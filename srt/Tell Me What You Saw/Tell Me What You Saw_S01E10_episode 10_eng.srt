1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,350

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,710

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,230

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,010

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,330

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,630

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,980

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,150

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,880

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,520

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:01:01,240

12
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,950
I don't know anything about 4789.

13
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,710
But there is Chilseong Labor that's a smuggling factory.

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,600
Hey.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,320
The president there, Jo Chil Seong, has all the inside information on Haewol-dong.

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,310
He is crazy, so you need to be very careful.

17
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,740
Who's Jo Chil Seong?

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,780
Hey, that's not a name for you to utter with your mouth.

19
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,460
You're Jo Chil Seong?

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,010
Hey, leave, punk. Leave.

21
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,930
Hey.

22
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,950
Who's the punk acting up and looking for me?!

23
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,460
You're Jo Chil Seong?

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,510
Oh, it's the person who made crap out of all the factions in Haewol-dong.

25
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,880
Detective Oh Hyeong Jae.

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,310
Jo Chil Seong, what's 4789?

27
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,210
Oh, do you want to die that badly?

28
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,870
4789? What is that bullshit?

29
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,930
Hey, give him a nice massage and send him off.

30
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,030
What is 4789?

31
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,050
I don't know.

32
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,110
 Oh, do you want to die that badly?

33
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,140
Who parked like that?

34
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,760
Seriously. Who is this bastard?

35
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,490
Hey, Ahjussi! Ahjussi! Open the window!

36
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,850
Hey!

37
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,810
What is 4789?

38
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,220
What? 4789?

39
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,790
Detective, I really don't know.

40
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,950
I remember! Tae Sik Hyung-nim was on the phone,

41
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,880
and he was mentioning 4789 or whatever

42
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,370
and ran off after getting upset.

43
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,080
But what are those numbers?

44
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,470
Where did Tae Sik go?

45
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,510
How am I supposed to know that?

46
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,330
- Look here. 
 - Yes?

47
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,900
Find out what 4789 means. Got it?

48
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,440
I understand. But it will take some time.

49
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,690

50
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,060
We're from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

51
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,880
We got the call. The site's over there.

52
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,630
The person who first reported it is a middle-aged woman who was taking a walk in the morning,

53
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,500
and the dog, that she was walking with, found him first.

54
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,120
It's a remote area, so there are no witnesses.

55
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,810
He's still so young...

56
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,670
But... there's no blood around him.

57
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,940
It seems that the initial crime happened elsewhere, right?

58
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,800
He was dragged from over there to here.

59
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,400
Detective Yang.

60
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,250
Do you see that by his neck?

61
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,560
It's a small gash. Two side by side.

62
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,260
I don't think it's a direct cause of death.

63
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,700
Why did he have to be discovered here of all places?

64
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,740
Why?

65
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,110
It's right on the border of two towns where jurisdiction overlaps.

66
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,920
On the outside, each precinct insists on taking on the case,

67
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,530
but internally, it can easily become an unsolved case,

68
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,540
so it ends up coming to the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

69
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,000
We have to catch the culprit so it won't end up unsolved.

70
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,130
Excuse me, where's the forensic team?

71
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,450
They're on their way.

72
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,430

73
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,070
Have you identified the victim?

74
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,630
His name is Shin Joo Yeong, 27 years old.

75
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,950
He has no family.

76
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,440
 Hello.

77
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,240
He's a part-time worker at a convenience store, and the store owner reported him missing three days ago.

78
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,110
He's never missed a day of work in the year he's worked there.

79
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,430
He wouldn't pick up the owner's calls, so the owner went to his home.

80
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,650
He thought something was wrong, so he called in a report.

81
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,940
The direct cause of murder seems to be from a dent in the cranium from being struck in the head with a blunt weapon.

82
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,560
A unique thing is that there were two small gashes alongside each other by the neck.

83
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,100
- What about the autopsy results? 
 - Maybe by tomorrow?

84
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,580
Detective Yang, what do you think?

85
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,010
By looking at the method of murder and abandonment,

86
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,640
we can't exclude revenge murder.

87
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,510
What about the CCTVs around the vicinity where he was abandoned?

88
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,430
There was only one suspicious car around midnight which is the estimated time of the body disposal.

89
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,220
Here, this black car.

90
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,400
The thing that stands out is that the logo is unusual.

91
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,220
The license plate was 61 S0611, a fake plate.

92
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,840
There are no other CCTVs?

93
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,780
We checked all the nearby roads' and stores' CCTVs,

94
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,230
but it's difficult to pinpoint the travel route because of the low resolution.

95
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,180
What do you mean Oh Hyeon Jae cut off all contact?

96
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,160
I think something came up. He'll call in soon.

97
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,740
Something came up? For three days?

98
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,110
He just came back to work.

99
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,990
Is this a place where he can come and go as he pleases?

100
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,020
I'll report to you separately.

101
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,240
Tell him I won't wait long.

102
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,120

103
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,890
Did you find something?

104
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,610
I found a few similar cases while investigating.

105
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,670
What are they?

106
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,100
If you look here, I've grouped cases together with the keyword that relates to the black vehicle,

107
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,370
and within that, I've grouped them by the common feature

108
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,010
of how the body was wrapped as well as the gashes.

109
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,020
What was he stabbed with?

110
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,090
A screwdriver? It doesn't seem like it.

111
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,180
This... There's a survivor.

112
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,290
Have you looked into 4789?

113
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,940
I've obtained all the data related to Ha Tae Sik,

114
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,690
and I've double checked all data within it that might have something to do with 4789.

115
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,210
But I haven't found anything.

116
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,310
Ji Min.

117
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,260
If it had been something I could find out using the field manual,

118
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,400
why would I have asked you to do it?

119
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,530
Your best asset.

120
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:41,300
You need to show me the disposition of someone who's climbed up inch by inch from the very bottom.

121
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,630
These are the things that we need to do in order to protect the organization.

122
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,200
If it helps the organization,

123
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,140
we have to do it even if we have to roll around in the mud or bleed.

124
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,960
Director.

125
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,870
I don't want to work for the sake of the organization.

126
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,950
Until now, I did my job as a detective, and I want to continue being a detective.

127
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,990
- I will, in my own way— 
 - What I told you to do wasn't a detective's job?

128
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,100
This bastard. You have a long way to go until you can be a detective down to your core.

129
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,070
You being in the organization is the reason you're being treated like a human being!

130
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,340
If you want to maintain your little position,

131
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,910
use your head to think about whom you need to be loyal to!

132
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:30,020
4789. Bring it to me even if you have to make up something.

133
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,700
Yes.

134
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,420
Yeah.

135
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,140
Did you call for me?

136
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,870
Can you contact Detective Oh?

137
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,950
No, he's not picking up.

138
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,250
We need his profiling for the Shin Joo Yeong case.

139
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,200
I'll organize the files and leave them at his hideout, then.

140
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,080
You do that.

141
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,810
It's Cha Soo Yeong.

142
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,080
It's Cha Soo Yeong.

143
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,840
You didn't come to work, so I came here.

144
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,880
I'm going to give you the briefing, whether you're listening or not.

145
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,290
The victim is Shin Joo Yeong, 27 years old.

146
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,600
- He was a young man who worked at a convenience store, 
  - Hello.

147
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,980
but he was murdered and was found wrapped in a vinyl bag.

148
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,070
Even though the young man disappeared like this,

149
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,410
he has no family or friends to cry over him.

150
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,360
We need your profiling to catch the culprit.

151
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,950
I'll leave the case files here.

152
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,570
Also, I'll keep the receiver on.

153
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,980

154
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,520
There was a survivor two years ago who was able to run away

155
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,110
after being kidnapped by a black vehicle,

156
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,140
so I called the detective who was in charge of that case.

157
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,580
Her name is Lee Yoon Jeong.

158
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,240
She was 27 years old at the time of the crime.

159
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,320
She just barely managed to escape death,

160
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,010
but she doesn't remember the kidnapper or the location of the kidnapping because of trauma.

161
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,350
She would totally hate it if the police came looking for her.

162
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,020
She probably doesn't even want to remember it.

163
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,740
Right.

164
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,730

165
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,570

166
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,740
Should I try meeting her once?

167
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,320
 After looking her up, she seems to have changed her name to Lee Yoo Mi.

168
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,550
 She works part-time at a cafe right now.

169
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:21,000
Detective Oh, I'm here to meet the survivor, Lee Yoo Mi.

170
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,390
I'll do my best.

171
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,760
Enjoy!

172
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,330
Hello.

173
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,750
Um...

174
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,050
I'd like one latte, please.

175
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,960
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

176
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,160
I'm sorry but the latte art didn't come out well.

177
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,540
Do you want me to make it again?

178
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,120
No, it's fine. I'll just take it.

179
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,270
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,300
Lee Yoo Mi seems to be suffering from trauma.

181
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,990
Would it be okay to ask her?

182
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,180
Is there anything else you need?

183
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,600
I'm Detective Cha Soo Yeong from the Mucheon Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

184
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,750
Right now, there is a case that is very similar to the incident

185
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,810
you went through two years ago.

186
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,160
We need your help to catch the culprit.

187
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,210
Detective,

188
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,080
I have nothing to say.

189
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,130
I don't want to think about that case, not that I even can.

190
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,430
I just want to live as if it never happened.

191
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,610
Please don't come for me anymore.

192
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,950
I have nothing to say.

193
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:51,470
Um, could you flip over my identification card?

194
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,500
She's my mother.

195
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,630
I heard your mother passed away.

196
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,010
My mom also died when I was young.

197
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,440
I didn't have a lot of friends, and I was an only child.

198
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,940
It was so lonely,

199
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,980
and every time I wanted to give up,

200
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,320
 I thought this:  If my mom saw me right now,

201
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,750
what would she say?

202
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,810
I should bravely endure so that if I meet her later,

203
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:41,620
I can at least say that I did my very best and didn't give up until the end.

204
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:50,210
Your mother is probably watching over you, too.

205
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,780
So please, do not give up on yourself.

206
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,090
You did nothing wrong, so why do you have to hide?

207
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,250
You have to stay strong, don't you think?

208
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,920
Will I get better

209
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,700
 if the culprit is caught?

210
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,180

211
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,220

212
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,930
Detective Oh.

213
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,180
Put Lee Yoo Mi on the phone.

214
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,750
Detective Oh!

215
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,960
I'm Oh Hyeon Jae with whom you spoke on the phone.

216
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,930
Lee Yoo Mi, you can freely speak about how you felt that night.

217
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,100
I was putting stuff in my trunk, and I was just about to close it.

218
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,570
That was when someone grabbed me from behind.

219
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,980
I was in a basement-kind of place.

220
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,590
My eyes were covered, so I couldn't see anything.

221
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:41,130
Did you hear or smell anything?

222
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,970
 Please spare me! Please!

223
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,520
I did hear something.

224
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,720
It was faint.

225
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,440
You heard something strange.

226
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,270

227
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,630
 He seemed to go somewhere.

228
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,650
 After that, I ran away.

229
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,430
I don't remember any more.

230
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,010
I get so scared every time I remember that night.

231
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,620
How would the dead victims have felt?

232
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,380
Lee Yoo Mi, we will find the culprit.

233
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,930
We will make sure nothing like this happens ever again.

234
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,960

Park Soon Mi, Jo Joon Seok, Jang Soo Jin, Shin Joon Yeong.

235
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,460
These are all of the unusual death cases that occurred in Mucheon in the last five years.

236
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,970
A black car that was spotted near the location where the bodies were abandoned,

237
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,160
bodies wrapped in vinyl, and a gash at the neck.

238
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,790
Other than these three common factors,

239
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,870
the victims' genders, locations of kidnapping, locations of abandoned bodies, nothing else is common.

240
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,450
Where do we catch him? This is driving me crazy.

241
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,460
Listen up. The commonality among all of the victims

242
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,470
is that they were young adults just barely starting their lives in society, living alone, and looking for a job.

243
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,700
The culprit picked the victims out of these three categories.

244
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,860
That means he was close enough to know the victims' personal information.

245
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,690
Why them in particular?

246
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,490
They were reported missing after the estimated date of their deaths.

247
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:04,960
In other words, all the victims were at a place where no one would know if something happened to them.

248
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,450
And that is what the culprit was after.

249
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,830
So it's a serial murder.

250
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,040
All of the victims have a commonality that they were looking for employment,

251
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,430
so look into the companies they applied to, their social media, card transactions, call logs, everything.

252
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,370
- Yes, ma'am. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

253
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,390
It's from the Touraine region.

254
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,110
That's right, you like the ones from there.

255
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,420
I don't like sweet ones, but this is okay.

256
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,460
It's sophisticated.

257
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,420
Min Hyeong Joo?

258
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,010
Leave the plan there.

259
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,980
Come on, Director Won Se Yoon. You're going to work here, too?

260
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,920
Hey, still. We're classmates.

261
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,090
Asking Min Hyeong Joo to run your document errands is a bit much.

262
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,530
I wouldn't do this if I wasn't so busy.

263
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,460
Director, let me try that.

264
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,010
Seriously, you're still as bad as ever.

265
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,070
I'm sorry.

266
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,530
Why can't you do it? I taught you before.

267
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,590
Hey, Won Se Yoon, that's enough.

268
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,340
You think so?

269
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,740
Then, Director, I think I should leave.

270
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,420
Go.

271
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,590
Min Hyeong Joo isn't someone who can hang out with us.

272
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,920
He was a loser since high school.

273
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,850
How did he get into Wonseo Group?

274
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,290
I was shocked when I saw him at the new employee training.

275
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,570
He was hanging on me like crazy since we were classmates. I was dying!

276
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,120
There are three things in the world you can't hide.

277
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,050
Sneeze, cheating, and poverty.

278
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,340
- Min Hyeong Joo has one more. Being a loser.
 - Right.

279
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,480
No matter where he goes, he's Min Hyeong Joo.

280
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,510
I'm going to trample on that bastard very soon.

281
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,430
Why are there so many loose ends I have to tie up before my wedding?

282
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,660

283
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,210

284
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,970
Bingo.

285
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,420

286
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,460

287
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,940

288
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,960

289
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,870
The common thread among the suspects is that they all interviewed at

290
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,580
subsidiaries of Wonseo Group and were killed a week to 10 days later.

291
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,650
- That's right. 
 - Who was the interviewer?

292
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,000
I've checked with all the fellow applicants from that time,

293
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,640
and they said Director Won Se Yoon was always present.

294
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,500
Won Se Yoon, 37 years old.

295
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,970
He is unmarried and is the director of Wonseo Group.

296
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,490
He was hired as an ordinary employee, but after being acknowledged for his skills,

297
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,430
he's considered to be the next most likely successor.

298
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,120
It would be difficult to summon him for testimony.

299
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,330
If it's hard, we'll have to go see him ourselves.

300
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,520
I'll go.

301
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,370
Detective Cha, come with me.

302
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,380
We're from the Mucheon Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

303
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,870
Could we meet with Director Won Se Yoon?

304
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,750
What brings you here?

305
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,300
Oh.

306
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,080
Oops.

307
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,670
We're from the Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency's Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

308
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,260
Could we speak to Director Won Se Yoon?

309
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,780
What is this about?

310
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,510
We'll tell him in person.

311
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,500
No, no...

312
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,070
I'll tell him first. Just a second.

313
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay, come in.

314
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,570
I'm Detective Cha Soo Yeong from Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency's Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

315
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,480
Have a seat.

316
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,290
What did you come here for?

317
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,350
We had a few questions while investigating a case.

318
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,900
What case?

319
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,770
All the victims who were discovered as dead bodies recently

320
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,760
have all interviewed for this company.

321
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,420
What does that have to do with me?

322
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,880
It's because each of the victims have met you once.

323
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,070
Ah, really?

324
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,030
So?

325
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:35,280
It's just a formal procedure, so don't worry too much.

326
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,510
But Director...

327
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,000
You must really like wine.

328
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,330
You must know about wine then?

329
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,870
I purchased a winery recently.

330
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,040
I have a habit of seeing things through to the end.

331
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,630
I've heard that people who like wine

332
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,000
remember the taste of wine they've only had once. Is that true?

333
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,720
Well, it's a feeling.

334
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:09,060
The taste, smell, and ambiance.

335
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,330
You use your five senses to remember it.

336
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,260
Detective Cha.

337
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,400
Do you remember any of these people?

338
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,420
There're no way.

339
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,860
I think you should leave now.

340
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,470
I have interviews scheduled for this afternoon.

341
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,710
Is that so? I understand.

342
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,510
Let's go.

343
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,800
You stupid bastard. You can't even handle this type of stuff?!

344
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,660
I had to sit here, and all you did was watch!

345
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,840
Hey. Hey, get lost.

346
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,460
Get out, you bastard!

347
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,020
I'm sorry. Director, I'm sorry.

348
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,850
Get out. Get out!

349
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,520
He's not happy unless he does whatever he wants.

350
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,690
A narcissist, a show off. He's full of superiority.

351
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:44,070
How could he be so unaffected after hearing people have died?

352
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,530
If he's a sociopath,

353
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,720
I guess he could be expressionless.

354
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,430
Han Seul Gi, Moon Hye Seon, and Kim Yeong Ho.

355
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,590
Okay. You can go inside.

356
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,900

357
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,470
- Last candidate, Lee Yoo Mi. 
 - Yes.

358
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,460
Come inside.

359
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,160
Nice to meet you.

360
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,950
There's a gap in your resume of two years.

361
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,550
What were you doing?

362
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,070
I did part-time work while applying for jobs.

363
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,260
 Please spare me!

364
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,090
Miss Lee Yoo Mi.

365
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,800
Miss Yoo Mi.

366
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,170
- Miss Yoo Mi. 
 - Yes?

367
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,770
Are you okay?

368
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,360
Haven't we... met somewhere before?

369
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,220
No.

370
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,270
Oh really?

371
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,450
Okay.

372
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,530

373
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,090
What did you do about the police that came by earlier?

374
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,070
Oh, I notified the legal team,

375
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,110
so they won't come around anymore.

376
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,970
The interviewee earlier... Lee Yoo Mi, was it?

377
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,080
Has she interviewed with us before?

378
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,340
Well, I'll look into it.

379
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,130
No. Don't worry about it.

380
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,010
Hyeong Joo. 
  (informal)

381
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,940
Yeah? 
  (informal)

382
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,650
You should be answering as Min Hyeong Joo. 
  (formal)

383
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,440
 (Implies they do not have a relationship where they can speak informally to each other)

384
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,870
You can go home now.

385
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,900
It was that sound... The sound from two years ago.

386
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,600

387
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,500
Hello?

388
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,590

389
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,870
 The call could not be connected and will be forwarded to—

390
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,210
Team Leader! I got a call from the survivor, Lee Yoo Mi, but it got cut off immediately!

391
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,520
Did you try calling her again?

392
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,500
I did but I couldn't reach her.

393
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,460
Come out.

394
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:15,870
Team Leader, Lee Yoo Mi's last location is Wonseo Group.

395
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,420
Okay, got it.

396
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,830
Won Se Yoon just left work.

397
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,540
This bastard kidnapped her.

398
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,790
Detective Yang, go to Wonseo Group with Detective Jang and look for Lee Yoo Mi.

399
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,890
Also, check for Won Se Yoon.

400
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,520
- Detective Lee, locate Won Se Yoon's car. 
 - Okay.

401
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,810
Cha Soo Yeong, was there anything weird at the scene?

402
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,140
Anything that might be special. Picture it.

403
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,720
There was just common trash.

404
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,230
Plastic bags, soda cans, cork stopper, Styrofoam—

405
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,320
Wait. Cork stopper?

406
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,950
There was a cork stopper?

407
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,040
Cork stopper...

408
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,090
There was a mark on it.

409
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,010
Hold on.

410
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,920

411
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,050
I think it's the same winery logo as the one in Director Won Se Yoon's office.

412
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,950
That's right, it was the exact same.

413
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,330
There was a wine opener on his desk,

414
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,300
an ah-so knife which people don't use as much.

415
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,850
I think he used that to make those gashes on the victims' bodies.

416
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,570
He used his position as the personnel team director to find his victims.

417
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,260
And he kidnapped Yoo Mi because his crimes might get found out.

418
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,300
Team Leader, I found a car registered to Won Se Yoon.

419
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,660
- It's on Highway 13. 
 - Report to me with real-time statuses.

420
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,450
- Okay. 
 - Come with me.

421
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,360
  Team Leader, Wonseo Group's training center is near Highway 13.

422
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,500
 I think Won Se Yoon is headed that way.

423
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,190

I looked for Lee Yoo Mi everywhere with assistance from the staff

424
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,820
 but she's not here.

425
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,160
They're telling me they can't get in touch with Director Won Se Yoon.

426
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,380
Is Won Se Yoon taking Lee Yoo Mi to the training center after kidnapping her?

427
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,110
He's intelligent and cunning.

428
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,610
He knows the police has him on their radar,

429
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,280
but he's doing something suspicious?

430
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,070
When we were at his office,

431
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,870
on Min Hyeong Joo's desk was the same ah-so knife,

432
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,110
wine remover, and similar books.

433
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,550
Recall the differences.

434
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,050
On Min Hyeong Joo's desk was some office stationery.

435
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,380
Also there was a retainer case.

436
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,830
Retainer case?

437
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,620
 I did hear something.

438
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,690
 It was faint.

439
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,740
The culprit is Min Hyeong Joo.

440
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,380
The reason?

441
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,920
Min Hyeong Joo probably feels anger towards Won Se Yoon.

442
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,210
But at the same time, he also idolized him

443
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,990
because Won Se Yoon has everything he can't have.

444
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,820
He would have taken out his anger on those weaker than him

445
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,310
and left traces of Won Se Yoon at the crime scene just as a caution.

446
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,790

447
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:46,340
But the strange sound that Lee Yoo Mi heard was Min Hyeong Joo's.

448
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,410
The sound that the retainers made when they hit each other.

449
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,460
He copied everything,

450
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,590
but that particular sound was Min Hyeong Joo's alone.

451
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,800

452
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,300

453
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,210

454
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,490
Hey! What are you doing right now?!

455
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,520
What are you up to?

456
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,310
What is this?

457
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:33,320
How dare you do a background check on me?!

458
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,810
Come here.

459
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,770
Have you gone mad?

460
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,610
Hey, this? This is nothing.

461
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,190
Rushing over here because of something as trivial as this...

462
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:55,870
What could be waiting for you who came because I told you to, huh?

463
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,880
You crazy bastard!

464
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,370
Se Yoon.

465
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:16,820
You're going to die here today, you bastard.

466
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,890
Hyeong Joo. Hyeong Joo, my friend.

467
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,540
Hyeong Joo, I'm sorry.

468
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,960
Stop! Stop! Stop!

469
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,970
Oh, you can't get a mark on your face, no.

470
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,570
Since you're going to kill yourself tonight by

471
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:58,670
drinking your favorite wine with potassium cyanide poured in it.

472
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,560
Hyeong Joo.

473
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,370
Just wait.

474
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,770
Hyeong Joo.

475
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,010
Hyeong Joo, please...

476
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,890
Drink up.

477
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,660
Come on.

478
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,780
Let- let me live, Hyeong Joo.

479
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,830
Here.

480
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,070
Wait! I don't this is the right building.

481
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,800
What do you mean? We don't have much time.

482
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,410
On Min Hyeong Joo's desk,

483
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:02,080
there was a picture taken in front of Haemaru building at the training center.

484
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,130
And Min Hyeong Joo had the key to that place.

485
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,900

486
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,960
Over there.

487
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,700

488
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,500
I do have another present.

489
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,420
You're now going to become a murderer.

490
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:45,530
You have been killing people and now that the police is on your tail, you commit suicide.

491
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,960
How is that?

492
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,870
I was hoping you'd like it.

493
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,950
And next is...

494
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,850
Where did she go?

495
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,670
She's gone!

496
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,950
Because of you bastard! She's gone!

497
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,420
See? She's disappeared!

498
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,200
You stay right there without running away, okay?

499
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,150
Excuse me!

500
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,390
It's Won Se Yoon.

501
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,940
He's already dead.

502
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,200
Send paramedics to the basement.

503
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,730
He was here until a moment ago.

504
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,190
Wait here until the paramedics get here.

505
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,100
I'll look for him and call you.

506
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,210
- Detective Cha, you go that way. 
 - Okay.

507
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,680
This is too difficult.

508
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,780
I haven't the slightest idea where she is.

509
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,170
Where are you?

510
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,880
I guess she's not here.

511
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,570
I don't think she's here!

512
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,050
Se Yoon!

513
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,420
Damn it!

514
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,870
Why me? Why me?

515
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,690
What did I do wrong?

516
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,350
You have nothing, not even family!

517
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:39,420
That! That is a sin.

518
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,320
Min Hyeong Joo, stop now.

519
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,900
It's all over now.

520
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,730
Does it hurt?

521
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,380
Are you scared?

522
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,820
People must have been scared like you are now.

523
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,160
Isn't that so?

524
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,370
Why?

525
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:51,310
Do you want to live?

526
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,350
Yes.

527
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,280
Damn it!

528
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,600
Go on.

529
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,150
Go.

530
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,110
Min Hyeong Joo, you're under arrest on charges of murder and disposal of bodies.

531
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,570
Yoo Mi.

532
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:41,260
Yoo Mi, are you okay?

533
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:44,520
I'm so sorry.

534
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,690
Live out the rest of your life in prison while apologizing to all the innocent victims you killed.

535
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,990
 Are you okay?

536
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,220
We found the black vehicle that was used for the crimes behind the training center.

537
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,580
Get in there, you bastard.

538
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:39,030
- Team Leader. 
 - Yes?

539
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,800
When was the last time you got any sleep?

540
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,620
I'll clean up here, so hurry up and go get some rest.

541
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,810
No, I'm fine.

542
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,840
Just a moment.

543
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,540
Thank you so much.

544
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,890
I lived because of this.

545
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,160
 Yoo Mi.

546
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,950
 It's a GPS.

547
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:22,240
  Don't worry. I'll come and save you.

548
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,730

549
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,970
Thank you so much.

550
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,790
Here.

551
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,830
Yoo Mi. If you hadn't been so brave,

552
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:19,790
we wouldn't have been able to catch the culprit tonight.

553
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,550
You played a huge part.

554
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,940
Thank you so much.

555
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,130
Ah, may I ask you something?

556
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,020
That day, when I came to see you at the cafe,

557
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:41,190
what did Detective Oh say on the phone to change your mind?

558
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,660
Oh, that?

559
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:52,450
  I ended up losing myself after losing someone.

560
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:57,080
  I pretend to be okay in front of others,

561
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,590
  but in reality, I'm not okay.

562
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,340
 I've become familiar with the pain,

563
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:07,160
  so I miserably deal with it every day, that's all.

564
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,820
  You must feel the same as I do.

565
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:16,680
  Then you have two choices.

566
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:23,300
  Either deal with that pain every day miserably,

567
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:31,370
  or... do whatever you can to find yourself.

568
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:15,180
♫  Conceal your sins won't lead you away now  ♫

569
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:21,040
♫  It's impossible to contain in my two hands  ♫

570
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,210
The reason that Min Hyeong Joo is so cowardly is because

571
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,950
he only picked on the weak who had no family

572
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,870
to carry out his crime.

573
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:36,790
♫  The memories which you have lost  ♫

574
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,900
♫  In an instant I recall you as if you were a picture  ♫

575
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,400
Why do we always arrive a step too late

576
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,790
and end up having to see the victims' bodies?

577
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,110
♫  Will be wandering again  ♫

578
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,900
I want people like Min Hyeong Joo to receive divine retribution.

579
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,170
Look here, Cha Soo Yeong.

580
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,750
Listen carefully.

581
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:04,680
♫  Confess your sins with blinks  ♫

582
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,970
There is no such thing as divine retribution in this world.

583
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,330
There's only the law that people have created.

584
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:15,710
The kind that catches criminals by chasing them until the end.

585
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:20,600
♫  As though putting together fragmented traces  ♫

586
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:30,580
♫  Before I realized it, you were beyond my sight  ♫

587
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:34,440
I just hope that what we do

588
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,180
comforts those victims who have passed away, even just a little.

589
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,630
♫  Who wandered alone searching for you  ♫

590
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:45,800
I think it's a good thing that I became a police officer.

591
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,870
I think so too.

592
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:52,030
Pardon?

593
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,250
It's good that you became a police officer, Cha Soo Yeong.

594
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,910
 Save me!

595
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:21,110
 Save me!

596
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,300

597
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,740
Have you found out what 4789 is?

598
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,040
Not yet.

599
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,660
I'm curious about what that is.

600
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,750
I'll let you know when I'm sure.

601
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,710
How's Director Choi?

602
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,460
Surprisingly, he's been quiet.

603
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,440
He's been quiet?

604
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,480
Why were you so aggressive with this case?

605
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,810
It's not like you.

606
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,010
I remembered something someone told me.

607
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:01,920
What is that?

608
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,590
That it could be someone's family member.

609
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,110

610
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,160
 I don't want to work for the sake of the organization.

611
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,370
 Until now, I did my job as a detective, and I want to continue being a detective.

612
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:27,080
 - I will, in my own way— 
 - What I told you to do wasn't a detective's job?

613
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:49,610

Ji Min, get rid of the list for Joonggeon three-way intersection.

614
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,900
 The last entry for the evidence.

615
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,880
 Why do you need to delete just that?

616
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,320
  Just take care of it and keep your mouth shut.

617
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,470

618
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:10,120

619
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,180

620
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,710

621
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,680

622
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,760

623
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:13,900

624
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,850
Hurry! Hurry! It's this way.

625
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:18,280
It's over here. Hurry.

626
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,160
Over here! Hurry!

627
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,930
It's over here, here!

628
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,930
This is Kang Dong Sik of Hongwoon Police Station at the site.

629
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:35,460
On a hill in the vicinity of Mount 22,

630
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,860
we found a dead body hanging by the neck on a tree.

631
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,020

632
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,140
Come in.

633
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,090
What is it?

634
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:55,960
I came to know about the original evidence list of the

635
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,980
2015 Joonggeon three-way intersection case by chance.

636
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:03,140
The last evidence was erased from the list.

637
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,490
"Why was it deleted?"

638
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:09,620
"Could it have been the one crucial piece of evidence to find that punk's identity?"

639
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:15,620
"If not, did someone erase it in order to monopolize that evidence?"

640
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,120
Those are the thoughts that went through my mind.

641
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,540
You have quite the imagination.

642
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,270
You were in charge of the whole operation at the time,

643
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,980
so I think there's a high probability of you having that evidence.

644
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,780
What is it that you want?

645
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,850
I would like to make an offer.

646
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,030
An offer?

647
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:43,150
4789.

648
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,620
You're curious about it.

649
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,740
I'll give you all the information I have.

650
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,240
Why don't you share your information with me?

651
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:02,930
 Detective Oh, I really don't know what 4789 is.

652
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:09,170
  But Hyung-nim Ha Tae Sik  used to visit a strange hospital from time to time.

653
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,170
What brings you here?

654
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,240
I'm visiting someone.

655
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,590
What's the room number?

656
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:26,250
4789.

657
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,780
Only the guardian is allowed to visit the special suite.

658
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:39,490

659
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:42,620
It must be a room that commemorates the founder.

660
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,190
Yes.

661
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,230
Hold on.

662
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,350
Hello?

663
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:52,360
Ah, yes.

664
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,390

665
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,300

666
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,180

667
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:03,170
  It's mine! Let go!

668
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,200
  Hey, it's mine!

669
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:35,870
  Let go!

670
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,200
  It's mine!

671
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,490

672
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,180
I found 4789.

673
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,570
It's a special suite at Yooseong Mental Hospital.

674
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:36,160

675
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,430
Eom Soo Tak?

676
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,200
Yes, Doctor.

677
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:56,320
Is it time to take my medicine?

678
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,890
Who are you? Who are you?

679
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,780
You're not that bastard.

680
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,960
Who sent you?

681
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,790
Ha Tae Sik.

682
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,210
Ha Tae Sik.

683
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,690
Ha Tae Sik?

684
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:44,200

685
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,480

686
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,300
  Could I see the files from my mom's case 20 years ago again?

687
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,730
  Hey, are you at this again?

688
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:00,790
  Chim Sa Bong?

689
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:03,410
 That person could know the whereabouts of that unregistered vehicle.

690
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,950
 Whom can I ask?

691
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:07,680
  What can I do for you, Detective?

692
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,910
 4789... 4789.

693
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:12,290
  I'm sure it's somewhere nearby.

694
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:13,610
  Hurry up and find him!

695
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,080
 It was a golden opportunity to catch that bastard.

696
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,390
 They've lost him.

697
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:19,340
 I'm sure he has another plan.

698
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:22,020
  A secret and familiar place...

699
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,600
 That bastard is coming.
