1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,300

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,620

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,140

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,650

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,290

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,020

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,000

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:36,380

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,530
 So we have a dismembered body in a suitcase,

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,670
 and we found a mint.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,160
 And that bastard who caused a commotion a few years ago did the same thing, right?

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,290
 Isu!

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,450
 Excuse me, is that bastard alive?

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,630
 It makes no sense at all.

15
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,120
 The real culprit died in an explosion incident five years ago.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,600
 Is your memory always this good or is it that you are great at observing?

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,260
 I can remember everything of a certain moment as though it stops with a click.

18
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,860
 A click? Is it something like a photographic memory?

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,590
 Yes.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,650
 The person I met really was Oh Hyeon Jae.

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,280
 I told you. I'm that bastard.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,600
 The mint serial killer.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,410
 You're just a copycat. That bastard died.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,210
 Please let me work at the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

25
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,530
 I am sure there will be times when I can be of help to you, Detective.

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,210
 Save me!

27
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,630
 Team Leader, could it be that bastard?

28
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,580
 The mint is a message.

29
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,380
 A message sent to someone.

30
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,690
 Moong Chi.

31
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,130
 But it looks like Moong Chi is sick.

32
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,160
 Wait a minute. There is a man.

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,840
 He was holding a black umbrella.

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,860
 But I saw this umbrella at the Go Min Ji's crime scene.

35
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,600
 How is he connected to Kang Seung Hwan?

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,630
 The dog leash Kang Seung Hwan was holding at the scene

37
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,530
 and the collar of the dog that the man was holding seem to be a set.

38
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,970
 He is the accomplice.

39
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,560
 Team Leader, we identified the suspect.

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,600
 His name is Jeong Chan Goo, 43 years old.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,800
 As you mentioned, he is a veterinarian.

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,150
 Why are you doing this to me?

43
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,320
 When I'm like this, I feel better if I see blood.

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,760
 Search thoroughly for animal hospitals nearby.

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,590
 I think he may still run an animal hospital near here.

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,750
 Team Leader!

47
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,580
 Hey, Jeong Chan Goo!  Stop the car!

48
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,940
 Stop, you asshole!

49
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,950
 He is heading to the port.

50
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,920
 Hurry. Catch him first.

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,750
 Hey!

52
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,010
 Why did you follow me without any fear?

53
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,260
 Someone else definitely must've been in the freezer storage.

54
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,520
 That guy knew that Jeong Chan Goo would go there.

55
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,990
 That's why you should have reported it to me!

56
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,230
 You think you're the only detectives?

57
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,030
 You came here to work together, Chief?

58
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,180
 It's fine that you have your personal grudge or ambition,

59
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,820
 but let's think of the organization first.

60
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,050
 It'll be revealed later what is good for the organization.

61
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,790
 There was no mint.

62
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,490
 Someone took it.

63
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,620
 On the day of the incident, Chief Choi went into the autopsy room.

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,630
 You're officially a part of the team starting now.

65
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,720
 Are you going to keep your promise?

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,110
 You'd bet your life that the bastard isn't alive.

67
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,280
 That promise.

68
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,840
 Chief Choi Hyeong Pil, it's Na Joon Seok.

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,300
 Just in case for safety, I'd like to request some protection.

70
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,580
 The next target is Na Joon Seok.

71
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,000
 This time, it'll be a very public murder in front of many people

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,010
 so that everyone can see his resurrection.

73
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,480

74
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,820

75
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,900
 In a moment, bus number 60 and 34 will arrive.

76
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,910

77
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:55,200

78
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,370

79
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,660
You must be really busy these days.

80
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,570
These days, everyone uses credit cards at mom-and-pop stores.

81
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,320
I'm grateful that you regularly use cash here.

82
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,460
By the way, is there someone at home?

83
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,280
Why?

84
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,920
I mean, when I was passing by your place, I heard TV sounds.

85
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,740
Did you leave the TV on when you left your house?

86
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,720
But I feel like your face has changed a little.

87
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,120
You give off a different impression.

88
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,120
Oh, it's cold.

89
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,060
- Ma'am! 
 - Welcome.

90
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,190
- Hello! 
 - Yes, it's been a while.

91
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,040

92
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,060
We'll be back on again.  Everybody, stand by while clapping.

93
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,050
Three, two, one.

94
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,790
On now!

95
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,160
Professor, is a psychopath born that way or does he become that way?

96
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,870
Well, a psychopath—

97
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,070
Stop them!

98
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,340
Block the entrance!

99
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,080
Don't move! Stay put!

100
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,290
Don't let even one person get out!

101
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,370
- This is the police! 
- You can't. Please, you can't get leave!

102
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,270
Please sit still!

103
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,900
Please calm down!

104
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,370
You can't leave.

105
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,230
Ma'am, no! You can't leave.

106
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,650
Someone was watching us.

107
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,560
Why are you blocking the exit?

108
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,420
I lost him.

109
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,260
It's that bastard.

110
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,190
That bastard finally showed up.

111
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,770

112
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,930

113
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,230
What happened?

114
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,110
It looks to be the same criminal who killed Kang Seung Hwan and Jeong Chan Goo.

115
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,750
On what basis are you saying that?

116
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,780
A mint was found.

117
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,870
Jeong Chan Goo's case has nothing to do with a mint.

118
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,120
Are you certain?

119
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,870
What do you mean?  Are you trying to say someone took the mint or something?

120
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,840
No.

121
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,950
How did you know Professor Na would be a target?

122
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,800
There was circumstantial evidence, and we were investigating with that in mind.

123
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,520
No matter how much you had wanted to catch the culprit,

124
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,500
you should've followed the reporting lines and protocol!

125
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,170
Is the organization such a joke to you?

126
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,890
I've never thought that way.

127
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,640
Let's be honest between professionals.

128
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,260
Who is the informant?

129
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,830
There must've been someone who gave you information, right?

130
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,010
Yes.  It's me.

131
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,580
I got it.

132
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,900
Put out an alert and tell them to take all the videos down.

133
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,840
Why are you asking me that, you punk?

134
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,310
I don't care if it was broadcast live or not!

135
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,170
Just take them down no matter what!

136
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,040
 Here is the next news.

137
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,840
 Today at around 8:47 PM, in a live broadcast studio,

138
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,830
 the famous profiler, Professor Na Joon Seok was murdered.

139
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:21,780
 The scene of Professor Na's murder was broadcast live immediately without censorship

140
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,610
 and it drove the viewers into a state of shock.

141
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:10,760
 I need a detective who will observe accurately in my place and tell me exactly what she saw.

142
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,250
 A newbie will be better if possible.

143
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,910
 Let's be honest between professionals.

144
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,510
 Who is the informant?

145
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,120
 There must've been someone who gave you information, right?

146
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,790

147
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,350

148
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,320
What brings you here?

149
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,160
I came here to explain the on-scene situation.

150
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,880
- It's too late. 
 - Pardon?

151
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,640
You were with that bastard in the same space,

152
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,010
but you didn't see anything.

153
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,450
- Why? 
 - That was—

154
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,020
Did you let yourself release your nerves after you got into the Investigative Unit?

155
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,350
The on-scene situation was not good.

156
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,820
Look, there’s never a good on-scene situation for murder cases.

157
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,010
Do you know why I gave you an opportunity?

158
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,170
Because of your photographic memory.

159
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,580
Camera equipment has improved a lot these days.

160
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,730
There are many people who have better memory and ability than you.

161
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,750
Then why did you call me in the first place?

162
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,290
You had an ability that could see things as they were.

163
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:03,710
People usually see what they want to see or hear or what they experienced.

164
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:10,410
But if you miss what you're supposed to see when I need you,

165
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,350
I have no need for that ability.

166
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,670
You may leave now.

167
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,020
Hey.

168
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,970
You have to be careful because that bastard saw you.

169
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,800
Get in.

170
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,920
 Restaurant

171
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,350
What are you doing?  It's getting cold. Eat.

172
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,330
Why did I lose him?

173
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,310
That was not your fault.

174
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,480
Is it doable?

175
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,410
Right now, it’s still doable.

176
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,180
If it gets too hard, I'll let you know.

177
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,710
If you have questions, ask me.

178
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,620
Team Leader, you were at the explosion accident site 5 years ago, weren't you?

179
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,820
 Oh Hyeon Jae!  Get out of there quickly!

180
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,620
 Isu!  Isu!

181
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,110
 Isu!

182
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,820
 Oh Hyeon Jae!

183
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,520
Everything changed after that day.

184
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,520
Hyeon Jae and I as well.

185
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,520
I sometimes feel like I'm living in hell.

186
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,170
Where do you think that bastard is right now?

187
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,710
It could be one of the people here

188
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,580
or he could be watching us from someplace else.

189
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,040
 You're leaving without being able to see him again?

190
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,820
 Yeah.

191
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,730
 Does Hyeon Jae treat you well?

192
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,490
 You also know well that he doesn't talk much.

193
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,470
 Still... when he gets home, he listens only to my music.

194
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,790
 You look happy.

195
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,490
 When he listens to my music, he makes the happiest expression in  the world.

196
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,750
 That's how I know how much he thinks of me.

197
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,590
 Unni, my most precious unni gave me the best gift in the world.

198
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,180
 Thank you.

199
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,310
The music sounds good.

200
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,620
It’s a close friend of mine performing.

201
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,540
I see.  You have a talented friend.

202
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:52,010
She had many things, unlike me.

203
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,300
You should see her often.

204
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,270
It gets harder to do as you get older.

205
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,950
Even if I want to do so, I can't do it.

206
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,260

207
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,540
What happened?

208
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,360
There was nothing special.

209
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,370
The bastard, who died five years ago, has come back to life and is committing murder.

210
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,130
Isn’t it strange?

211
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,680
I’m not sure what you mean.

212
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,110
“Three people can create a tiger.”

213
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,950
It means that if three people lie in sync, they can make a non-existent tiger real.

214
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,010
Everyone’s talking about that damn bastard everywhere.

215
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,630
Do you believe it too?

216
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,350
No. I don't.

217
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,390
The police would suffer the most if that bastard comes back to life.

218
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,520
Then who would benefit the most?

219
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,920
Pardon?

220
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,410
Look into Team Leader Hwang.

221
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,210
It’s too strange for it to be a coincidence.

222
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,780
And monitor that person and report back, too.

223
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,910
That tall police officer from the rural branch who’s a newcomer.

224
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,320
Cha Soo Yeong. She’s a detective.

225
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,490
Someone is behind Team Leader Hwang. Find out.

226
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,040

227
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,150

228
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,790

229
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,640
Oh, Mom. Right now, I’m on my way...

230
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,240
Scared me.

231
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,830
Hello.

232
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,880
You shouldn’t stay out so late.

233
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,610
It’s a  very scary world.

234
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,510
You have no fear.

235
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,460
Yes. Work hard.

236
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:06,150
I’m certain that bastard was enjoying it.

237
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,620
While watching them from an isolated spot away from people,

238
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,250
would he have made any contact?

239
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,310
He perfectly calculated even the variables and carried it out.

240
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,410
We have to find a mistake from his movements.

241
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,140
  It’s Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong.

242
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,780
It’s me.

243
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,860
Go ahead.

244
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,390
There’s an order to clean the scene.

245
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,640
The most I can delay it is about an hour.

246
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,880
Find the person who put the mint on the table.

247
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,890
There’s a chance he might have seen him.

248
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,520
Hello.

249
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,550
What brings you by?

250
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,450
We’re from Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency's investigation unit.

251
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,730
We’d like to do an inquiry investigation

252
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,910
of the employees who were present at the time of Professor Na’s murder.

253
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,160
Yes, just a moment.

254
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,790
Detective Cha.

255
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,880
Oh, damn it!

256
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,770
It’s not me!

257
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,710
Ouch! I really don’t know!

258
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,840
Do you want me to break it?

259
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,860
I-I’ll talk!

260
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,660
Who was it?

261
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,220
Well, some guy told me it was a prop and that if I put it on the table,

262
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,010
he’d give me 300,000 won.

263
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,650
Why didn’t you admit it then?

264
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,130
I thought it might get misconstrued. I'm sorry.

265
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,270
Do you remember what he looked like?

266
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:56,230
No. I think he looked ordinary.

267
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,390
  All I have to do is just put it there?

268
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:10,900
But what’s strange is his hands smelled like gasoline.

269
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,710
- Gasoline? 
 - Yes.

270
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,000
It’s nail polish.

271
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,780
Team Leader.

272
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,790

273
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,910
It must've been used to hide his fingerprints.

274
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,020

275
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,730
A part of a fingerprint was found, but it’s so small.

276
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,240
This guy is very meticulous.

277
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,620
That's why we came to the National Forensic Service.

278
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,320
This will take time, and we may not get any results.

279
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,120
You have to get the results somehow.

280
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,170
Geez...

281
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,080

282
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,050

283
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,380
410.

284
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,280
Yes?

285
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,240
The district office is verifying actual residents,

286
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,250
so please sign here.

287
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,650
Here?

288
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,290
You said nothing was stolen.

289
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,900
If you're done watching, let’s wrap it up.

290
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,210
Wait, stop.

291
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,070
Who’s that?

292
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,430
Who’s this? When did he get in?

293
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,570
Do you know him?

294
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:27,390
Not being able to differentiate between reality and an illusion is a mental issue,

295
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,620
but you know about trauma.

296
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,120
Have you heard this before?

297
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,040
God heals sicknesses,

298
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,730
but the doctor takes the fees.

299
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,490
That saying is true.

300
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:50,470
The patient’s will is more important than any prescription.

301
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:55,300
But... it’s too soon to be at ease.

302
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,310
You don’t need to scare me.

303
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,860
I’m scared enough.

304
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,580
I’m glad to hear it.

305
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:11,080
Anyway, don’t push yourself too much.

306
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,060
I’ll be leaving.

307
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:18,010
Doctor Ahn, thank you.

308
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,170
It's the first time I'm hearing that in five years.

309
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,230
I saw the news. Be careful.

310
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,680
I’m home.

311
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,030
I told you not to wait up.

312
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,530
Did you eat?

313
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,190
Are you sleeping?

314
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,350
This is my journalistic instinct,

315
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,750
but you know that female officer?

316
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,210
The detective who recently joined the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

317
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,280
Whoever brought her here...

318
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,980
you said it was a little odd.

319
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,240
I think there’s something.

320
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,930

321
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,270
I called the nail polish company, but it’s mass produced,

322
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,230
so it’ll be tricky to pinpoint where it was bought.

323
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,740
I was told a lot of men also buy the clear ones.

324
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,960
Start with the shops near the broadcast station.

325
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,030
Yes, I understand.

326
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,580
It won’t be easy to track those threatening texts either

327
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,160
since they came in through an overseas server.

328
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,180
- What about the fishing line? 
 - We’re going to the store later.

329
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,000
Call me as soon as you get a suspect.

330
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,360
Yes, I understand!

331
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,040
Only the registered reporters can enter.

332
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,370
Why are you being so inflexible all of a sudden?

333
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,140
I come here all the time!

334
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,110
That’s the procedure, so I can't let in those who aren't registered.

335
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,780
Please don’t be like this. Let us in!

336
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,830
Let us in!

337
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,800
Come on.

338
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,290
You can’t!

339
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,340
Please!

340
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,750
Please leave. I’ll contact you.

341
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,240
Did you find something?

342
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,140
Yes.

343
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,190
It’s a fishing line used by tugboats to catch tuna.

344
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,610
But it’s not Korean.

345
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,200
It’s not used by recreational fishermen either.

346
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,000
Yes, yes.

347
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,560
Okay, I understand.

348
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,370
What did she say?

349
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,860
Where are we going to find him?

350
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,570
Ah, it’ll be faster to find Waldo.

351
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,750

352
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,540
Excuse me, we're the police.

353
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,470
We need to ask you a few questions.

354
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,090
Do you sell this here?

355
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,730
Uh... no, we don’t.

356
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,140
Thank you for your help. Good bye.

357
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,750

358
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,170
Yes, Team Leader?

359
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,420
We haven't found it yet.

360
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,950
Yes, as Detective Yang said,

361
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:55,830
it won’t be easy to find where it was sold since it’s a mass produced item.

362
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:56,840
Yes, yes.

363
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,780
 What is this? Pencil lead?

364
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,030
Yes, yes.

365
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,770
We’ve checked all the stores around the broadcast station,

366
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:10,060
and we’ll give you the status report after we check another location.

367
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,460
The bastard's target radius is becoming smaller.

368
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,690
In my vicinity...

369
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,070
Who would be next?

370
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,210
The next target...

371
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,740
 It's Cha Soo Yeong.

372
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,260
 Um... Detective Oh.

373
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:39,190
There's something I have to tell you.

374
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,540
Tell me.

375
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,100
I think someone came into my room.

376
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,120
What was taken?

377
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,300
 Nothing was taken.

378
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,120
But it feels strange.

379
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,050
If he didn't take anything,

380
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,440
then he must've gotten some information.

381
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:59,020
I think he saw my notebook.

382
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,300
Be careful. You could be his next target.

383
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,860
Okay.

384
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,690

385
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,300

386
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,400

387
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,500

388
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,170
You were in.

389
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,570
I just stopped in while passing by.

390
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,620
Wow, reminds me of old times.

391
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,170
When I was a team leader, this was my desk.

392
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,150
Is there something you want to say?

393
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,680
Team Leader Hwang.

394
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,380
As your work superior and sunbae in life,

395
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,470
let me give you some advice.

396
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,630
Do everything you want.

397
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,820
But let’s not do what the organization doesn’t want you to do.

398
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,540
Isn’t it your wish instead of the organization’s?

399
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:20,000
I’m loyal to the organization.

400
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,810
But I’m just worried because a junior I care about

401
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,990
seems to keep going against the wishes of the organization.

402
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,790
I have things to do.

403
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,790
Next month, there will be personnel changes.

404
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,060
 Someone is behind Team Leader Hwang. Find out.

405
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,380
  And monitor that police officer from the rural branch and report back.

406
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,050

407
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,420

408
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,510
Don’t wait up.

409
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,690
I might not be able to come home for a while.

410
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,750

411
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,750
We'll announce the interim results of our investigation on Professor Na Joon Seok’s murder.

412
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:19,100
Based on CCTV and eyewitness testimony,

413
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,240
we are tracking down possible suspects.

414
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,610
What about the mint which was found at the scene?

415
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:29,640
We have identified that it was used to confuse the investigation.

416
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,920
Does it have anything to do with that bastard who died five years ago?

417
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,420
No, the latest murder is not related to the series of murders that have happened,

418
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:46,120
and it’s believed to be a crime of revenge by someone with a grudge against Professor Na Joon Seok.

419
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,860
We will apprehend the criminal as soon as possible.

420
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,830
Do you have any idea who could be the next victim?

421
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,670
Please tell us!

422
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,550
Please give a statement!

423
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,330
We will give more details in writing.

424
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,350
Please, a statement!

425
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:29,160
Yes, Detective Lee. I’m on my way.

426
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,850
Okay.

427
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:41,190
  I’ve seen him somewhere before.

428
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,900
  Please!

429
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,520
  Come on let us in!

430
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,590

431
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,440
Please follow that taxi in front of us.

432
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,290
Detective Lee, it's me.

433
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:35,020
Among the reporters who have access to the police station, there is a Reporter Lee Bo Gwang.

434
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,740
Could I get an identity check on him?

435
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,430
Lee Bo Gwang?

436
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,420
He took leave six months ago.

437
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,390
He doesn't have a criminal record or anything. What is it?

438
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,190
Something doesn’t feel right.

439
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,390
Please look into him more.

440
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:24,880
 Where did he go?

441
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,370
I searched his credit card and medical insurance details, but he doesn't have any family members,

442
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,540
 and there has been no trace of how he's been making living for six months.

443
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,260
 Please investigate Lee Bo Gwang right now.

444
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,140
 Pardon?  Where are you right now?

445
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,810
 I'm near the Yeonsil-dong intersection.

446
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,750
 I'll call you again later.

447
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,000
Yes.  What's the matter?

448
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,530
Where are you now?

449
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,860
I'm about to leave work.

450
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,450
Come here right away.

451
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,680
 That bastard is near there.

452
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,400
Hurry up.

453
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,840
Who are you?

454
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,140

455
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,650

456
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,510

457
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:34,100
Team Leader, Detective Cha requested an investigation on Reporter Lee Bo Gwang's residence.

458
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,250
Where is Cha Soo Yeong right now?

459
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,970
When I just spoke with her on the phone, she said she was near Yeonsil-dong intersection.

460
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,180
- Detective Yang. 
 - Yes?

461
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,460
Head to Lee Bo Gwang's residence with Detective Jang first.

462
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,300
- I'll go to Cha Soo Yeong. 
 - Yes.

463
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,860
I'll send you his address.

464
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,400
Hurry up and send it!

465
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:06,750

466
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:51,440
Hello!  Are you okay?  Hello!

467
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,710
I'm at Seong Myeong Clinic at Yeonsil-dong intersection.

468
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,370
Please send an ambulance here as soon as possible.

469
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:03,620
An emergency patient is here.

470
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,760
 If he didn't take anything,

471
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,940
 then he must've gotten some information.

472
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,620

473
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:30,910

474
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,650

475
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:53,570

476
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,930
Team Leader, it's me.

477
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:07,610
The next target is Detective Oh.

478
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,770
I couldn't get in touch with Oh Hyeon Jae.

479
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:17,300
It's all my fault. Detective Oh's location was exposed because of me.

480
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,180
 Team Leader, we're heading to Lee Bo Gwang's address right now.

481
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,580
You never know what could happen. Everyone, be careful.

482
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:59,280

483
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:08,070

484
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,850

485
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,860

486
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,670
 Lee Bo Gwang, Jeonsoo-dong 78.

487
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:33,050
I'll send an address. Go there right now and catch him first no matter what.

488
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:35,480
Right now!

489
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:23,510

490
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,660

491
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:32,640
It's been a while.

492
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,980
Has it been five years?

493
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:39,840
I finally meet you, Oh Hyeon Jae.

494
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:52,450

495
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:09,910

496
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:13,490
 So you used me to lure that bastard out.

497
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,650
 The hit-and-run car that you were looking for when you were young...

498
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,350
 I can help you find it.

499
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,840
 Did you plan all this on purpose to catch that bastard?

500
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,460
 I need to confirm that you're really that bastard.

501
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,680
 Where should I cuff the other one?

502
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,120
 Freeze! Put your hands in the air!

00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,540
