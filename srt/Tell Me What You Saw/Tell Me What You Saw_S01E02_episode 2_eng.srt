1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,900

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,070

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,410

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,490

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,630

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,480

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,390

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:36,780

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,770
 Who threw away something like that there?

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,430
 What?

11
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,530
 Twenty-year-old Go Min Ji, who lives in Hwayeong-Gun, Mucheon Metropolitan City, went missing on 24th of last month.

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,090
  So we have a dismembered body in a suitcase,

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,310
  and we found a mint.

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,220
 Who was the first officer on scene?

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,630
 May I ask you where we're going?

16
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,030
 To meet someone.

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,010
  All you have to do is tell the person what you saw like the last time.

18
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,180
 Is anybody there?

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,230
 The scene in Heungwoon... Tell me exactly as you saw it.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:11,040
 Among the bystanders, there was a man who was holding something like a dog leash.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,010
 It was the first time that I saw him.

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,860
  How was the policewoman you met a few days ago?

23
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,580
 I don't think she will be much help.

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,300
 She is too emotional.

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,640
 I came to turn myself in.

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,730
 I'm the very murderer who killed Go Min Ji.

27
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,910
 The mint serial killer.

28
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,590
 He keeps insisting he is the bastard who died five years ago.

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,840
 Is he really that bastard?

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,090
 You're just a copycat who wants attention.

31
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,550
 That bastard died.

32
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,130
 You'll regret it if you keep doing this.

33
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,800
 Didn't you hear you should hand the suspect over to the prosecutor?

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,890
 Don't cause trouble for multiple people by going off on your own like you did five years ago.

35
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,390
 I couldn't remember this at the time,

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,810
 but there was someone else at the scene.

37
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,530

38
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,140

39
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:17,770

40
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,870

41
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,590
To Sejeon-dong, please.

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,100

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,810
It seems like you're going somewhere to meet someone.

44
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,490
Your boyfriend?

45
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,160
We've pinpointed the location of Isu's phone.

46
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,890
It's heading toward Joonggeon three-way intersection.

47
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,740
Oh Hyeon Jae, stay cool.  She'll be alright.

48
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,030
 No.  There is more.

49
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,120
Isu.

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,470
Isu!

51
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,510
Look at all this smoke!

52
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,590
I can't even breathe.

53
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,160
Isu!

54
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,190
Stop right there!

55
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,910
Cuff one hand to the metal pole next to you.

56
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,880
Hurry up!

57
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,970
That's right.

58
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,560
Stay there.

59
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,400
Isu!

60
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,560
Isu! Isu!

61
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,590
Wake up! Are you okay?

62
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,350
Oh Hyeon Jae! Hurry up and get out of there!

63
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,440
- Isu! 
 - Hyeon Jae!  Hyeon Jae!

64
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,620
Isu! Isu!

65
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,690
Hyeon Jae!

66
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,980
Isu! Isu!

67
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,390
Hyeon Jae!

68
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,360
Isu! Isu!

69
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,470
Oh Hyeon Jae!

70
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,080
Isu...

71
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,960

72
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,440
 I came to see Detective Oh Hyeon Jae.

73
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,280
 I'm Policewoman Cha Soo Yeong who was here a few days ago.

74
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,110
 I have something that I must tell Detective Oh.

75
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,600
Detective, you were right.

76
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,640
 About how Kang Seung Hwan is not related to that bastard.

77
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,090
 So I understand very well that I became useless.

78
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,420
But... I couldn't remember this at the time,

79
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,310
but there was someone else at the scene.

80
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,620
 There was a taxi.

81
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,620
 But no one got out and it was parked there for a while.

82
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,020
I just... I came because I thought you should know.

83
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,150
Hello.

84
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,730
You're surprised.

85
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,920
Yes... no.

86
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,080
Right, now tell me what you saw.

87
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,280
There were so many onlookers at the scene that day.

88
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,230
There was a taxi behind them.

89
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,620
But no one got out and it was parked there for a while.

90
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,150
Was there anyone in the taxi?

91
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,200
There was someone in the back seat but I couldn't see who the person was.

92
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,540
Why didn't you mention that a few days ago?

93
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,710
I went back to the scene.

94
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,980
So it jogged your memory?

95
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,230
Yes.

96
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,710
There are so many psychos at a scene.

97
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,250
It’s similar to a tow truck arriving before the police when there’s an accident.

98
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:06,540
It could've been a live SNS (social networking service) video or just someone eavesdropping.

99
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,510
Hey, don't do anything childish.

100
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,600
I'm sorry.

101
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,850
Just because I can't see, doesn't mean I don't know.

102
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,480
Okay.

103
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,750
I've thought about it.

104
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:49,080
If that bastard were able to assess the police radio,

105
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,380
he might've heard about a mint they found among the dismembered body parts, right?

106
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,690
If I were him, I think I would be curious

107
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,930
about what kind of a person would copy me.

108
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,990

109
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:08,160
You saw that bastard's information on KICS and, of course, did research on his case, too.

110
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,100
That's how you got suspicious.

111
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,400
So you started thinking sequentially.

112
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,180
Because of a coincidence, a fixed idea, a mistake from generalizing,

113
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,620
and then lastly a delusion, you felt certain.

114
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,980
Listen to me well. That's how errors in witness statements also happen.

115
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,400
Ghost images become subjective and distorted.

116
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,150
Still, it's not that there is no possibility, right?

117
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,070
That bastard officially died.

118
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,920
It says that on the autopsy notes of the police investigation records.

119
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,550
But you don't believe it.

120
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,890
Why do you think I don't believe it?

121
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,290
I thought over and over about why you called me.

122
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,350
It's because of that bastard, right?

123
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,370
You wanted to know if that bastard came back to life.

124
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,530
I'm correct, right? If that bastard is alive...

125
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,730
This is interesting.

126
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,510
If he's alive?

127
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,390
Please let me work at the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

128
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,570
I am sure there will be times when I can be of help to you, Detective.

129
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,430
Look, I don't have that kind of authority.

130
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,790
But do you have that kind of a talent?

131
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,380
What's the reason?

132
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,110
Why do you want to join the Metropolitan Investigation Unit?

133
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,200
I also...

134
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,610
have someone I must catch.

135
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,400

136
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,250

137
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,020

138
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,410

139
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:41,310

140
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,160

141
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,140
Oh!  I thought you went home.

142
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,810
- There is an empty desk, isn't there? 
 - Yes.

143
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,860
What are you doing, not coming in?

144
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:21,280
Hello.  Hello.  Hello.

145
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,660
She is a policewoman who will temporarily work here until we resolve the Go Min Ji case.

146
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,180
- Detective Lee, give her the relevant documents. 
 - Yes.

147
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,970
What?  Excuse me, that...

148
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,060
Team Leader, the Metropolitan Investigation Unit is not a place that anyone can join.

149
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,810
This is not right.

150
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,920
Still, even if it's temporary, letting a policewoman join is a little...

151
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,930
Other teams will make a fun of us, Team Leader. Please?

152
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,970
She is an important witness of the Go Min Ji murder case,

153
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,800
and I have my own discretion as a team leader.

154
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,370
If the case is resolved, I'll send her back right away, so don't worry.

155
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,480
We'll have a meeting in five minutes.

156
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,890
I'm Policewoman Cha Soo Yeong. I'll do my best.

157
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,840
What do we do?

158
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,060
I don't know, you punk!

159
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,470
Why are you asking me?

160
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,000
Take this to the laundry room.

161
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,010
Come this way.

162
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,190
Ah, geez.  Gosh.

163
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,850
Go figure. Ah, seriously.

164
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,290

165
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,830
Let's begin.

166
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,100
It's presumed that Kang Seung Hwan looked for his victims through a chatting site,

167
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,250
lured them, and then killed them.

168
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,660
How about the location of the crime?

169
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,890
First of all, it's not his house.

170
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,600
If he mutilated the bodies at his house, there would be blood all over the place.

171
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,090
But it was cleaner than expected.

172
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,790

173
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,510

174
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,910
How about other victims?

175
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,880
- We have only photos for now— 
 - Wait, wait!

176
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,990
- Hey. 
 - No...

177
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,060
Hey, hey, ask questions later.  Just listen right now.

178
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,690
No, the previous photo... Yes.

179
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,170
The woman wearing that earring in the photo just now... I've seen her here.

180
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,960
What?

181
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,300
When?  Why are you talking about it now?

182
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,230
Actually to be clear, I saw her in the missing person print flyers.

183
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,200
The earring is the same.

184
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,320
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

185
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,440
Bring the flyer.

186
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,620
Team Leader, what is it with her?

187
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,670
We will know in due time.

188
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,290
Ah, really.

189
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,950
Here you are.

190
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,860
Whoa, it's exactly the same.

191
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,560
- Call the specialized missing person team and find out more details. 
 - Okay.

192
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,650
Contact her family too and track the location of Jo Seong Ae's cellphone.

193
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,500
Okay, got it.

194
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,860
 Isu! Isu!

195
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,760
 Is this the police station? I got pickpocketed.

196
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,360
 Dispatch to the incident site.

197
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,540
 A hostage incident occurred. A perpetrator is holding a pedestrian hostage...

198
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,120
 Thirty something years old.

199
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,030
 He really disappeared.

200
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,940
 He wore white clothes.

201
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,360
 A dead body was found near the mountain.

202
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,280
 A person who hasn't come home yet has been reported.

203
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,140
 Patrol car, please go to that area.

204
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,280
 Location noted.

205
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,820

206
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,590
Although this building is a little old, these are prestigious study rooms.

207
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,470
Seven people passed the bar examinations, five people passed the civil service examinations,

208
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,390
and countless people passed the police examinations.

209
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,390
Rent should be paid in advance every month,

210
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,810
and the laundry room is at the left corner.

211
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,180
You can't use it after 9 pm.

212
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,700
Excuse me.

213
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Ah, that...

214
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,730
And pets and boyfriends are prohibited from visiting.

215
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,390
And let me know if anything is wrong.

216
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,990
I'm going to be a policeman soon.

217
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,500
Ah, I see.

218
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,790
Thank you.

219
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,050
Dad!

220
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,380
 Is the place you're staying at okay?

221
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,950
The room is big and the rent is cheap.

222
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,690
It's okay. It's not too bad.

223
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,090
 Have you had dinner?

224
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,050
 Of course I ate. Look at the time!

225
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,530
Don't worry about me and make sure to eat well yourself.

226
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,910
Please be quiet.  Who doesn't have a dad?

227
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,970
 Dad, phone connection is getting cut off.

228
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,210
 I'll call you later.

229
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,440
 Okay.

230
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,690
I'm sorry.

231
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,190
Right.  Cha Soo Yeong, you can do it.

232
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,850
Do it tomorrow! Let me sleep!

233
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,250
You can hear this too?

234
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,420
I'm sorry.

235
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,620

236
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,450

237
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,430
Did you find something?

238
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,000
I found something but—

239
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,840
Who are you?

240
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm Policewoman Cha Soo Yeong.

241
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Ah, the policewoman who turned the suitcase over at the scene?

242
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,070
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Let's keep going.

243
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,520
You have such a temper.

244
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,850
I analyzed the hair DNA and...

245
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,470
Ah, stop taking your time! I'm already stewing as it is!

246
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,200
- It was a match. 
 - What is?

247
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,140
I'm telling you the DNA from Kang Seung Hwan's criminal weapon

248
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,400
and the DNA from Jo Seong Ae's hair match.

249
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,890
There is only a small amount...

250
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,700
Anyway, looking at how long the blood has been exposed in the air, I don't think it has been that long.

251
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,730
What do you mean by that?

252
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,460
It seems it was stained very recently,  about 48 hours ago.

253
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,280
You're saying it is possible that she is alive.

254
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,390
It's a possibility.

255
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,370
T-Team—

256
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,190
- Team Leader. 
 - There's a possibility that she's still alive.

257
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,930
If it has been three days since she went missing, today is the golden time.

258
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,460
People are able to stay alive at most three days without water, right?

259
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,310
Team Leader, Kang Seung Hwan wants to speak only with you.

260
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,860
Send Kang Seung Hwan to the Prosecution by today.

261
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,440
It's decided that this case will be closed.

262
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,410
There is a possibility that there is a victim who is alive.

263
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,070
We have to connect the pieces and dig into him more.

264
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,910
Just hand him over along with that situation!

265
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,520
It's not confirmed, so don't unnecessarily make something into a bigger problem.

266
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,300
If the missing person ends up dying because we kept him,  our police force will get all the blame.

267
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,890
I'll find her within today.

268
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,950
Hey, Hwang Ha Yeong!

269
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,060
Only until today!

270
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,060
Salute.

271
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,050
You, come inside.

272
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,360
Me?

273
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,030
I'll start by apologizing.

274
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,300
I honestly didn't believe you when you said you were that bastard.

275
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,790
I thought you were just a third-rate copycat.

276
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,120
What changed your mind all of a sudden?

277
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,990
We found someone else's blood on the weapon.

278
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,750
Who knows? There's a chance she could still be alive.

279
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:14,630
The thought that you were greater than I thought came to my mind.

280
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,370
What are you up to?

281
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,340
You deserve to be respected.

282
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,170
Where is she?

283
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,400
She must be somewhere.

284
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,360
Who knows?

285
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,880
Where is she, you bastard?

286
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,330
I'm also curious.

287
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:04,260
Is she alive or is she dead?

288
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,910
It's your job to find out, huh?

289
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,920
It would be too easy if I told you.

290
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,990
Isn't that so?

291
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,370

292
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,990
This is the area where Jo Seong Ae's phone signal was cut off three days ago.

293
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,150
If you look at Kang Seung Hwan's driving pattern and phone usage pattern,

294
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,190
there is a high possibility that the location of the crime

295
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,450
is within a 20 kilometer radius of Kang Seung Hwan's residence.

296
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,840
If he moved further away, he might have felt some psychological resistance.

297
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,830
Right.

298
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,760
The location of the crime is probably some place with not too many people

299
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,280
and a place that wouldn't be suspicious even if there were noise.

300
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,610
Wouldn't it be in a basement?

301
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,000
We can't rule out the possibility that she is still alive.

302
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,710
We must find her today.

303
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,740
A basement...

304
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,580
When Team Leader had Kang Seung Hwan by the throat...

305
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,450
Policewoman Cha.

306
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,980
Well, it was just for a moment, but...

307
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,360
Kang Seung Hwan's stare stopped at a certain photo for a short time.

308
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,470
There's a saying that even if one lies with one's mouth, one's eyes can't lie.

309
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,770
It was this picture.

310
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,350
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

311
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,040
It looks like some factory in the background.

312
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,480
Although it's very little, limestone powder was found on his shoes and house.

313
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,010
If it's limestone powder... it's an ingredient of cement.

314
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,260
There is a closed cement factory in Gijoo-dong.

315
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,310
It takes only 15 minutes to get there from Kang Seung Hwan's residence.

316
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,990
The place where Kang Seung Hwan's car was caught speeding on CCTV was near there.

317
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,330
And Kang Seung Hwan's father used to work there.

318
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,430
Let's go there right now.

319
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,960
Detective Jang, ask the local police unit and fire rescue team for back up.

320
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,360
Okay, got it.

321
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,430

322
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,080
Ah, is that so? Okay, I understand.

323
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,140
They said all of the fire rescue teams went to put out a forest fire.

324
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,240
Detective Lee, you contacted the local police units, didn't you?

325
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,960
Yes, I contacted them.

326
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,940
Tell them no one can go in before the Metropolitan Investigation Unit arrives.

327
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,130
- Particularly, tell them to turn off their flashing lights and sirens when they approach. 
 - Yes.

328
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,710
Team Leader, if the missing person ends up dying when we are involved like this, we'll be blamed for everything.

329
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,920
Is being blamed for all of it a problem when someone's life is at risk?

330
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,400
True.

331
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,570

332
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,940
 Report the progress.

333
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,520
Right this way.

334
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,600
It's locked.

335
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Team Leader, this is the interior floor plan.

336
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,270
Team Leader, this is an old building that had a possible risk of collapse, so it's been closed down.

337
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,370
The building owner has a key but he is not contactable.

338
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,420
And there is no other entrance except this main door.

339
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,330
There must be a hidden entrance.

340
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,840
Team Leader, they've paid fines for wastewater and poisonous gas before.

341
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,500
Looking at this, we have to get in through the sewer or the vent pipe.

342
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,930
It looks like it's over there.

343
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,510
The entrance is too narrow so it'll be hard to go through.

344
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,520
What should we do?

345
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,130
There's no other entrance.

346
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,810
Oh, this...

347
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,400
I don't think it'll come off.

348
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,640
I'll go inside.

349
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,200
Does this seem like a joke to you right now?

350
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,440
You don't know when to get involved and when to step back!

351
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,780
Can you do it?

352
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,460
- Yes. 
 - Hey!

353
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,240
Hey! If something happens, you’ll be in big trouble!

354
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,150
If anything seems dangerous, I'll come right out.

355
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,630
Get ready.

356
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,160
Team Leader.

357
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,780
I'm going to go crazy.  Ah really.

358
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,190
That is here, but...

359
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,040
Even now, if you don't want to, you can stop here.

360
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,250
No, I'll go inside.

361
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,200
It's for backup.

362
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,900
 If you follow the sewer and go about 50 meters,

363
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,000
 there is a pathway to the factory basement.

364
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,300
 If you find the victim, radio us.

365
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,910
 If it doesn't feel right, come out right away instead of getting yourself into trouble.

366
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,370
 Okay, I understand.

367
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,990
- You have to be careful of the wastewater inside over there. 
 - Okay.

368
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,740
Cha Soo Yeong.

369
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,150
 What happened?

370
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,880
It was nothing.

371
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,510
Keep going straight. Go about 20 meters.

372
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,520
 If you see a forked path, take the right one.

373
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,800
Okay, got it.

374
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,140
 Policewoman Cha.

375
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:17,940
Yes?

376
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,570
Do you see anything?

377
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:24,800
Not yet. I don't see anything.

378
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,760
Where should I go?

379
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,510
There are spiderwebs everywhere here.

380
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,360
And?

381
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,410
 Policewoman Cha. Cha Soo Yeong.

382
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,150
Can you hear me?

383
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,640
The sewer is underground and it's blocked everywhere, so the connection is not good.

384
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,400
Let's tell her to come out now.

385
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,770
Team Leader, due to an inlet nearby, the ground has weakened. There is a risk of the building collapsing.

386
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,190
Cha Soo Yeong! Policewoman Cha!

387
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,390
 Stop and come out.

388
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,090
 What did you say? What did you say, Team Leader?

389
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,670
 I can't really hear you, Team Leader.

390
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,810
That's enough. Come out now. It's dangerous.

391
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,430
Now, what will you do?

392
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,170
You have to choose, Cha Soo Yeong.

393
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:26,260
Will you get out or keep going in?

394
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,750
Try it.

395
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,890
It's blocked.

396
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,400
It looks like someone blocked it recently.

397
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,190
Can you hear me, Team Leader?

398
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,650
 Team Leader? Can you hear me, Team Leader?

399
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,470
What the?

400
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,680
What the?

401
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,890
Cha Soo Yeong, answer me.

402
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,990
I said answer me!

403
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,050
It looks like a hidden space not on the floor plan.

404
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,040
Policewoman Cha, can you hear us?

405
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,360
 Hey Policewoman Cha! Stop there and come out!

406
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,820
The radio signal is cut off. What should we do?

407
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,560
We'll wait.

408
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,990
The type that has no plans and gets led by her emotions.

409
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,520
A troublesome type.

410
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,620

411
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:42,320
 Sir, we looked for it, but it’s an unlicensed vehicle.

412
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,530
  It means there’s no owner.

413
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,320
  To be honest, the kid could have seen wrong.

414
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,790
  Anyway, we’ll try our best. Good luck with the funeral.

415
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,280
 I’ll be in touch, okay?

416
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,300
 Okay?

417
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:02,090
 I saw it. I really saw it!

418
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,250
 Mom.

419
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,350
 Mom.

420
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,130
 Mom, Mom.

421
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,390
Mom.

422
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,400
If I give up now...

423
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,650
it’ll also be easy to give up looking for your killer too, right?

424
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,960
I'm... honestly the most scared of that.

425
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,750
From now on, follow my orders.

426
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,350
Who is it?

427
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,750
Who do you think?

428
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,230
Detective Oh Hyeon Jae?

429
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,940
 How did you...

430
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,210
Now, it's really showtime.

431
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,410
You’ve been listening this whole time?

432
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,360
Don't make a fuss. Can you get up?

433
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,180
Yes.

434
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,790
 What do you see?

435
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,520
There are spiderwebs everywhere.

436
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,170
Go where there are no spiderwebs.

437
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,130
That’s a path people have been using.

438
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:17,630
From now on, you have to concentrate on sound, smell, and feel.

439
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,210
There should be plumbing by the wall. Knock on it.

440
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,110
Follow the vibration.

441
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,440
If it hasn't been cut off, it should be connected to above.

442
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,480
It’s blocked. It’s a wall.

443
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,400
What should I do now?

444
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,130
Knock on the wall and make a sound.

445
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,690
Right there.

446
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,930
Now find the door.

447
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,700
 I can’t find the handle anywhere.

448
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,640
Look, just because there’s no handle, it doesn’t mean there’s no door.

449
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,900
Use your head. Think for a change.

450
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,860
It opened.

451
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,090
Now go inside.

452
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,290
The smell changed.

453
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,730
What does it smell like?

454
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:34,560
Something like dust and something disgustingly fishy.

455
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:39,050
Don’t make unnecessary sounds.

456
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,090
I'm sorry.

457
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,250
There should be a switch somewhere.

458
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,200
With your back toward the wall, touch to your left.

459
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,040
I found it.

460
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,910
Wait. Before you turn on the switch, close your eyes first.

461
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,450
Why?

462
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,380
 Just do as I tell you.

463
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,260
Open your eyes when I tell you to.

464
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,380
 Listen carefully. The first feeling is the most important.

465
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,210
You can’t get a true initial feeling if it gets bright suddenly.

466
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,600
You have to give your pupils time to adjust.

467
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,730
When should I open my eyes?

468
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,740
Now.

469
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,670
What do you see?

470
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,590
There are so many corpses.

471
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,100
Don’t touch anything and just look and feel.

472
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,750
I'll be the one to decide.

473
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,810
Go in a little further.

474
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,430
It looks like...

475
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,960
some kind of an exhibition hall.

476
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,020
There’s a chair in the center.

477
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,570
I think Kang Seung Hwan sat here

478
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,790
and looked at the victims as though he was admiring a work of art.

479
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,400
How long has it been?

480
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,610
I think they’ve been dead for a while.

481
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,990
What is that sound?

482
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,050
It looks like the ceiling is about to collapse.

483
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,610
Get out.

484
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,410
What if the victim is alive?

485
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:38,350
It’ll collapse soon. Get out.

486
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,800
 What if the victim is alive?

487
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,080
Save me! I'm over here!

488
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,480
You’ll be okay now. I’m a police officer. We’ll get out.

489
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,960
Thank you.

490
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,680
 You'll be okay. We'll get out of here now.

491
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,170
We’ll get out of here.

492
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,100
Thank you.

493
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,380
You'll be okay.

494
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,940
 You endured well.

495
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,770
  Don't worry. We’ll get out now.

496
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,450
♫  A cold pain that takes my breath away  ♫

497
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,150
♫  Stains the gray sky red  ♫

498
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:35,470
- Find her.
 - Yes.

499
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,930
Cha Soo Yeong!

500
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:40,870
- Cha Soo Yeong! 
 - Cha Soo Yeong!

501
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:43,270
Policewoman Cha, can you hear me?

502
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,380
- If you can hear me, answer. 
 - Cha Soo Yeong!

503
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,620
♫  Left alone in the rough wind  ♫

504
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,770
Team Leader!

505
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,450
Cha Soo Yeong!

506
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,690
Call an ambulance.

507
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,080
Are you okay?

508
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,220
I'm fine.

509
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,660
- Detective Jang!  
 - Yes!

510
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,430
- Carry her. 
 - Policewoman Cha.

511
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,710
♫  The world turns redder  ♫

512
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:20,160
Get a hold of yourself!

513
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,810
♫  Deep in the dark  ♫

514
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,970
♫  Your sigh seeps in before I know it  ♫

515
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:34,550
♫  In the withered petals  ♫

516
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,880
♫  The color spreads  ♫

517
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,420
Go!

518
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,650
I’ll assess the scene.

519
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,880
Good work.

520
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,040
You said you weren’t interested.

521
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,660
 Why did you help me?

522
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,460
I never helped you.

523
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,150
Then why?

524
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:05,040
I pitied you.

525
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,160
I pity myself, too.

526
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,750
This is as far as you go.

527
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,930

528
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:27,370
First, Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong will report on the progress of the investigation.

529
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:36,060
We have rescued the missing Ms. Jo who was kidnapped by suspect Kang Seung Hwan.

530
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,090
Suspected serial killer Kang Seung Hwan is assumed to have kidnapped his victims

531
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:43,620
and killed them brutally at the basement of the abandoned building.

532
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,500
Have you found the motive for the murders?

533
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:51,190
According to the investigation, Kang Seung Hwan is a mentally ill person who wanted to imitate the infamous criminal.

534
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,390
We presume that Kang Seung Hwan conducted several rehearsals based

535
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,160
on the numerous articles about that bastard and carried out the crimes.

536
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,760
Excuse me, is that bastard alive?

537
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,580
I will only say things based on the facts.

538
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:12,700
He is officially dead due to the explosion

539
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,410
that occurred at the Joonggeon three-way intersection five years ago.

540
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,590
That case is closed.

541
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:22,920
There are people saying that to determine the dead body that was found five years ago as that bastard is poor investigation.

542
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,730
There is nothing we can say officially about the conspiracies that exist.

543
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,410
Excuse me.

544
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,350
Is Profiler Oh Hyeon Jae alive?

545
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,290
We will put an end to the case briefing here.

546
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,260

547
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,460
What?

548
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,600
Did you know? That Detective Oh would intervene?

549
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,760
No, but I thought he might.

550
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,990
Betting on you was an adventure for me, too.

551
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,510
And?

552
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,180
Is my or Oh Hyeon Jae's evaluation that important?

553
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,520
Your will is what is important.

554
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:32,700
You sent that policewoman in first at the scene I heard.

555
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,090
Are you out of your mind?

556
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,790
It was a decision made by Team Leader Hwang.

557
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,450
Nothing new about her?

558
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:42,250
Nothing so far.

559
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,590
- Detective Lee. 
 - Yes.

560
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,710
Where you should put periods,

561
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:56,350
you can't constantly be putting question marks, okay?

562
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,860
Okay.

563
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,290
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

564
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,160
How about yellowtail?

565
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,690
Don't you know I don't eat sashimi?  Is Detective Lee going to be late?

566
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:09,100
-  He said he will soon join us. 
- Cha Soo Yeong, come here quickly.

567
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,760
Okay.

568
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,800
That was good.

569
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,050
Once more like this.

570
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,700
What is this? You should add more meat and soup here!

571
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,380
You’ve gotten really cheap!

572
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,290
Gosh, have some conscience.

573
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:32,090
You're not a detective but a robber!

574
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,130
You even look like a thief!

575
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:38,100
Come on, Auntie. How will you do business when you don’t know how to judge people?

576
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,090
- People who look like him are the nice ones. 
 - Exactly.

577
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:46,060
I guess so. I mean where can he go with this face to con or steal from people?

578
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,760
What’s with her? Is that a compliment or an insult? What is that?

579
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,060
- It's a compliment. 
- You started already!

580
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,140
We just started.

581
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,990
Be on time!

582
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:01,730
No matter what people say about high-tech or scientific investigations,

583
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,090
investigations are done with physical strength.

584
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:06,700
- Right or wrong? 
 - Of course! It’s done with your guts and strength!

585
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,640
You said before it’s done with your head.

586
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,230
Did I?

587
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:16,910
Hey, you do it with your brain and then with your guts! That's how you do it!

588
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:20,770
You really got a proper welcoming ceremony today, didn’t you?

589
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,230
It’s like that in the beginning.

590
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,300
- Hey, but why isn’t Team Leader here? 
 - She said she had to go somewhere.

591
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,870
- Where? 
 - After she gave me this.

592
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:33,830
- She's got sense, our team leader.
- As expected from our team leader.

593
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,070
Hey, let us have a drink then.

594
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,970
- Cheers! 
 - Then for the Metropolitan Investigation Unit!

595
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:41,580
- Come on! 
 - Don't do stuff like that. You seem like an old fart.

596
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,210
Sit down.

597
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:49,000
Now, cheers to the Metropolitan Investigation Unit!

598
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,850
Do you think she's going to be useful?

599
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,990
Well, I don't think she is good, but...

600
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,820
But she's not bad either.

601
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,030
What is it that you want to say?

602
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,690
That bastard... do you think he's alive?

603
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:12,630
If he's alive, then he'll show up.

604
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,140
He'll show up?

605
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:19,020
Never know. It's up to him, after all.

606
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,170
I'll get going.

607
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,360

608
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,990

609
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,320

610
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,450
Crazy bastard, really...

611
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,530
Oh... my stomach.

612
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:49,070
Be on guard, I'll be right back.

613
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,870
Yes, sir.

614
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,680

615
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,840

616
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,320

617
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,900
Team Leader, we're ready for the on-scene investigation.

618
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,010
- Where's Kang Seung Hwan? 
 - In the interrogation room.

619
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,820
Who are you?

620
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,760
Are you guarding—

621
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,930
Team Leader!

622
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:02,000

623
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,040

624
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,900
Thank you.

625
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:46,370

626
00:58:56,030 --> 00:59:06,020

627
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,910

628
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,870
 Do you remember anything, particularly the people who passed by you?

629
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:25,730
  I can’t recall everything that I see.

630
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:30,600
  I thought about it, and I think Kang Seung Hwan has an accomplice.

631
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,410
 I'm sure he was there to get rid of evidence.

632
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,830
  That bastard died five years ago.

633
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:35,130
  You verified it too.

634
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,990
 Is it really that bastard?

635
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,460
  We’ll know when we find the true culprit who killed Kang Seung Hwan.

636
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,950
 Hurry. Catch him first.

637
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,580
 We have to catch him before Chief Choi does.

638
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,160
 Be careful. We don't know what he will do.

639
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,560
