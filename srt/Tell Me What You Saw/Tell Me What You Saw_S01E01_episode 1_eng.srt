1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,450

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,110

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,770

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,660

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,940

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,700

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,640

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,560

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,310

10
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,350
It's raining.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,380
Woo Ri, I brought an umbrella.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,880
It's raining.

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,820
Eun Gil, Mom is here. Mom is here. Okay.

14
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,580
Come under the umbrella.

15
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,420

16
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,090
Soo Yeong, let's go together.

17
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,730
Thank you.

18
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,980
Oh no...

19
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,440
It's raining so much.

20
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,110
Soo Yeong. Soo Yeong!

21
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,530
Isn't that woman calling you?

22
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,950
 Take your umbrella with you, Soo Yeong.

23
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,100
No.

24
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,300
Soo Yeong. Soo Yeong!

25
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,950
Soo Yeong. Soo Yeong!

26
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,350
Soo Yeong!

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:40,770

28
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,090
 That umbrella...

29
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,710
 Use it...

30
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,260
I'm reporting an accident.

31
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,290
Please send an ambulance quickly.

32
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,580
She must've been seriously  hurt.

33
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,830
No, I’m telling you that asshole won’t show up there.

34
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,880
Am I stupid?  Ah, really.

35
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,430
I need to hang up.

36
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,180
Dad.

37
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,050
Excuse me, sir? Are you the patient's guardian?

38
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,650
 What happened? What happened to her mother?

39
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,190
Damn it, this is driving me crazy.

40
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,610
You... you can't talk?

41
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,060
He asked if you're the guardian.

42
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,000
 What happened?

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,070
Yes, yes, she's in surgery right now.

44
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,980
Her condition isn’t good.

45
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,520
Your mom can't speak either?

46
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,300
- No, she can't.
- Then...

47
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,150
We did the best we could, but she died.

48
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,820
Ah, this is really driving me crazy.

49
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,880
Sir, Sir, please. Get a hold of yourself.

50
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,390
I'll find the money, so please save her. Please.

51
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,020
- Please save my mom! 
 - Wait, excuse me!

52
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,070
Sir, please get a hold of yourself!

53
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,690
This won't bring her back from the dead.

54
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,830
Sir, I'll make sure to contact you, so good luck with the funeral. Keep me posted.

55
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,280
- Wait... 
 - Okay, okay.

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,100
I saw it.

57
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,610
I saw the car.

58
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,500

59
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,000
Mucheon 11 A5897, a black car.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,450
A man with a black hat and a boy were in the car.

61
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,430
Hey, you... I'm a policeman.

62
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,320
If you're lying, you'll be in big trouble.

63
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,390
I know.

64
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:21,080
Hey, look into a plate number. Mucheon 11 A5897.

65
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,950
 That was the first time.

66
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,710
 When I realized I could remember everything as exactly as I saw it.

67
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,790

68
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,830

69
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,090
Hold it right there!

70
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,100
Don't move.

71
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,090
Be good.

72
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,050
Calm down, and stay still.

73
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,640
- What was its name? 
 - Yeom Doong.

74
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,190
Yeom Doong, Yeom Doong. Yeom Doong, Yeom Doong.

75
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,360
It's not that I'm trying to hurt you.

76
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm trying to take you home.

77
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,630
You're like that because you're scared?

78
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,190
I understand. But either way, there is nowhere for you to run right now.

79
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,390
- What are you doing?
- So you should...

80
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,030
This is driving me nuts. Why are you talking to a goat?

81
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,510
Just catch it quickly! What are you doing?

82
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,270
Please be quiet. He's surrounded for now.

83
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,650
Right now... right now, making him calm is the first step to arrest.

84
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,930
Yes. Stay still.

85
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,490
Don't move, okay?

86
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,020
- Oh! No! Stop!
- And you've lost him.

87
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,200
There! Did you catch him?  Oh no!

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,080
He's running! Catch him!

89
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,980
- Oh, they missed! 
 - Ah, what are they doing, not catching him?

90
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,720
- Now! Grab him now!
- Now, now, now! Grab him!

91
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,730
Ah! She caught him!

92
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,770
Oh, goodness.

93
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,500
There you go.

94
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,720
I'm sorry, Yeom Doong.

95
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,530
Civil complaint 54 was resolved.

96
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,580
Policewoman Cha, thank you for your work.

97
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,450
Okay, I'll get going.

98
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,020
- Good bye. 
 - Good work, Policewoman Cha.

99
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,110
Good bye.

100
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,050
Hey, wait, don't get in.

101
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,300
You're so petty.

102
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,830
One person has to answer the radio. Was it hard?

103
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,160
Let's go now. I have to change.

104
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,600
No, first... Hold on. Wait.

105
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,820
Hold on.

106
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,330
Let me put this down, then get in.

107
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,880
You're such a clean freak.

108
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,930
Is this my car?

109
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,960
It's public property, so I'm worried that the smell will stick.

110
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,820
But doesn't it feel like something smells like poop?

111
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,470
Oh, I stepped in some.

112
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,130
Hey, get it off.

113
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,460
Damn it. You’re just too much! More, more.

114
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,110
Happy?

115
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,890
You wash the seat, okay?

116
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,500
Goodbye.

117
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,930
She is Cha's daughter at the fishery, isn't she?

118
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,230
I heard she shut herself off from studying.  How did she become a police officer?

119
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,820
She's not that smart,

120
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,430
but her memory and stamina are the best.

121
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,940
I heard she became a policewoman on the third try.

122
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,460
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

123
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,600
People say even slugs are good at crawling.

124
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360

125
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,350

126
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,830
Japchae. 
  (Korean stir-fried glass noodles)

127
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,820
 Eat slowly or you'll get an upset stomach.

128
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,080
I'm on the night shift. I have to eat quickly and go.

129
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,120
 Yet they pay you so little.

130
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,960
True.

131
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,240
Is today a special day?

132
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,710
 You like japchae.

133
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,170

134
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,050
Mom's birthday!

135
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,140
 It's okay. You can forget things when you're busy.

136
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,840
 How is the application you submitted for transferring to Mucheon City?

137
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,120
I failed.

138
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,180
I need higher grades if I want to be accepted to the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

139
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,810
Problem is there is no work in the countryside.

140
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,320
 It'll be fine

141
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,260
 because you're the best.

142
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,320
You know you'll miss me if I go.

143
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,050
 Twenty-year-old Go Min Ji, who lives in Hwayeong-Gun, Mucheon Metropolitan City, went missing on 24th of last month.

144
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,940
 Contact with Ms. Go was lost on the way home after seeing her friend.

145
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,510
 Police are even using police dogs and a helicopter to search around Ms. Go's school and home.

146
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,850
 But there are no traces of her and she hasn’t been seen on any CCTVs.

147
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,990
 Ms. Go has an average body figure, is 158 centimeters tall, and weighs 47 kilograms.

148
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,220
Is there a hole in the sky? It’s raining buckets!

149
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,110
I'll just do this when the rain stops.

150
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:08,310
Oh! Who threw away something like that there?

151
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,550
Who threw this away here?

152
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,360
Sir! Come to your senses, sir!

153
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,160
Sir!

154
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,840
What did you eat to become like this?

155
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,220
Soo Yeong, don't be scared.

156
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,010
- I’m here. 
 - The screwdriver is here, right here.

157
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,590
It went out again. Work is never done.

158
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,080
Seriously.

159
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,100
Yes, Hongwoon Police Station.

160
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,690
What?

161
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,740
Okay, Ahjussi, I’ll be right there!

162
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,350
Sunbae!

163
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,610
I...

164
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,410
- I have to go to the double bridge road. 
 - Why?

165
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,660
I don’t know. A strange luggage was found.

166
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,880
Ah, this is driving me nuts.

167
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,760
It's not like I can leave him alone here.

168
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,470
Go there first. I’ll call Chief and come over together.

169
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,660
Okay.

170
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,120
Sir!

171
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,300
Hey, don’t touch it and just protect it.

172
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,410
Oh, over here!

173
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,930
- You came alone? 
 - Yes.

174
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,030
Where is the site?

175
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,780
My legs are shaking so...

176
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,520
In the luggage over there, you can see something whitish,

177
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,620
and I have a bad feeling about it.

178
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,180
I’ll go and see.

179
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,810
Oh, right there.

180
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,370
 There are no CCTVs in the vicinity.

181
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,810
 What should I do?

182
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,470
 If I leave it as is, it might float away in the rain.

183
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,330
 It’ll take a while for forensics to get here.

184
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,710
 No can do. I’ll have to go down myself.

185
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,680
Sunbae, it looks like a corpse.

186
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,110
Call backup and come here quickly.

187
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,080
Oh no! Be careful!

188
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,660
Oh!

189
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,680
Are you okay?

190
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,500
Please step away. It's dangerous.

191
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,940
Come here quickly.

192
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,890
Please be careful!

193
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,250
- You can’t come out here.
- Oh my, what happened?

194
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,340
- Please stay back. 
 - Please go further back.

195
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,490
I said be careful!

196
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,990
What happened here?

197
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,290
 Respond, respond. A dead body in a suitcase was found at...

198
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,700
 Sir, you found this, right?

199
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,940
Look at this mess.

200
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,770
It's you again? Don't you know the basics of an investigation?

201
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,220
Why did you touch the suitcase?

202
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,870
I thought it might slip away in the rain.

203
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,890
How dare you make that judgment call?

204
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,070
You should have waited for the forensics team!

205
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,420
I took some photos.

206
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,110
Give me.

207
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,210
What's this?

208
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,530
What’s wrong with this? Huh?

209
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,360
Earlier... I slipped and...

210
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,950
What the... I’ll just...!

211
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,200
- Section Chief. 
 - What?

212
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,890
I think you need to take a look at this.

213
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,230
What the? A mint?

214
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,540
Please stay back.

215
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,150
No pictures, please.

216
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,420
You can’t come close. Please move back!

217
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,430
What happened!

218
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,840
Why are we not wrapping up?

219
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,320
They want the scene preserved since the Metropolitan Investigation Unit is coming down.

220
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,220
Is it perhaps because of that thing? The mint?

221
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,580
Watch your mouth. We're screwed if we get blamed for not preserving the crime scene.

222
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,590
They’re here.

223
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,230
Welcome.

224
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,230
I'm Section Chief Bang from Hwayeong Police Station.

225
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,540
If you enter the site without following official procedure—

226
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,390
Where is the site?

227
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,900
It’s over there.

228
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,780
Why is the Metropolitan Investigation Unit here?

229
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,120
So cool. I want to be like that.

230
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,020
Dream on.  You think just anyone can work at the Metropolitan Investigation Unit?

231
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,120
We’re in the process of identifying the victim.

232
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,330
This was found.

233
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,330
I'm done here.

234
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,020
It seems that it hasn't been long since she was murdered.

235
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,300
The body parts were originally inside the luggage,

236
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,720
but there was a mishap.

237
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,050
Who was the first officer on scene?

238
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,950
Over there.

239
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,140
Stop looking at them. If they see you, it’ll only be a hassle.

240
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,580
Move aside.

241
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,080
Oh! They're coming.

242
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,480
Good work.

243
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,580
- Salute! I'm from Hongwoon Police Station—
- Was it you?

244
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,700
What kind of a punk are you?

245
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,090
Don't you know that the basics of an investigation is to preserve the scene?

246
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,740
Pathetic punk.

247
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,870
Be prepared to write a report when you go back to the station.

248
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,980

249
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,510
So we have a dismembered body in a suitcase,

250
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,240
and we found a mint.

251
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,760
And that bastard who caused a commotion a few years ago did the same thing, right?

252
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,020
Why don't you sit down?

253
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,380
If not, there is no reason for the Metropolitan Investigation Unit to rush down to the countryside like here.

254
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,210
No way it's him, right?

255
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,490
Mint candies are common.

256
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,160
Every restaurant has them as desserts,

257
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,100
and I heard he died five years ago.

258
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,200

259
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,680
What do I write?

260
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,110
The victim's identity?

261
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,100
Yes, we're investigating it right now, but it'll take some time because the fingerprints are too damaged.

262
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,780
Have you done cross validation with

263
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,240
women who were reported missing and emergency reports in the vicinity?

264
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,670
We're currently checking it.

265
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,400
Do we know what weapon was used in the crime?

266
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,320
Any leads to how the suspect arrived at the crime scene?

267
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,140
Not yet.

268
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,310
Please gather all of the CCTV footage within five kilometers of the crime scene starting from last week.

269
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,610
Who will take responsibility for damaging the crime scene and losing evidence?

270
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,590
Well, we had a phone that recorded the scene,

271
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,110
which we ordered to restore the footage—

272
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,560
You're not amateurs...

273
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,540
What? You think you're all that just because you came from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit?

274
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,820
What can anyone do when it was pouring rain at the crime scene?

275
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,100
If it rains, does crime stop?

276
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,290
Preserving the scene as it was left is the most important basic of an investigation.

277
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,850
- Do I have to tell you?
- What?!

278
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,060
Great job.

279
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,410
Hey, you people! Are you trying to get me fired?

280
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,380
What's this? What's this?

281
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,070
Ah, what's going on?

282
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,400
I'm sorry.

283
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,350
This fell there... I'm sorry.

284
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,820
I'm sorry.

285
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,420
But you know, I still remember all of the crime scene.

286
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,740
I think I could explain it to you thoroughly.

287
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,460
Who is she?

288
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,250
Ah, she was the first policewoman to arrive at the scene.

289
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,650
Hey, you're trying to bring up that weird story about how your memory is like this and that, huh?

290
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,870
Let's at least take a listen.

291
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,800
Since we don't have pictures anyway.

292
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,190
There's no need for that. The most important thing is—

293
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,290
Tell me.

294
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,230
Okay. Tell us.

295
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,630
When I arrived at the scene, a plaid pattern suitcase ...

296
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,320
The plaid pattern luggage was...

297
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,740
lying in this direction.

298
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,830
It was slanting down by about 30 degree.

299
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:42,220
I'm not sure if the zipper was broken, but it was open here and there.

300
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,660
The interval was about 25 cm.

301
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:50,200
The victim's hand stuck out with her palm facing the sky.

302
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,480
There was a footprint next to the suitcase.

303
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,080
This footprint was not from hiking shoes, but I think it was from sneakers.

304
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,860
And near the suitcase, there were a piece of vinyl,

305
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,490
a pesticide bottle, a styrofoam, and so on.

306
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,490
Hey, hey!  It was hectic at the scene and it was raining so hard.

307
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,800
Yet you're saying you can remember all of that?

308
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,300
If you are wrong, are you going to take responsibility?

309
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,420
I think the piece of vinyl, pesticide bottle, and styrofoam were garbage that was always there.

310
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,670
- You, really!
- Okay, okay. That's enough.

311
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,410
Leave.

312
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,980
The cellphone was restored.

313
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,830
Is that so? Connect it.

314
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,330
Yes.

315
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,400
The Metropolitan Investigation Unit will take this case.

316
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,630
I'm requesting your cooperation.

317
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,720
 010-499-1243

318
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,180
 It's Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong.

319
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,470
 Tell me.

320
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,680
A mint was found. It's a dismembered body.

321
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,870
Continue.

322
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,890
It was abandoned in a suitcase.

323
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,840
Any witnesses?

324
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,450
None yet.

325
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,020
 It's shocking that dismembered body parts were found near the drainage channels in Hongwoon-myun.

326
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,880
 Police submitted an autopsy request to the National Forensic Services

327
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,220
 in order to find out the victim's identity and the cause of death.

328
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,340
- Stove is running out of oil again.
-  ...with additional details, they are looking for the suspect.

329
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,340
 In addition, there is a possibility that this may be a serial murder.

330
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,830
- I'm back. 
 -  You're here?  Oh right!

331
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,740
The Metropolitan Police Agency called us.

332
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,100
What did they say?

333
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,620
It's a little unclear but they said to send you to Mucheon.

334
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,030
- Send what? 
 - You.

335
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,520
Me?

336
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,100
I spoke well of you to the superiors so prepare your heart.

337
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,720
Why did you say something useless?  Really!

338
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:40,350
But technically, I didn't do anything that bad. Don't you think so, Chief?

339
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,520
The photos of the crime scene were all restored, and I'm the one who took those.

340
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,310
Ah, if the reason why they told me to come is to give me an award...

341
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,030
If they wanted to give you an award, they would have come down themselves.

342
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:57,790
Anyway when you go there this time, just beg for forgiveness no matter what. Got it?

343
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,770
I got it.

344
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,630
Why are you counting all of those?

345
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,230
You're really inefficient.

346
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,880
Geez!  Snap out of it!

347
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,540

348
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,190

349
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,870
Team Leader, we got the murder victim's results from National Forensic Services.

350
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,080
Check the phone call log and investigate those close to her by questioning.

351
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,370
Check all the suspicious or fishy people's alibis.

352
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,600
- Move swiftly. 
 - Yes.

353
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,360
Hey. It's not even enough to delegate our work to other people,

354
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,070
so why did she drag this one in here all the way from the countryside?

355
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,750
- How would I know that? 
 - You're close to Team Leader Hwang.

356
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,240
There's no such thing.

357
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,440
Wow, you punk.

358
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,200
An innocent mint brought an absurd amount of work to us.

359
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,140
Didn't that bastard die? At the three-way intersection case.

360
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,070
He did as per an official announcement.

361
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,250
An official announcement?

362
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:15,180
DNA confirmation on his body failed.

363
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,040
In the end, it is an assumption.

364
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,020
No way.

365
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,410
Hey, that "no way" is holding us right now.

366
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,300
So I can't even go home.

367
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,960
I'm jealous of you.  Jealous of you.

368
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,880

369
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,820

370
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,250

371
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,800

372
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,550

373
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:08,330
Geez!  Do you think being a policeman means you can do anything?

374
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,870
Hey, hey.  Be quiet.  Get in there.

375
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,040
Be quiet!

376
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,690
- Get inside. 
 - Geez.

377
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,150

378
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,810

379
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,020
Sorry.

380
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,740

381
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,520
Tell me the truth!

382
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,650
Where did you do your eyebrow tattoo?

383
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,900
Get it removed. It looks weird.

384
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,120
Tell me everything!

385
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,140
Won’t you tell?

386
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,670
Come here.  Come here.

387
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,050
What brings you here?

388
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,970
Excuse me, the Metropolitan Investigation Unit team 1...

389
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,300
Take a seat over there.

390
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,080
Seriously!

391
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,890
- You have to tell us. 
 - Be quiet!

392
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,360
Do you want to feel how it is?

393
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,160
- Ah, really! 
 -  So who took that?

394
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,790
Hey!  I'm a detective, you bastard!  Who are you trying to defraud?

395
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,280
Ah, he hung up on me. Bastard.

396
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,410
Let's do it fast.  Date of birth, name, address, and job?

397
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,230
Me?

398
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,110
Excuse me, today's my first day here...

399
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,800
I know.   Just answer the questions.

400
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,350
December 8th, 1992.  Name is Cha Soo Yeong.

401
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:01,190
Mucheon Metropolis, Hwayeong-gun, Hongwoon-myeon.

402
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,420
I'm also a policewoman. Today...

403
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,700
So what, Customer?

404
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,530
You'll receive a criminal penalty.

405
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,330
- What do you need? 
 - ID.

406
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,550
Here.

407
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,270
Hyung-nim, look at this.

408
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,090
- Oh, it was made very well. 
 - It's exactly the same. The same.

409
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,760
Gosh, seriously!

410
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,510
Geez, I know everything. How you impersonated a police officer and committed fraud.

411
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,520
How dare you come to the police station and pretend that you're a policewoman?

412
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,980
Uh... I...

413
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,280
What are you doing there?

414
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,870
Someone told me to take a seat here.

415
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,460
Come in.

416
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,470
Okay.

417
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,790
You two know each other?

418
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,730
Yes.

419
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,700
Then, you're really a policewoman?

420
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,420
Yes.

421
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,780
Is she a blockhead?

422
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,080
Policewoman Cha Soo Yeong.

423
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,920
I did wrong.  I shouldn't have done that at the time.

424
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,180
I can't get fired.  My father is old—

425
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,550
Is your memory always this good or is it that you are great at observing?

426
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,090
When you caught a pickpocket in high school, you also re-enacted the scene in great detail.

427
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:40,730
Ah, that... It's not that I remember everything.

428
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,020
About that... well just, under certain conditions,

429
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,990
I can remember everything of a certain moment as though it stops with a click.

430
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,880
A click? Is it something like a photographic memory?

431
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,800
Yes. A neuropsychiatrist said a similar story.

432
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,500
What are certain conditions?

433
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,910
Just when I'm nervous.

434
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,570
Or when I'm in a very unfamiliar environment,

435
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,120
or if I hear some sounds that get on my nerves,

436
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,880
then my body tenses up and I remember everything.

437
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,760
Follow me.

438
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,400
Where...

439
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Team Leader, we got the victim Go Min Ji's phone records analysis results.

440
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,340
Before her phone was turned off, there were three calls with a man.

441
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,450
We're checking on the locations of the calls.

442
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,830
As soon as you track the locations, give me a call.

443
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,610
Okay.

444
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:01,040
Excuse me...  May I ask you where we're going?

445
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,930
To meet someone.

446
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,480
Who is it?

447
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,440
All you have to do is tell the person what you saw like the last time.

448
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,240
Who is that person?

449
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,370
A person whom you shouldn't tell anybody that you met.

450
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,830
We're here. You can get out.

451
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,710
You're not coming with me?

452
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,520
It's on the third floor. Go on.

453
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,470
You had applied for the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.  You'd better speak well when you get there.

454
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,450
It may be possible for you to transfer to the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

455
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,050
Is anybody there?

456
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,460
Is anybody there?

457
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,850
I'm Cha Soo Yeong.

458
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,890
 Don't move and stay still.

459
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,190
I'm sorry.  I thought nobody was here...

460
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,940
 Cha Soo Yeong you said?

461
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,510
Yes.

462
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,450
Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong told me to come here.

463
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,160
 I know.  I asked her to make you come here.

464
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,890
 Your height is 170 cm and your weight is a little over 50 kg.

465
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,830
 You have scoliosis.

466
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,780
 I think you usually wear sneakers.

467
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,680
 You barely have experience wearing high heels.

468
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,310
 Your left leg is 1 cm longer than your right leg.

469
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,990
 I can get it by hearing your footsteps.

470
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,350
 By the sounds of your clothes brushing against each other, they are cheap, cotton ones.

471
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,900
 Your voice doesn't have confidence.

472
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,830
 So you don't know when to put a period in your sentences.

473
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,860
What?

474
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,390
Now, tell me what you saw.

475
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,150
What I saw?

476
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,480
 Everything that you saw after you got off the car until now.

477
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,330
 It looks like you're slow to understand the situation.

478
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:29,410
 I'll ask questions one by one as utmost courtesy to you.

479
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,910
Description of the  guard at the entrance?

480
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,930
He is in his late fifties and his height is about 170 cm.

481
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,200
His family are his wife and a son.

482
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,460
Tomorrow’s date was circled on the calendar.

483
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,070
He wears a marine ring.

484
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,220
He has a habit of biting his nails.

485
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,840
 How many lights are there on the third floor?

486
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,590
Seven.

487
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:10,160
Wrong. There are nine.

488
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,110
Two were turned off.

489
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,150
Is that so?  Good.

490
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,470
 The scene in Hongwoon... Tell me exactly as you saw it.

491
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:28,540
 Ah, not what you already told the fools at the office but something else.

492
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,060
Something else?

493
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,930
Yes.

494
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,320
Bystanders.  Right, it'd be better to begin from there.

495
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,710
Among the bystanders, it's true there was a strange guy.

496
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,470
He was holding something like a dog leash.

497
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:56,410
 He was holding something like a dog leash?  Was he a villager?

498
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,950
No, he was not a villager.

499
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,010
It was the first time that I saw him.

500
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,600
How about his height?

501
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:08,170
About 190 cm? He was wearing a black jacket.

502
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,830
Any other special features?

503
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,950
There was nothing special.

504
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:43,920
Hey, look. One's memory...

505
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,370
Have you ever considered how reliable one's memory is?

506
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,650
Memories are subjective.

507
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:53,720
At one's convenience, they are edited and distorted.

508
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,970
As for you, you have the essentials.

509
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:02,720
But you have hyperthymesia, remembering the useless surroundings.

510
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,500
It's a kind of obsessive compulsive disorder.

511
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:11,070
Probably... You must've been traumatized by being abandoned when you were a kid.

512
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,510
Because you're insecure.

513
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,610
You must have a story,

514
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,250
but everybody thinks their stories are the most tragic ones in the world.

515
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,830
When in actuality,

516
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,840
they are nothing.

517
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,360
What do you know about me that you speak like this?

518
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:33,380
It's not what I know but a fact.

519
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,040
Then shall I evaluate you properly from now?

520
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,310
You have a low self-esteem and a weak will...

521
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,530
You've probably never dated either, right?

522
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,690
I think a policewoman in the countryside is the most suitable job for you,

523
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,080
but you didn't want to remain in the countryside.

524
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,370
So you must've used some other way.

525
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:01,400
Of course, it didn't work out well.

526
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,210
Aren't you too rude to a person whom you met for the first time?

527
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:07,110
If this is how you want to do it, then I have a lot to say, too.

528
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,040
Go ahead.

529
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,210
You're arrogant, rude, and supercilious.

530
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,670
You must not have any friends, lover, or family due to that kind of character.

531
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,220
In the end, I think there is a high possibility that you will live here without anybody.

532
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,800
What I just said...

533
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,870
I do mean it but...

534
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,160
Leave.

535
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,030
You've done what you were supposed to do.

536
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,840
I don't think there will be any more business between us.

537
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,700
Transferring? My butt.

538
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,850
It's all over.

539
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,750
Team Leader!  We found the primary suspect!

540
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,200
I think the person who contacted the victim Go Min Ji is the suspect.

541
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,250
His name is Kang Seung Hwan and his residence is Yeon Seo Apartment 7145.

542
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,280
Yes, I'll send you the location.  Yes.

543
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,430
- Hey, how about the local police station? 
 - I contacted them.

544
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,340
- Hyung-nim, where are you going? 
 - Hey, we found the suspect.

545
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,450
- I'll call you.  Please back up. 
 - What?

546
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,410
Step on it!

547
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,140
Delivery!

548
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,970
Is anybody there?

549
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,980
Delivery! Is anybody there?

550
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,980
I think anyone is here.

551
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,560
He already sensed it and ran away?

552
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,880
Team Leader.

553
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,010
Psycho bastard.

554
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,970

555
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,510

556
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,630

557
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,700
How can I help you?

558
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:57,580
Oh, it seems everybody went somewhere else, right?

559
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:02,110
This place is the Metropolitan Investigation Unit that is in charge of a serial murder case, isn't it?

560
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,480
Yes, but what business are you here for?

561
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,630
I came to turn myself in.

562
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,200
- Turn yourself in? 
 - Yes.

563
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,670
You're looking for Go Min Ji's murderer.

564
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,870
What is this?

565
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:31,030
I'm the very murderer who killed Go Min Ji.

566
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,010
The mint serial killer.

567
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,620
Put your hands up, you bastard.

568
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,540
Put your hands up!

569
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,000
 The suspect of the dismembered body murder case in Hongwoon-myeon turned himself in this afternoon.

570
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,850
 While the police are investigating if he is related to the unsolved cases of south Mucheon City,

571
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,670
 they are focusing on finding out if he has additional  crimes.

572
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,330
 The identity of the dismembered body murderer in Hongwoon-myeon has been revealed.

573
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:11,120
 The murderer who killed a woman in her 20's, dismembered her body, and abandoned it at the drainage channels in the rice fields

574
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,300
 is Kang Seung Hwan, 41 years old.

575
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:19,030
 Police held an open identity information committee meeting with external experts like psychiatrists, lawyers, etc.

576
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,770
 They decided to reveal the suspect's identity for the public's right to know.

577
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,580
- That dog leash man...
-  ...the way he premeditated the murder and brutally dismembered the corpse,

578
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:31,970
 ...the way he premeditated the murder and brutally dismembered the corpse,

579
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,420
 and considering he admitted his crime and there was a lot of evidence,

580
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,680
 they decided to reveal his identity to the public.

581
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:42,110
Kang Seung Hwan is 41 years old and he has no family.

582
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,070
He used to be famous as an installation artist for a time after graduating from a college of fine arts.

583
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,970
But after a plagiarism controversy, he disappeared.

584
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:49,460
He has no criminal record

585
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,160
and he confessed all of the details in how he carried out the murder and how he abandoned the body of Go Min Ji.

586
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,380
There might be more victims. We have to find them quickly.

587
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,590
We are comparing the pictures we found in his house

588
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:02,450
with the reported missing people right now.

589
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:06,880
By the way, he keeps insisting he is the bastard who died five years ago.

590
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:07,820
Is he really that bastard?

591
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,650
Does that make any sense?

592
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:13,130
Detectives should not be swayed by psychos.

593
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,840
Dig into it more.

594
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,080
Who knows if he is related to that bastard somehow?

595
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,360
  Kang Seung Hwan is claiming that he’s the mint serial killer

596
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,940
 who made headlines worldwide five years ago.

597
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,160
 Is it true?

598
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,770
 It makes no sense at all.

599
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,550
 The real culprit died in an explosion incident five years ago.

600
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,650
  The police investigation came to the same conclusion as well.

601
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:00,540
Take your time eating, just don't be a slowpoke about it.  We have to get back on duty.

602
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,310
Chief, you said you were there on scene during that explosion, right?

603
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,120
You have no idea. It was so chaotic back then.

604
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,800
The truck exploded at the Joonggeon three-way intersection,

605
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,690
so everything burned to a crisp.

606
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,710
There was nothing left after the explosion.

607
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:18,210
That mint serial killer or whatever also died in the explosion.

608
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,730
I was there when it happened.

609
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:23,010
But why are you asking about that all of a sudden?

610
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,990
Because this is a copycat case?

611
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:30,050
No... just because. It's kind of weird.

612
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,540
You find random things weird.

613
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,560
Oh wait. What was that guy's name?

614
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:43,140
Oh something. That profiler's fiancée died.

615
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,570
Oh right! Oh Hyeon Jae! It was him.

616
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,040
Profiler Oh Hyeon Jae?

617
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,800
I heard that guy suffered severe injuries.

618
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,250
He completely disappeared. They say he committed suicide or emigrated.

619
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,600
There are a lot of rumors.

620
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:04,750
Mint. Metropolitan Investigation Unit. Team Leader Hwang.

621
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,320
 That has to be done anyway so reporting a culprit...

622
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,270
That wheelchair...

623
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,130
You scared me!

624
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:16,650
Chief, I have to go somewhere for a second.

625
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,730
- Hey! 
 - I need to take the rest of the day off.

626
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,080
Hey! Hey!

627
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,760

628
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,980
  The best criminal psychological analyst

629
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,900
  with the highest arrest rate of 97%,

630
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,770
 genius profiler, Detective Oh Hyeon Jae.

631
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:40,420
  A serial murderer who killed 11 times,

632
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:45,370
  called “That Bastard”, what is the reason he leaves behind mint in the dead bodies?

633
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,040
Wow. The person I met really was Oh Hyeon Jae.

634
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:55,830
 We have Detective Oh Hyeon Jae here, the criminal profiler at the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

635
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,460
 Detective Oh Hyeon Jae, I'll ask a question point-blank.

636
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,880
 Is there a pattern to how that bastard selects a victim?

637
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:10,250
 Perhaps, that bastard might force victims to tell  him whom they wanted to kill.

638
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:15,130
 Victims who were facing deadly horror would open their mouth unintentionally.

639
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,600
 Friends who looked down on them,

640
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,540
 store owners at subway stations who picked a fight with them,

641
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:27,440
 and their mother's boyfriends who abused them when they were kids.

642
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,730

643
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:33,540
 The moment those names slipped out from their mouths, those names' owners would disappear.

644
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,570
 The culprit used mints as his signature, right?

645
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:40,480
 If your hypothesis is correct, Detective Oh Hyeon Jae,

646
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,830
 how would the culprit ask the victims?

647
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:03,450
 Look, tell me one person whom you want to kill.

648
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:13,110
 That is the last thing you must do in this world before you die.

649
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,030
 We spent time with the genius profiler Oh Hyeon Jae, who is currently at the peak of his popularity,

650
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:20,460
 to get to know the serial killer, "that bastard."

651
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,880
 Thank you, Detective Oh Hyeon Jae.

652
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,220
 Thank you.

653
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,360

654
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,370
I waited a long time for you.

655
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,750
I was getting bored to death,

656
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:44,910
Metropolitan Investigation Unit's ace, Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong.

657
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:47,670
Why did you kill Go Min Ji?

658
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:55,420
I told you. I'm that bastard.

659
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,580
 Do I need a reason to kill multiple people?

660
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,980
You're just a copycat who wants attention.

661
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:09,830
You'll regret it if you keep doing this.

662
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,630
That bastard died.

663
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,110
Stop kidding around.

664
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:23,900
 That's what you're insisting.

665
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,710
Why did you turn yourself in?

666
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:37,210
Suddenly... my conscience suddenly felt a huge sense of guilt.

667
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:41,350
Victims' voices won't disappear from here.

668
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:45,760
"Save me. Please."

669
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,800
"Please! It hurts!"

670
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:58,330
Because you didn't come to arrest me, I was bored and came.

671
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,900
There is another victim besides Go Min Ji, right?

672
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:20,550
I'm not sure.  Is there?

673
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,070
 Or is there not?

674
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:40,860
Didn't you hear you should hand the suspect over to the prosecutor?  Are you refusing to take an order?

675
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,510
We can't hand him over to the Prosecution yet.

676
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:45,990
The reason?

677
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,190
I'm looking for it.

678
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:52,000
We got all the evidence and a confession. What else do we need?

679
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,780
Is it because that psycho said he was that bastard?

680
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,990
I think he is hiding something.

681
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,660
You don't need to borrow trouble.

682
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,330
It's not that I don't know how you feel.  But let's consider our organization a bit, too.

683
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:09,910
Don't cause trouble for multiple people by going off on your own like you did five years ago.

684
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,500
 Why did he ask to see me?

685
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,560
 He was probably trying to test me.

686
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,710
 I have to find something.

687
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:34,930
 There must be something I missed at the scene on the day.

688
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,210
 Perhaps...

689
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,630
 There was a taxi.

690
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,320
What did you think?

691
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,130
He is too amateur to be that bastard.

692
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:21,330
How was the policewoman you met a few days ago?

693
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:28,010
I don't think she will be much help.  She is too emotional.

694
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:30,120
I'll get going.

695
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,740
I am not sure

696
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:40,820
why you are so obsessed with that bastard.

697
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,290
I have a debt to settle with that bastard too.

698
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:53,200
Yes, Chief. What do you mean "that bastard"?

699
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,390

700
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:58,800
We'll wrap up smoothly.  You know me, don't you?

701
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,990

702
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,910
Come in.

703
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:17,570
Your feedback is slow these days.

704
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,730
Because I'm busy in the field.

705
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:24,780
You, punk.  You have almost fully become Team Leader Hwang's boy.

706
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:29,210
Do you want to go through a highway or go around through a local way?

707
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:33,110
I'm just saying it because I'm worried about your future, you punk.

708
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,810
Yes.

709
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,730
Public opinions are not good.

710
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:42,900
People above keep pressuring us to finish up the case quickly.

711
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,490
Is there anything unusual in Team Leader Hwang?

712
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:46,840
No.

713
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,690
You may leave.

714
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,820
Ji Min.

715
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,570
Keep in mind.

716
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:00,050
The organization always comes first.

717
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,730
Loyalty is basic.

718
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,310
Yes.

719
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:16,500

720
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:37,720
 I came to see Detective Oh Hyeon Jae.

721
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:51,910
 I'm Policewoman Cha Soo Yeong who was here a few days ago.

722
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:55,510
 I have something that I must tell Detective Oh.

723
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,980
Detective, you were right.

724
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,020
 About how Kang Seung Hwan is not related to that bastard.

725
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,520
 So I understand very well that I became useless.

726
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,970
But... I couldn't remember this at the time,

727
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,810
but there was someone else at the scene.

728
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,100
 There was a taxi.

729
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:25,100
 But no one got out and it was parked there for a while.

730
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:32,660
I just... I came because I thought you should know.

731
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:25,880

732
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:30,340

733
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,640

734
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,720
 Stop right there!

735
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,150
 That bastard officially died.

736
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,520
 But you don't believe it.

737
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,500
  Send Kang Seung Hwan to the Prosecution by today.

738
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,360
 There is a possibility that there is a victim who is alive.

739
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,080
 We have to connect the pieces and dig into him more.

740
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,470
 Just hand him over along with that situation!

741
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:06,390
 If the missing person ends up dying when we are involved like this,  we'll be blamed for everything.

742
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,330
 Is being blamed for all of it a problem when someone's life is at risk?

743
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,860
 The radio signal is cut off. What should we do?

744
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,810
 Tell me what you saw.

745
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:17,310
 I'll be the one to decide.
