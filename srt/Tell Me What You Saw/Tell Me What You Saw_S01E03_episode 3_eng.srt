1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,420

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,810

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,150

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,130

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,440

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,310

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,330

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,080

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,330
 So we have a dismembered body in a suitcase,

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,530
 and we found a mint.

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,970
 And that bastard who caused a commotion a few years ago did the same thing, right?

12
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,550
 - Isu! 
 - Oh Hyeon Jae! Hurry up and get out of there!

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,910
 Isu!

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,250
 Is your memory always this good or is it that you are great at observing?

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,040
 I can remember everything of a certain moment as though it stops with a click.

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,180
 - A click? Is it something like a photographic memory?
 - Yes.

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,540
 To meet someone.

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,040
 All you have to do is tell the person what you saw like the last time.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,700
 The scene in Heungwoon... Tell me exactly as you saw it.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,680
 Among the bystanders, there was a man who was holding something like a dog leash.

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,880
 It was the first time that I saw him.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,110
 I came to turn myself in.

23
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,170
 I'm the very murderer who killed Go Min Ji.

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,140
 The mint serial killer.

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,940
 It seems it was stained very recently,  about 48 hours ago.

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,060
 You're saying it is possible that she is alive.

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,200
 Where is she, you bastard?

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,630
 She must be somewhere.

29
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,990
 I thought over and over about why you called me.

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,300
 It's because of that bastard, right?

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,210
 You wanted to know if that bastard came back to life.

32
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,290
 It's for backup.

33
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,350
 Please let me work at the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

34
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,520
 I am sure there will be times when I can be of help to you, Detective.

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,840
 But do you have that kind of a talent?

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,550
 From now on, follow my orders.

37
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,290
 Detective Oh Hyeon Jae?

38
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,140
 Go where there are no spiderwebs.

39
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,600
 Follow the vibration.

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,380
 It should be connected to above.

41
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,590
 Now find the door.

42
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,360
 It opened.

43
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,390
 There are so many corpses.

44
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,540
 Get out. It’ll collapse soon.

45
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,110
 What if the victim is alive?

46
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,990
 What if the victim is alive?

47
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,570
 You’ll be okay now. We’ll get out.

48
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,480
 - Thank you. 
 - You'll be okay.

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,920
 Why do you want to join the Metropolitan Investigation Unit?

50
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,500
 I also...

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,900
 have someone I must catch.

52
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,040
 Excuse me, is that bastard alive?

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,850
 I will only say things based on the facts.

54
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,740
 He is officially dead due to the explosion

55
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,090
 that occurred at the Joonggeon three-way intersection five years ago.

56
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,740
 Do you think he's alive?

57
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,240
 If he's alive, then he'll show up.

58
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,440
 It's up to him, after all.

59
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,970

60
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:20,380

61
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,240
No...

62
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,150
Who are you?

63
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,550
Save me!

64
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,140
Team Leader!

65
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,180
This is driving me insane!

66
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,080
How could this happen right now at a police station?

67
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,550
What about the file?

68
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,070
He took the hard disk.

69
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,910
Obtain CCTV recordings from all entrances and hallways.

70
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,130
And Detective Jang, check everyone who went in and out of the police station.

71
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,700
- Yes, I understand. 
 - What did you do, you asshole?

72
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,850
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,580
I'll contact the cybercrime response team as soon as possible and ask them for the CCTV video analysis.

74
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,810
Team Leader, could it be that bastard?

75
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,500
Don't you have any sense?

76
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,320
Well, you know, a mint was found.

77
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,900
Does that make any sense? How can a dead person... how does that make sense?

78
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,140

79
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,390
What's going on? How are you managing things that a suspect dies at the police station?

80
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,340
What are you going to do?! How are you going to deal with this?!

81
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,390
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,100
Do you think this is something that an apology will take care of?

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,660
Who's this?

84
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,290
I am Policewoman Cha Soo Yeong from the Hongwoon Police Station.

85
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,500
Ah, you...

86
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,360
She was the first person on the scene for Kang Seung Hwan's case.

87
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,920
She's been dispatched temporarily.

88
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,240
What a good job you're doing!

89
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,750
Discipline and hierarchy are totally out of control.

90
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,530
All of you, write the incident reports and submit them!

91
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,110
We'll write them after solving the case.

92
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,650
What?

93
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,020
Hey, Team Leader Hwang—

94
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,300
Yes?

95
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,500
Yes, I understand.

96
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,520
Ah, it hurts! It hurts!

97
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,560
Hyung-nim, w-wait a minute. Wait.

98
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,360

99
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,990

100
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,190
Yes.

101
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,620
Yes, Commissioner.

102
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,320
Of course. I will take care of this quickly.

103
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,170
Yes.

104
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,420
Any suspects?

105
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,930
I don't really know yet.

106
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,810
I think it was done by someone who knows the police from the inside.

107
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,520
So you mean the culprit is a police insider?

108
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,150
We'll find out once we investigate.

109
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,460
I heard a mint or something was found.

110
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,560
Yes.

111
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,710
It's not true, right?

112
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,610
You don’t believe that, do you?

113
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,630
That bastard died five years ago.

114
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,120
You verified it too.

115
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,990
Did I have any authority?

116
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,130
You verified it back then, didn't you, Deputy Commissioner?

117
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,670
I was sure it was the bastard.

118
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,380
By the way, it's so obvious that Team Leader Hwang is going to dig around here and there.

119
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,460
What should I do?

120
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,540
Should I have sent her to a different department earlier on?

121
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,840
It's best to keep more dangerous enemies closer.

122
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,130
I'll take care of directing traffic.

123
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,720
How about the reporters?  If they find out about this, they'll go wild.

124
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,720
Well... a crisis can become an opportunity.

125
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,960
Do you have a plan in mind?

126
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:38,050
Even if we give our flesh, we should keep our bones.

127
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,320

128
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,860
They said they are behind schedule on their autopsies so we have to wait.

129
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,380
Tell them to make other teams wait.

130
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,470
Yes.

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,100
Is that so?

132
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,250
Okay, I understand.

133
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,270
Catch the culprit before Team Leader Hwang does no matter what it takes!

134
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,450
Yes.

135
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,660
Even if you are in such a rush,

136
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,510
 does it make sense to ask me for an autopsy of someone who just died?

137
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,640
The cause of death?

138
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,800
His carotid arteries were cut off.

139
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,520
 It is a very clean cut.

140
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,360
With a thin and sharp string.

141
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,900
Either a fishing line or a piano wire.

142
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,980
 It looks like he applied uniform force on him once.

143
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,390
But it's weird. It's quite fascinating.

144
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,320
What is?

145
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,100
No resistance. There’s no sign of fighting back.

146
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,100
If someone strangles your neck, you instinctively resist, but there’s nothing of the kind.

147
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,070
He was overpowered. Psychologically.

148
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,950
- And the weapon? 
 - A fishing line or something like it.

149
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,780
He would have been wearing gloves.

150
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,310
 This is not an ordinary man.

151
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,030
It’s not possible to overpower a 120 kg man in one go without getting any resistance.

152
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,240
Was he overtaken by extreme fear?

153
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,330
And the mint?

154
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,940
We’ll know after a thorough analysis, but it’s such a mass produced item.

155
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,400
The mint is a message,

156
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,000
and Kang Seung Hwan is the messenger.

157
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,890
A message sent to someone.

158
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,310

159
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,470
What happened?

160
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,410
I don't know.  Earlier, the forensic team was coming out of the interrogation room.

161
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,270
Forensic team?

162
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,640
Oh! The superintendent is here.

163
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,350
Thank you for your hard work late into the night.

164
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,550
I'll start the briefing now.

165
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,150
Today, at around 2:27 PM,

166
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:25,310
the suspect Kang Seung Hwan, who was under investigation on suspicion of 5 serial killings,

167
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,070
died inside the interrogation room.

168
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,320
- What? 
 - Did he die?

169
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,630
- Wow. 
 - They said he died.

170
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,260
Was it murder or suicide?

171
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,470
We are still in the middle of the investigation.

172
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,450
Did he possibly receive cruel treatment?

173
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,170
We are investigating with that in mind.

174
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,960
What was the cause of death?

175
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,030
We are still in the middle of investigating, but what is certain is that

176
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,080
there was a mint in the victim's mouth.

177
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,640
- A mint? 
 - Is it a copycat crime?

178
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,390
Yes. It is definitely a copycat crime.

179
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,800
Is it possible that bastard is alive?

180
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,560
No.

181
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,780
We're revealing this to prevent the unnecessary suspicion and absurd rumors from spreading.

182
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,010
We'll do our best to catch the culprit as soon as possible

183
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:16,480
to reform ourselves into a trustworthy police force.

184
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,050
Please tell us about the next steps you will take in this investigation.

185
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,490
How long will it take?

186
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,120
It is certain that it is copycat crime, right?

187
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,630
Was there any more information regarding...

188
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,560
 Today, at around 2:27 PM, serial killer Kang Seung Hwan

189
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,810
  died inside the police station which has brought shock.

190
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:42,030
 A mint was found on his body which increased curiosity about the investigation.

191
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,920

192
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,260
 It's Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong.

193
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,840
Speak.

194
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,820
What do you think?

195
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,700
Well...

196
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,170
Is it really that bastard?

197
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,490
It's not his style to make a scene.

198
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,930
When serial killers take a break from killing,

199
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,180
they change their method of killing.

200
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,030
We’ll know for sure when we find the true culprit who killed Kang Seung Hwan.

201
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,730
We have to catch him before Chief Choi does.

202
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,450
I'll have to look into Kang Seung Hwan's case again.

203
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,800
I filled the fridge, so don't skip your meals.

204
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,560
And take this 30 minutes after you eat, not before you eat.

205
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,980

(Used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms, and seizures.)

206
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,760

207
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,780
If you're tired, take a break and do it later.

208
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,570
No, I'm okay.

209
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,560

210
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,300
 Thank you.

211
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,010
What is it? Is there something weird?

212
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,880
No.

213
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,550
Let's stop here for today.

214
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,160
Okay.

215
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,170

216
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,500

217
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,300
It's been a while, Lieutenant Hwang.

218
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,350
Aren't you being too cold?

219
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,690
After all, we used to be on the same team.

220
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,910
Being on the same team doesn't mean every team member is special.

221
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,730
But I thought I was special. I'm not?

222
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,300
Well, I have to go.

223
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,800
There is no news on Detective Oh Hyeon Jae?

224
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,410
Just call it camaraderie or what have you.

225
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,950
Tell him to call if he is going through a hard time.

226
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,920
I can help him get on a show.

227
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,810
He must at least be able to talk, right?

228
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,300
Why do you keep thinking about Oh Hyeon Jae?

229
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,800
You must have had a lot of affection for him.

230
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,650
You're not his rival, but you think you are.

231
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,190
That’s pitiful.

232
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,570
You're obsessed.

233
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,750
See you later. I think I'll be seeing you often from now on.

234
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,630
Hyung-nim, isn't that Profiler Na Joon Seok?

235
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,510
The two of them were on the same team, but they weren't close?

236
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:32,010
When he was at the Metropolitan Investigation Unit, he once got thoroughly embarrassed because of Oh Hyeon Jae.

237
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,380
He accused an innocent person as the criminal and caused him to commit suicide.

238
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,640
Did he hear me?

239
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,800
Dad, what's wrong?

240
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,520
 I didn't hear from you for a while.

241
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,050
Sorry, Dad. I'm working right now.

242
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,340
 Hey, no matter how busy you are, you should still contact your father.

243
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,580
The whole village is worried about your father.

244
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,440
 Sunbae, take care of him well for me.

245
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,380
Wow, her shamelessness is through the roof.

246
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,250
Why else do you think I'm here now?

247
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,250
 Since you’re busy, hurry up and hang up. Go back to work.

248
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,960
Bye.

249
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,930
Hey!

250
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,380
Pretending to be so busy! That kid.

251
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,650
Moong Chi, come here.

252
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,730
Moong Chi! Moong Chi, come here.

253
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,840
- So beautiful. 
 - Moong Chi.

254
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,150
It's great that Moong Chi is so friendly.

255
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,760
Moong Chi, let's go.

256
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,740
It's okay.

257
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,490
But it looks like Moong Chi is sick.

258
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,600
He was fine a minute ago. What could be wrong?

259
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,870
Moong Chi, are you okay?

260
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,440
Do you mind if I take a look?

261
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,490
I'm a veterinarian.

262
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,720
Ah, okay.

263
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,940
Aigoo, Moong Chi.

264
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,810
Attention, everyone.

265
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,600
Now we'll start the meeting for the entire Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

266
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,870
- Let's begin. 
 - Okay.

267
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,710
 While focusing on those around or those who have something against Kang Seung Hwan,

268
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,550
I’ve narrowed the list down to criminals with a history of using fishing items.

269
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,600
There are seven in total.

270
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,010
The culprit is definitely among them.

271
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,270
But what we must remember is that there is no perfect murder.

272
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,740
There is only imperfect investigation.

273
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,680
The result of an imperfect investigation will bring about another—

274
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,500
Kang Seung Hwan was delusional and tended to be anti-social.

275
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,170
He is an impulsive and unpredictable type that is hard to control.

276
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,010
But... he planned the crime by himself?

277
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,800
Assess their whereabouts and report if you find anything suspicious.

278
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,680
 Come to the hideout. There's something I want to hear.

279
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,570
All right, you all heard that, right?

280
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,370
Metropolitan Investigation Unit Team 2, start questioning the specific suspects right now.

281
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,670
Team 1 will stay at the station and support.  That's all.

282
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,470
Chief, how can you do this? This is our case.

283
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,500
The suspect you were interrogating is dead.

284
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,000
You're also suspects.

285
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,010
Suspects?

286
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,160
Aren’t you going overboard when we’re family?

287
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,480
Because we are, I only went this far.

288
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,220
Consider yourself lucky you haven’t been suspended.

289
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,900
Did you stake claims to the case or something?

290
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,400
Since when is there yours or mine?

291
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,830
That's why you should have guarded the suspect well in the first place.

292
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,430
Damn, you little—

293
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,010
Team Leader, are you going to let them disrespect us like that?

294
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,780
Enough. I don’t think it’s your place to say that.

295
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,950
The only thing that motivates us to endure is our pride! This is absolutely unfair!

296
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,720
We don't do investigations with pride.

297
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,930
Let's catch him first.

298
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,540
Okay, okay. Good job enduring it.

299
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,470
Please rub him a lot.

300
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,120
- You must've been very surprised. 
 - Yes.

301
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,530
First, admit him for today and come back again a little bit later.

302
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,890
Thank you. We were very lucky.

303
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,280
Maybe because Moong Chi is like his owner, he endures it well.

304
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,390
And don't worry about today's veterinarian fees.

305
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,450
Thank you.

306
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,390
By the way, it looks like you also take photos?

307
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,450
Ah, it's a hobby.

308
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,000
When you come back later, I'll take a photo for you to celebrate Moong Chi getting discharged.

309
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,780
- Really? 
 - Yes.

310
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,070
Thank you.

311
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,370
Moong Chi, I'll be back later.

312
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,160
- Bye. 
 - Bye, see you later.

313
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,330
I'll finish up.  You may leave from work first.

314
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,800
Okay, I'll get going.

315
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,770
Okay, good job today.

316
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,900
Here, let's go there.

317
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,050

318
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,060
Is anyone there?

319
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,890
Doctor, I'm here for Moong Chi.

320
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,040
Doctor?

321
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,150
You came early.

322
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,810
Ah yes. Doctor, where's my Moong Chi?

323
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:14,420
Ah, he suddenly got into a worse condition, so he's in the treatment room.

324
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,210
Is Moong Chi really sick?

325
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,260
I thought he would get better but his condition is not good.

326
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,390
First, let's go to the room. Given his condition, I think I need to explain it.

327
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,530
- Okay. 
 - Let's go in.

328
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,380
- What is it? 
 - Huh?

329
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,370
What is it?

330
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,330
No, it's...

331
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,300
No, it's just...

332
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,220
- Doctor, it's just... 
 - What?

333
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,650
Help me! Help me!

334
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,430

335
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,790

336
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,930
Hey, are you still looking at the call list?

337
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,480
Yes, there are a lot of calls.

338
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,910
- Give me a towel. 
 - Okay.

339
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,990
Did you find anything?

340
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,680
Not yet.

341
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,620
Is there anyone?  Help me.

342
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,560
Help me.

343
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,630
Ah gosh.  We're going to get caught.

344
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,340
Ah, what should I do?

345
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,710
This is no fun. Ah, seriously.

346
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,530
Ah, blood!

347
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,770
Ah, really.  How far will you go?

348
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,300
Huh?  You really!

349
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,410
Hey!

350
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,720
Are you dead? That's no fun.

351
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,700
It's Cha Soo Yeong.

352
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,500
Are you here?

353
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,220

354
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,770
You're here sooner than I expected.

355
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,160
Just think of it as a very peculiar hobby of a peculiar person.

356
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,200
You were waiting. For the bastard to show up.

357
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,470
I thought about it, and I think Kang Seung Hwan has an accomplice.

358
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,440
Accomplice?

359
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,970
Then do you think the person who killed Kang Soo Hwan was his accomplice?

360
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,890
If the accomplice went to the police station that day,

361
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,790
he was probably curious about the investigation's progress.

362
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:16,050
Do you remember anything, particularly the people who passed by you?

363
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,210
I can’t recall everything that I see.

364
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,170
Before, you said you could remember every sight you saw

365
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:30,120
when you were very nervous or were in an unfamiliar environment, didn't you?

366
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,510
Yes.

367
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,540
By chance...

368
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,940
You already have the stored images in your brain.

369
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,560
But is there a case that you don't realize it?

370
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,740
Speaking honestly, I've never thought about it.

371
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,390
What do you think?

372
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,440
You want to try it?

373
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,880
- Right now? 
 - Yeah.

374
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,470
Here?

375
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,100
Yes.

376
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,420
Well, close your eyes.

377
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,880
Promptly.

378
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,750
Let's say you're in the police station right now.

379
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:47,710
And bring up every image that you saw on that day, one by one.

380
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,030
There is nothing particular.

381
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,730
There are just policemen,  civil petitioners, and employees.

382
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,740
Keep going.

383
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,860
 - How about yellowtail? 
 - Don't you know I don't eat sashimi?

384
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,240
 - Is Detective Lee going to be late? 
 - He said he will soon join us.

385
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,270
Wait a minute.  There is a man.

386
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,950
His age... is in about the early forties.

387
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:25,590
He stoops a little bit but still has a robust physique.

388
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,000
He has a habit of cracking his neck.

389
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,570
I think that's a unique habit that appears when he's excited or nervous.

390
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,690
Other distinct features?

391
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,790
I don't know.

392
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,960
Focus more on things that you saw.

393
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,170
I think you might've missed something.

394
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,450
There was some kind of black stain on the back of his hand,

395
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,830
but I don't know what it is.

396
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,840
It's probably a birthmark or a tattoo.

397
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,260
Wait a minute. He was holding a black umbrella.

398
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,450
But I saw this umbrella at the Go Min Ji's crime scene.

399
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,380
I think they are the same person.

400
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,330
How is he connected to Kang Seung Hwan?

401
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,520
The dog leash Kang Seung Hwan was holding at the scene

402
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,720
and the collar of the dog that the man was holding seem to be a set.

403
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,890
Good.  Now open your eyes.

404
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,520
There is a clue that we're missing.

405
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,070
Go to the Kang Seung Hwan's house right now.

406
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,360
I'm in.

407
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:40,610
Well, what did we miss?

408
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,720
They already took all of the stuff related to the crime.

409
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,940
Kang Seung Hwan liked to show off himself and loved himself very much.

410
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,350
 He must've left some traces.

411
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,680
There are some pictures left.

412
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,920
Most of them are selfies and a lot of pictures are of himself with a puppy.

413
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,440
Cha Soo Yeong, don't talk but stay still.

414
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,150
Pardon?

415
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,340
There is someone over there.

416
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,500
Get out of there.

417
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,550
Cha Soo Yeong.  Cha Soo Yeong.

418
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,390
 This is Metropolitan Investigation Unit Team 2.

419
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,820
 We're heading to Kang Seung Hwan's apartment.

420
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,000
 We'll gather the rest of evidence and return.

421
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,180
Cha Soo Yeong, can you hear me?

422
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,850
Cha Soo Yeong.

423
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,500
Yes?

424
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,170
Cha Soo Yeong, did you get hurt?

425
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,880
Yes, but I'm okay.

426
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,310
 I'll chase him right away.

427
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,300
 No need to chase him.

428
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,580
I'm sure he was there to get rid of evidence.

429
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,030
Look for what he took.

430
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,440
I'm not sure.

431
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,760
There is nothing that changed.

432
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,610
There must be. Otherwise there was no reason for him to be there.

433
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,220
 Metropolitan Investigation Unit Team 2 will be there soon.

434
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,580
You must find it before they arrive. Can you do that?

435
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,040
I'll try.

436
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,600
Focus more.

437
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,070
Focus.

438
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,000
One picture is missing.

439
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,140
The picture that was of himself with a dog.

440
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,680
There are many pictures of himself with a  dog.

441
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,100
He took only that picture?

442
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,160
The background is different.

443
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,250
And I can see the man, who was taking the picture, in the side mirror.

444
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,180
He is the accomplice.

445
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,110
 Get out of there now.

446
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,980

447
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:11,620
- Gather everything and take them back! 
 - Yes.

448
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,980
What kind of relationship do you think they had?

449
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,700
Kang Seung Hwan went to the scene to get his dog.

450
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,090
He must've loved his dog very much like his family member.

451
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:45,230
The accomplice probably got close to Kang Seung Hwan through his dog.

452
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,380
He must do work related to animals.

453
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,690
Cha Soo Yeong... she scored this time, too.

454
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,940
She is an interesting gal.

455
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,500
She doesn't know her ability well.

456
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,370
She'll learn it gradually.

457
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,530
She kind of works hard, but she's not good.

458
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,300
She has a lot of fears, but she has a brave side.

459
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:18,310
The important thing is that we need Cha Soo Yeong.

460
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:27,400
 Play the CCTVs of the cars that visited on the day  Kang Seung Hwan died.

461
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,360
Look into the car with license plate 67-H6677.

462
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,040
Let me see.

463
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,460
The car's owner is Jeong Chan Goo.

464
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,220
There is nothing special.

465
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,460
- Jeong Chan Goo? 
 - Why?

466
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,890
There is a record that he called Kang Seung Hwan five months ago.  Just once.

467
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,460
What?

468
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,170
Yes.

469
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,720
 Check if there was a veterinarian or a worker related to animals among the visitors on that day.

470
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,640
- Yes, I understand. 
 - What is it?

471
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,530
She said to check  if there was a veterinarian or a worker related to animals among the visitors on that day.

472
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,660

473
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,150
It's said the job of Jeong Chan Goo is veterinarian.

474
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,340
Bingo!  We should go get him.

475
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,030
- Hey, Detective Lee, put his address in the system and dig into Jeong Chan Goo more. 
 - Yes.

476
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,040
Policewoman Cha, follow us.

477
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,850
Okay.

478
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,240
Yes, we're heading there. Yes.

479
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,840
Yes, yes.

480
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,210

481
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,000
Team Leader, we identified the suspect.

482
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,050
His name is Jeong Chan Goo, 43 years old.

483
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,620
As you mentioned, he is a veterinarian.

484
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,270
Yes, we'll send you his address.

485
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,710
- Send his address. 
 - Okay.

486
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,610
Wow, Team Leader Hwang is a demon.  How did she know it?

487
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,900
He got married seven years ago, but he is single now.

488
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,500
But his wife is missing right now.

489
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,120
He doesn't have a criminal record nor a record of paying a fine.

490
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,410
I looked him up online.

491
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,790
 He treats a lot of abandoned dogs for free and does a lot of volunteer work,

492
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,630
 so he has a good reputation.

493
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,240
But there were some disputes with neighbors because of noise and stench.

494
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,690
Hey, what kind of stench?

495
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,970
It's said it was some burning smell.

496
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,820
Spare me.

497
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,710
Spare me.

498
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,870
Spare me, please.

499
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:55,190
Look into him more and send his picture to Detective Jang.

500
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,140
I received it.  He is this punk.

501
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,860
He looks so normal.

502
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,940
Spare me.

503
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,570
Spare me.

504
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,630
Please spare me.

505
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,670
Spare me.

506
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:46,130
You're worse than dogs.

507
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,090
If you want to live, then bark.

508
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,780
Spare me.

509
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,160
Bark.

510
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,080
Why are you doing this to me?

511
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,910
I'm in a very bad mood because of a certain lunatic.

512
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,550
When I'm like this, I feel better if I see blood.

513
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,050
Please spare me.

514
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:57,150
Please.  Please.

515
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,970
Stay still.

516
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,880
What is it? Ah, gosh.

517
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,810
The animal hospital is closed.

518
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,880
I called the veterinary state board.

519
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,910
They said his license was suspended,

520
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,500
and the hospital has closed.

521
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,280
But the odd thing is that if I look at his credit card usage,

522
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,660
there are records that he's been purchasing animal medicine until now.

523
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,350
The receiver's place is not that far from there.

524
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,680
Bye.

525
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,580
They said they were not sure.

526
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,400
Someone else came and took the package.

527
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,740
Search thoroughly for animal hospitals nearby.

528
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,300
I think he may still run an animal hospital near here.

529
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,590
Ah, this is driving me nuts.  I'm sure it's some place near here.

530
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,780
Detective Oh, it's Cha Soo Yeong.

531
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,710
 Can you hear me?

532
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:51,440
 Try thinking of the picture that he took.

533
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,810
Pardon?

534
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,810
I'm talking about the picture that was gone.

535
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,080
Yes, I understand.

536
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:22,650
There is a picture in the back.

537
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:24,520
Search for it.

538
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,130
Spare me.  Please spare me.

539
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,990
Spare me. Spare me.

540
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:43,690

541
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,430
Spare me!  Spare me!

542
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,240

543
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,510
Team Leader, I found the animal hospital.

544
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,450
Welcome.

545
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,740
- We're the police. 
 - What's the matter?

546
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,650

547
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,950
What is this?

548
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,770
We're going to search.

549
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,280
This asshole, that's how he didn't get caught.

550
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,030

551
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,260
There is nothing unusual.

552
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,680
They said it was a burning smell.

553
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,580
There must be an incinerator somewhere.

554
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:38,790
 There is a gap between a closet and a wall in the picture.

555
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,070
Team Leader.

556
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,720
This closet looks strange.

557
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,180
It seems like the smell of blood.

558
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,730
Team Leader.

559
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,630
I think they're belongings of the victims who were found at Kang Seung Hwan's crime scene.

560
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,070
He is a completely crazy asshole.

561
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,430
Wait.

562
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,360
Team Leader!

563
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,620
She's still alive.

564
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,330
Detective Lee, send an ambulance here immediately.

565
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,840
Relax. We're the police.

566
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,430
Team Leader, here!

567
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:36,910
 Detective Lee, call the situation monitoring team and ask them to check the street CCTVs.

568
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,940
Jeong Chan Goo's car, 67-H6677!

569
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,210
Seven!  He is heading to highway seven.

570
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,720
Detective Yang, go to highway seven.

571
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,890
If you fall behind, radio me immediately.

572
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,050
 Jeong Chan Goo's car is heading in the direction of  Bookwoo-dong.

573
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,700
 You'll meet at the Namwoo intersection.

574
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:20,190
Detective Yang, over there!

575
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,940
Over there! The car shifted to that lane.

576
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:32,290
Hey, Jeong Chan Goo!  Stop the car!

577
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,940
I'm telling you to stop the car, you asshole!  Stop!

578
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,340
Stop, you asshole!

579
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,290

580
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,550
Get out of our way!  Get out!

581
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,950
 It's driving me nuts, gosh.

582
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,440
You're working hard.

583
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,890
I'm here because you didn't reply to my text.

584
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,150
How is it? Is our contract still valid?

585
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:21,280
Kang Seung Hwan and Jeong Chan Goo had committed their own crimes respectively.

586
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,440
Then they began to share crimes.

587
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,030
If Jeong Chan Goo lured a victim through a dog,

588
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,920
then both of them kidnapped the victim.

589
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,210
Kang Seung Hwan's goal was taking pictures,

590
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:33,210
and Jeong Chan Goo's goal was murdering.

591
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:37,230
But someone stimulated Kang Seung Hwan.

592
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:40,820
Kang Seung Hwan began speeding up because he wanted to become famous.

593
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,600
Then he ended up turning himself in.

594
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,440
Accomplice Jeong Chan Goo was afraid that his crimes would be revealed,

595
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,600
so he went to the police station to find out about the progress of investigation.

596
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:58,290
After that, Kang Seung Hwan eventually died.

597
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,820
Team Leader, Jeong Chan Goo's car is found.

598
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,650
He is heading to the port.

599
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,210
There is possibility that he may smuggle himself out.

600
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:23,170
And Team 2 started heading there.

601
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,870
This is a DWI traffic stop.

602
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:37,460
 Notification to every patrol squad. 67-H6677, white car.

603
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,370
 As soon as you find it, arrest him immediately!

604
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,050
This car!  This car!  Catch this car!

605
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,600
Block it!  Block it!

606
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:46,870
 It's just now, right?

607
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:49,630
 - A serial killer who was investigated by the police... 
 - The car with license plate 67-H6677 fled.

608
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:51,980
 - Notifying again. 67-H6677! 
 - Kang Seung Hwan was killed.

609
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:55,850
 - The suspect's car passed the DWI traffic stop and is fleeing. 
 - Really...

610
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:59,230
 Did the mint serial killer come back to life and kill him?

611
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:03,330
 As you know, mint is that bastard's signature.

612
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:09,540
 Then why did the copycat put a mint in the suspect's mouth?

613
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,860
 This is an interesting question.

614
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:17,460
 Someone who uses Peppermint Candy as his ID asked this question:

615
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,300
 If that bastard is alive, what would I do?

616
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,460
 Well, could that happen?

617
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:28,410
 I'd even bet my life that he's not alive.

618
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,100
Gosh.  At this time!

619
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,950
Where did this punk go after taking my money?

620
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,660

621
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,460
It's cold.

622
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:13,210
Kitty.

623
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,540
You startled me!

624
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,290
What are you doing here?

625
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:27,840
I lost my phone.

626
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,820
May I use your phone?

627
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,680
- Where are you? 
 -  I'm on my way over there. We're arriving soon.

628
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,700
Hurry. Catch him first.

629
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,900
Team Leader!

630
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,310
He is dead.

631
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,810
He must be around here. Search for him again.

632
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,510
Yes.

633
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,040
Call the police quickly.

634
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,230
This way.

635
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,190
- Cha Soo Yeong, go with Detective Jang. 
 - I got it.

636
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:49,100
He might have disguised himself, so be careful.

637
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,450
- If you find him, radio us right away. 
 - Yes, we got it.

638
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,380
Follow me.

639
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:21,140
- Hey, you go that way and I'll go this way. 
 - Okay.

640
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,160
Detective Jang, there is a blood mark on the handle of storage 3.

641
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,280
 Policewoman Cha, where are you right now?

642
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,390
 Hey, I can't hear you at all.

643
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:51,270
 Can you hear me?  Hey, Policewoman Cha...

644
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:54,160
Detective Jang, I'll go inside first.

645
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,620
 Policewoman Cha,  you can hear me?

646
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,390
 Got it? Policewoman Cha! Policewoman Cha!

647
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:33,370
This is Cha Soo Yeong.

648
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:37,850
There is radio frequency interference, so the radio won't work well.

649
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,060
Yes, I understand.

650
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:43,960
 Be careful.  We don't know what he will do.

651
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,680
Yes.

652
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,540
Hey!

653
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:38,100
 Policewoman Cha! Hey, Policewoman Cha, where are you?

654
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,510
 It's storage 3.

655
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:44,730
Cha Soo Yeong is in danger.

656
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,880
- That way! 
 - Who was it?

657
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:42,370

658
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:53,910

659
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,440

660
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,820
 In this case, there was no mint.

661
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:03,460
 To see what we missed, I went over it again.

662
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,080
 This was definitely done by the same criminal.

663
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,420
 Who is the next target?

664
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:11,650
 You'd bet your life that the bastard isn't alive.

665
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,280
 Are you going to keep your promise?

666
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,350
 If that bastard really is the culprit,

667
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,600
 whom is he trying to show off to?

668
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,770
 What could it be? Without showing up himself,

669
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:23,800
 a method to kill in front of people...

670
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,510
 That bastard finally showed up.
