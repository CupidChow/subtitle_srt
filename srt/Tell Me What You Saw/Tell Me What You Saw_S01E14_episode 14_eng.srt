1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,480

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,740

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,210

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,060

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,490

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,960

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,020

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:36,010

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,940

10
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,730
I will be sure to catch you.

11
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:15,370

12
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,680
You must catch him.

13
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,860
Detective Oh!

14
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,150
Oh Hyeon Jae!

15
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,200
Ask for back up now.

16
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,250
Detective Yang, come to the NFS right now!

17
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,130
Director.

18
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,100
Director.

19
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh Hyeon Jae!

20
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,350
The police will arrive soon. Please secure the area until then.

21
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,380
Okay.

22
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,210
 - Your call cannot be connected at this time... 
   - Why isn't she answering?

23
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,120
- Team Leader Hwang isn't picking up? 
 - No, she isn't.

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,010
Detective Cha and Detective Oh aren't picking up either.

25
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,930
What the hell is happening right now?

26
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,590
Detective Oh!

27
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,990
Team Leader!

28
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,300
Team Leader.

29
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,730
Wait!

30
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,570
Detective Yang.

31
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,700
Detective Cha, what's going on?

32
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,110
It was that bastard. To Director Choi, he—

33
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,780
What? Cha—

34
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,750
Everyone out!

35
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,920
- Get out, all of you! 
 - This way! Follow us!

36
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,050
Over here.

37
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,140
Search that area thoroughly!

38
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,940
Yes, sir.

39
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,570
It's that way. Run!

40
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,350
Oh Hyeon Jae, what about that bastard?

41
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,370
I lost him.

42
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,720
Detective Oh.

43
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,210
Detective Oh.

44
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,280
Team Leader, what happened?

45
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,310
Are you okay?

46
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,300
I'll take good care of these handcuffs.

47
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,410
After all, this precious thing links me to you, Oh Hyeon Jae.

48
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,580

49
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,120
He kept struggling to make his way up,

50
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,500
when, in the end, that's how he was going to end up.

51
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,700
Regardless of what kind of a person Director Choi was,

52
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,140
he was still a policeman just like us.

53
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,790
Now he's the victim of a homicide case.

54
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,400
You should show some basic respect.

55
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,220
It's because it's so tragic.

56
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,480

57
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,060
Stop.

58
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,350
Could you step out for a bit?

59
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,910
What? That's a bit...

60
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,630
The situation requires security.

61
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,010
Even so, according to regulations, doing that isn't...

62
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,840
It's not a request but an order.

63
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,110
 Oh Hyeon Jae, you saw that bastard's face.

64
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,900
Show me your next move, Kim Yo Han.

65
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,970

66
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,560
Just by looking at the cut, it's definitely that bastard's doing.

67
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,400
What do you mean that bastard?

68
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,080
That bastard from five years ago? You mean the mint serial killer?

69
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,660
I'll still have to check.

70
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,940
But it won't be easy to open up someone I knew well.

71
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,650
You're all working so hard.

72
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,090
We're from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

73
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,500
Could we see the CCTV footage from last night?

74
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,880
What do you want to see?

75
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,130
We came for the CCTV footage of the homicide that happened here last night.

76
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,530
You already took everything with you yesterday.

77
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,840
And if you were going to take it, you should've done it nicely.

78
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,730
- How could you completely destroy someone else's equipment while taking it? 
 - What?

79
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,090
Who took this?

80
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,970
She said she was high ranking.

81
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,200
She rushed in here saying she's the team leader of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit

82
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,370
and just took off with everything.

83
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,490
 Oh Hyeon Jae, you definitely saw his face.

84
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,280
 So why? Why?

85
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,020
 Why aren't you saying anything?

86
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,720

87
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,820
 Tell me the name.

88
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,260
 Isu.

89
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,970
 What did you say?

90
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,200
 Han Isu.

91
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,310
That bastard is responsible for Director Choi's death.

92
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,660
It happened because he went at it alone.

93
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,750
Poor fellow.

94
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,410
This never would've happened if we had covered it up sooner.

95
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,720
This is what the security cameras recorded last night.

96
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,290
He moved while avoiding the cameras,

97
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,740
so only Oh Hyeon Jae and Director Choi's faces could be confirmed.

98
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,660
Once he gets caught by Oh Hyeon Jae—

99
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,860
No, that must never happen.

100
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,140
Oh Hyeon Jae will reveal everything.

101
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,530
Everything that happened five years ago without leaving out a detail.

102
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,200
Then, all the criticism will be directed at us, the police.

103
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,920
Team Leader Hwang, there is no way you...

104
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,940
How much do you know?

105
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,940
I will be the first to catch that bastard.

106
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,070
You will catch him first?

107
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,760
And I myself will cover it up.

108
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,230
Okay, what is it that you want?

109
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,350
If you take care of this well,

110
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,370
you can move into Director Choi's office.

111
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you checking the footage?

112
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,840
What the heck?

113
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,050
Why aren't you going through the CCTV footage?

114
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,730
What? What do you mean?

115
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,180
Didn't you go to get the CCTV footage?

116
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,680
Hey, hey. Where's Team Leader Hwang?

117
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,590
She's not here yet.

118
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:32,550
Team Leader, we were told you took the entire hard drive of the CCTV footage.

119
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,410
Where's the hard disk?

120
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,010
Detective Yang Man Soo, I don't report to you.

121
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,450
You report to me.

122
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,110
Team Leader...

123
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,350
Hey, Hwang Ha Yeong.

124
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,620
Let me ask you one thing.

125
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,250
That look in your eyes last night...

126
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,920
 Team Leader.

127
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,480
You looked ready to kill someone.

128
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,640
What are you thinking?

129
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,940
Team Leader!

130
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,940
I can't get in contact with Detective Oh.

131
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,260
In his current state, we don't know what he'll do—

132
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,290
Cha Soo Yeong, how long are you going to whine like that?

133
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,030
If you're a detective, act like one.

134
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,440
Kim Yo Han.

135
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,240
I knew you would be here.

136
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,910
Because for you, this is the safest place from me right now.

137
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,300
That's right.

138
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,620
Oh, this is kind of a funny story,

139
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,570
but the police always protected me,

140
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,250
whether it was five years ago or now.

141
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,320
Do you know why I was never caught? Then or now?

142
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,130
Deep in your hearts, all of you have something you want and desire.

143
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:43,990
You probably want to pretend you're different from them,

144
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,770
but you don't seem any different. Aren't I right?

145
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,540
Maybe it's just my own opinion.

146
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,240
I really like it here.

147
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,350
This is the one place you can't catch me.

148
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,720
Why? Your objective isn't to use government authority

149
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,890
to throw me in jail.

150
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,280
It's Isu, right?

151
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,930
Han Isu.

152
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,290
You want revenge.

153
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,000
Isn't that so?

154
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,100
But, you want to know something?

155
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,000
If that someone, who told me to kill her,

156
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,140
didn't tell me to kill her,

157
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,220
what do you think I would have done?

158
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,840
You're curious, right?

159
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,650
You got more talkative.

160
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,700
You must be scared.

161
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,220
You see, that worries me.

162
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,770
That you'll be caught by someone else first.

163
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,460
Be careful.

164
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,820
You're worried for me? Really?

165
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,370
Don't worry.

166
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,690
The way I see it,

167
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,110
you seem anxious I'll be caught by someone else.

168
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,910
Isn't that right?

169
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,970
Oh Hyeon Jae.

170
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,670
You are under arrest as a suspect for the murder of Director Choi Hyeong Pil.

171
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,490
Last night, Director Choi Hyeong Pil

172
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,560
was attacked and killed by an unidentified assailant.

173
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,220
The police force expresses deep condolences over the death of Director Choi,

174
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,770
who has been a dedicated and exemplary police officer.

175
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,740
We'll do everything we can to catch the culprit as quickly as possible.

176
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,310
Do you have a suspect?

177
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,730
The investigation is in progress, so I cannot share that information.

178
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,230
There's a rumor that the Profiler Oh Hyeon Jae was arrested this morning.

179
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,110
Does that have anything to do with the murder of Director Choi Hyeong Pil?

180
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,970
As I said, the investigation is ongoing,

181
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,300
so I ask that you refrain from excessive speculation or speculative articles.

182
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,690
That is the end of the briefing.

183
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,890
What kind of state was the body discovered in?

184
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,230
Please, a question!

185
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,390
Please, just an answer, please!

186
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,340
Please tell us!

187
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,490
When it gets out that Oh Hyeon Jae is a suspect,

188
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,690
there will be a huge impact internally and externally.

189
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,530
Make sure you keep it under wraps.

190
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,610
Oh Hyeon Jae's interrogation will be undisclosed to the public.

191
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,100
- Detective Lee. 
 - Yes?

192
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,790
Place personnel in front of the interrogation room,

193
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,410
and make sure no one comes near.

194
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,850
Team Leader, what's the evidence that you've identified Detective Oh as a suspect?

195
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,510
From the situation we witnessed last night—

196
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,460
We know nothing just from what we witnessed last night.

197
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,350
Team Leader!

198
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,590
If you're done, you may leave.

199
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,080
Then what about the CCTV footage?

200
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,650
Why did you take the hard drive?

201
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,300
- If we analyze the footage—
 - Cha Soo Yeong.

202
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,960
That's enough. You can leave.

203
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,990
The NFS said the murder method was the same as that bastard's.

204
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,060
So you arresting Detective Oh as a suspect right now,

205
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,420
you know better than anyone what that means.

206
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,950
What if Oh Hyeon Jae is that bastard?

207
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,310
How could that...

208
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,890
Seriously, is that what you really think?

209
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,790
I'm going to go confirm that starting now.

210
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,890
What did she say?

211
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,020
What's the reason she's like that all of a sudden?

212
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,930
No way... Detective Oh did that to Director Choi?

213
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,590
Really, there must be a reason if she's acting like that.

214
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,950
Report.

215
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,560
There were a total of six people who took time off on November 29.

216
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,130

217
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,910
The interrogation of these six people has to be done unofficially.

218
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,280
Just state that we're interviewing them about work.

219
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,240
The interrogation location needs to be unofficial, too.

220
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,960
Okay.

221
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,820
Team Leader. Then why did you arrest Detective Oh?

222
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,740
Team Leader?

223
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,030
Detective Lee, let me give you some advice.

224
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,080
Don't repeatedly put a question mark where a period should be.

225
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,550
You just do as I tell you.

226
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,730
- Director Choi—
 - Director Choi...

227
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,970
About Director Choi...

228
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,860
whenever I tried to catch that bastard, he caused a hindrance.

229
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,760
 What's the real reason why you've come back to work?

230
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,810
Unnoticeably. Why did he do that?

231
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:03,160
He must have been trying to cover his secret.

232
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,210
 Someone in his thirties whom we won't be able to identify.

233
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,760
 Male. We need a body.

234
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,910
I'm talking about how at the Joonggeon three-way intersection five years ago,

235
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,760
he put a fake corpse at the scene in that bastard's place and covered up the case.

236
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,970
That's why he went so far.

237
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,800
He took away the handcuffs which was the only evidence,

238
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,800
and he even manipulated circumstantial and direct evidence.

239
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,540
What is it that you want to say?

240
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,540
Hwang Ha Yeong, profiling is all about

241
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,720
figuring out the psychology between one choice and the next.

242
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,590
If you analyze the process and assume that psychology in reverse order,

243
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,020
you can see the ultimate objective of the person who made that choice.

244
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,730
Deciding to hold hands with Director Choi, who was trying to cover up his secret,

245
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,630
Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong.

246
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,970
Even though you could have easily subdued Shin Gyeong Soo,

247
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,940
you shot him on purpose.

248
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:12,580
And right after he woke up, you even helped him escape from the hospital.

249
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,680
Why did Hwang Ha Yeong go so far as to arrest Oh Hyeon Jae

250
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,200
when there is no reason to interrogate him?

251
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:29,410
It's because you didn't want me to catch that bastard.

252
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,090
Isn't that right?

253
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:36,990
Are you saying you've profiled me or something?

254
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,670
So? What's the conclusion?

255
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:47,470
Hwang Ha Yeong, what's the secret you're hiding?

256
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,130
Tell me.

257
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,070
Oh Hyeon Jae!

258
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,200
You saw that bastard's face, but you didn't tell me.

259
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,910
He's someone you wanted to catch so badly,

260
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,800
but you willingly let him go.

261
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,940
It's a dereliction of duty as an officer.

262
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,660
Didn't I tell you?

263
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,320
You know...

264
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,600
all I want to know is

265
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,770
who asked for Isu to be killed.

266
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,140
Oh, I'm okay.

267
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,190
Is it difficult?

268
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,900
It must be.

269
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,140
When all you wanted was to be a good policeman.

270
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,630
To deal with Director Choi who died, and now Team Leader Hwang...

271
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
Detective Yang.

272
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,980
Why? You thought I wouldn't know?

273
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,110
- Yes. 
 - Makes sense.

274
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:15,400
You must have thought, "Why did he who just rambles and eats jjajangmyeon all the time"

275
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,340
"choose to be a policeman when he doesn't seem all that capable?"

276
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,270
That's not true.

277
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,670
If I were to try and make up an excuse,

278
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,980
it's because I trust you guys.

279
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:36,480
What I can't do, Team Leader Hwang and you guys do well.

280
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,100
What you guys can't do, I...

281
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,980
Never mind that one.

282
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:54,700
No matter who the culprit is, you can't catch him alone.

283
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,980
No matter how good you are, you can never do it alone.

284
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,850
So that's why we all have to catch him together.

285
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,040
That's what it means to be a police officer.

286
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,640
So Detective Lee...

287
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,830
No, Ji Min,

288
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,050
let's catch him together, whether it's that bastard or someone else.

289
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,420

290
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,360
Soo Yeong, are you okay?

291
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,880
What's going on exactly?

292
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,500
- Sunbae, I have a favor to ask of you. 
 - What is it?

293
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,360
I need to speak to Detective Oh. I need your help.

294
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,860
Help how? He's in the interrogation room. Speak to him there.

295
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,710
Team Leader has someone standing watch so no one can go in.

296
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,150
Then that's a different story.

297
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,760
I think it'll cause issues, so don't do anything.

298
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,920
No, I must see Detective Oh.

299
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,720
Why do you need to see him that badly in the midst of all this?

300
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,530
We're one team, and...

301
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,430
And?

302
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,970
Someone has to believe Detective Oh.

303
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,530
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

304
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,770
Ah, I'm tired.

305
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,030
Let's switch.

306
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,080
Hey, I'm nervous, so make it quick and come out, okay?

307
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,940
Okay. Thanks.

308
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,880
What are you doing? Hurry and go inside!

309
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,810
Okay.

310
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,110
What is it?

311
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,580
I believe you.

312
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,750
That you didn't kill Director Choi.

313
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,500
That's not a belief but truth.

314
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,850
There are things that are hard to believe even if they are true.

315
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,840
Having low self-esteem and being weak willed,

316
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,730
I knew all along that I was best suited to be a

317
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,670
countryside officer, even though I pretended it wasn't true.

318
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,210
But once I joined the Metropolitan Investigation Unit,

319
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,560
I wanted to try and believe

320
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,920
that I might be able to become a good officer.

321
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,380
The tenacity to catch the person who killed my mom,

322
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,990
without that one thing,

323
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,160
there's nothing about me that makes me suitable to be an officer.

324
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,150
But you believed in me.

325
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,900
I believe you, too.

326
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,770
Please give me an order.

327
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,240
So that I can investigate as a real officer.

328
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,900
I forgot about this place.

329
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,710
This is an interrogation room that existed before you became an officer.

330
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,620
How did you find it?

331
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,390
Finding information that others can't is my specialty.

332
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,230
Fine. Let's start with Kang Dong Sik.

333
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,890
Bring him here quietly without anyone knowing.

334
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,990
Yes, I understand.

335
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,460
 I'm determined to find you within the day.

336
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,850
 Then everything will be over.

337
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:45,490
 Until then, just wait quietly, Oh Hyeon Jae.

338
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,380
 Thanks.

339
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,480
 What are you doing? Hurry and go inside!

340
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,490
 Okay.

341
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,970
That's what Cha Soo Yeong saw.

342
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,990
How interesting.

343
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,700
You scared me!

344
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,920
Detective Yang, what are you doing there?

345
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,060
Oh...

346
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,000
I came to put this back.

347
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,320
You're going back to Hongwoon now?

348
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,520
Yeah, I have to go back and protect Hongwoon now.

349
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,710
- You worked hard.
- Thanks.

350
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,060
Sorry for not taking better care of you.

351
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,710
Oh, not at all.

352
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,050
We were in a state of disorder when you arrived

353
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,450
and it's the same now as you're leaving.

354
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,000
Or did it become that way when you got here?

355
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,220
Why are you scaring me like that?

356
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,420
It's always chaotic at the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

357
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,450
Right.

358
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,110
I'll come down to visit you when I have time.

359
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,280
Let's grab a drink.

360
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,740
Okay. I'll see you later.

361
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,750
Sergeant Kang, Team Leader is looking for you.

362
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,320
Me? Why is she looking for me?

363
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,860
I think it's because you're going back to your division.

364
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,280
Oh, okay, I understand.

365
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,980
I'll get going.

366
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,610
Detective Yang.

367
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,840
Oh, Detective Cha. I need you to come with me.

368
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,810
What is this place?

369
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,660
It was used to record statements a long time ago.

370
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,550
Over there is the interrogation room.

371
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,670
But why are we here?

372
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,620
When the equipment became digital,

373
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,900
we moved everything to the current interrogation room.

374
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,420
But the organization is so funny.

375
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,530
They should have changed the use of this place,

376
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,080
but with so many things to get permits for and signed off on,

377
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,100
things just ended up this way.

378
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,980
Team Leader...

379
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:03,090
 She's going to catch that bastard first, even if Detective Oh has to be falsely detained?

380
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,970
 Yes.

381
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,980
 Knowing her personality, she's not after recognition.

382
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,020
 There's definitely a reason we're unaware of.

383
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,250
 Whatever that is, I can't allow her current actions.

384
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,030
 Detective Yang, in this current situation,

385
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,610
 it will be difficult to resolve this by talking to her.

386
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,850
 I'll watch her a little bit more from near by.

387
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,620
 We should be able to find out the reason then.

388
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,400
 Ji Min, I don't want to do that to you, too.

389
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,320
 Let's say it's the consequence of switching loyalties often.

390
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:45,960
First, let's find out what her objective is.

391
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,540
Pull over a chair.

392
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,010
Sunbae...

393
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,160
Why is Sunbae...

394
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,110
Take a look.

395
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,730

396
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,940

397
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,850
Do what you do.

398
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,050
Pardon?

399
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,690
You know how you mumble under your breath like a crazy person all the time.

400
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,500
Why would you try and do that in secret now, given the situation?

401
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,360
Oh, okay.

402
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,720
- Detective Oh. 
 - Go ahead.

403
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,130
Team Leader is investigating Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency's officers

404
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,180
who took time off on November 29, 2015.

405
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,090
Wait.

406
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:04,880
Now that I think about it, five years ago, November 29 is the day

407
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,910
Team Leader Hwang suddenly fell off the radar.

408
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,060
- Detective Oh. 
  - I heard him.

409
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,820
Check with Detective Yang

410
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,040
 the reason she disappeared that day

411
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,510
and what state she was in when she reappeared.

412
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,770
Well...

413
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,150
I don't think she ever told me the reason until the end.

414
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,040
Her face was in bad shape.

415
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,050
I can't understand even now.

416
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,950
That was the only time that she disappeared without a reason.

417
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,340
What's the current situation?

418
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:41,530
The suspects have been narrowed down to six.

419
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,770
Among them, she's interrogating Detective Kang Dong Sik.

420
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,230
Why did you want to see me?

421
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,330
What is this place?

422
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,910
I just wanted to have a quiet conversation.

423
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,160
It's nothing much.

424
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,430
I have some questions for performance assessment.

425
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,340
Cha Soo Yeong, concentrate from now.

426
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,090
You have to report to me her posture, gestures,

427
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,700
and even the tiniest facial changes in exact detail.

428
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,420
Okay.

429
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:20,560
But just the two of us being in a place like this

430
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,920
makes me feel weird. It's like an interrogation.

431
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,480
It's nothing like that, so there's no need to be nervous.

432
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,640
Okay.

433
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:40,550
Team Leader is rubbing her forehead with her right hand.

434
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:44,530
Now she's touching her neck with the same hand.

435
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,460
Is she covering her right elbow with her left hand?

436
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,230
Yes.

437
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:55,430
 Rubbing the forehead means she feels very uncomfortable.

438
00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:01,420
 And touching her neck while covering the elbow with the other hand means

439
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,670
 she's very stressed and anxious.

440
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,000
- You worked at Hongwoon Police Station for seven years. 
 - Yes.

441
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,420
What's the reason you're not transferring to another region?

442
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:18,430
Well... I don't know how this will sound,

443
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:24,720
but... I like places that have less work and less people.

444
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,420

445
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,220

446
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,800
You took time off on March 12th.

447
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,280
What did you do that day?

448
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,980
March 12?

449
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,180
March 12...

450
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:48,600
Oh, I wasn't feeling well, so I stayed home all day.

451
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:10,580
You're blocking the negative memories from getting into your brain, unconsciously.

452
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,370
Hwang Ha Yeong, you're scared right now.

453
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:20,280
This man who is in front of you... You're scared of him.

454
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,330
It's horror.

455
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,520
What do you mean?

456
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,000
Why would Team Leader be afraid of Sunbae Kang?

457
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,680
What? What do you mean?

458
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,850
Hwang Ha Yeong is not scared of Kang Dong Sik himself.

459
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,870
But she is afraid of the fact that he might be that bastard.

460
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:42,620
I'm sure Hwang Ha Yeong is scared of that bastard.

461
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,190
Why would Team Leader be scared of that bastard?

462
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,290
Now you can leave. We have something to check lastly.

463
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,970
But why is Detective Kang Dong Sik—

464
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,980
Did you forget?

465
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,500
The one who asked to be given orders

466
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,990
was not me but you.

467
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,060
Okay, I understand.

468
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,190
I think I need to go now.

469
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,800
O-Okay.  I'll keep watching.

470
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:31,030
 Detective Cha, why would Team Leader Hwang go so far as to arrest me?

471
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,960
 She probably has something else to do while

472
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,470
 keeping me detained here. Like Ha Tae Sik did.

473
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,500
 I have to sit here quietly

474
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,500
 in order for her to reveal her objective.

475
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,170
 If I escape this place

476
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:54,680
 or hold her up in order to prove my innocence,

477
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,140
 we won't find out anything about her end goal.

478
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,690
 What could her end goal be?

479
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,670
 We'll have to find out.

480
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,640
 Work with Detective Yang.

481
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,040
 He's the only one who knows her as well as I do.

482
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,620
 Okay, I understand. But...

483
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,360
 if I hadn't come to see you,

484
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,150
 what were you going to do?

485
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,050
 What would I have done?

486
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,750
 You see,

487
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:35,110
 I have faith in you.

488
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:40,460
 Faith that you would come here.

489
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,410

490
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,990

491
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,580
Did you find out about Lee Ji Seon?

492
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,710
Yes, I'm looking it over.

493
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,030
But there's nothing that connects her to Team Leader in particular.

494
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,200
No, there's definitely a connection.

495
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,820

496
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,680

497
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,590

498
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:28,560
Sanareum?

499
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,770
Sanareum...

500
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,300
Where have I seen Sanareum?

501
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,720

502
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,260
- Detective Oh. 
 - Tell me.

503
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:56,270
I think Team Leader bought some flowers near Lee Ji Seon's charnel house.

504
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,050
Confirm it.

505
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,000
Okay, I will.

506
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:11,580
Hwang Ha Yeong, are you really afraid of that bastard?

507
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,790
Why?

508
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,550
I know her well. She comes every year.

509
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,650
This year, she just came last week.

510
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,880
Every year?

511
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,560
Since five years ago, around the end of November,

512
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,440
she always bought freesias.

513
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,470
Okay, I understand.

514
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,950
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

515
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,390
Excuse me, Lee Ji Seon...

516
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,710
Lee Ji Seon?

517
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,340
This way, please.

518
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,310

519
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,350
- Detective Oh. 
 - Tell me.

520
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,380
 Team Leader seems to have visited Lee Ji Seon's charnel house

521
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,670
 every November for the past five years.

522
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,640
Detective Oh? Detective Oh?

523
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,030
What happened?

524
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:23,050
November 29, 2015, Lee Ji Seon...

525
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:27,600
That bastard's 11th victim. The one right before Isu.

526
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,000
But the estimated date of death is December 1.

527
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,650

528
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,710
 Five years ago, November 29 is the day

529
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:45,290
 Team Leader Hwang suddenly fell off the radar.

530
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:53,210
  Lee Ji Seon, the mint serial killer's 11th victim.

531
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:59,550
 Only you, Hwang Ha Yeong, knew that Lee Ji Seon died on Novemeber 29.

532
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,890
 But... you kept that information to yourself.

533
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,910
 You didn't tell anyone else.

534
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,450
 The reason you couldn't help but do that is because

535
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,660
 if that fact came to be known,

536
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,420
 the secret you want to hide will be revealed.

537
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:19,560
 Listen well. The person who told me to kill Isu is...

538
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,690
It can't be true.

539
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,940
 I have a debt to settle with that bastard too.

540
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,500
 I know you came up with this game plan.

541
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,090
 I could have caught him, but I lost him.

542
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,440
 Everything changed after that day. Hyeon Jae and I as well.

543
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,660
 I sometimes feel like I'm living in hell.

544
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,380
 Tell me one person whom you want to kill.

545
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:54,610
Now, the name I wanted to hear was yours.

546
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,060
Hwang Ha Yeong.

547
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,930
Team Leader, no way...

548
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,710
Detective Yang, you have to stop Detective Oh.

549
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,610
 What are you talking about now?

550
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,360
Why would you stop Detective Oh when he is in the interrogation room?

551
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,310
I'll tell you later. Detective Oh might be up to something right now.

552
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,140
Hurry!

553
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,060
What's she talking about?

554
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:57,130

555
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,020
Can I leave now?

556
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,830
I might call you again, but that's it for today.

557
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:05,650
You may leave.

558
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,270
Okay.

559
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,140
I'll get going.

560
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,250
Wait.

561
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,030
Yes?

562
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,270
It's been a while, so I don't know if you remember.

563
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:31,300
Five years ago, you took time off on November 29.

564
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,820
By chance, do you remember what you were doing that day?

565
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:42,030
I don't even remember well what I did a month ago.

566
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,370
Wh-Which date?

567
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:48,700
November 29, 2015.

568
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:55,260
November 29... November 29... 29...

569
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:58,960
November five years ago, November 29...

570
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,980
I remember.

571
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,110

572
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,540
What happened?

573
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,060
Detective Oh disappeared.

574
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,460
How, suddenly?

575
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,460
I don't know. He just disappeared.

576
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,570
What were you doing, you punk?!

577
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:20,730
I'm sorry.

578
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,470
I was with a friend of mine.

579
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,310
A friend from childhood.

580
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:30,240
A friend? Would it be possible to know who that friend was?

581
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,340
Stop right there!

582
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:52,360
Ah, but it's a bit... to tell you that...

583
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,150
 Thanks.

584
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:05,170
You probably know him, too.

585
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,530
Me?

586
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:11,790
Yes, my friend.

587
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,660
You blew his head off.

588
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,950
Don't you remember?

589
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:29,890
Shin Gyeong Soo.

590
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,850
No...

591
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,080
No, no...

592
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,280
It can't be.

593
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,320
Say it the way you did back then.

594
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,960
"Spare me. Spare me!"

595
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,040
 Spare me.

596
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,900
 Spare me!

597
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,840
Why can't you say it?

598
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,350
You said it well back then.

599
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,720
 Tell me the name.

600
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:56,030
Don't worry. Today is not the day.

601
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:00,580
Like how I let you live when you gave me the right name that I wanted five years ago,

602
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:08,000
I'll let you live today for the grand party I'm preparing for you guys.

603
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,020
You can look forward to it.

604
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:25,420
The party invitations that will be sent out to you guys

605
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:31,190
will arrive soon.

606
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,960
No... it can't be.

607
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,600
Still, I have to let someone know.

608
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,640
Who can I tell?

609
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,990
Not Detective Oh.

610
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,300
Oh, why at a time like this...

611
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:29,160
Kang Dong Sik.

612
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,700
Detective Yang.

613
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:42,580
 The call cannot be connected, so it'll be forwarded to voice mail.

614
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,130
Kang Dong Sik. That bastard.

615
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:00,640
I must catch him.

616
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,950
Detective Yang.

617
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,930
 Oh, Soo Yeong!

618
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:13,870
 Detective Yang tells me he is busy right now.

619
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,520
So I'm answering his phone in his place.

620
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,360
 I'm busy right now, so can you tell me quickly if you have something to say?

621
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,060
Well...

622
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,120
By any chance, last night—

623
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,960
 Are you asking if I was there?

624
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,030
Yeah. I was there, in the forest where you guys were.

625
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,640
Oh, that was it? It's not even that important.

626
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,110
Why take so much time to say it?

627
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:42,750
Then, are you really...

628
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,890
Yes, Soo Yeong, I'm that bastard.

629
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:50,020
You understand me, right?

630
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:01,230
Where are you right now? Where are you right now?

631
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,500
Where are you right now?!

632
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,400
If you miss me that much, just wait a little bit.

633
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,020
By any chance... by any chance... to Detective Yang...

634
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,450
I'll send him off in no time.

635
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:19,720
No, I'll come to you. I'll come.

636
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,990
I'm telling you to wait a little bit.   I'll send him off soon.

637
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,860
Where are you?

638
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,600
Where are you, you crazy bastard?!

639
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,010
Wait a little bit.

640
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,430
It's almost over.

641
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,690
Detective Yang, can you hear me?

642
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,000
Detective Yang, if you can hear me, please answer me.

643
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,850
Please.

644
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:48,020
Don't kill Detective Yang. Please.

645
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,400
Don't kill Detective Yang, please!

646
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,220
Please.

647
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,990
He is dead.  Dead.

648
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,560
 Hey, Soo Yeong.  Don't get excited. Don't.

649
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,780
 Look up. Up here!

650
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,720
What's happened?!

651
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,940
This is the invitation that I'm giving you guys.

652
00:57:52,030 --> 00:58:02,060

653
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,650

654
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,740
No!

655
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,540
What's happened?!

656
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,950
Detective Yang...

657
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:30,790
No...

658
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,060
♫  Confess your sins with blinks  ♫

659
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,240
No!

660
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,870
♫  Eyes you flicker  ♫

661
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:39,170
No.

662
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,000
No...

663
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,400
♫  As though putting together fragmented traces  ♫

664
00:58:52,150 --> 00:59:00,700
♫  The memories which you have lost  ♫

665
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:10,480
♫  In an instant I recall you as if you were a picture  ♫

666
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,440
♫  Will be lost again  ♫
