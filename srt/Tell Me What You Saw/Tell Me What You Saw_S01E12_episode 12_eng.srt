1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,850

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,130

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,850

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,540

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,870

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,170

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,450

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,010

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,220

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,220

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,750

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,800

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,410

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:10,840

15
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,340
 Tell me one person whom you want to kill.

16
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,310
 You did well.

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,530

18
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,820
I switched the order, but it's not working out well.

19
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,590
I usually kill first and then put it in.

20
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,310
Hwang Ha Yeong, tell me one person whom you want to kill.

21
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,850
You never know. I might let you live.

22
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,100
Spare...

23
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,420
What?

24
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,880
Spare me.

25
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,910
I can't hear you.

26
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:01,000
Spare me! Spare me! Spare me!

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,070
Wrong answer.

28
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,720
Spare me!

29
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,870
Hey there.

30
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,920
Please save me.

31
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,070
Who is it?

32
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,780
Save me.

33
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,450
Are you okay?

34
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,900
I'm so scared.

35
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,230
He's going to kill me.

36
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm a police officer.

37
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,370
You will survive this. You will.

38
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,100
He's going to kill me now. He will end up killing me.

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,430
We will survive.

40
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,740
Th- there. There's a light over there.

41
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,650
Go there and ask for help.

42
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,980
We have to get to the road. We have to go further away.

43
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,760
I'm scared. My legs are shaking.

44
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,440
Save me...

45
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,120
Are you okay? Just gather up your strength a little more.

46
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
Mom...

47
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,350
- Just a little more.
- Mom...

48
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,530
Unni. Unni, hurry up.

49
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,530
No, no!

50
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,440
What are you doing?

51
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,240
I'm sorry. He said he would spare me. I'm sorry.

52
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,520
- What? 
 - Sorry.

53
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,420
So why would you put your hope in someone?

54
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:31,400
Look carefully at what the woman you tried to save did to you.

55
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,660
You said you would let me live if I brought her here.

56
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,370
Please spare me.

57
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,780
Spare me!

58
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,640
Hwang Ha Yeong, tell me one person whom you want to kill.

59
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,190
No one!

60
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,560
No one? Wrong answer.

61
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,380
Save me...

62
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,410
No! No!

63
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
No!

64
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,030
No!

65
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,000
No! You bastard!

66
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,320
No!

67
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,380
Tell me whom you want to kill.

68
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,960
Hwang Ha Yeong. Hwang Ha Yeong.

69
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,340
Wrong answer.

70
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,310
Try again.

71
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,410
I don't know.

72
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,160
Think of that jerk next to you.

73
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,410
That jerk who makes a big deal as though he knows everything about me.

74
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,840
Oh Hyeon Jae.

75
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,660
Oh Hyeon Jae? You want to kill him?

76
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,160
He's my objective but not the answer.

77
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,100
He's too good to kill so easily.

78
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,310
Now, try again.

79
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,980
Tell me one person whom you want to kill.

80
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,040
I don't know. I don't know!

81
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,530
- You know the answer. 
 - I don't know!

82
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,680
Think carefully.

83
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,180
Spare me.

84
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,420
If you want to live, tell me the name in your head.

85
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,510
Spare me. Spare me!

86
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,930
- Tell me. 
 - I'll do everything you ask, so spare me.

87
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,380
You'll do everything I ask?

88
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,320
Tell me the name.

89
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:24,020
 Unni, my most precious unni gave me the best gift in the world.

90
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,830
 Thank you.

91
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,350
Isu.

92
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,350
What did you say?

93
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,380
Han Isu.

94
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,580
Bingo.

95
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm letting you live since you got the answer right.

96
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,340
You did well. Good job.

97
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:01,800
 We have Detective Oh Hyeon Jae here, the criminal profiler at the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

98
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,250
 Detective Oh Hyeon Jae, if your hypothesis is correct,

99
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,440
 how would the culprit ask the victims?

100
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,750
 Look, tell me one person whom you want to kill.

101
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:29,870
 That is the last thing you must do in this world before you die.

102
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,500

103
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,420

104
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,520
This is that bastard's hideout.

105
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,640
You finally found it.

106
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,040
That's right.

107
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,980
Have you contacted Team Leader yet?

108
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,160
Not yet.

109
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,120
Memorize using your photographic memory first.

110
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,090
That doll isn't a victim's.

111
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,730
It's definitely that bastard's.

112
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,640
It must have some special meaning.

113
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,910
This doll...

114
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,120
I know it.

115
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:46,390
Twenty years ago, in the car that hit my mom and ran,

116
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,370
the child who was sitting in the back was holding this doll.

117
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,980
There was a child?

118
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,540
If this doll is his,

119
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,750
then that bastard was in the car...

120
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,890
That child...

121
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,390
There's a high probability of that.

122
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,350
Cha Soo Yeong, the scene of the accident at that time,

123
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,430
can you recall it?

124
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,290
A man wearing a black cap was driving

125
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,820
and a child was in the back.

126
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,500
The child was holding that doll.

127
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,180
A boy who looks to be about

128
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,950
11 to 13 years old.

129
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,420
That child...

130
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,170
He was smiling.

131
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,470
During the moment that the accident happened,

132
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,120
he was smiling.

133
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,420
Cha Soo Yeong, there's something you need to do.

134
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,250
Shin Gyeong Soo.

135
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,530
The one who's in a coma?

136
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,310
Is he a copycat of the bastard?

137
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,910
Shin Gyeong Soo isn't a copycat.

138
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,050
They're a lot closer.

139
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,070
This Matryoshka doll...

140
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,550
The one that was found at Shin Gyeong Soo's house,

141
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,180
it could be the last one of that Matryoshka doll.

142
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,520
I'm sure there's a link between Shin Gyeong Soo and that bastard.

143
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,360
First, find out what contact that bastard had with Shin Gyeong Soo when he was young.

144
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,630
Shin Gyeong Soo or Kim Sang Gil, whichever one it is,

145
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,820
we're getting closer to the bastard.

146
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,370
What about this place? What should we do about it?

147
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,330
We have no use for it anymore.

148
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,930
That bastard won't come here anymore.

149
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,110
When you first came, you gave me only the intel I wanted.

150
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,280
Very actively, even though it wasn't your job.

151
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,980
At the time, it was the only way for me to become a part of the Metropolitan Investigative Unit.

152
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,320
People always have a goal.

153
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,030
The Ha Tae Sik case...

154
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,630
there were a lot of variables.

155
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,350
Right, there were.

156
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,600
This time, there will be many variables, too.

157
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,500
Being predictable isn't his style.

158
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,600
We have to find his goal.

159
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,370
That's how the winner will be decided.

160
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,370
Tell me.

161
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,780
The GPS you put in Eom Soo Tak's shoe.

162
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,750
It was brilliant.

163
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,830
 Because of that, I thought you were looking for Eom Soo Tak...

164
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,590
But you got me.

165
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,570
 It's my turn next.

166
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,020
I'll anticipate it.

167
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,000
You find me.

168
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,960
Then...

169
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:05,570
I'll tell you who told me to kill Isu.

170
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,070
His voice has started trembling.

171
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,360
He has lost his composure.

172
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,830

173
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,230
What happened to Cha Soo Yeong?

174
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,600
Handing Chim Sa Bong over to you.

175
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,800
She'll be back.

176
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,270
I'm sorry.

177
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,460
Oh, you came. The youngest is the master.

178
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,950
Hey, we had to prepare the briefing for Chim Sa Bong.

179
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,710
Thank you.

180
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,000
Let's start.

181
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,410
It's a case Cha Soo Yeong brought.

182
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,430
It's a bigger case than expected.

183
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,420
Park Choon Gil, who was first discovered in the hills of Hongwoon-myeon,

184
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,440
looks to have been killed by Lee Jong Soo after being paid off by Bong Yeon Ja,

185
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,860
and was made to look like a suicide.

186
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,400
Section Chief Bang looks to have been killed the same way.

187
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,880
Interrogate Bong Yeon Ja and Lee Jong Soo separately.

188
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,550
You know the prisoner's dilemma?

189
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,740
Get them to confess to the crime without confrontation.

190
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,400
We need a testimony from the first police officer at the scene

191
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,990
in order to hold a corroborative investigation,

192
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,870
so we've requested for him to be dispatched here until the case is solved.

193
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:26,130
His name is Kang Dong Sik, who's Cha Soo Yeong's sunbae from Hongwoon Police Station.

194
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,160
I got it.

195
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,580

196
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,830
Senior Policeman Kang Dong Sik, whom you asked to be dispatched, says he is here downstairs right now.

197
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,190
Okay, bring him up.

198
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,660
Sunbae.

199
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,140
Soo Yeong.

200
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,230
I heard you were dispatched because of Section Chief Bang's case.

201
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,580
They need a statement from the first person on scene and the related files,

202
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,990
so I brought everything.

203
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,180
Okay. Let's go.

204
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,220
Hey.

205
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,380
Is something the matter?

206
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,620
No, why?

207
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,590
You're not your usual self.

208
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,020
Why do you seem so dark?

209
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,230
What is it? Tell me.

210
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,180
Later. I'll tell you in time.

211
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,980
Let's go.

212
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,020
Hurry.

213
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,410
I'm so curious.

214
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,750
Mr. Kim Sang Gil. Mr. Kim Sang Gil.

215
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,030
Who is it?

216
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,200
Are you Kim Sang Gil?

217
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,340
Who are you?

218
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,830
A female detective came by before, right?

219
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,010
Stop coming to see me.

220
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,730
It's hard for me, too.

221
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,370
I want to turn back time, too.

222
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,340

223
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,020
Please leave already!

224
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,840
Your health must not be good.

225
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,380
Living is hell.

226
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:43,370
But... you still pray.

227
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,180
Your rosary is very worn. An important prayer, perhaps?

228
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,390
Are you a detective, too?

229
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,940
It's all in the past.

230
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,650
Kim Sang Gil, it doesn't seem to be only about the hit-and-run accident.

231
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,440
What do you know that you came to see me?

232
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:27,430
Do you remember that doll?

233
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:45,280
Was the child sitting in the back of the car during the accident that day your son?

234
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,840
He was.

235
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,610
It was a prayer for your son.

236
00:24:55,050 --> 00:25:01,310
That child... I abandoned him.

237
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,730

238
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,880
 Yo Han.

239
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,620
 What are you doing here?

240
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,010
 I was looking for you for a long time.

241
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,690
 What is that doll?

242
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,740
 And what is that blood?!

243
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:57,860
 Mom, from now on... this doll is mine.

244
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,380
 Honey, I'm home.

245
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,340
 Honey.

246
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,840
 Oh, Yo Han, what are you doing?

247
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,030
 Honey. Honey!

248
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,900
 Honey, Honey!

249
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,660
After my wife's funeral was over,

250
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,150
I was driving like mad saying to myself I should kill the boy and myself.

251
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:44,760
But on the way, I hit that female detective's mother.

252
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,410
 Close your eyes while eating candy.

253
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,660
 Then it'll all be over.

254
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:32,280
 Yo Han... I don't think I can live with you. Sorry.

255
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,920
Back then, I really...

256
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,720
I couldn't see straight.

257
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:53,590
The child... What is that child's name?

258
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,410
Kim Yo Han.

259
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,780
Kim... Yo Han.

260
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,370

261
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,420
Detective Lee, let's talk.

262
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,850
What does it mean that you gave this to me?

263
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,290

264
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,380
I know that you're Director Choi's person.

265
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,710
I want to be a detective, that's why.

266
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,380
A real detective.

267
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,590
That alone doesn't explain it.

268
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,220
Team Leader, when I was young,

269
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,020
I liked it better outside than inside of a school.

270
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,280
While hanging out outside like that,

271
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:11,670
I nearly ended up going to juvenile hall.

272
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,200
That's when Director Choi helped me.

273
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,520
He even helped me go to college.

274
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,860
To me, he's my savior.

275
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,590
And?

276
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,310
That was it.

277
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:30,020
I did everything he asked while feeling grateful.

278
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,350
It was loyalty.

279
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,690
Though, in the end, he just used me.

280
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,920
So now... I am not really sure where I am supposed to go.

281
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,920
Take the path you want.

282
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,990
From now on, as a detective,

283
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,330
carry out the investigation in the way you believe is right.

284
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,760
What is the evidence that was taken out?

285
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,720
That's... handcuffs.

286
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,150
Handcuffs? The evidence Director Choi wanted to hide was handcuffs?

287
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,690
Yes.

288
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,930
This evidence will only be used to catch that bastard.

289
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,730
And I'll be the only one who'll have knowledge of this for the time being.

290
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,360
Also, a real detective isn't made by someone else.

291
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,900
The case for Eom Soo Tak's corpse on the hill has been closed as an unsolved case.

292
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:53,540
For five years now, why must we continue to do something that makes us tremble?

293
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,230
Of course, we have to do it.

294
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,040
What?

295
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,120
In order to protect the organization,

296
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,910
there has to be some self-sacrifice.

297
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,330
What is left by us doing this?

298
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,400
Once everything comes to light, we'll be discarded.

299
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,410
I guess we don't share the same values.

300
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:25,350
Do you want to see the police in a fragile state like it was five years ago?

301
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,190
Getting beat up from the inside and verbally abused from the outside.

302
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,870
Being despised for being incompetent!

303
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:35,550
I can't stand to see the organization I belong to falter.

304
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:39,400
So? What are you planning to do?

305
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,440
Whatever I can, I'll do.

306
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,580
I'll catch that bastard first no matter what.

307
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,340
You have a good plan in mind?

308
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,800
Information on him that not even Oh Hyeon Jae has.

309
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:05,890
With that card, I'll catch him before Oh Hyeon Jae and cover it up again.

310
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,890
Chim Sa Bong. Bong Yeon Ja, who dealt with a vast amount of money in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong.

311
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,330
Wow, I didn't know I would meet you in person.

312
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:45,150
You started a private loan business in Korea, provided money to civil servants, and threatened them.

313
00:32:54,110 --> 00:33:00,150
Wow. You sure are a big player.

314
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,380
Why did you kill Section Chief Bang?

315
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,900
I didn't kill him.

316
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,980
Then why did you kill Park Choon Gil on the hills of Hongwoon-myeon and make it look like a suicide?

317
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,340
I didn't kill him.

318
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,610
After Park Choon Gil's death, his adopted son, Jong Soo, received inheritance.

319
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:29,010
But why is Jong Soo working at your greenhouse?

320
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,970
Here.

321
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,030
Look at the knots.

322
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,500
The ones on Bang Sang Sik and Park Choon Gil

323
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,940
are just like the knots you make on your manure burlap bags.

324
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,360
You're laughing?

325
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,550
Think about it.

326
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,840
An old lady like me without any strength,

327
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,490
how could I kill those men?

328
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:08,830
Also, I never knew how scary that kid, Jong Soo, was.

329
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,720
Excuse me.

330
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,500
The villagers told me that if someone borrows money from you and doesn't pay back,

331
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,380
that the person disappears without a trace after handing over notarized agreements

332
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,200
that he'll hand over the deeds to his houses and land.

333
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,240
That's all gossip.

334
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,380
I didn't want to say this,

335
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,330
but Lee Jong Soo admitted everything.

336
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,460
If you don't want to die in jail, tell us the truth.

337
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,350
W-What did Lee Jong Soo admit?

338
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,420
Everything.

339
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,990
Chim Sa Bong told you everything?

340
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,930
So why don't you come clean, too,

341
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,360
and receive a reduced sentence?

342
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,720
Chim Sa Bong admitted to Section Chief Bang, too?

343
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,640
Not him. Honestly.

344
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:21,240
Park Choon Gil or Section Chief Bang, I don't know anything.

345
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,900
There's no reason for me to kill them.

346
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,100
Oh, especially Section Chief Bang,

347
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,950
I could have used him to my advantage for a long, long time.

348
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,310
Why would I kill him?

349
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,820
She's keeps denying it until the end.

350
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,630
Team Leader.

351
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,680
Yes?

352
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,650
Right.

353
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,530
What should we do about him?

354
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,400
Tell him to be on standby until Bong Yeon Ja case's is resolved.

355
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,610
I'll make a formal request to Hongwoon Police Station.

356
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,050
Hwang Ha Yeong.

357
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,490
Yeah, Hyung. 
  (some women use this term when they're close friends with an older male, especially in a male dominated environment)

358
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,120
Let's speak casually without rank for the first time in five years.

359
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,470
What's up with you these days? Is something going on?

360
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,150
No.

361
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,740
That's not true. Why are you pretending?

362
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,260
- What do you mean? 
 - As if you're all right.

363
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,110
When you don't look okay.

364
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,830
Also, don't disappear like how you did five years ago.

365
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,410
You know, right?

366
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,400
My phone is always on.

367
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,690

368
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,060

369
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,150

370
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,420

371
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,010

372
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,900

373
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,010
Onju orphanage?

374
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,600
Onju orphanage.

375
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,650
If they grew up in the same orphanage...

376
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,640
Is he currently able to communicate?

377
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,520
 Yes. He can handle simple conversations.

378
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,770
Okay. Please continue to maintain security.

379
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,970
He's a suspect in an important case.

380
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:59,050
Other than me, who's in charge of the case, you can't let anyone else know.

381
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,880
Don't let anyone in, nor let any other detectives know.

382
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,060
 Okay.

383
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,320
 If Shin Gyeong Soo is being controlled by someone...

384
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,510
 That would be the real culprit.

385
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,010
Kim Sang Gil's son is the bastard.

386
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,410
His name is Kim Yo Han. He disappeared 20 years ago.

387
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,020
 Kim Sang Gil doesn't know anything about him.

388
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,740
If he grew up in an orphanage because of that,

389
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,380
he could have grown up with Shin Gyeong Soo.

390
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,730
 Shin Gyeong Soo grew up at a place called Onju Orphanage.

391
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,160
Onju Orphanage...

392
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,130

393
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,910
Let's talk for a moment.

394
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,910
Shin Gyeong Soo is being controlled by the bastard.

395
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,110
I'm sure they knew each other.

396
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:43,690
When he finds out that Shin Gyeong Soo is awake,

397
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,440
he might come to kill him.

398
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,300
You want to set a trap using Shin Gyeong Soo as bait?

399
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,750
I want the trap to be set densely.

400
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,550
Also give me the information on that bastard related to the handcuffs.

401
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,390
Team Leader Hwang, how did you...

402
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,780
We're running out of time.

403
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,800
Until he was 14 years old, Shin Gyeong Soo

404
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,470
grew up at Onju Orphanage which was run by a Catholic foundation.

405
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,090
The bastard probably had nowhere to go but to an orphanage too.

406
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,720
If he grew up with Shin Gyeong Soo,

407
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,840
it's not a simple case of gas-lighting.

408
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,090
They're much more intimately connected.

409
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,140
Like communicated insanity.

410
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,910
Communicated insanity?

411
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:29,010
A shared consciousness... It's a symptom where they have the same delusions.

412
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,170

413
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,830

414
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,650
What brings you here?

415
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,360
We're from the Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency's Investigation Unit.

416
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,570
We heard the director has been here the longest.

417
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:09,700
Would it be possible to see him right now?

418
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,580
Oh, he won't be able to answer very well due to Alzheimer's.

419
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,800
I ask for your understanding.

420
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,790
Of course.

421
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,100
- Director, it's me. 
 - Who?

422
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:40,350
- Dominique. 
 - Oh, Dominique.

423
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,950
We have guests.

424
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,380
They're detectives.

425
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,320
They have some questions for you.

426
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,890
Hello, Director.

427
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,300
I'm Detective Cha Soo Yeong from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

428
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,140
We came to ask a few things about a case we're investigating.

429
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,890
It was a long time ago so you may not remember,

430
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,620
but about 20 years ago, did a child named Kim Yo Han

431
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,930
come to this orphanage?

432
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,440
Yo Han.

433
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,860
I knew this day would come some day.

434
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,710
Pardon?

435
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:36,190
I have looked after many kids in my life,

436
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:40,440
but there was no one odd like him.

437
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,930
That's interesting, Father.

438
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,440
Father, what kind of a child was he?

439
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,310
He was very different.

440
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,420
 Over here! Kick it!

441
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,410
 - Hey, we're going first. 
 - We're going.

442
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,730
- That kid...
  - Yo Han!

443
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,390
He had a knack for drawing people to him.

444
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:11,070
The three of them always went around together.

445
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:16,290
Even siblings couldn't be that close.

446
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:21,330
By chance, do you have any photos left of them?

447
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,540
The kid holding the doll. It is him.

448
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,490
Really, the three of them were so eccentric.

449
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:51,470
 Who pushed him? Who pushed Daniel?

450
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,010
 Daniel could die!

451
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,910
 - I did it. 
 - What?

452
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,500
 Yo Han, you tell me.

453
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,020
 Who did it, Yo Han?

454
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:08,460
 - Father, stop bothering Gyeong Soo and Yo Han. 
 - What?

455
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,310
 - It's all my doing. 
 - What?

456
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,800
Yo Han was Luciel, Gyeong Soo was Gabriel,

457
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,730
and Jeong Hwan was Michael.

458
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:25,070
Yo Han was Luciel, Gyeong Soo was Gabriel,

459
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,700
and Jeong Hwan was Michael.

460
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,450
Luciel is a fallen angel, Gabriel delivers news,

461
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,890
and Michael symbolizes an army.

462
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,650
If Jeong Hwan is Michael,

463
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:43,380
he must have protected the other two.

464
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,810
How did you know?

465
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:52,090
Jeong Hwan... cared about Yo Han and Gyeong Soo extremely.

466
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,920
But more so, Yo Han.

467
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:00,760
Father, the kid holding the doll.

468
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,950
Is he Yo Han?

469
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,540
Yes. The one on the right is Gyeong Soo.

470
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,540
Shin Gyeong Soo?

471
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,910
Where's Kim Yo Han right now?

472
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:14,930
He was adopted by a couple.

473
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:18,310
They lived in Dol Ak Valley, as I recall.

474
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,290
Dol Ak Valley?

475
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,720
 I saw Dol Ak.

476
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,620

477
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,650
And the last kid here is Jeong Hwan then?

478
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,100
- Where is he right now? 
 - Huh?

479
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:39,080
You met Jeong Hwan a moment ago.

480
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,650
Dominique is Jeong Hwan.

481
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,330
Father, where's Father Dominique?

482
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,820
- He went to his room earlier. 
 - Where's his room?

483
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,550
Go around this way. It's the last one on the second floor.

484
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,930
Search here.

485
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,240
Cha Soo Yeong. It's a Matryoshka doll.

486
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,240
Shin Gyeong Soo and Dominique followed that bastard.

487
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,930
Even after they went out into the society, they didn't let go of each other.

488
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:58,720
Especially Dominique, he would have done everything the bastard asked of him.

489
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,570
Can you recall this building? Try.

490
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,580

491
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,670

492
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,490
It's the hospital where Shin Gyeong Soo was admitted.

493
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,280
A hospital?

494
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,750
As expected, Dominique continuously kept his eye on Shin Gyeong Soo

495
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,850
because the bastard asked him to.

496
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,960
Shin Gyeong Soo is in a coma right now.

497
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,160
Shin Gyeong Soo...

498
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,300
He's awake.

499
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,930
Mr. Shin Gyeon Soo, it's time for your—

500
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,800
It's an emergency! Shin Gyeong Soo has disappeared right now!

501
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,090
- What? 
 - What?

502
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,120
Yes? What did you say?

503
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,910
Shin Gyeong Soo ran away? We'll be right there.

504
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,790
- What are you talking about? 
 - Shin Gyeong Soo ran away from the hospital.

505
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,470
A guy who was in a coma?

506
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,750
Call Team Leader and Cha Soo Yeong.

507
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,400
Yes, sir.

508
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,820
 The customer's phone is turned off—

509
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,510
Team Leader's phone is off.

510
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,930
Let's go to the hospital first.

511
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,580
Shin Gyeong Soo disappeared from the hospital.

512
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,040
He couldn't have gone far. Find him quickly!

513
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,720
Yes, Detective Jang?

514
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,740
 Hey Cha Soo Yeong, Shin Gyeong Soo ran away.

515
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,000
 Quickly come to the hospital and provide backup.

516
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,990
Yes, I understand.

517
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,120
They said Shin Gyeong Soo ran away.

518
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,430
What happened?  He was in a coma. Why would he suddenly run away?

519
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:44,250
He didn't suddenly run away. He woke up earlier.

520
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:50,060
Then that means, we weren't told that he had gained consciousness?

521
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,150
Someone planned it.

522
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:54,580
It means someone came up with a game plan.

523
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,760
 A suspect of a murder case has escaped.

524
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,920
 He escaped from the hospital. Asking for backup.

525
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,160
That bastard knew I would wake up.

526
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,950
There was a place he told me to come to when I woke up.

527
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,980
 Get me out of here.

528
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,110
 Then... I'll take you to where you can meet the bastard.

529
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,560
 Fine.

530
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,340
 But... how will you get me out of here?

531
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,140
 I'll take care of it.

532
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,020
 - Any news from headquarters?
 - Not yet.

533
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,990
 - Find out.
 - Yes, ma'am.

534
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,030
 - Officer Kim, come with me. 
 - Yes.

535
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,600
 Don't get any ideas. Take me to that bastard.

536
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,910
 You'll meet him soon.

537
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:18,210
 But keep your promise. That you'll give me freedom.

538
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,190
Go in first.

539
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:50,470
 You must be looking for me. I'm Dominique.

540
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,090
Detective Yang!

541
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,840
Hey, Cha Soo Yeong! Where have you been?

542
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,710
I was out with Detective Oh.

543
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,220
- Where is he? 
 - He's tending to another matter.

544
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,380
What the hell is going on?

545
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,570
- Where's Team Leader? 
 - Her phone is still turned off.

546
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:10,170
Oh, this is so frustrating.

547
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,840
Anyway, in Shin Gyeong Soo's physical state, he can't have gone outside of the hospital.

548
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,110
I'll search the exits thoroughly with Detective Jang,

549
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,410
so you two go to the security office and find out what's happening.

550
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,580
Okay.

551
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:24,460
What are you? Are you his lackey?

552
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,930
 That's the wrong question, Detective Oh Hyeon Jae.

553
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,570
The three of us are of one body.

554
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,520
You can't catch Gyeong Soo.

555
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,660
You have a more important task.

556
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,760
Continue.

557
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:48,050
Aren't you curious about who wanted Han Isu dead?

558
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,130
Turn around.

559
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,020
 Tell me one person whom you want to kill.

560
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:15,980
If you catch me, I'll let you hear the rest.

561
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,810
We just have to go a little further.

562
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,300
Don't play any tricks.

563
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,780
What are you guys planning?

564
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,400
You're impatient.

565
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,600
Tell me.

566
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:31,750
Yes. Everything that happened today was Yo Han's plan.

567
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,690
You, me, and everyone

568
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,120
are in the palm of his hands.

569
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,790
But you know something?

570
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,190
At the critical moment when you have to tell someone about me,

571
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:53,610
At the critical moment when you have to tell someone about me,

572
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,210
you'll protect me, right?

573
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:56,990
you'll protect me, right?

574
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:00,020
Even if it means putting your lives on the line!

575
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,170
Even if it means putting your lives on the line!

576
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,480
What do you mean?

577
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,760
What are you doing?

578
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,380
What are you doing?

579
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,990
The drug that will save me.

580
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,860
We are one.

581
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:44,560
My will is Yo Han's will.

582
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,560
Everything is...

583
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:59,680
Yo Han's will.

584
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,270
But, you punk,

585
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,580
where is that bastard right now?

586
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:38,180
Yo Han was right.

587
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,780
If I talk about Han Isu,

588
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,080
that you wouldn't go to

589
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,540
Shin Gyeong Soo.

590
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:43,010

591
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,870
Detective Yang, it's me.

592
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:49,950
Shin Gyeong Soo is dead.

593
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,480
I'm at the Joonggeon three-way intersection.

594
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:10,350
Team Leader, are you okay?

595
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:12,770
- Detective Jang and Lee, take care of the scene. 
 - Okay.

596
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,350
Are you okay?

597
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,940
Something's happened.

598
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,580
What's going on?

599
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,760
Please restrict the area well.

600
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:54,640
What happened?

601
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,840
I caught Shin Gyeong Soo when he was running away,

602
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,700
and we got into an accident while I was taking him with me.

603
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,550
Hwang Ha Yeong.

604
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,560
Fine.

605
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,460
I know you came up with this game plan.

606
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,890
I could have caught him,

607
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,790
but I lost him.

608
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:51,530
No. You weren't going to be able to catch him from the first place.

609
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:56,020
That bastard just cut off his tail, that's all.

610
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:58,330
 They're the handcuffs that Oh Hyeon Jae put on that bastard five years ago.

611
01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:59,890
 But that bastard...

612
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:04,010

613
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:14,070
 He took off the handcuffs that Oh Hyeon Jae put on him.

614
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:19,330
 It means he had the key for the cuffs that were distributed that year.

615
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,140
 That bastard...

616
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,740

617
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,100
 is a policeman.

618
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,100
 Hurry!

619
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,170
 Over here!

620
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,390
 Please stay out. Please stay out.

621
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:22,450
 Please stay out. Please stay out.

622
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,930
 It's dangerous here.

623
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:27,200
 Please stay out. Please stay out.

624
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,580
 Please stay out.

625
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:48,620

626
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,940

627
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,790
 How is the bastard who died five years ago still walking around right now?

628
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:08,110
 It's interesting, isn't it?

629
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,650
 The cause of death for both of them is the same.

630
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,940
 They were both poisoned with potassium cyanide.

631
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,750
 They both committed suicide.

632
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:17,970
 This reminds me of the saying "keep your friends close and your enemies closer."

633
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:20,090
 If Detective Oh was his usual self,

634
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,480
 he wouldn't have shared information.

635
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,820
 Why did he do that?

636
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:27,250
 I can see an outline of you. Just wait.

637
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,170
 We'll meet soon.
