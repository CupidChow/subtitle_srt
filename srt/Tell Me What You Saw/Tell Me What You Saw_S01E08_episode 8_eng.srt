1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,280

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,800

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,390

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,130

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,310

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,660

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,030

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,680

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,720

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,300

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,210
Okay, got it.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,410
Back up will arrive soon.

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,140
Detective Cha and I will go this way.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,150
We'll go this way.

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,810

16
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,470
Team Leader, here.

17
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,010
Yoo Bin!

18
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,620
Where are you right now?

19
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,300
We have to go home.

20
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,940
If you're not with Mommy,

21
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,250
the bad guys might get you.

22
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,680
You have to be by my side.

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,250
That way I can protect you.

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Yoo Bin.

25
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,380
There was someone here until a moment ago.

26
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,830
I think Hyeon Soo tried to call Detective Cha from here.

27
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,920
Team Leader, I think these are sleeping pills.

28
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,030
For a child, even a small dose would be lethal.

29
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,190
Team Leader.

30
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,380
What is this?

31
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,040
We have to find Hyeon Soo quickly.

32
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:35,300

33
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,540
Yoo Bin!

34
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,450
Yoo Bin.

35
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,740
You... you can't play here.

36
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,030
Last time, you got lost while playing here!

37
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,320
Yoo Bin.

38
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,960
Are you really not going to come out?

39
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,040
Yoo Bin.

40
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,330
Where were you?

41
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,670
I looked for you for a long time.

42
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,340
Let's go home quickly, okay?

43
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,220
You go that way.

44
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,940
You can't disappoint me like this.

45
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,010
I've been so nice to you.

46
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,360
Come with me, okay?

47
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,490
I'm begging you like this.

48
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,290
You are Yoo Bin.

49
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,010
My son Yoo Bin!

50
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,580
If it's what you want, I can do anything!

51
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,140
For your sake, I can really do anything!

52
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,430
Come with me quickly, okay?

53
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,090
He's not here.

54
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,990
Where are you?

55
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,890
 Oh Hyeon Jae!

56
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,950
Oh Hyeon Jae! Hyeon Jae! Hyeon Jae!

57
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,560
Isu.

58
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,050
Hyeon Soo!

59
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,480
I found Hyeon Soo! He's on the roof.

60
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,460
Hyeon Soo! Hyeon Soo!

61
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,440
Hyeon Soo, are you okay?

62
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm here now. Everything will be okay.

63
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,950
Is your injury okay?

64
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,980
Kim Na Hui.

65
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,370
Give me back my son.

66
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,550
I'm begging you.

67
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,210
Kim Na Hui, I know you're looking for Yoo Bin.

68
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,270
That's why you saved Hyeon Soo from the kidnapper. Isn't that right?

69
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,630
The one I saved was Yoo Bin.

70
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,960
Still, thanks to you, Hyeon Soo is alive.

71
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,000
But that's as far as you should go.

72
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,980
Get away from my son!

73
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,150
I won't let you be!

74
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,800
Let go.

75
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,080
Stop now.

76
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,720
Stop what?

77
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,340
Your son died five years ago.

78
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,500
Accept it.

79
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,690
What are you saying?

80
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,740
My Yoo Bin is right here.

81
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,560
That child is Hyeon Soo.

82
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,550
Come out of your delusion now.

83
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,510
No! No!

84
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,980
You guys are lying! Stop lying!

85
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,970
Stop!

86
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,870
Let's be honest now.

87
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,430
You already know, don't you?

88
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,910
Yoo Bin...

89
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,390
My Yoo Bin is there.

90
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,940
Look at my Yoo Bin.

91
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,770
My Yoo Bin is here.

92
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,450
Who can help get him out?

93
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,090
Give me back my son.

94
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,960
Look at my Yoo Bin.

95
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,960
You can see my Yoo Bin too.

96
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,180
Yes, I can see him.

97
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,970
Look carefully.

98
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,770
Because his mom is having a hard time, he can't leave.

99
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,040
His mom is feeling so lonely and having such a hard time.

100
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,060
Are you going to keep him like this?

101
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,430
Let him go now.

102
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,720
Tell him that you will be okay

103
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,000
and will start over.

104
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,350
Only then will he be able to leave in peace.

105
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,570
Send him off.

106
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:27,950
Kim Na Hui, you are under arrest for child kidnapping, murdering No Sang Cheol, and abandoning his corpse.

107
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,470
Let's go.

108
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,700
I'm sorry. I came too late, didn't I?

109
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,500
 No, I knew that you would come.

110
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,990
I also knew that you would endure well.

111
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,400
Hyung-nim, why do I feel so sad?

112
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,990
Sad, my ass.

113
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,080
I'm sad for myself. I can't even go home.

114
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,620
 It's a secret.

115
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,590
What is?

116
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,940
 I saw Yoo Bin inside.

117
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,690
 Maybe I saw wrong?

118
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,980
Yoo Bin was probably protecting you.

119
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,510
What are you thinking about?

120
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,350
How much a person's pain can continue to make one suffer.

121
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,680
Inside the snow globe in Kim Na Hui's office was Yoo Bin's ashes.

122
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,800
She was stuck in the past.

123
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:18,140
Kim Na Hui seemed to believe Yoo Bin was still alive.

124
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,440
And Hyeon Soo also said he saw Yoo Bin inside.

125
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,940
 Isu...

126
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,060
Everyone has pain.

127
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,030
The mirror just showed that.

128
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,050
Thank you.

129
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,530
For helping me find Hyeon Soo.

130
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,890
If you still need me,

131
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,560
I'll accept the offer you made.

132
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,970
Good job.

133
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,200

134
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,220

135
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,930

136
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,090
Gil Hyeon Soo is currently in the hospital to stabilize his mental and physical status.

137
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,110
Fortunately, according to the doctor,

138
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,560
he will be fine once he gets some rest for a few days.

139
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,390
The police, not for one moment, not for one second,

140
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,120
gave up hope for Hyeon Soo.

141
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,600
Thank you.

142
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,760
As the saying goes, the bear does the tricks, and Mr. Wang collects the money.

143
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,570
Then you be Mr. Wang.

144
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,360
Right?

145
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,420
I thought I'd see you at the National Police Agency.

146
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,170
Sorry.

147
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,030
You did well in saving Hyeon Soo.

148
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,140
It was luck.

149
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,090
When you reappeared, you caused a stir.

150
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,120
I told them to resolve it quietly.

151
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,130
The world doesn't know about our relationship, Commissioner.

152
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,420
It's more like the world doesn't know my relationship to Isu.

153
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,200
When my friend died, Isu was in high school, I think.

154
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,100
I made a promise at my friend's funeral

155
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,160
that I'd watch over his daughter well.

156
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,180
Stop fighting it. Return to work.

157
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,520
We needed to recruit an analyst for the Metropolitan Investigation Unit anyway.

158
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,040

159
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,800
 It's a duo, and it's an execution.

160
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,760
 The two of them went around cutting people's throats with a Chinese knife.

161
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,330
 The victims died after getting their necks and legs cut off while running away.

162
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,620
 And this victim right here,

163
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,060
 he was still breathing for a long time.

164
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,410
 Listen carefully. You have to look through the eyes of the assailants.

165
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,220
 With their logic, through their eyes.

166
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,880
 You're back?

167
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,470
  How was today's case?

168
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,460
  Well, we found a lot of dead bodies. Just a sec.

169
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,060
  You can't just call them dead bodies.

170
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:15,600
  They could be someone's sons or daughters, their family members.

171
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,440
 It was hard for you, wasn't it?

172
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,910
 Good job.

173
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,280
 Let's get some rest.

174
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,620
So you've decided to return to work?

175
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,750
When I went to Shin Gyeong Soo's house,

176
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,700
there were still signs of wiretapping.

177
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,610
If Shin Gyeong Soo is being controlled by someone...

178
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,380
That would be the real culprit.

179
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,840
And?

180
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,260
I have to start again,

181
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,990
while being exposed to him.

182
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,490
As a team member of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

183
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,420
That's right.

184
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,910
From the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

185
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,160

186
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,630

187
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,610

188
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,290

189
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,180

190
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,750
I should have realized it when Isu's case was covered up.

191
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,120
Where Oh Hyeon Jae was living was a secret safe house, too.

192
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,210
I couldn't have imagined the Commissioner's relationship to Oh Hyeon Jae's former fiancée.

193
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,000
At least we know now.

194
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,010
We are on the same team, aren't we?

195
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,540
Of course. I'm not suspicious of you at all.

196
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,740
Since you have a lot to lose.

197
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,010
Oh, why is this so heavy?

198
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,040
It weighs a ton.

199
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,210
Hey, are you sure?

200
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,870
That it's bigger than the other place?

201
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,450
It's the same.

202
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,730
Get out of the way. What's wrong with it?

203
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,350
There's a bathroom and a window in here.

204
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,060
It's pretty much a suite.

205
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,210
You told your father you were moving into a studio.

206
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,660
That's why I came up to help you move.

207
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,340
What am I supposed to tell him when I get back?

208
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,220
You know that thing you're good at. The awkward sign language.

209
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,430
You're so mean.

210
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,320
Wow. This is basically a suite.

211
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,680
Well...

212
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,980
You can't have boyfriends over.

213
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,320
Oh, he's not my boy—

214
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,370
The manager is weird as well as the room.

215
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,010

216
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,290
Leave my things alone.

217
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,920
You think I don't know you went into the Metropolitan Investigation Unit because of your mother?

218
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,620
You're too quick.

219
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,040
Have you investigated at all?

220
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,520
You wrote some stuff down.

221
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,400
Any results?

222
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,710
Not yet.

223
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,590
I'm sure you'll catch the hit-and-run guy.

224
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,510
He's probably living very well somewhere. Bastard.

225
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,380
Cheer up, Cha Soo Yeong! Cheer up!

226
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,740
But, Soo Yeong,

227
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,310
when are we eating jjajangmyeon? 
  (Black bean noodles)

228
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,050
What did you do to deserve that?

229
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,350
What did I do? Not much I guess.

230
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,200
I'll get going.

231
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,640
Oh, fine. Let's eat sweet and sour pork, too.

232
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,860
Nice! Sweet and sour pork!

233
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,750

234
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,440

235
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,870
I disapprove. What about you, Detective Lee?

236
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,690
Do we have to do this?

237
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,600
I approve.

238
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,950
Just disapprove!

239
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,930
Two for disapproval.

240
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,560
Why are you against it?

241
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,330
Hyung-nim! Listen.

242
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,290
You've been second-in-command in Team 1.

243
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,240
But what happens when Detective Oh comes back?

244
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,300
Rank will get all screwed up! Why are you so naive?

245
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,760
- Disapprove. 
 - Right?

246
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,090
Just because I disapprove, it's not like he won't come.

247
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,370
But your voice was shaking a little. It was.

248
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,400
Oh, w-w-wait a minute.

249
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,750
Detective Oh is coming? To where?

250
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,240
Wow, you're so out of the loop after taking the day off to move yesterday.

251
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,110
Detective Oh!

252
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,860
There's a rumor going around he's coming to Team 1 after getting reinstated yesterday.

253
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,870
Really?

254
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,460
Yes. Why would we lie?

255
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,120

256
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,620
What, you bastard?

257
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,420
The victim is Choo Won Pyeong, the second-in-command of the Sinwol faction.

258
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,650
Who found him first?

259
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,000
The security guard.

260
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,230
Anything significant?

261
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,920
The money he collected wasn't taken.

262
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,400
I think it's retaliation.

263
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,890
He just became second-in-command.

264
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,380
Why does it seem like he has a complicated backstory?

265
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,690
It looks like retaliation between two factions.

266
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,410
It's going to be a headache.

267
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:02,070
That's why the local precinct called the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

268
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,450
Something's strange. Murderers don't usually display their crime this way.

269
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,820
Look carefully. The first impression is the most important in a crime scene.

270
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,690
I will.

271
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,910
It looks like the claw machine game.

272
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,490
But, Hyung-nim, where's Detective Oh?

273
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,130
He's flying solo as soon as he gets back to work.

274
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,380
The rumors were true about him being "die alone".

275
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,080
Why don't you ask Team Leader directly?

276
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,300
I mean, there should have been an initiation and an exchange of our greetings.

277
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
Isn't that the order of things?

278
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,760
Cha Soo Yeong, you got a call, didn't you?

279
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,990
He's on his way right now.

280
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:59,640
What's the matter with him?

281
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,390
What happened to him?

282
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,010
Are you okay?

283
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,250
Team Leader!

284
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,000
What happened to him?

285
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,930
He's dead.

286
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,400
Two murders in one day.

287
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,520
It's from excessive bleeding. There are no stab wounds.

288
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,860
The cause of death is the same as that of Choo Won Pyeong, who was killed at the waste disposal facility.

289
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,980
It's vascular poisoning, making him bleed out of every orifice in his body.

290
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,730
He has the same needle mark behind his left ear,

291
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,480
and he's a member of the Sinwol faction.

292
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,720
It's terrible.

293
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,080
What happened?

294
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,410
Catch him!

295
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,160
Hey, stop, you bastard!

296
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,680
Seriously, this rat-like bastard.

297
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,770
Where did he hide?

298
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,330
Hey!

299
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,610
- Have you looked carefully? 
 - Where the hell did he go?

300
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,000
Are we going to search all night? Find him quickly!

301
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,560
- You haven't found him? 
 - No, sir.

302
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,570
Hurry to find him and bring him to me.

303
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,430
Yes, sir.

304
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,870
We have to find him before the police.

305
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,800
Yes, sir.

306
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,350

307
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,650
This case appears to be crimes of murder between

308
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,120
the old and the new factions over the rights of Haewol-dong.

309
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,990
Both Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun are members of the Sinwol faction.

310
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,380
The cause of death is from shock caused by excessive bleeding. What about the type of poison?

311
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,400
It's crotalotoxin. Poison from venomous rattlesnakes.

312
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,790
- Check all the stores, distribution channels, and buyers.
 - Yes.

313
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:52,570
- Any suspects? 
 - The most likely suspect is the Guwol faction leader, Ha Tae Sik.

314
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,600
Recently, the Sinwol faction has been aggressively expanding its influence.

315
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,450
It looks like Ha Tae Sik felt threatened and committed the crime.

316
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,960
These days, gangs don't openly commit murder.

317
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,510
It creates unnecessary noise in their neighborhood and disturbs their business.

318
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,240
During the estimated time of the first crime, Ha Tae Sik's car was seen near its location.

319
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,120
The second murder also took place within Ha Tae Sik's territory.

320
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,410
That's circumstantial evidence. Any others?

321
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,520
They're still being identified.

322
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,340
The similarities between the two crimes are poison and Ha Tae Sik.

323
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,200
There's a risk of Ha Tae Sik fleeing.

324
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,330
Put out an all-points bulletin, and Detective Lee, request a warrant.

325
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,000
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,980
Hey, Detective Lee, where's Detective Cha?

327
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,710
She's at the site with Detective Oh.

328
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,560
Hey, still, it's a group meeting.

329
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,230
The rumors were true.

330
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,950
I heard he doesn't do teamwork.

331
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,510
As soon as he's back, he goes at it alone.

332
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,960
What are you complaining about?

333
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,870
Get ready to mobilize, punk.

334
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:52,200
- Like a wet chicken. 
 - There's no hope of going home for a while.

335
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,100
But, where are we going?

336
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,190
We're nearly there.

337
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,130

338
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,210

339
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,090
What brings you here?

340
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,290
Is Jo Bang Man around?

341
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,010
What? Jo Bang Man?

342
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,920
How dare you call my boss that way?

343
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,490
It's been a while.

344
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,270
Well... I did hear that you were back at work.

345
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,650
But what brings you here?

346
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,700
Last night, here in Haewol-dong,

347
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,170
Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun turned up dead.

348
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:57,490
If you know anything, tell me.

349
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,540
They were originally part of the Guwol faction.

350
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,760
But then they betrayed and went over to the Sinwol faction.

351
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,120
 Let's do well, okay? Cheers!

352
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,200
But it's been some time since they betrayed.

353
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,490
And?

354
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,160
Well, I don't know much!

355
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,040
But it is strange.

356
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,860
Usually if it's a fight between two factions, there should be an uproar,

357
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,000
but it's too quiet.

358
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,180
What's Ha Tae Sik saying?

359
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,940
After losing his territory to the Sinwol faction,

360
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,770
he's been quiet.

361
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,870
Who is that next to you?

362
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,990
- Me? 
 - Yes.

363
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,360
I'm a detective.

364
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,410
- Huh? 
 - Pardon?

365
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:48,300
Jo Bang Man, if you see anyone slightly suspicious in Haewol-dong,

366
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,400
contact Detective Cha. Got it?

367
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:58,340
Oh, Hyung-nim! I have my own image to think about!

368
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,410
Of course, I will contact her.

369
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,900
Okay.

370
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,720
Yes, this is Detective Lee Ji Min of Team 1 at Mucheon Metropolitan Agency.

371
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,460
Pardon? Surrender?

372
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:21,430
Detective Yang, Ha Tae Sik is coming to turn himself in.

373
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,560
Who?

374
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,900
Ha Tae Sik. He said he's on his way right now.

375
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,590
- What is it? 
 - The thing is...

376
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:39,220
Ha Tae Sik is... on his way to turn himself in.

377
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,170
Right now?

378
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,730
Hey, hey! Isn't that Ha Tae Sik?

379
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,540
Ha Tae Sik...

380
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,730
I killed them.

381
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,710
Mr. Ha Tae Sik,

382
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,340
you are aware it's a considerable charge for murdering and abandoning the bodies of Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun?

383
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,580
You're being taken into custody at 11 a.m. on the 27th.

384
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,780
You have the right to defend, to appoint a lawyer,

385
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,170
and you have the right to refuse to answer questions.

386
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Let's go.

387
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,120
What?

388
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,480
Ha Tae Sik turned himself in?

389
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,080
Okay.

390
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,250
Ha Tae Sik...

391
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,170
What's he thinking?

392
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:20,150
January 19, 1968. You're Ha Tae Sik, right?

393
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:29,480
You've been arrested for the murder of Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun.

394
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,370
You have the right to refuse to give self-incriminating statements and the right to have a lawyer's assistance.

395
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,610
Now, Mr. Ha Tae Sik,

396
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:44,150
where were you on February 26, 2020, between 9 p.m. and midnight?

397
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,660
Look at this.

398
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,330
It's your car, correct?

399
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,170
It was photographed in the vicinity of the crime during the time of murder.

400
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,480
Why did you kill Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun?

401
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,570
Do you admit to the charges?

402
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,360
You're laughing? Is this funny?

403
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,290
Do you not know where you are?

404
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,810
- Detective Yang, please calm down. 
 - Let go.

405
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,160
I will do it.

406
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,210
Hyung-nim, let's go.

407
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,700
He's laughing.

408
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,890
Let's leave.

409
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,650
Him laughing really got on my nerves!

410
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:45,220
Why is he like that after confessing?

411
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,520
The prosecution is one thing,

412
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,180
but you can always retract a confession given during a police investigation.

413
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,450
There's no legal validity with just a confession.

414
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,940
We have to file an arrest warrant within 48 hours.

415
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,420
Chief, what brings you here?

416
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,650
Did you get anything?

417
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,970
He hasn't said anything so far.

418
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:13,990
Mr. Ha Tae Sik, why did you come if you weren't going to say anything?

419
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,230
I will talk.

420
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,920
Please call in Oh Hyeon Jae.

421
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,310
What?

422
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,750

423
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,100
The artery was stabbed with a syringe in one shot.

424
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,800
It's the easiest way to kill someone

425
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,990
but also the most brutal.

426
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,230
You feel the poison slowly spreading

427
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,660
throughout the body as you die.

428
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,260
The culprit would have been watching from over there.

429
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,760
What would be the reason they were killed so brutally?

430
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:52,730
As of right now, it's a mixture of staging, showing off of retaliation, and grudge.

431
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,980

432
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,130
It's me.

433
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,650
Ha Tae Sik will only speak to Oh Hyeon Jae? What are you going to do?

434
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,350
He came in willingly and confessed.

435
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,480
What can I do?

436
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,510
If Ha Tae Sik talks, it's all over for us!

437
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,840
The knife is scarier when it's sheathed.

438
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,580
He won't talk about that incident.

439
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,000
What about evidence that he committed the murders?

440
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,380
We have circumstantial evidence,

441
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,290
but it's not conclusive.

442
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,270
I'll call the prosecution.

443
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,330
Hurry up and forward it.

444
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,040
Just why did Ha Tae Sik confess?

445
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,640
If I knew, I wouldn't be sitting here.

446
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,440
He'll only speak to you.

447
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,800
Any reason you can think of?

448
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,590
Affidavit.

449
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,360
It's been a while.

450
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,040
Why did you want to see me?

451
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:51,400
You were going to find me anyway.

452
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:57,440
I could say that I wanted to be interrogated by an old friend.

453
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:05,930
Friend? Right. I hear there are three types of friends.

454
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,750
One who likes me, one who hates me,

455
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,520
and one who has no interest.

456
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,630
I like the second one.

457
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,980
You teach me to be careful.

458
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,990
Listen, Ha Tae Sik,

459
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,370
if you're thinking of leaving here after wasting a little time,

460
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:29,900
coming here on your own will become very uncomfortable for you.

461
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Now, what are you curious about?

462
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,250
You wanted to catch me.

463
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,970
What are you hiding?

464
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,030
If you can figure it out,

465
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,480
I'll tell you what you're curious to know.

466
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,010
Ha Tae Sik is not an easy opponent.

467
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,950
He's been indicted 17 times,

468
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,610
but he's always been freed due to lack of evidence.

469
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:12,970
Why did he want to see Detective Oh?

470
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,300
Finding that out is our job.

471
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,690
- What about evidence? 
 - We're still waiting on autopsy results.

472
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,970
He can't be proven guilty with just a confession and no evidence.

473
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,890
We have to find the evidence.

474
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,860
I think we need to search his office one more time.

475
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,020
There has to be something the forensics team haven't found.

476
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,110
They said they scoured the place.

477
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:49,810
What do we need to find, exactly?

478
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,650
His motivation.

479
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:57,790
 Come up for a minute.

480
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,800
That bastard is a cunning and methodical criminal.

481
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,100
I'm sure he's made himself an exit.

482
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,180
Then we have to plug up that exit.

483
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,060
Detective Cha, come with me.

484
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,620
You wanted to see me?

485
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,110
Report what Oh Hyeon Jae and Ha Tae Sik

486
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,900
are talking about to me without missing a word.

487
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,120
Okay.

488
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,510
Ji Min, don't forget with whose help you became a cop

489
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:44,080
and got to where you are right now.

490
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,540
Yes.

491
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,940
Where did he go?

492
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,240
He's not there.

493
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,140
Where did he run off to now?

494
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,480
Look through everything!

495
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,000
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

496
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,260
Gosh, Ha Tae Sik.

497
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,540
What did we miss?

498
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,370
- Team Leader. 
 - What?

499
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,940
There's something in here.

500
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,030
Crotalotoxin?

501
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:02,700
It's the same poison that killed Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun.

502
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,020
I found evidence.

503
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,730
I'll stop by the NFS and come back.

504
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,310

505
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,450
You're back.

506
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,190
Detective Cha, go in and take over.

507
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,880
Okay.

508
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,170
Did you find evidence that I am the culprit?

509
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,050
In a fish tank.

510
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,520
I killed them.

511
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,770
They betrayed me, so I couldn't just let them be.

512
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:18,260
Ha Tae Sik, this isn't your style at all.

513
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,010
 Why would you let us find proof on purpose?

514
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,750
This is what makes you Oh Hyeon Jae.

515
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,690
Now, the poison that killed Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun

516
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:36,680
as well as the footprints and fingerprints found on the scene are all obvious evidence.

517
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,230
Anyone could have found them, not just me.

518
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,640
You would have found out eventually anyway.

519
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,920
Maybe I just wanted to be caught by a competent detective?

520
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:59,350
Why do you insist that you're the culprit?

521
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,430
What's the reason you're saying I'm not the culprit?

522
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,560
There's proof.

523
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,670
Isn't this funny?

524
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:10,070
I'm saying that I'm the culprit,

525
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:13,050
and you're saying that I'm not the culprit.

526
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:22,010
 What's this? Why does he keep looking at the tumbler?

527
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:33,910
The evidence that you're showing and the words coming out of your mouth...

528
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,620
I don't believe them at all.

529
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:52,800
Let's stop here for today.

530
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,090
I have my rights.

531
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,010
What should I do?

532
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,930
Send him to the holding cell.

533
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,930
Good work.

534
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:31,720
We have evidence and a confession.

535
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,790
We should forward him to the prosecutor as soon as the autopsy results come out.

536
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,030
There's still a variable.

537
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,200
A variable?

538
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,280
The poison isn't a conclusive evidence.

539
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,280
Same thing with the motive.

540
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,620
He can always change his mind and say that it was a forced confession.

541
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,820
Ha Tae Sik is hiding something.

542
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,010
We have to find that first.

543
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:08,860
Earlier, Ha Tae Sik kept staring at the watch reflected on the tumbler.

544
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,290
What nonsense.

545
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,140
The watch?

546
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,140
He was stalling for time.

547
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:23,840
Ha Tae Sik didn't want Oh Hyeon Jae at the crime scene.

548
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,950
Still, why confess?

549
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,650
The conclusive evidence is

550
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,960
a person.

551
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,560

552
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:45,850
Yes, this is Cha Soo Yeong.

553
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:50,640
Oh, Detective. I looked into it as much as I could,

554
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,220
  and I got something huge!

555
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,430
Mr. Jo Bang Man? What is it?

556
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:01,520
  I heard that the Sinwol  faction is looking for someone like crazy.

557
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,200
I'm not sure who they're looking for though.

558
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,260
Yes. Thank you.

559
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,170
The Sinwol faction is looking for someone.

560
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:13,120
How do you know that?

561
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,530
Well... I have an informant.

562
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,700
How do you have an informant?

563
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,890
The Sinwol faction is looking for someone?

564
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:24,320
It's a witness. There was a witness at the scene of the murder.

565
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,610
A witness?

566
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:29,140
Ha Tae Sik was stalling for time while looking for the witness.

567
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:33,500
But why is the Sinwol faction looking for someone and not the Guwol faction?

568
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,790
We have to find that person first.

569
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,330
For the remainder of the time, the Sinwol faction will be closely monitored.

570
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,120
Okay.

571
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,990

572
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,040
Oh, gosh.

573
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,790
Team Leader, we received a fax from the National Forensic Service.

574
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:12,310
- Hand it over to him. 
 - Okay.

575
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,830
Look, while Choo Won Pyeong was dying,

576
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,110
he left a message.

577
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:41,770
The button that fell from the clothes you're wearing.

578
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:48,510
Oh, the button.

579
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,510
I was wondering where it was.

580
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,270
So it was inside his stomach.

581
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:55,960
It was inside his stomach?

582
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,990
In his stomach?

583
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,990
I never said it was found in the stomach.

584
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,570
The button was found in his throat.

585
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:16,300
That means there's a possibility someone purposely

586
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,390
forced it down Choo Won Pyeong's throat after he died.

587
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,970
Why did they do that?

588
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,340
Why did you do it?

589
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:45,990
I told you I killed him.

590
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,770
Detective Oh, a moment please.

591
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,050
Oh, you're here. Have a seat.

592
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,850
How does it feel to be back?

593
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,800
Why did you want to see me?

594
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,050
You don't need a reason when a higher-up calls on the subordinate.

595
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:33,480
So how is Ha Tae Sik's case going?

596
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,280
Don't you already know everything?

597
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:41,310
Ha Tae Sik is a snake-like bastard.

598
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,260
Since he confessed, you can stop and forward him.

599
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,770
The higher-ups are very interested in this as well.

600
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:49,570
They don't seem to be comfortable about it.

601
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:57,720
Who's at fault that they're not comfortable?

602
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:03,950
Is it because of Ha Tae Sik or because of me?

603
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:15,040
Why would they be uncomfortable when a capable detective has been reinstated?

604
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,350
What's the real reason why you've come back to work?

605
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,960
To protect the lives and property of the people and the well-being of the public, etc.

606
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,680
Let's just say it's because of those.

607
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:42,370
If you have nothing more to say, I'll leave.

608
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,740
Oh Hyeon Jae.

609
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,970
Are you still living in the past?

610
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,010
I got out of it.

611
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:04,430
Because there's work I need to do.

612
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,200
Well then.

613
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:15,090
Gosh, that bastard. Where are we going to find him?

614
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:17,830
Hey, stop right there.

615
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:24,000
Stop! Stop, you bastard!

616
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,050
Stop!

617
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,940
Hey! Stop!

618
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,160
Split up!

619
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,920
Go that way!

620
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,960
Stop!

621
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,020
Hey, you bastard!

622
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,110
Come here.

623
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,490
This punk!

624
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:13,630
Come here.

625
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:19,050
Where did you think you were going?

626
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,450
Hyung-nim, we found him. We'll bring him over.

627
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:37,280
Don't do that! Stop!

628
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,350
Stop! Stop!

629
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:42,420
I'm so hungry.

630
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,270
- What are you guys? 
 - You're newbies, aren't you?

631
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:47,800
You don't know me? Unbelievable.

632
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,450
Spit your gum out, you punk.

633
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:52,090
- Get them! 
 - Damn you.

634
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,960
- Stay still, don't move. 
 - My arm, my arm.

635
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,760
I'm the police.

636
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,760
Are you okay?

637
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:30,970
I saw it.

638
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:33,350
The murder.

639
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,520
Yeah.

640
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,490
Okay.

641
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,120
Good work.

642
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,540
We found the witness.

643
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,210

644
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:14,070
Then, why on earth did Ha Tae Sik need 48 hours?

645
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:16,010
Tell me.

646
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:26,960
Everyone has a secret he wants to hide.

647
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,820
You're right. What is that secret?

648
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:43,770
Five years ago, at Joonggeon three-way intersection,

649
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,740
there is a secret.

650
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:51,940
What could that secret be?

651
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:12,160

652
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,530
♫  Won’t you tell me now  ♫ ♫

653
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:19,200
♫  This game won’t get you out  ♫

654
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,010
♫  Won’t get you out  ♫

655
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:25,320
♫  Silence won’t tell you what to do for you  ♫

656
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,300

657
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,000
 Are you sure it's not that man?

658
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,480
 It wasn’t that man.

659
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,020
 Please make sure he’s caught.

660
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,590
 He turns himself in,

661
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:37,220
 but sends me an alibi and asks me to release him.

662
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,480
 We totally got flipped.

663
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,930
 Why on earth did he need 48 hours?

664
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:46,910
 Then who was the man in the motorcycle helmet Sa Gang mentioned?

665
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:48,560
 It's an unseen truth.

666
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,950
 We nearly missed it.

667
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,150
 You can't always see the truth.

668
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:54,360
 If everything I see isn't the truth,

669
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,790
 what do I look at?

670
01:04:55,790 --> 01:05:00,790
♫  Silence won’t tell you what to do for you  ♫
