1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,380

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,690

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,230

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,130

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,410

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,400

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,990

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,150

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,150
 Where do you think that bastard is right now?

10
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,690
 It could be one of the people here

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,750
 or he could be watching us from someplace else.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,360
 The bastard, who died five years ago, has come back to life and is committing murder.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,950
 Look into Team Leader Hwang.

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,300
 It’s too strange for it to be a coincidence.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,090
 And monitor that person and report back, too.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,880
 Someone is behind Team Leader Hwang. Find out.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,190

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,470
 You have to be careful because that bastard saw you.

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,550
 But you know that female officer?

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,540
 You said it was a little odd.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,970
 Detective Lee, it's me.

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,540
 Among the reporters who have access to the police station, there is a Reporter Lee Bo Gwang.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,860
 Could I get an identity check on him?

24
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,800
 If he didn't take anything,

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,320
 then he must've gotten some information.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,060

27
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,460
 Team Leader, it's me.

28
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,170
 The next target is Detective Oh.

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,180

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:45,360

31
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,400
I couldn't get in touch with Oh Hyeon Jae.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,930
It's all my fault. Detective Oh's location was exposed because of me.

33
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,690
 Team Leader, we're heading to Lee Bo Gwang's address right now.

34
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,250
You never know what could happen. Everyone, be careful.

35
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,610

36
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,950

37
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,820

38
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,580
It's been a while.

39
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,830
Has it been five years?

40
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,460
I finally meet you, Oh Hyeon Jae.

41
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,740
Look here, I need to confirm that you're really that bastard.

42
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,240
How can I prove it so that you'll believe me?

43
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,500
 Cuff one hand to the metal pole next to you.

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,610
 Hurry up!

45
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,250
 That's right.

46
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,900
Where should I cuff the other one?

47
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,550
It'll be interesting for you

48
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,980
if you follow me.

49
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,750
You're the one who made Kang Seung Hwan turn himself in, aren't you?

50
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,080
I needed bait to lure you out.

51
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,850

52
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,860

53
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,230
Look here.

54
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,830
 How about turning yourself in as the grand finale?

55
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,070
You'll become a hero.

56
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,810
Isn't that great?

57
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,410
 Being remembered forever as that bastard.

58
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,370
 I'm the very murderer who killed Go Min Ji.

59
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,890
 The mint serial killer.

60
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,420
It was kind of difficult.

61
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,030
As you know, it was inside the police station.

62
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,950
It was good that you diverted the eyes of the police to Jeong Chan Goo.

63
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:28,160
Jeong Chan Goo didn't die in the ice factory by accident.

64
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,620
A little miscalculation occurred in your plan.

65
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,120
Na Joon Seok was a steppingstone you used to reveal yourself.

66
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,340
But I felt like someone was always chasing me right up to my nose.

67
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,100
Although it should have been impossible.

68
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,780
Because you're in a situation where you could never show yourself in public.

69
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,910
Then I found a woman detective.

70
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,200
But it was kind of weird.

71
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,890
It seemed like someone was behind her.

72
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,580
I kept wondering who it could be.

73
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,140
You followed that woman detective.

74
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,350
Then you met Doctor Ahn and came all the way here.

75
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,140
Isn't that so?

76
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,850
Bingo.

77
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,030
There will be more and more things I'll want to ask you.

78
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,120
That woman detective, the doctor, and everything...

79
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,040
were they all part of your plan?

80
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,950
Wow. You are indeed Oh Hyeon Jae.

81
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,220
But it doesn't matter.

82
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,480
I'm going to kill you here anyway.

83
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,600
Freeze! Put your hands in the air!

84
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,310
Isn't that the smell of formalin?

85
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,270
Look here, I was bored waiting around.

86
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,470
Damn it. You really shocked me.

87
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,830
You completely fooled me.

88
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,120
So this is how it feels to be strangled.

89
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,240
Tighter. Use your strength to squeeze tighter.

90
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,590
Speak.

91
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,230
The real Lee Bo Gwang has been dead for a while.

92
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,930
The suspect seems to have stolen Lee Bo Gwang's identity.

93
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,390
Team Leader, I think he's a psychopath.

94
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,320
Be careful.

95
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,680
Do you know why I'm wearing this?

96
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,000
Because even if I kill you, no one will know.

97
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,120
I haven't left any traces of myself here.

98
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,920
Have you ever felt pain to the point of wanting and preferring death?

99
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,340
The kind of pain that is so horrific and cruel.

100
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,180
Try feeling it once.

101
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,160
Don't worry. I won't kill you yet.

102
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,100
There's something I want to hear from you.

103
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,450
You know Isu, right?

104
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,490
Who told you to kill Isu?

105
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,440
Why was Isu the last one?

106
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,620
Tell me. Then I'll stop the pain.

107
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,980
I'll remove my hand, so tell me. Got it?

108
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,850
Go ahead.

109
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,480
Then feel more pain.

110
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,980
I'll tell you.

111
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,480
I'll tell you.

112
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,880
How's that? Now do you believe me?

113
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,890
So this is how it feels to strangle you.

114
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,260
I was going crazy from curiosity.

115
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,910
You'll never be able to catch me.

116
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,710
Tell me.

117
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,640
Who told you to kill Isu?

118
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,300
That's all I need to hear.

119
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,300
You want to hear it?

120
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,480
Listen well. The person who told me to kill Isu is...

121
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,130
T-This is the third floor of Majin-dong 23.

122
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,120
The suspect has been shot. Please hurry over.

123
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,900

124
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,250
Put your hands up!

125
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,000
Detective Gong, what are you doing here?

126
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,070
What's with your expression?

127
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,190
Are we at a place where we are not supposed to be?

128
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,760
What the? What happened?

129
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,320
He was already in that state when we came.

130
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,570
Hurry please.

131
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,480
Did you plan all this on purpose to catch that bastard?

132
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:44,240
I need to know who told him to kill Isu.

133
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,590
I need to know.

134
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,800
You wanted to know even if it cost you your life?

135
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,040
Am I really living?

136
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,910
Just because I'm breathing?

137
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,410
So did you get the answer that you wanted?

138
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,570
Not yet.

139
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,800

140
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:16,530
How much do you know about me?

141
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,040
Only as much as I need.

142
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,490
Why did you deceive me?

143
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,320
I never deceived you.

144
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,460
You just believed what you wanted to believe.

145
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,880
Were you also at the scene of the Go Min Ji case?

146
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,440
Yes.

147
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,300
Then why did you need me in the first place?

148
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,940
Because I needed people to believe that I had disappeared.

149
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,560
So you used me... to lure that bastard out.

150
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,830
You also needed me to join the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

151
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:45,090
We were just on the same page for our own interests.

152
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,800
Thank you for your help all this time.

153
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,960
I don't think I'll be seeing you again.

154
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,660

155
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,430
I'm at the hospital.

156
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,270
We arrested Professor Na's murderer at Oh Hyeon Jae's residence.

157
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,850

158
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,400
I warned you, didn't I?

159
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,390
If you acted by ignoring the organization and protocol, I wouldn't leave you alone.

160
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,010
We've apprehended the suspect.

161
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,090
I had no other choice in order to apprehend him, and the information could've leaked out as well.

162
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,180
So the meager choice you made was to work with a civilian?

163
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,160
- There'll be an investigation for using your gun. 
 - I know.

164
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,550
For illegal wiretapping and leaking investigation data to outsiders as well.

165
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,730

166
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,170
The surgery was successful,

167
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,670
but I think we'll need to monitor his progress.

168
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,170
Were you already aware that Oh Hyeon Jae was physically sound?

169
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,920
Clearly deliver this message to Oh Hyeon Jae.

170
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,430
I will put him in jail for obstruction of justice.

171
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,520

172
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,920

173
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,790

174
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,170
It looks like the time of death was approximately six months ago.

175
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,030
- What was the cause of death? 
 - It wasn't strangulation.

176
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,960
I think I'll know after autopsy.

177
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,440
We've identified him.

178
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,980
His real name is Shin Gyeong Soo. He's 34 years old.

179
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,580
He dropped out of college while majoring in mass communication.

180
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,890
He doesn't have a family.  His residence is not known.

181
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,530
He doesn't have a criminal record.

182
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,410
I think Shin Gyeong Soo killed Lee Bo Gwang

183
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,430
and has been posing as him.

184
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,790
Good work.

185
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,850

186
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,910
 Two days ago, at a clinic in Mucheon City,

187
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,130
 Doctor Ahn was attacked by an unidentified assailant.

188
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,630
 Also on the same day, at a factory outside Mucheon City,

189
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,840
 there was a sound of a gun shot which made citizens very nervous.

190
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,280
 Police stated that it happened while chasing a murder suspect

191
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,360
 and have been quiet about the details.

192
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,470
Yes, Commissioner?

193
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,860
Yes. We're still working on the details.

194
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,980
It's a sensitive issue.

195
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,720
I'll report it privately later.

196
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,500
Who are you?

197
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,550
You are?

198
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,700
I'm the chief investigator at Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency.

199
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,840
Ah, okay.

200
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,070
How is he?

201
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,470
He's barely hanging onto his life right now.

202
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,690
When will he be able to wake up?

203
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,420
We need to interrogate him.

204
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,170
I can't make any guarantees.

205
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,840
There's a chance he might not wake up.

206
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,620
He's the suspect of a major case.

207
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,190
Please keep this confidential.

208
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,750
Yes.

209
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,470
It's me.

210
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,650
What's the situation?

211
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,650
I don't think you need to worry for the time being.

212
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,560
 Everybody is talking only about that bastard on the internet and in the media.

213
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,170
What do you plan to do?

214
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,740
How could I stop the flow of unstable water?

215
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,080
What? Then how are you going to handle Oh Hyeon Jae?

216
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,110
For over-reaction, illegal wiretapping,

217
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,640
leaking inside information, and illegal investigation plans,

218
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,100
we'll have to throw him in jail.

219
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,860
 Do you think I don't know that?

220
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,720
If Oh Hyeon Jae starts spouting nonsense that the corpse that was found five years ago is fake,

221
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,030
 what are you going to do about that?

222
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,420
I'll take care of it.

223
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,370
Gosh.

224
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,580
The position you're sitting in right now

225
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,220
is a seat that I bought you.

226
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,260
Instead of always asking me what to do,

227
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,600
use your own brain to think about what we can do.

228
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,000
Come in.

229
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,510
I've been thinking about

230
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:31,120
why I keep getting half the information from you.

231
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,010

232
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,910
Yes.

233
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,690
Either you were only getting half the information

234
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,240
or you were only telling me half the information.

235
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,510
It must be one or the other.

236
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,860
I did as much as I could—

237
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,690
Think carefully.

238
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,320
Leave.

239
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,400
These punks are playing me?

240
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,850
Wow, your work history is so impressive.

241
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,310
And you're well-acquainted with some heavy hitters.

242
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,900
Oh, you take pills that contain mirtazapine.

243
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,380
Because of depression or insomnia?

244
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,150
Maybe that's why your judgement was clouded?

245
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,820
We can look at the medical certificate for that.

246
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,740
I see you used a gun.

247
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,810
He is someone who killed Kang Seung Hwan, Jeong Chan Goo, and even Professor Na Joon Seok.

248
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,240
It was an emergency situation,

249
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,290
and I complied with the regulations concerning the use of police equipment.

250
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,980
That's for us to judge.

251
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,750
When did you start leaking inside information to Oh Hyeon Jae?

252
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,910
It's as written on the report.

253
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,140
Investigations are within the official sphere.

254
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,490
No matter what Oh Hyeon Jae was in the past, he is a civilian.

255
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm aware.

256
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,460
As a team leader, you should have complied with the reporting system and the investigation manual.

257
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,890
Didn't you know it was an illegal act?

258
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,430
We saw on your personnel record that you're divorced.

259
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:37,320
By chance, do you have a personal relationship with Oh Hyeon Jae?

260
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,930
Well, nobody knows what can happen between a man and a woman, right?

261
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,740
Let's stop. This is getting boring. Just write whatever you want on the report.

262
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,380
Look here, Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong!  This is a major crime!

263
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,800
Infiltration, mutual assistance, and collaboration!

264
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,800
They are all within the discretion of the team leader!

265
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,470
Wiretapping the communication network?

266
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,600
That's something even the tow truck drivers do!

267
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,730
So tow truck drivers can do it, but Oh Hyeon Jae can't?

268
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,000
Upper management should take responsibility for not properly maintaining the police communication network!

269
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,850
If there isn't an issue but you have to come up with one,

270
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,960
I'll take responsibility.

271
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,850
Gosh!

272
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,610
Will Team Leader be okay?

273
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,120
She'll just have to sit still until the investigation result comes out.

274
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,940
It only ended up making us look like complete fools.

275
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,630
I mean, we're on the same team.

276
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,750
Shouldn't she have shared this information with us?

277
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,640
I knew something was off.

278
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,240
Look how she's pretending not to hear even though she can hear everything we're saying.

279
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,070
I know.

280
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,800
Why do I feel so leery even though we caught the culprit?

281
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,760
Ah, Hyung-nim, did you hear that Oh Hyeon Jae is coming?

282
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,870
Haven't you heard?

283
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,970
We hear you played a key role in catching Professor Na Joon Seok's killer. Please give us a comment.

284
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,920
When did you start collaborating on the investigation with the police?

285
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,510
Are you here to be questioned as a witness?

286
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,680
Do you have any intention of returning to work?

287
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,070
-  Pleas give one comment! 
 - Please answer the questions!

288
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,780

289
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,640
Today of all days, all the conference rooms are occupied.

290
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,870
I've always hated your cocky profiling since a long time ago.

291
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,280
I'm well aware.

292
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,980
People like you who can't distinguish between

293
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,880
catching a culprit and provoking them...

294
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,560
There are so many illegal things going on here.

295
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,810
Strangely, upper management keeps saying to just let them slide.

296
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,200
Team Leader Hwang's case as well.

297
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,870
Why did Kang Seung Hwan turn himself in?

298
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,840
While saying something absurd that he was the mint serial killer.

299
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,530
He was a psychopath who wanted be famous,

300
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:21,040
so if someone provoked him, it was something which could possibly happen.

301
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,860
I knew it!

302
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,350
Well, let's get to the point now.

303
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,970
What do you want?

304
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,470
That bastard died five years ago.

305
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,470
The guy in the hospital is a copycat.

306
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:01,620
When you leave here, don't go around spouting nonsense.

307
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,180
If you're done talking,

308
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,050
I'll leave.

309
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,700
Oh Hyeon Jae.

310
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,510
Don't live such a hectic life.

311
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,740
I heard that Doctor Ahn is safe and sound.

312
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,420
When did you find out?

313
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,150
I heard from Doctor Ahn.

314
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,310
I needed bait to lure that bastard out.

315
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,770
Is it all over now?

316
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,900
Probably.

317
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,620
Oh Hyeon Jae.

318
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,970
I'm happy that you can walk and see.

319
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,110
Work hard.

320
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,220

321
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,750
 High five!

322
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,890
 Lovely, team!

323
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,010
 High five!

324
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,420
 Hey!

325
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,180
 Choose your destination.

326
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,170
 You've obtained the crown!

327
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,510
 You've ascended the throne.

328
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,830
 Now!

329
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,610
 High five!

330
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,740
You're good.

331
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,320
Will you teach me how to play?

332
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,140
 Choose your destination.

333
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,570
 What are you doing?

334
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,590
Nothing. Drink while you play.

335
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,490
Hyeon Soo! Hyeon Soo!

336
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,100
Hyeon Soo! Hyeon Soo!

337
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,340
It was a misunderstanding! I won't do it again! I was wrong!

338
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,400
You'll come again tomorrow, right?

339
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,970
 I'll never come again!

340
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,650
You'll come again tomorrow.

341
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,900
Hello.

342
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:34,950
- Did you see him? 
 - I know.

343
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,770

344
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:49,340
When an adult asks you a question, you should answer.

345
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,460
You have to leave now.

346
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,160
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

347
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,000
Excuse me, he's waiting for his grandmother.

348
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,290
Oh! Why didn't you say—

349
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,120
You've been waiting for so long.

350
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,630
Be careful, okay?

351
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,330
Did your grandmother go somewhere?

352
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,830
You should've waited at home.

353
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,430
Why are you waiting here?

354
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:31,270
 I'm scared of being alone.

355
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,500
What's your name?

356
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,870

357
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,000
Hyeon Soo?

358
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,900
My name is...

359
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,060
Hyeon Soo, is something the matter?

360
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,710
Should I take you home?

361
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:27,890
Hyeon Soo, if anything happens, call this number.

362
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,020
I'm a police officer.

363
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,140
Hyeon Soo!

364
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,790
My little baby.

365
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,120
You must have waited a long time!

366
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,960
You're hungry, aren't you?

367
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,470

368
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,810

369
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,630
If you knew I was coming, you should have come out sooner.

370
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,810
Am I at your beck and call?

371
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,900
You should have told me ahead of time that you were coming.

372
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,260
My schedule is full!

373
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,580
I was wrong.

374
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,110
If you were wrong, then you said so.

375
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,100
Thank you, Oppa.

376
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,350
Hey, clean off your shoes before getting in.

377
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,430
Don't get poop in here again.

378
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,450
- Bye! 
 - Okay, bye!

379
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,570
Hey, hey!

380
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,010
Oh, right, right!

381
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,980
You're still clumsy as always.

382
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,930
Sorry, sorry.

383
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,900
- You've become a bit cocky lately. 
 - What?

384
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,900
I told you not to get discouraged, and you've became totally rude.

385
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,420
I admit that you've gotten a little prettier.

386
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,270
Oppa, I mean, Sunbae-nim...

387
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,380
So you've been feeling agitated?

388
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,770
I'm sorry.

389
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,690
Whether you call me "Oppa" or "Sunbae,"

390
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,560
can't you just stick with one and have some consistency?

391
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,830
Still, it's nice to be home.

392
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,070
Coming back makes my heart feel at ease.

393
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,710
Hometown is the best.

394
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,420
Thank you for today. I'll buy you a meal.

395
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,910
- Buy something expensive! 
 - Okay.

396
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,820
- Hey! 
 - What?

397
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,420
- In front! In front! 
 - What?

398
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,210
- In front! 
 - What?

399
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,310
Watch out for poop!

400
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,740
- Go inside. 
 - Go.

401
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,710
I'm leaving!

402
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:11,880
♫  My deep shadow  ♫

403
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:19,100
♫  Your petals brush by  ♫

404
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,980
♫  A cold pain that takes my breath away  ♫

405
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,710
♫  Stains the gray sky red  ♫

406
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,180
 Did you get fired?

407
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,460
No, I didn't get fired.

408
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,540
Why would I get fired?

409
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,320
I'm just taking my vacation.

410
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,510
 If it's too hard, just come back.

411
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:42,870
 No one will say anything.

412
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,740
I'm doing very well.

413
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,480
You worry about yourself.

414
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,790
 Don't worry.

415
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,030
 A lot of our neighbors help me out.

416
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:03,060
 Dong Sik sometimes stops by and keeps me company.

417
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,870
How nice of Dong Sik.

418
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,890
 My daughter, don't try too hard.

419
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,690
 People's lives are all about the same.

420
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:00,940

421
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,750
 It's wiretapping.

422
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,260
 Someone was wiretapping.

423
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,960
 There was radio frequency interference during the Jeong Chan Goo case.

424
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,980
 It was also the same with the Na Joon Seok case.

425
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,340
 Who could it be?

426
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,980
 There is someone else.

427
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,140

428
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,210
No matter how few cases I have,

429
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,210
I have no intention of representing a person like you who pocket kids' lunch money,

430
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,740
so look for someone else.

431
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,300
I don't know who he is, but he really called the wrong person.

432
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,460
Are you going somewhere?

433
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,700
I'm going to the Marina House's event,

434
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,280
and I'll go home directly from there.

435
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,100
That place is in a mountainous area.

436
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,470
Should I take you there?

437
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,140
I'm fine.

438
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,000
One, two, three.

439
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:28,410
Hyeon Soo!  Hyeon Soo!  Hyeon Soo!

440
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,770
Hyeon Soo.

441
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,100
Why are you there?

442
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,550
What did I do so wrong that you're giving me a hard time?

443
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:01,620
 Please let me off. I want to go home.

444
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,130
I prepared everything.

445
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:05,960
We have to play the game.  I'll level up today for sure.

446
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,590
I've even prepared so many game items.

447
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,650
 I did wrong.

448
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,290
 Please send me home.

449
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:27,450
Why, why, why, why did you run away?!  Why?

450
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,310
I just wanted to talk to you.

451
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:31,710
So why did you run away? Why? Huh?

452
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,990
Hey, Hyeon Soo!  Hyeon Soo!

453
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,110
I won't do it again! I did wrong!

454
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,780
Hyeon Soo!  Hyeon Soo!

455
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,570
Hyeon Soo, I won't do it.  Let's go home.

456
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,940
Let's go home.

457
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,720
Let's go home and play games.

458
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,610
I did wrong.

459
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:36,630

460
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:47,230

461
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,090
So this is where you live.

462
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,610
You already knew.

463
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,160
It's my first time seeing it in person.

464
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,090
Why are you here?

465
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:11,420
I don't have anything to do, so I was thinking about fishing.

466
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,410
Why?

467
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,720
Does it feel awkward?

468
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,790
I'm asking why you're here.

469
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,430
I want to make an offer.

470
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,820
I am not interested.

471
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,500
You didn't even hear it yet.

472
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,510
No matter what kind of an offer it is,

473
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,460
I don't want it.

474
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,690
The hit-and-run car that you were looking for when you were young...

475
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,470
I can help you find it.

476
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,010
How about it?

477
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:53,890
Isn't that enough for you to hear my offer?

478
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,950
Then...

479
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,190
have a safe trip back home.

480
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,690
I'll wait.

481
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,800
Until tomorrow.

482
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,380
Are you okay?

483
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,720
I'm sorry.

484
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,710
I couldn't see well because it is dark.

485
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,920
Where did you put your eyes?!

486
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,070
But... why are you speaking informally to me?

487
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,790
- Just leave. I'm fine. 
 - No, it's fine.

488
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:17,160
Let's exchange insurance information.

489
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,910
I said I'm fine. Didn't you hear me?

490
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,290
- Why- why are you acting like this? 
 - Damn it!

491
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,530
I told you to leave since I'm fine!

492
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:28,770
Why, why are you acting like this?

493
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,690
You don't need to tell me. Everyone's out on emergency because of that!

494
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,410
Yes, I understand.  Let's hang up first. Yes. Seriously.

495
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:52,210
- Chief! 
 - Huh? What brings you here, without even calling us?

496
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,560
Have you been well?

497
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,400
How could you come here on vacation at this kind of time?

498
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,470
Did something happen?

499
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,990
A boy from the upper neighborhood didn't come home last night.

500
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,230
You know how there's so much commotion these days when there's a missing person's case.

501
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,980
It's an emergency. Everything's an emergency.

502
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,920

503
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,900
 Suspect identified for the Gil Hyeon Soo child kidnapping case.

504
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,520
 Sex offender, No Sang Cheol, is suspected.

505
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:17,330
 Hyeon Soo, is something the matter?

506
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:22,000
Hyeon Soo...

507
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,950
What's the matter?  Do you know him?

508
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:26,210
 No Sang Cheol's address is 36 Wongyae Road.

509
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,860
 Asking for back up to patrol cars nearby.

510
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,060
 Suspect identified for the Gil Hyeon Soo child kidnapping case.

511
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,590

Sex offender No Sang Cheol who wears an electronic anklet...

512
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:34,880
H-Hey, where are you going?

513
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:44,980
Who are you?

514
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,200
I'm Cha Soo Yeong at the Mucheon Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

515
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,230
What brings you here?

516
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,230
I know the child. May I look around a little bit?

517
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,780
Yes, but please don't touch anything.

518
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,760
Hey, look at this.

519
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,310
 My name is...

520
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,860
Sunbae, this!

521
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,840
This asshole cut the electronic anklet and fled.

522
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,440
There must have been a signal error.

523
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:21,070

524
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,590

525
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:53,120
 The police determined it was a critical situation

526
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,130
 and quickly decided to make it an open criminal investigation.

527
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:59,010
 The prime suspect of the kidnapping, Mr. No, has a history of child sex offense.

528
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,720
 He cut off his electronic anklet and is on the run right now.

529
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,820
 News flash. The suspect's vehicle was just found at a vacant lot halfway up Daeheung Mountain.

530
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:14,730

531
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,000
It looks like the kid's shoe.  There is blood as well.

532
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,270
So this asshole ultimately...

533
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,430
- Hey, how about the search and rescue team? 
 - They are on standby.

534
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,950
Tell them to come here quickly.

535
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,170
Excuse me.  By any chance, did you find a note here?

536
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:46,760
A note? No, I haven't seen one.

537
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,580
- May I take a look? 
 - Pardon?

538
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:59,660
What is this?

539
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,290
Hey, stop. Hey, stop!

540
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,260
- Hello. 
 - What's going on? What are you doing here?

541
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,480
Section Chief, the missing child is someone I know.

542
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,930
Hey, don't be annoying and just stay over there!

543
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,950
Is this Hyeon Soo?

544
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,210
 It's sad news.

545
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:25,680
 The missing child who was kidnapped from an elementary school

546
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,780
 in Mucheon City yesterday afternoon still hasn't been found yet.

547
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,500
 The suspected kidnapper Mr. No's last whereabouts was at a vacant lot halfway up Daeheung Mountain.

548
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,380
 The police has issued an AMBER alert to find the missing child.

549
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,780
 And they've put all their efforts on locating the suspect's whereabouts.

550
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,440
It's me.

551
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,840
I'm listening.

552
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,760
Detective Oh, I'll accept your offer.

553
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,280
 But I have a request.

554
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,980
His name is Gil Hyeon Soo. He's 12 years old.

555
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,410
It has been about 27 hours since he was abducted.

556
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,290
Please help me find him.

557
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,480
Detective Oh?

558
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:29,220

559
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,580
♫  Won’t you tell me now  ♫

560
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:38,170
♫  This game won’t get you out  ♫

561
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:41,240
♫  Won’t get you out  ♫

562
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,180
♫  Silence won’t tell you what to do for you  ♫

563
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,950

564
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,380
 With kidnapping cases, there's nothing to be gained even if you do well.

565
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,980
 I assigned it to Team Leader Hwang.

566
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,780
 You'll make up an excuse to get rid of her?

567
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,460
 The critical hour has passed.

568
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,820
 At least finding his corpse quickly is a part of the police's role, isn't it?

569
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,120
 We found the corpse.

570
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,000
 He might call me!

571
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,880
 There is a third person.

572
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,440
 Are you saying the culprit is someone else?

573
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,490
 Stop there!

574
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:10,100
 If you want to find the child, you need to remember everything.

575
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,030
 Hyeon Soo is probably alive, right?

576
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:15,940
 Hurry. A kidnapping case is a race against time.
