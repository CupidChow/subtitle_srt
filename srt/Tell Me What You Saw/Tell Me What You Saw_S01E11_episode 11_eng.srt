1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,680

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,930

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,640

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,250

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,680

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,570

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,480

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,840

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,900

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,970
This is ...

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,220
You bastard.

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,940
What is this? What kind of bastard are you?

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,970
What kind of bastard makes threats over taking out small private loans?

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:12,690

15
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,410

16
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,080
Yes, Section Chief?

17
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,680
Section Chief?

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,320
 Section Chief?

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,880

20
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,120

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,410

22
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,990
 Hello, this is Cha Soo Yeong.

23
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,270
 Detective, I'm the man at the junk yard

24
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,000
 whom you asked for help to look for the unregistered vehicle.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,390
 Yes, sir?

26
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,720
 I don't know if this will help.

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,740
 I heard there's someone in the area who used to

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,080
 lend money to the people who ran the unregistered vehicles business.

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,770
 That person could know the whereabouts of that unregistered vehicle, don't you think?

30
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,210
 Someone who lent them money?

31
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,190
 He lent money for them to buy the vehicles.

32
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,520
 Who is it?

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,350
 His name is Chim Sa Bong.

34
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,580
  Chim Sa Bong?

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,400
  That's all I know.

36
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,850
 Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

37
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,750
 Chim Sa Bong?

38
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,990

39
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,880
 What is it?

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,460
 Could I perhaps see the files from my mom's case 20 years ago again?

41
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,100
 Hey, are you at this again?

42
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,070
 Asking about that is a yearly event for you, isn't it?

43
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,250
 I thought there could be clues I missed by chance.

44
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,640
 There's none. Nothing.

45
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,880
 Also, the statute of limitations has long expired!

46
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,430
 Then... by chance, have you heard of Chim Sa Bong?

47
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,300
 Chim Sa Bong?

48
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,920
 It seems like he might be a person who knows about the unregistered vehicle, Mucheon 11-A5897.

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,280
 Hey, I'm busy so I'm hanging up.

50
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,050
 Why Chim Sa Bong of all people?

51
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,700

52
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,670
Let it go!

53
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,370
â™« May God protect and preserve our country!

54
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,740
It's mine!

55
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,640
I found 4789.

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,370
It's a special suite at Yooseong Mental Hospital.

57
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,370
4789, 4789.

58
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,750

59
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,640
Eom Soo Tak?

60
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,890
Yes, Doctor.

61
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,020
Is it time to take my medicine?

62
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,970
Who are you? Who are you?

63
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,940
You're not that bastard.

64
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,310
Who sent you?

65
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,820
Ha Tae Sik.

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,360
Ha Tae Sik.

67
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,720
Ha Tae Sik? Ha Tae Sik?

68
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,680
Where is it? Ha Tae Sik. Ha Tae Sik.

69
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,170
Joonggeon three-way intersection. Joonggeon three-way intersection.

70
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,320
That's right. The three-way-intersection...

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,320
He said he needed a corpse.

72
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,420
When I was eating, he called me and said he needed a corpse.

73
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,270
One that was burnt to a crisp.

74
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,570
The boat was on fire.

75
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,890

76
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,680
I just needed money.

77
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,470
All I did was just put it there!

78
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,710
Someone saw me.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,890
Eom Soo Tak.

80
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,980
That bastard saw you?

81
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,220
I see.

82
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,860
You also saw that bastard.

83
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,430
You also saw him? That bastard?

84
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,730
Continue. And then?

85
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,460
Save me! Please save me!

86
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,260
4789! 4789! 4789!

87
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,030
There's no one else here besides the two of us.

88
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,180
It's okay. Tell me.

89
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,380
So what happened?

90
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,260
Eun Joo...

91
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,800
Eun Joo?

92
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,320
Was that your girlfriend?

93
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,450
Eun Joo.

94
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,600
He killed... Eun Joo in front of my eyes.

95
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,330
That bastard killed your girlfriend?

96
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,160
I'm fine!

97
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm... 4789.

98
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,110
4789! 4789! 4789!

99
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,110
It's safe here. It's safe here.

100
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,310
It's safe here. He said it's safe here.

101
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,050
4789, 4789, 4789, 4789.

102
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,320
4789.

103
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,860
You know how I feel.

104
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,750
No! No! You don't know!

105
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,970
You haven't been to hell!

106
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,580
Hell?

107
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,920
Hell!

108
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,940
Dark and suffocating,

109
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,670
repeated excruciating pain every day,

110
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:43,090
that damned hell!

111
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,750
I have been there too.

112
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,160
That hell.

113
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,290
You too? You came back alive from it, too?

114
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,580
Like me?

115
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,310
I'm still there.

116
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,970
You are?

117
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,430
I resurrected.

118
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,390
I resurrected!

119
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,690
Tell me, Eom Soo Tak.

120
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,740
How did you resurrect from that hell?

121
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,210
Ha Tae Sik told me about this place.

122
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,440
He said I would be safe here.

123
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,810
He hid you here after you ran away?

124
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,840
Did Ha Tae Sik really send you?

125
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,910
Then it's not safe here anymore!

126
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,730
4789! 4789! 4789!

127
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,170
Devil! Devil! Devil bastard! Crazy bastard!

128
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,030
Yellow color... Dol Ak. Dol Ak!

129
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,220
Dol Ak! I saw Dol Ak.

130
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,920
Dol Ak. I can't talk about that.

131
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,120
4789 will protect me.

132
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Eom Soo Tak, be quiet!

133
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,390
Someone is coming.

134
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,760

135
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,830
Hello, I'm from Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency.

136
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,920
Oh okay.

137
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,210
I have a few questions to ask regarding a case we are investigating.

138
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,510
Do the numbers 4789 ring a bell?

139
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,370
It's a special suite at our hospital.

140
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,530
A hospital room.

141
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,870
What is the name of the admitted patient?

142
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,020
It's that bastard. That bastard is coming.

143
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,810
Be quiet.

144
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,360
Eom Soo Tak!

145
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,590
- Eom Soo Tak, what's wrong? Who are you?
- Doctor, Doctor!

146
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,300
Please help me. That bastard came.

147
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,200
- I understand, so please calm down.
- Doctor! Doctor, save me!

148
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,120
Calm down, okay? Wait just one moment.

149
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,480
Eom Soo Tak, please give me your arm.

150
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,420
Eom Soo Tak!

151
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,310
Calm down, please. Eom Soo Tak!

152
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,770
You're working with that bastard, aren't you?

153
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,060
Don't come any closer! I'll kill him.

154
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,120
This is the safest place for you.

155
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,560
That bastard has come. That bastard is here!

156
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,530
- Don't do something you'll regret. Come on. 
 - Stay back!

157
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,660
Calm down, please. Eom Soo Tak!

158
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,680
Eom Soo Tak. Eom Soo Tak!

159
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,400
Open the door, quickly!

160
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,280
Hurry! Hurry!

161
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,810

162
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,390

163
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,160
  Let's create a suspect.

164
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,270

Someone in his thirties whom we won't be able to identify.

165
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,370
 Male. We need a body.

166
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,460
 I know a guy who takes care of that stuff.

167
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:53,340
 In return, this is the last deal we make.

168
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,250

169
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,950

170
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,110
 Code zero. Code zero.

171
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,270
 A patient from Yooseong Mental Hospital has escaped.

172
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,610
 I repeat, a patient from Yooseong Mental Hospital has escaped.

173
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,380
You'll need to take measures.

174
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,460
Eom Soo Tak, who escaped from the hospital, is connected to that bastard.

175
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,490
We need the local police, not Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency,

176
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,210
to catch him quietly.

177
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,580
Okay. I'll let the station in the hospital's vicinity know.

178
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay, I got it.

179
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,290

180
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,770
 4789 is a patient named Eom Soo Tak.

181
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,620
Five years ago, Ha Tae Sik asked him to

182
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,180
put a fake corpse at the Joonggeon three-way intersection in place of that bastard.

183
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,740
 He was kidnapped by that bastard and ran away,

184
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,190
 and Ha Tae Sik hid him here.

185
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,430
That bastard let Eom Soo Tak go on purpose.

186
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,170
That sounds like you are saying that you can catch that bastard.

187
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,610
Eom Soo Tak fled. Hurry.

188
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,440
That bastard will definitely look for Eom Soo Tak.

189
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,670
We'll find him. I'll call you later.

190
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,070

191
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,780
4789 was Ha Tae Sik's minion.

192
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,220
Even though he ran away, he couldn't have gone far. We have to find him.

193
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,820
I'll keep an eye on Oh Hyeon Jae.

194
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,310
He's not the kind of person who would lose him from his grasp.

195
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,310
I'm sure he has a plan.

196
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,240
But one thing is certain.

197
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,060
That the information you gave me was right.

198
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,550
What is it that you really want?

199
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,410
When we catch that bastard, under the guise of emergency,

200
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,550
I'll use my discretion.

201
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,550
What do you mean? That you'll shoot?

202
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,810
Perhaps, is it because you want to kill that bastard with your own hands...

203
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,540
Let's say that that's how much I want to catch him.

204
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,740
Now, please give me the information that you have.

205
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,550
Not yet. Let's wait and see.

206
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,260
- Where is it? 
 - Over there.

207
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,160
Over there.

208
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,910
In this little village, this is the second suicide already.

209
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,880
Hey, it's different this time.

210
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,310
It's Section Chief Bang.

211
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,550
What in the world is going on here?

212
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,420
I know.

213
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,820
This is another suicide.

214
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,280
I hear he had a lot of gambling debt.

215
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,350
There are rumors about him getting private loans.

216
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,960
What? Someone else died in a matter of days?

217
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,110
It's that man!

218
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,330
- You don't know anything? 
 - Not much yet.

219
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,030
Right? I told you.

220
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,890
Give me the last caller's number.

221
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,240
What is this atmosphere that's like the quiet in the middle of a typhoon?

222
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,590
What do you mean a typhoon?

223
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,700
It's too quiet.

224
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,580
Hello, it's Cha Soo Yeong.

225
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,690
 I'm Detective Kim Woo Sik at Hwayeong Police Station.

226
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,850
 By chance, do you know Detective Bang Sang Sik?

227
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,440
Yes, I do.

228
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,330

229
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,750
Have some coffee.

230
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,640
Thank you.

231
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,970
You're a Metropolitan Investigation Unit detective?

232
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,800
Yes.

233
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,510
What is the cause of death?

234
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,000
He committed suicide. A hiker found him a short while ago.

235
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
He hung himself on a tree.

236
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,140
You called him many times yesterday.

237
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,120
Oh... yes. We only got to speak once.

238
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,070
I had something personal to ask him.

239
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,290
But he called me back at night.

240
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,010
You said you're Detective Cha Soo Yeong, right?

241
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,760
Your name was in his notebook as well.

242
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,500
This looks like a case I was investigating.

243
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,140
I had asked him about Chim Sa Bong.

244
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,260
Did he look into Chim Sa Bong by any chance?

245
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,910
I'm not sure about that.

246
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:36,190
Only he would know the contents of his notebook.

247
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,510
Could I maybe see his case file?

248
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,610
Hello, Team Leader?

249
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,040
Yes. Okay.

250
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,760

251
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,190

252
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,980
Goodbye.

253
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,480
Hello?

254
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,750
 Sunbae, it's me.

255
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,870
You know that Section Chief Bang died, right?

256
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,080
Of course, I do. I saw him in person.

257
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,040
The news already spread that far?

258
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,180
I'm at Hwayeong Police Station.

259
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,500
He called me before that happened.

260
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,730
He did? To you? Why?

261
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,300
I had made a request before.

262
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,920
I was the last one he spoke to, so I'm here to give a witness statement.

263
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,470
What did you request?

264
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,190
 There's something.

265
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,830
Sunbae, was there anything odd about him lately?

266
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,240
There are rumors that he was gambling and that he got private loans.

267
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,590
These rumors were going around.

268
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,900
 You're at Hwayeong Police Station? You want me to come get you?

269
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,800
No. I'll call you later.

270
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,430
Gambling and private loans?

271
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,220
Private loans...

272
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,220
Gambling, unregistered car...

273
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,140
Ah, whom can I ask?

274
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,890
Gosh, you scared me!

275
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,940
Long time no see.

276
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,750
Have you been well?

277
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,760
Your son is so cute.

278
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,190
My son takes after me.

279
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,120
Your wife is beautiful too.

280
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,300
I used to be the face of our faction. At one point.

281
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,890
Whenever I appeared, Haewol-dong used to be at a standstill.

282
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,010
The women used to come out in droves,

283
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,330
and it used to cause tons of traffic.

284
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,020
Water is...

285
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,780
Speaking of my son, he aced his math test two days ago.

286
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,540
He's so great at addition and subtraction.

287
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,140
- But... 
 - Yes?

288
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,570
I'm curious about something.

289
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,480
If the CEO of a detective agency cheats, who investigates that?

290
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,860
That's my specialty.

291
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,900
This is...

292
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,010
What can I do for you, Detective?

293
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,580
Unregistered cars and...

294
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,900
Chim Sa Bong. Please find everything related to them.

295
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,310
Okay, I will.

296
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,590
Wow, you're good at making deals.

297
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,330
Let's become partners later when you quit being a police...

298
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,920
She learned from Oh Hyeon Jae...

299
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,240
- It's him, right? 
 - Yes, I think it is.

300
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,350
Team 3, we found the hospital escapee.

301
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,680
 Located the escapee of Yooseong Mental Hospital.

302
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,280
 He has gone into Yongmo Cathedral.

303
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,940
Everyone be calm. Don't provoke him.

304
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,930
 Just watch him for the time being.

305
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,330
 We're only to standby for now.

306
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,380
 Don't provoke him and wait outside until reinforcements come.

307
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,650
4789! 4789!

308
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,730
4789! 4789!

309
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,340
No! Don't come near!

310
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,130
You two go that way, and the two of you search over here. Let's go.

311
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,030
Yes.

312
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,650
Stop right there! Hey, you!

313
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,400
Stop! Stop! You, stop there!

314
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,260
Stop!

315
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,620
Where did he go? Find him!

316
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,980
Where is he?

317
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,600
Hurry up!

318
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,220
Where has he gone? Where is he?

319
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,540
- Search thoroughly for him. 
 - Yes, sir. Let's go!

320
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,870
They've lost him.

321
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,640
 I am not sure

322
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,270
 why you are so obsessed with that bastard.

323
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,390
 I have a debt to settle with that bastard too.

324
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,180

325
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,580
 Crazy bastard! Yellow color... Dol Ak. Dol Ak!

326
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,760
 Dol Ak. I saw Dol Ak.

327
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,570

328
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,260

329
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,370

330
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,590
- Yes? 
  - Detective, I found Chim Sa Bong.

331
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,190
 Her name is Bong Yeon Ja.

332
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,240
 In Tsim Sha Tsui ( an area of Hong Kong ), she multiplied a vast amount of money and came back.

333
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,770
But this grandma does tons of business with

334
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,250
private loans, unregistered cars, and such.

335
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,380
On the surface, she runs a landscaping company.

336
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,590
Landscaping company? Okay.

337
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,000
Please send me her address.

338
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,830
Hey, Cha Soo Yeong!

339
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,990
Yes?

340
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,630
Why are you so busy?

341
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,800
Ah, that...

342
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,680
Hey, why does it seem like everyone on the team is busy but me?

343
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,260
You guys aren't meeting separately behind my back, are you?

344
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,040
No, I'm not. I have some personal business to take care of.

345
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,760
Personal business?

346
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,120
Still, you shouldn't run around by yourself.

347
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,280
Excuse me.

348
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,850
I don't have anything to sell yet.

349
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,740
I'm from the Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency's Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

350
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,300
Excuse me, but are you Bong Yeon Ja?

351
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,510
Why are you looking for me?

352
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:52,740
I heard that you're the bankroller for Mucheon's unregistered car business.

353
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,950
And so?

354
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,070
By chance, among the unregistered car businesses,

355
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,640
have you heard of Choigang Engine?

356
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,430
Oh, I don't know.

357
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,930
What would an old woman who is almost dying know?

358
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,700
Then, do you know Section Chief Bang at Hwayeong Police Station?

359
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,140
Who?

360
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,040
Section Chief Bang Sang Sik from the Hwayeong Police Station.

361
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:26,020
What would someone like that have anything to do with a shabby vinyl greenhouse?

362
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,290
 Yes. Okay.

363
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:10,170
Ma'am, did you personally tie that burlap bag of manure?

364
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,920
These days, I have no strength in my hands,

365
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,330
so it's hard for me even to tie anything.

366
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,370
You should leave now. I'm a busy person.

367
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,920
When did you break your nails?

368
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,690
My nails?

369
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,350
Why are you curious about my nails?

370
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,950
Did you say you're a detective?

371
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,600
There have been hundreds of detectives who have come here.

372
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,850
I don't know why you came looking for me,

373
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,940
but bring me a warrant.

374
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,540
Bring me a warrant!

375
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,400
A warrant!

376
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,550
Leave!

377
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,950
- Ma'am. 
 - Yeah?

378
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,550
- Please calm down and use words.
 - Words? Huh?

379
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,100
I told you not to go around alone!

380
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,890
How many crimes have you committed that you're threatening a detective who just came to ask some questions?

381
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,010
Now, what should I look for?

382
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,770
There should be a ledger.

383
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,980
She's a loan shark, so she should have a ledger hidden somewhere.

384
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,310
Okay. Then I'll look inside. You search out here.

385
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,010
Okay.

386
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,080
 A black stain?

387
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,380

388
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,150

389
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,340

390
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,230

391
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,710

392
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,630

393
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,150

394
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,530

395
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,020

396
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,380
Kim Sang Gil.

397
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,320
Kim Sang Gil.

398
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,330
Kim Sang Gil.

399
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,440
Did you find something?

400
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,270
Detective Yang, there's something strange about Section Chief Bang's death.

401
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,260
His name is in here,

402
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,010
and I think he's connected to Chim Sa Bong.

403
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,190
What do you mean?

404
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,790
Please finish up here and take this.

405
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,570
I need to go somewhere.

406
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,900
Hey! Hey, Cha Soo Yeong! Hey! Hey!

407
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,620
What the?

408
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,960
Located the patient who escaped from Yooseong Mental Hospital.

409
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,020
 Cheongdang area, Mount 1.

410
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,450
 Patrol units, assemble quickly.

411
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,210

412
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:47,140
Detective Cha, as you requested, I found the address of Kim Sang Gil.

413
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,620
I'm sure it's somewhere nearby.

414
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,150
Call forensics and search the area thoroughly!

415
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,210
Yes, sir.

416
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,330
Let's go. Hurry!

417
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,790
He's still warm.

418
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,020
It looks like he died not too long ago.

419
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,950
How did you know where Eom Soo Tak would be?

420
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,510
 We were too late.

421
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,470
 Did you lose him?

422
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,470
 Yes.

423
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,590
 Why did you go at it alone instead of with the team?

424
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:26,080
 It's a GPS. I planted it on Eom Soo Tak.

425
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,290
 He couldn't have gone that far.

426
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:56,090
We lost the bastard.

427
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,050
Are you certain that bastard killed him?

428
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,980
 Has that bastard really showed up?

429
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,830
Deputy Commissioner, don't keep bringing that bastard up.

430
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,620
Let's just...

431
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,380
leave it as an unsolved case.

432
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,430
Okay, I understand.

433
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,860
Eon Soo Tak's body will be left as a cold case.

434
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:31,800
But why did Oh Hyeon Jae give this to you?

435
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,980
It was a golden opportunity to catch that bastard.

436
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,860
I'm sure he has another plan.

437
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,690
Another plan?

438
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,680
Excuse me. Do you know where #27-3 is?

439
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,780
Try going up that way.

440
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,020
Thank you.

441
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,670
Excuse me.

442
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,900
Who is it?

443
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,340
May I come in for a moment?

444
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,440
Did you come from the community center?

445
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,380
Are you Kim Sang Gil, born in 1964?

446
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,210
Who are you?

447
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,780
Mucheon 11 A5897.

448
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,040
Have you driven this unregistered car?

449
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,430
I don't know.

450
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,540
Please leave now.

451
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,280
Twenty years ago on October 10, 2000 at 2 PM, at an intersection in Hongwoon-myeon,

452
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,450
a black car was involved in a hit-and-run accident.

453
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,840
At the time, the driver was wearing a black hat.

454
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:50,060
The accident at that time... killed 37-year-old Jeong Eun Mi.

455
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,170
Besides you, there was also a child in the car.

456
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,320
Even the rag doll that the child was holding...

457
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,980
There's someone who remembers it all.

458
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,190
Who are you?

459
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,510
A witness and the victim's daughter.

460
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,040
That was something from a long time ago.

461
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,990
What are you trying to do about it now?

462
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,310
The statute of limitations has expired.

463
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,120
It hasn't expired for me!

464
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,210
I...

465
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,390
I became a cop because of this.

466
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,180
Get up.

467
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,340
Get up!

468
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:59,080
Kim Sang Gil, you are being arrested for the crime of a fatal hit-and-run

469
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,350
which killed 37-year-old Jeong Eun Mi on October 10, 2000,

470
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,790
on an intersection in Hongwoon-myeon,

471
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,430
which falls under Additional Punishment Law on Specific Crimes.

472
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:12,390
I should have just died then.

473
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,940
You have the rights to defend yourself, to appoint an attorney,

474
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:21,140
and to refuse to give testimony.

475
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:27,220
In addition, you have the right to request a judicial review of the legality of this arrest.

476
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,690
I, Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency's Investigation Unit Detective Cha Soo Yeong, have notified you of all this.

477
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,740
Don't arrest me;  just kill me.

478
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:41,210
I should have died then.

479
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:44,330
I should have just died then.

480
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,570
It's been hell.

481
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,380
Kill you?

482
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,600
You want me to kill you?

483
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:08,590
I dreamt of arresting you more than a hundred times over the last twenty years.

484
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,980
The statute of limitations has expired.

485
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,360
I can't arrest you.

486
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,430
Continue to live in this hell that you can't die from

487
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:39,000
like I am.

488
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:49,470
You must keep living. Don't die.

489
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,870
â™«  My deep shadow  â™«

490
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:02,140
â™«  Your petals brush by  â™«

491
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:07,730
â™«  La la la la la la la la la  â™«

492
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:16,340
â™«  La la la la la la la la la  â™«

493
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:23,900
â™«  Left alone in the rough wind  â™«

494
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:29,490
â™«  The petals withered  â™«

495
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:36,360
 Soo Yeong, thank you for not giving up.

496
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,980
â™«  I fell asleep with you in my arms  â™«

497
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,370

498
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,460
Dol Ak. It's here.

499
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:20,450
Eom Soo Tak hit this sign as he was running away.

500
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,320
And he saw the words 'Dol Ak' here.

501
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,110
 Yellow color... Dol Ak. Dol Ak!

502
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,210
This is  the place where Eom Soo Tak and his girlfriend were buried.

503
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,710
That bastard must've been very excited.

504
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,630
A secret and familiar place

505
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,980
 that could excite him to the extreme.

506
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,750
I am certain that his hideout is near.

507
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,220
 The reason why he is aware of the situation

508
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,240
 is because he is wiretapping into the police radio.

509
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,750
 I am sure that strong radio signals will be transmitted from his hideout.

510
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,700
Remember...

511
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,530
who told you to kill Isu.

512
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:32,300
You will have to tell me.

513
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,290

514
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,350
 What's wrong?

515
00:52:53,250 --> 00:53:02,950
Dad, I caught the culprit.

516
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:12,820
I caught the culprit who hit Mom and ran.

517
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,040
 Really?

518
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,510
 You caught him?

519
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,360
 You've been through a lot, my daughter.

520
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,760
Dad, I'm sorry.

521
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:52,350
I found him too late.

522
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:56,750
I'm so sorry that I couldn't do anything.

523
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,690

524
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:23,290

525
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,010
It's me.

526
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,410
 I guess something must have happened?

527
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:55,110
I found the guy who hit my mom and ran.

528
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,020
That's a relief.

529
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:06,740
May I ask you a question?

530
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:10,310
Go ahead.

531
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:17,100
When you helped me on the first case with Jo Seong Ae,

532
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,000
you said this to me.

533
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,940
 You said you werenâ€™t interested.

534
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,550
 Why did you help me?

535
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:28,280
 I never helped you.

536
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,940
 Then why?

537
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,810
 I pitied you.

538
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:36,810
 I pity myself, too.

539
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:40,280
What did you mean by that?

540
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,790
Scars...

541
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:47,440
A sense of loss for those whose tomorrow will never come.

542
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,550
Look here, Cha Soo Yeong.

543
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:54,190
Try to fight it.

544
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:57,090
 If you don't want to be weakened.

545
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:03,000
I need you right now.

546
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,990
â™«  Confess your sins with blinks  â™«

547
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:09,750
â™«  Eyes you flicker  â™«

548
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:19,910
â™«  As though putting together fragmented traces  â™«

549
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:32,210
â™«  The memories which you have lost  â™«

550
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:40,340
â™«  You left me behind  â™«

551
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,350
Detective Oh.

552
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:46,940
â™«  Who wandered alone searching for you  â™«

553
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:49,380
This is that bastard's hideout.

554
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:56,680
You finally found it.

555
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,140
That's right.

556
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,170
Have you contacted Team Leader yet?

557
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,370
Not yet.

558
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:05,110
Memorize using your photographic memory first.

559
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,630
That doll isn't a victim's.

560
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:54,250
It's definitely that bastard's.

561
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:57,410
It must have some special meaning.

562
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,310
This doll...

563
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:26,690
I know it.

564
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:36,360
Twenty years ago, in the car that hit my mom and ran,

565
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,490
the child who was sitting in the back was holding this doll.

566
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,270

567
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:13,330
 Tell me one person whom you want to kill.

568
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,390
 You did well.

569
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:46,360

570
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,070

571
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,130
 Do you remember that doll?

572
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,810
 What do you know that you came to see me?

573
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:07,080
 For five years now, why must we continue to do something that makes us tremble?

574
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,450
 I can't stand to see the organization I belong to falter.

575
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,350
 Being predictable isn't his style.

576
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:15,110
 We have to find his goal.

577
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:19,280
 What's the evidence that Director Choi wants to hide?

578
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:22,650
 What the hell is going on?

579
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:25,240
 You weren't going to be able to catch him from the first place.

580
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:29,110
 That bastard just cut off his tail, that's all.
