1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,370

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,840

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,240

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,750

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,420

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,480

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,940

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:36,190

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,740
Hey! Stop!

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,020
Hey, come here, you bastard!

12
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,540
Come here.

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,630
This punk!

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,670
Come here.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,010
Hyung-nim, we found him. We'll bring him over.

16
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,650
Hey! Don't do that! Stop!

17
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,350
Stop! Stop!

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,550
- What are you guys? 
 - You're newbies, aren't you?

19
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,130
You don't know me? Unbelievable.

20
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,820
Spit your gum out, you punk.

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,180
- Get them! 
 - Damn you.

22
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,250
Get him!

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,040
- Stay still, don't move. 
 - My arm, my arm.

24
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,950
I'm the police.

25
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,990
Are you okay?

26
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,180
I saw it.

27
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,000
The murder.

28
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,280
Yeah.

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,400
Good work.

30
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,870
We found the witness.

31
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:45,290

32
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,610
I heard that Sinwol faction is looking for someone.

33
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,450
I wondered who that could be.

34
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,170
Then I had a sudden thought.

35
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,780
Maybe the Sinwol and Guwol factions are one group.

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,930
Then someone, on purpose,

37
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,860
might have wanted it to appear as though there were murders of retaliation between the factions.

38
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,950
That’s not a bad theory. It could be.

39
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,360
Why would the great Ha Tae Sik show up at the police station?

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,050
On his own volition at that?

41
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,040
Team Leader.

42
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,590
This way, please.

43
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,380
Team Leader, this is Joo Sa Gang.

44
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,710
This is our team leader.

45
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,930
You turned yourself in on purpose to keep me here.

46
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,680
During the 48 hours allowed for an arrest made without a warrant,

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,370
you were intending to get rid of someone through Choi Doo Man.

48
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,560
For a perfect crime.

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,790
But...

50
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,930
we found the person you were looking for first.

51
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,780
The witness.

52
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,230

53
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,000

54
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,020
Is that man the one you saw that night?

55
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,220
No.

56
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,480
Look again. Are you sure it's not that man?

57
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,730
Now, you’re safe in here, so take another look.

58
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,980
Again.

59
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,960
It wasn’t that man.

60
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,630
Take him away.

61
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,620
Okay.

62
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,050
This way, please.

63
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,130
Drink this.

64
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,230
It's scary being in a police station, isn't it?

65
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,730
Is there anything you remember about the culprit?

66
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,690
He was wearing a helmet.

67
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,500
Helmet?

68
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,920
A black motorcycle helmet.

69
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,050
I saw his face when he put the visor up.

70
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,350
You saw him?

71
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,220
What does he look like?

72
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,000
I can draw him.

73
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,690
Ah, hold on. Hold on.

74
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,400
Try drawing him here.

75
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,450
Joo Sa Gang, 21 years old. A student studying in America.

76
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,740
According to him, he came back to Korea for a short time on his school break.

77
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,260
Team Leader, I ran a background check on Joo Sa Gang, and he has no priors.

78
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,600
But he’s scheduled to leave for the US tomorrow morning.

79
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,610

80
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,310
It's this person.

81
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,150

82
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,040
- Team Leader. 
 - Yes?

83
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,920
This is the montage of the culprit that Joo Sa Gang drew.

84
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,140
Ask the people who gave testimony on Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun’s murders

85
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,110
and the business owners in the vicinity of the crime about a man wearing a helmet one more time.

86
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,310
Okay, got it.

87
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,660
So... I’ve asked the precinct to protect your identity,

88
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,510
so please don't worry too much.

89
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,440
Thank you.

90
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,650
Please... make sure he’s caught.

91
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,960
We will.

92
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,260
So you’re saying you remember seeing someone wearing a helmet that day near the place of the incident, right?

93
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,370
Okay, thank you.

94
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,350
Yes, I understand.

95
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,480
Hyung-nim, the business owners near the murder sites of Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun

96
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,190
claim to have seen a man wearing a helmet.

97
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,880
Doesn't this really look like Sinwol faction's Choi Doo Man?

98
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,430
The scar by his eye.

99
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,490
You're right.

100
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,980
Team Leader, the montage looks a lot like Choi Doo Man.

101
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,320
Ha Tae Sik and Choi Doo Man?

102
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,810
Look into his past records for me.

103
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,950
Hold on.

104
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Yes, Sunbae?

105
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,340
Are you sure?

106
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,580
In any case, thank you.

107
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,220
That was the detective who was in charge of Choi Doo Man.

108
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,720
He says Choi Doo Man's been to prison in place of Ha Tae Sik.

109
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,010
Then Ha Tae Sik confessed in Choi Doo Man's place?

110
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,270
There's a high probability of Choi Doo Man being the real culprit.

111
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,750
I'll figure out his whereabouts right away.

112
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,630
- Everyone mobilize! We found the suspect. 
 - Pardon?

113
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,630
Ask the telecom companies for cooperation and find out the location of Choi Doo Man's cell phone!

114
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,430
Okay.

115
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,620
Hurry up! Take your gear and bullet proof vests!

116
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,290

117
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,560
- Everyone, be careful. 
 - Yes.

118
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,990
Hey, Choi Doo Man!

119
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,350
I think he's dead.

120
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,740
Team Leader, Choi Doo Man is dead.

121
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,630
Detective Jang, call the forensic team.

122
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,590
Okay, I will.

123
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,740
I understand. I'll call you back with the results.

124
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,290

125
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,280
Yes?

126
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,140
- What's the issue? 
 - You received a package.

127
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,490

128
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,810
 Ha Tae Sik.

129
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,820
 Why did he send this to me?

130
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,520

131
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,970
 Choo Won Pyeong's estimated time of death is 9 p.m. on the 26th.

132
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,290
  Kim Pan Geun's is 11:30 p.m.

133
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,320
So during the times of Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun's murders,

134
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,580
Ha Tae Sik is saying that he was in his office the whole time?

135
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,820
He turns himself in but sends me an alibi and asks me to release him.

136
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,570
That little...

137
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,970
Is he mocking the police or just looking down on me?

138
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,960
Choi Doo Man.

139
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,950
I know you two had a special relationship.

140
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,600
He went to prison in your place,

141
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,550
and you hate being indebted to people so you wanted to repay him.

142
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,270
You're right.

143
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,850
Choi Doo Man is dead.

144
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:30,640
Ha Tae Sik turned himself in to hide Choi Doo Man, to take the fall for him.

145
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,300
No, that's not it.

146
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:40,890
Then, why on earth did Ha Tae Sik need 48 hours?

147
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,000
Tell me.

148
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:02,560
Everyone has a secret he wants to hide.

149
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,820
You're right. What is that secret?

150
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,870
Five years ago, at Joonggeon three-way intersection,

151
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,090
there is a secret.

152
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,440
What could that secret be?

153
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,610
What are you saying right now?

154
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,020
I told you. I have conditions.

155
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,960
 What are you hiding?

156
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,570
 If you can figure it out,

157
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,580
 I'll tell you what you're curious to know.

158
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,060
Tell me.

159
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,520
What are you doing right now? Let him go.

160
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,900
Not yet.

161
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,440
The real culprit is dead!

162
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,820
We also received Ha Tae Sik's alibi.

163
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,970

164
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,560
We totally got flipped.

165
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,120
What was Ha Tae Sik thinking when he turned himself in?

166
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,380
That's what I'm saying.

167
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,920
 Everyone has a secret he wants to hide.

168
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:05,240
Ha Tae Sik, what is it that you have?

169
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,840
He planned everything before he came here.

170
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,830

171
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,680
The poison.

172
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,610
The button. Choi Doo Man.

173
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,110
The only think he didn't plan was...

174
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,570
 The witness.

175
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,320

176
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,600
I've seen this signature before somewhere.

177
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,720
Cha Soo Yeong, look into Joo Sa Gang.

178
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,850
Joo Sa Gang?

179
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,630
Joo Sa Gang and Ha Tae Sik are associated in some way.

180
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,710
You, give me the statement that Joo Sa Gang wrote.

181
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,740
Here it is.

182
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,580
Ha Tae Sik and Joo Sa Gang?

183
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,960
Ha Tae Sik and Joo Sa Gang?

184
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,190

185
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,630

186
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,010

187
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,790

188
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,190

189
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,830
There was a painting in Ha Tae Sik's office.

190
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,430
But there was a painting in Choi Doo Man's office too.

191
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,410
A painting?

192
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,890
Continue.

193
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,380
The two of them had the same signature.

194
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,020
But if you look here on the montage that Sa Gang drew,

195
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,070
the way the S is written in the signature is the same.

196
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,120
I'm certain that all those paintings were drawn by Joo Sa Gang.

197
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,930
Okay, good work.

198
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,520
We received Choi Doo Man's alibi during the time Choo Won Pyeong and Kim Pan Geun were killed.

199
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,090
That means he's not the true culprit!

200
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:26,300
Ha Tae Sik and Joo Sa Gang are definitely connected in some unusual way.

201
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,400
Detective Lee, find Joo Sa Gang's address.

202
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,960
Yes.

203
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,610
Haewol 2-dong 81-9, Dongcha-gu, Mucheon Metropolitan City.

204
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,480
But this looks like his old address.

205
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,200
Look into it further.

206
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,530
Okay.

207
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,090
It's close to where we found him before.

208
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,130
Detective Oh, you and Cha Soo Yeong head there first.

209
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,820
You two, track Ha Tae Sik's location.

210
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,850
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,250
I think it's this building.

212
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,490

213
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,230
Come here.

214
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,280
The paintings...

215
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,650
Joo Sa Gang is not simply a witness.

216
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,410
If he's not a witness...

217
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,990
Ha Tae Sik bought Joo Sa Gang's painting.

218
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,180
Joo Ga Sang already knew Ha Tae Sik from before.

219
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,520
Choi Doo Man also had Joo Sa Gang's painting in his office.

220
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,140
This means that Joo Sa Gang lied in his statement when he said he didn't know them.

221
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,750
Right.

222
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,010

223
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:35,170
There's a letter at the end of this signature. On each of the paintings.

224
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,310
It's an easter egg.

225
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,920
What do you think it means?

226
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:44,060
Detective Cha, you said there were paintings at the crime scene as well, right?

227
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,630
Yes.

228
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,940
There was a letter at the end of the signatures in the paintings Ha Tae Sik and Choi Doo Man had, too.

229
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,980
Picture all of those alphabet letters.

230
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,820
Ha Tae Sik's painting had A.

231
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,470
Choi Doo Man's painting had F.

232
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,920
The one here is T.

233
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,930
Here is H.

234
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,550
Here is E.

235
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,620
Here is R. So A, F, T, H, E, R.

236
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,370
If we follow the order they died in, it's T, H, E.

237
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,320
And R is last. It's an anagram.

238
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,970

239
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,780
Father.

240
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,780
But the paintings here...

241
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,430
Doesn't it look like he painted the victims who died in our current case?

242
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,050
That facial shape and scarf...

243
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,810
It looks like Choo Won Pyeong.

244
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,890
The dark red shirt and black suit is Kim Pan Geun.

245
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,080
The man who died in a sitting position, Choi Doo Man.

246
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,250
And this one looks like a man hanging from a ceiling.

247
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,720
They're all a series of paintings of corpses at their deaths.

248
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,250
Real crime scenes were used as a motif.

249
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,140
He painted the scene of crime.

250
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,950
Then who was the man in the motorcycle helmet Sa Gang mentioned?

251
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,530
If I'm correct in my assumptions, these are previews of the murders.

252
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,540
The last target...

253
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,540
is Ha Tae Sik.

254
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,960
Hurry up and get in! We found Ha Tae Sik's car.

255
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,510
It was captured on a CCTV at a closed distribution center near the harbor.

256
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,190
Please spare him.

257
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,300
This is what you wanted to see.

258
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,060
No it's not. No.

259
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,570
You insect-like bastard.

260
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,430
You've got no self-confidence or backbone.

261
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:40,110
A weak ass like you has no right to live!

262
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,970
He's still my father!

263
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,500
Your mother died miserably

264
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,390
in this container as she froze to death.

265
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,590
He killed her. He wanted to save himself.

266
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,590
Kill him with your bare hands.

267
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,660
It's okay.

268
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,030
I said, kill him.

269
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,210
Who cares if you share the same blood!

270
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,030
Look.

271
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,550
He's the reason you're like this.

272
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,360
 Team Leader, Joo Sa Gang's mother was Joo Seon Hwa.

273
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,670
In 2004, her dead body was discovered in  a container.

274
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,750
Joo Sa Gang, who was five-years-old at the time, survived,

275
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,120
and his mother is believed to have died while being smuggled into the country.

276
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,940
She died while being smuggled in?

277
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,480
 Mom! Don't die!

278
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,180
Also, someone named Jin Choon Gil filed a birth certificate.

279
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,890
I looked into who Jin Choon Gil was just in case, and it's Ha Tae Sik's old name.

280
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,750
Joo Sa Gang is Ha Tae Sik's son.

281
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,010
To avenge his mother's death when he was a child,

282
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,610
he's been deliberately killing Ha Tae Sik's close associates.

283
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:22,890
Ha Tae Sik had someone fabricate the evidence.

284
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,660
Ha Tae Sik's goal was for Joo Sa Gang to leave the country.

285
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,500
That's why he turned himself in.

286
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,560
He needed time, 48 hours.

287
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,270
Then... who is the man in the motorcycle helmet whom Joo Sa Gang

288
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:40,950
and the business owners nearby claimed they saw?

289
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,490
Your son saw his own mother die,

290
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,860
and he made a pledge

291
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,230
that he would get revenge.

292
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,620
Stop now.

293
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,050
Your son is next.

294
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:06,160
No. You can't kill Sa Gang.

295
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,920
Sa Gang is not well.

296
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,630
Are you attempting to act like a father after all this time?

297
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,450
Because of that dirty money you begged to have,

298
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,180
your son was all the more pitiful!

299
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,500
Let's stop now.

300
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,860
Isn't this Ha Tae Sik's car?

301
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,320
Oh, this is like looking for a needle in a haystack!

302
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,070
- How do we find him? 
 - Spread out for now.

303
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,860
- We'll go this way. 
- Pardon?

304
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:13,490
Where have I seen this logo?

305
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,460

306
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,740
Sa Gang's notebook?

307
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,050
Hey, Detective Cha.

308
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,470
What is it?

309
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,760
91W?

310
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,550
91W.

311
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,280
M16.

312
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,860
It's M16.

313
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,010
What do you mean M16?

314
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:56,260
I... saw a sketch inside Sa Gang's notebook.

315
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,400
In the picture, a man was hanging upside down,

316
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,800
and next to it was this logo and 91W written.

317
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,100
- And? 
 - If we

318
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,680
turn it upside down like the last forewarning painting that we saw,

319
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,520
91W becomes M16.

320
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,750
M16.

321
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,060
It's the M building. After M, there is P.

322
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,920
M, this way.

323
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,660
You insect-like bastard.

324
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,600
You've got no self-confidence or backbone.

325
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,220
A weak ass like you has no right to live!

326
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,310
Did you make up your mind?

327
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,220
I can't do it. I can't.

328
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,910
Don't be ridiculous.

329
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,920
You have to do this yourself.

330
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,510
No. This isn't right.

331
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,460
You punk!

332
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,490
You moron!

333
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,820
It's what you wanted.

334
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,110
Stop making me do it all the time like a coward, and kill him yourself!

335
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,100
Detective Oh.

336
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,410
Sa Gang.

337
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,190
If it's your wish, kill me.

338
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,250
If you can't do it, then I will.

339
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,870
Watch carefully. He made you that way.

340
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,670
We found Ha Tae Sik.

341
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,890
I don't see Joo Sa Gang nor the culprit in the helmet.

342
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,910
Catch him!

343
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,750
Team Leader, I'm chasing the guy in the helmet!

344
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,120
It's near the L area.

345
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,290
  Okay, I'll be there soon.

346
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,650
Did you find out my secret?

347
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,490
Yes.

348
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,120
Ha Tae Sik's goal was for Joo Sa Gang to leave the country.

349
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,400
So you turned yourself in.

350
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,040
After putting all the attention on yourself,

351
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,820
you were buying time.

352
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,170
Even by fabricating evidence.

353
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,210
Joo Sa Gang was Ha Tae Sik's son.

354
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,640
As expected from Oh Hyeon Jae.

355
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,080
 Detective Cha! Where are you, Detective Cha?

356
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,400
I'm currently—

357
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,770
Die!

358
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,410
Cha Soo Yeong, are you okay?

359
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,480
Yes.

360
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,190
Joo Sa Gang?

361
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,350
From trauma, Joo Sa Gang created an alter ego.

362
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,940
The man in a helmet who was here earlier.

363
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,180
Ha Tae Sik's Achilles heel.

364
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:59,430
In the end, there's nothing you can do about your own child.

365
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,780
I don't have time, so listen carefully.

366
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,900
Joonggeon three-way intersection,

367
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:29,540
4789.

368
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,420
47...

369
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,030
89?

370
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,530
Are you okay?

371
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,470
Joo Sa Gang.

372
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,510
We are arresting you for three murders and the murder of your own family member.

373
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,990
You have the right to a lawyer and to refuse to give testimony.

374
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:33,790
You have the right to request a judicial review of the legality of this arrest.

375
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,110
Let's go.

376
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,780
Hold on.

377
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,520
What is it?

378
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,280
Just a moment, please.

379
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,520
♫  Conceal your sins won't lead you away now  ♫

380
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:15,790
♫  It's impossible to contain in my two hands  ♫

381
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,650
♫  The memories which you have lost  ♫

382
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,280
Father. Father...

383
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:34,470
♫  In an instant I recall you as if you were a picture  ♫

384
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,800
♫  Will be wandering again  ♫

385
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,640
Father.

386
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,490
♫  Confess your sins with blinks  ♫

387
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:58,050
♫  Eyes you flicker  ♫

388
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:05,970
The man in the helmet was an alter ego Joo Sa Gang made up from trauma.

389
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,110
 It wasn’t that man.

390
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:19,770
♫  The memories which you have lost  ♫

391
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:28,630
♫  In an instant I recall you as if you were a picture  ♫

392
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,330
♫  Will be lost again  ♫

393
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,120
 Who are you?

394
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:43,360
Ha Tae Sik turned himself in to buy time until Joo Sa Gang left the country.

395
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,910
Even Ha Tae Sik didn't want his son to become a murderer.

396
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,650
It's an unseen truth. We nearly missed it.

397
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,390
You can't always see the truth.

398
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:58,840
If everything I see isn't the truth, what do I look at?

399
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:03,170
What people really wish to say.

400
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,890
Then what?

401
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,520
You'll be able to see things as they are.

402
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,330
You two, good job.

403
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,500
♫  Who wandered alone searching for you  ♫

404
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,260
4789.

405
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,030

406
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,410

407
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,160

408
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,300
Just Choigang Engine's left.

409
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,100

410
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,560

411
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,140
 What's the reason?

412
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,870
 Why do you want to join the Metropolitan Investigation Unit?

413
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,800
 I also...

414
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,120
 have someone I must catch.

415
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,530
Excuse me, sir.

416
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,200
Who are you?

417
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,930
I heard that in the past, this used to be called Choigang Engine

418
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,730
where they used to deal with unregistered cars.

419
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,070
Is it possible to meet an employee from that time or someone affiliated with the company?

420
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:35,700
It's been a long time since they shuttered after the CEO died.

421
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,590
So... even if it's not the CEO,

422
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,290
I thought I might be able to meet someone affiliated with the company.

423
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,880
Stop bothering me! I don't know anything!

424
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,750
I'm a detective from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

425
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,900
It's because I have someone I must find.

426
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:55,340
Detective? I'm telling you, I only handed over the keys!

427
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,550
I'm not at fault!

428
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,740
Then you used to work at Choigang Engine?

429
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,310
Grandpa, I'm not here to blame anyone,

430
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,890
I wanted to know about this license plate.

431
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,180
Mucheon 11 A5897.

432
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,210

433
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:15,740
Tons of people came by to get cars.

434
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,680
How would I remember that?

435
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,470
Grandpa, I became a detective to find this.

436
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,580
What is that license plate to you?

437
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,670
It's a car that ran over my mom and fled.

438
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:34,030
And she passed away because of it.

439
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,390
I looked into all of the unregistered cars in Mucheon,

440
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,780
but this is the last place.

441
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,720
I'm pleading with you.

442
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,810
Come on. When it comes to unregistered cars,

443
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,570
you can have many owners under one license plate.

444
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:53,680
I feel bad for you, but there's no way.

445
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:00,880
Oh... Anyway, leave me your number.

446
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,510
If I find out anything, I'll call you.

447
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,840
Here is my business card.

448
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,340

449
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,380
Thank you.

450
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,830

451
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:26,700

452
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,350
 You couldn't catch one person and caused this mess?

453
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,170

You're making a mockery out of the police!

454
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:36,600
  If we don't resolve this case, we're done for!

455
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,560
 It's the greatest interest of our VIPs.

456
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,000
  Where can we catch him?

457
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,100
  We have no evidence and have no idea who it is.

458
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,920
  The cop who caught but lost him even committed suicide due to criticism.

459
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,130
  Then who will take responsibility?

460
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,030
  We have to catch him no matter what!

461
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:54,910
  If we don't within this month, be ready to give up your jobs!

462
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,640
  We're going to die at this rate.

463
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:04,980
  We have to survive no matter what.

464
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,700
  Or make ourselves an opportunity.

465
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,250
  Search everywhere even inside, too! Hurry up!

466
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,110
 Yes, sir!

467
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,110

468
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:46,100
  It's me.

469
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,070
  Let's create a suspect.

470
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,350
4789.

471
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,510
A new clue.

472
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:15,580
I have to find out what it means.

473
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:20,040

474
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,690
If you're the second director, you're third highest in the Mucheon Regional Office.

475
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:29,110
Chief Choi, no, Director Choi's super-fast promotion is going to cause his power to soar.

476
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,840
And we're all going to disappear.

477
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,210
Why? We can follow him upwards.

478
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,690
How? With wings?

479
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:41,740
Seriously, he's so lucky.

480
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,650
After catching the higher-ups' eye, leaving his colleagues in the dust,

481
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,750
he's become the second director.

482
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,210
Hey, does that make sense?

483
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,600
Congratulations, Director!

484
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,040
It's all thanks to everyone.

485
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,520
Yeah, thanks. Why did you come out in this cold?

486
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,840
- Congratulations, Director. 
 - Thank you.

487
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,360
Congratulations.

488
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,830
You played a big part in it, Team Leader Hwang.

489
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,640
Help me out in the future as well.

490
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,260
Well, I'll do my job as I've always done.

491
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,290
That won't cut it.

492
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,800
You'll have to do even better, no?

493
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:27,290
- Congratulations. 
 - Oh, thank you.

494
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:31,960
Detective Yang, you're the real deal with a lot of field experience.

495
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,220
I know you well. I have you in mind.

496
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,980
Thank you.

497
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,640
Congratulations, Director Choi. I'll do my best.

498
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,110
Yes, thank you.

499
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,070
Congratulations.

500
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,270
Yes, work hard.

501
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,850
Where's Oh Hyeon Jae?

502
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,220
He's doing investigative work outside.

503
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,800
Working alone without a care for the organization,

504
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,860
he's still the same as five years ago.

505
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,230
It's so like him.

506
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,730
Now, let's go in. It's cold.

507
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,670
Yes.

508
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,900

509
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:19,070

510
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,190

511
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:40,680
 4789.

512
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,590
Yes?

513
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,660
You wanted to see me?

514
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:11,850
Must you do things this way?

515
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,060
I told you to report to me what Ha Tae Sik and Oh Hyeon Jae

516
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,760
talk about without omitting one word.

517
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,670
Must I hear the information that Ha Tae Sik spilled

518
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,660
by running around here and there like a rat?

519
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,160
I'm sorry.

520
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,680
I sent a mutt bastard to college

521
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,830
and struggled to make him into a police officer,

522
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,800
but he doesn't recognize his owner.

523
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,350
I know very well that if it hadn't been for you,

524
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:35,620
I would have ended up at a juvenile hall back then.

525
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,820
I wouldn't have been able to even dream of becoming a police officer.

526
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,650
You know very well?

527
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,620
I am always grateful.

528
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,910
If you know, how can you act this way?!

529
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:50,030
You bastard, don't you know whom you need to appease?

530
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,290
The people I hate the most are

531
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,070
the ones who keep confusing me with their inconsistency.

532
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:59,420
Because I can't discern what kind of blood flows through them.

533
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,770
I'm sorry.

534
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,050
You've become attached to your team members,

535
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,990
and you want to be loyal to Team Leader Hwang.

536
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:15,830
Why do you think I placed you in the Metropolitan Investigation Unit?

537
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:19,390
I made an investment for the sake of the organization.

538
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,890
The time and effort I put into you...

539
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:25,910
at the very least, don't make me think about coming out even.

540
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,600
Do you want to end up back on the streets?

541
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,070
I'm sorry.

542
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:37,300
Comb through everything and dig up whatever you can.

543
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,660
4789.

544
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,160
Damn it.

545
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,930
What is it?

546
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:02,070
Unsolved cases. Director Choi gave orders for them to be transferred over to us.

547
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,270
What?

548
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:09,790
He's totally telling us to eat sh**!

549
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,400
Wow, there are so many.

550
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,660
We'll have to eat it then.

551
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,570
Hey, come here and eat some.

552
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:26,870
What is this?

553
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:29,820
They're unsolved cases, and they've been assigned to us.

554
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,090
- Who assigned them? 
- Director Choi.

555
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,240
There are many other teams like the unsolved case team,

556
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,410
women and youth team, and violent crimes team,

557
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,430
but they've been handed over to us.

558
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,210
Well, it's not so much a promotion but a shackle.

559
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,040
Rank isn't important these days.

560
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,810
Okay. Yes, thank you.

561
00:52:54,230 --> 00:53:00,060
Why are you assigning all the tasks at the agency to team 1 all of a sudden?

562
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:08,490
Ace team leader of team 1.

563
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:13,300
You'll have to show your abilities in order to keep your position.

564
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,900
I've allocated long-term unsolved cases, so make sure I see results within a week.

565
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,210
Investigations are done with time, effort, and legwork.

566
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:23,080
How quickly do you want them to be done?

567
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,130
I want to restructure the organization.

568
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,070
Incompetent teams will be reorganized from team leaders down to the lowest-ranking officers.

569
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:34,120
It's not a threat, and I'm not trying to discipline either.

570
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:38,960
I just want to do what we're supposed to as police officers.

571
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,280
I understand for now.

572
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,900
I'm sorry but the latte art didn't come out well.

573
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,330
Do you want me to make it again?

574
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,810
It's okay. Let me have it.

575
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,870
I'm sorry.

576
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:47,570
 Is anyone there?

577
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,080
 Please help me!

578
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,480
It's okay.

579
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,230
It was just a dream. It's okay.

580
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,800
It's okay. It's okay, Yoon Jeong.

581
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,280

582
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,270
Oh, you haven't left work yet.

583
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,750
I will after I leave the files.

584
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,340
Okay.

585
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,770
- Detective Cha. 
 - Yes, Director.

586
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,460
I heard you played a big role in solving the Ha Tae Sik case,

587
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,440
that you're amazingly sharp-eyed.

588
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,500
Not at all. I don't know much yet,

589
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,450
so sunbaes help me out a lot.

590
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:59,130
Are you saying you're receiving help from Oh Hyeon Jae?

591
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:03,440
I'm learning a lot from Detective Oh.

592
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,860
You're learning a lot from Detective Oh...

593
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:11,630
He does whatever he wants without a care for the organization.

594
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:16,340
If you want to work well in the organization, you need to meet a good superior.

595
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:22,390
Detective Oh is a good superior to me.

596
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:24,290
Are you sure?

597
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,080
Yes.

598
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,890
Work hard.

599
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,330
Hello.

600
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:11,250
Thank you.

601
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:50,040

602
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:53,590
4789.

603
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,700
4789.

604
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,740
4789, 4789, 4789.

605
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:05,100
4789, 4789, 4789.

606
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:09,170
He said it will protect me. 4789, 4789.

607
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:20,730
4789, 4789, 4789.

608
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:27,330
4789, 4789, 4789.

609
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:31,590
4789, 4789, 4789.

610
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,760
It'll protect me!

611
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,670
4789! 4789! 4789! 4789!

612
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:40,090
4789! It'll protect me!

613
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:42,780
♫  Let's go! I came up on the other side  ♫

614
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,540

623
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,260
  What do you mean Oh Hyeon Jae cut off all contact?

624
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,740
  What is 4789?

625
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,790
 4789. Bring it to me even if you have to make up something.

626
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:13,170
 We have to catch the culprit so it won't end up unsolved.

627
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:15,600
  - It's a serial murder. 
 - There is a survivor.

628
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,530
 She seems to be suffering from trauma.

629
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:19,160
 Would it be okay to ask her?

630
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,560
 The sound from two years ago...

631
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,400
 Why were you so aggressive with this case?

632
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,290
 I remembered something someone told me.

633
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,950
  That it could be someone's family member.

634
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,650
 Why do we always arrive a step too late

635
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,150
 and end up having to see the victims' bodies?

636

637
