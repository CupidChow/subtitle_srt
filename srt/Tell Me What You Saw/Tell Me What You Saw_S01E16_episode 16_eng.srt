1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,470

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,580

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,180

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,110

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,380

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,570

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,900

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:36,400

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,690

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,760

11
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,990
 Why did you do it?

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,850
 Why?

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,370
 Why Isu?

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,910
 I wanted to live.

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,720
 When Isu's name was said that day,

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,480
 Hwang Ha Yeong died.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,770
 I saw what I wanted to see.

18
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,880
 And I believed what I saw as is.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,660
 Having that kind of bastard by my side,

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,450
 laughing with him, talking to him...

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,250
 I'll formally introduce myself to you, Sunbae.

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,500
 I'm Cha Soo Yeong. Please take care of me.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,700
 Yes, let's do our best.

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,370
 Why did that bastard come to Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency?

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,600
 He had another goal.

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,390
 A goal that meant he had to come to Mucheon Metropolitan Police Station at all costs.

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,490
 Joo Sa Gang.

28
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,270
 The left-handed serial killer.

29
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,680
 Hey, Lefty.

30
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,960
 Let's talk for a bit.

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,960
 Kim Yo Han, this was your final goal.

32
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,400
 No, please. Don't do this.

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,980
 Don't do this.

34
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,940
 I think that bastard has known Oh Hyeon Jae

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,400
 for a much longer period than we thought.

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,050
 Maybe long before he started serial killing in full swing...

37
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,400
 In front of me is Hwang Ha Yeong,

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,590
 and behind me is Oh Hyeon Jae.

39
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,900
 I've prepared a present for you today.

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,290
 Team Leader is at Domyeong Elementary School right now.

41
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,660
 But that school... it's where that bastard used to attend.

42
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,870
 You're curious, aren't you?

43
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,010
 When exactly did our red thread of fate get tied together?

44
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,880
 The last location for a party I've prepared for you guys.

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,050
 Kang Dong Sik, it's all over now.

46
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,160
 Could that really be true?

47
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,900
 Be careful. You'll end up covered in wounds.

48
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,900

49
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,090

50
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,170
 A profiler analyzes the clues of a case

51
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,100
 and gets to know the suspect more and more.

52
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,690
 It's a process of setting the direction of the investigation and narrowing down the suspects.

53
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,860
 How do you figure out what type of a person the criminal is?

54
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,450
 The most important thing here is that you have to think like the criminal.

55
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,140
 That way, you can guess exactly what type of person the criminal is

56
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,280
 and what he or she will do in the future.

57
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,190
 If you know how they think,

58
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,190
 will you be able to tell

59
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,810
 the reason why they kill people?

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,330
 Do you know the story about the scorpion and the frog?

61
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,830
 There was a scorpion that needed to cross a river.

62
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,260
 But the scorpion couldn't cross the river,

63
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,770
 so it asked the frog for help.

64
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,890
 "Frog, I need to cross the river."

65
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,800
 "Can you help me?"

66
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,880
 But the frog refused.

67
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,880
 It was scared of the deadly poison of the scorpion.

68
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,560
 The scorpion said,

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,070
 "Frog, while we're crossing the river,"

70
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,700
 "if I sting you, won't we both die?"

71
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,600
 "I won't sting you."

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,770
 Relieved, the frog put the scorpion on its back and started to cross the river.

73
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,450
 But when they were halfway across,

74
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,370
 the water suddenly started to become rough.

75
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,180
 And the very shocked scorpion stung the frog unwittingly.

76
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,580
 So, in the end, they both died together.

77
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,000
 While the frog was dying, it asked the scorpion,

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,950
 "Scorpion, you promised not to sting me."

79
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,810
 "Why did you sting me?"

80
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,010
 That's when the scorpion said in a very sad voice,

81
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,020
 "Sorry, Frog."

82
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,860
 "That's naturally how I was born,"

83
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,330
 "so I guess I can't help it."

84
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,860
 Murderers follow their natural instinct.

85
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,000
 According to their natural instinct. That's all.

86
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,210
 That's naturally ... naturally how I was born...

87
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:36,510

88
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:55,450
 Thank you. We must meet again one day, Profiler Oh Hyeon Jae.

89
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,840

90
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,730
Okay, I understand.

91
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,150
Team Leader is at Domyeong Elementary School right now.

92
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,960
Domyeong Elementary School.

93
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,900
It's been shuttered. It's not far from here.

94
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,220
But that school...

95
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,680
it's where that bastard attended.

96
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,490
What is this? Why there of all places?

97
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,260
He didn't just happen to end up there while running away.

98
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,510
It could be a trap. This won't work.

99
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,380
I think we need to ask for back up.

100
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,470
- Detective Jang. 
 - Yeah.

101
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,400
This is Detective Jang Tae Seong of Team 1 of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

102
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,080
Please send back up to Domyeong Elementary School right away.

103
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,330
Leaving? To where?

104
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,490
To Domyeong Elementary School, which was closed ten years ago.

105
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,160
Team 1 is chasing after Kang Dong Sik right now.

106
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,120
Team 1 is chasing after Kang Dong Sik?

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,180
Yes, that's right.

108
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,490
Don't leave yet but be on standby.

109
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,220
I'll go talk to Team 2.

110
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,260
But they're asking for back up, and Kang Dong Sik is...

111
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,150
Okay, I understand.

112
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:20,310

113
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,020
You bastards, won't you get your heads screwed on straight!

114
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,040
How can all of you lose against Oh Hyeon Jae?

115
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,900
This is really our last chance.

116
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,700
Do whatever you have to in order to shut Oh Hyeon Jae and Kang Dong Sik's mouths.

117
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,390
 You get what I'm saying?

118
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,630
Yes, I understand.

119
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,030
Aren't you filled with emotions of your memory?

120
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,320
Do you want to hear something interesting?

121
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,920
The name you gave me last time was the wrong answer,

122
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,480
but this time, it's the correct answer.

123
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,960
Tell me the name of the person whom you want to kill.

124
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,190
The one person you want to kill...

125
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,800
Tell me the name.

126
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,230
Hurry up.

127
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,330
No one!

128
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,310
There's no one I want to kill, and there's no one to die by your hands!

129
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,990
No one will die, Kang Dong Sik.

130
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,880
I'll make sure that even someone like you receives the judgment of law.

131
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,500
Because...

132
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,320
I'm a police officer.

133
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,480
Oh Hyeon Jae!

134
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,820
What are you doing right now?

135
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,020
Team 1, get off this case from this moment onwards.

136
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,590
- What? 
 - This case is Team 2's now.

137
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,450
How can you say that? Right now, Team Leader Hwang and Detective Oh—

138
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,520
It's an order from our superior. Are you disobeying right now?

139
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,600
We don't care if it's disobedience.

140
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,200
Don't move.

141
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,720
Since when did the police force act on their own?

142
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,810
If you move one step, I'll shoot.

143
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,700
You got that?

144
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,400
Make sure to follow orders.

145
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,110
What happened?

146
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,510
Yes, we're holding Team 1 and searching.

147
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,280
As soon as you find them, kill them both.

148
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,920
What?

149
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,500
 Get closer to the car.

150
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,250
 The tire marks... are headed to the back...

151
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,750
Detective Hong, search the place first.

152
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,990
Put your hands up.

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,910
It's not inside the school but the back.

154
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,650
I'll take care of it here, so you go catch him.

155
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,250
It's not a fight for you to get involved in, Joo Sa Gang.

156
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Go quickly!

157
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,450
This way!

158
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,590
Team Leader!

159
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,950
Team Leader! Team Leader!

160
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,380
No...

161
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,310
Please send an ambulance to Domyeong Elementary School immediately.

162
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,410
Team Leader Hwang is injured. Please hurry!

163
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,610
- Team Leader. 
 - Stop Oh Hyeon Jae. Stop him.

164
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,790
Will you shoot?

165
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,830
Go ahead and shoot.

166
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,150
Go ahead and shoot.

167
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,620
Bang.

168
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,670
Oh Hyeon Jae, drop your gun!

169
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,560
Not yet.

170
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,400
This is my last warning. Drop your gun.

171
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,380
No, you can't.

172
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,690
Move. Move! This is an order!

173
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,830
I can't follow unjust orders!

174
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,440
If you shoot even once at Detective Oh,

175
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,210
I'll arrest you for dereliction of duty and attempted murder, Team Leader.

176
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,190
She has a serious injury. Be careful.

177
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,420
Please move aside.

178
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,340
Let go!

179
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,720
Come here!

180
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,180

181
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,820
What do we do now?

182
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,280
Team Leader is hurt, and Detective Oh has disappeared with that bastard.

183
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,100
There's only one place he could have gone.

184
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,320
His hideout.

185
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,830
We have to get there first. Hurry.

186
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,250
- What happened? 
 - We lost them.

187
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,030
You stupid idiot!

188
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,660
- What are you doing? Track their location! 
 - Yes, sir.

189
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,070
Where's your car? Hurry up. Hurry!

190
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,810
I came here yesterday.

191
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,240
At this rate, I'll get attached to this place.

192
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,200
Wow, you prepared a lot of things.

193
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,860
I look forward to it.

194
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,310
I think I saw someone on the way.

195
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,000
Who was it?

196
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,200
The father of the sixth victim you killed.

197
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,480
The sixth?

198
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,920
The sixth...

199
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,360
Ah, they do look alike.

200
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,490
She looks a lot like her father.

201
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,780
I remember her.

202
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,530
If you get hanged, the amount of time you can survive

203
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,900
is at minimum about 4 minutes and at maximum about 40 minutes.

204
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,030
But on average, it's 14 minutes.

205
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:29,770
Within those 14 minutes, most die completely.

206
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,210
I wonder how long you'll survive.

207
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,180
I will look forward to it.

208
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,360
Since you're in this situation already anyway, I'm hoping you're above average.

209
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,910
Just what is Detective Oh thinking?

210
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:59,360
No way. Even so, he wouldn't kill him...

211
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:08,300
 Oh Hyeon Jae will probably kill that bastard and then end his own life.

212
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,370
 I'll make sure to stop it, Team Leader.

213
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,790
Hey! She's in shock! Step on it!

214
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,210
I understand.

215
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,790
Deputy Commissioner, we found Team 1's vehicle.

216
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,300
- Hurry and step on it. 
 - Yes, sir.

217
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,640
Four minutes. It's less than anticipated.

218
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,500
You didn't think I'd kill you this easily, did you?

219
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,210
The pain and dread that you made your victims feel...

220
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:36,080
I will never kill you until you feel it a thousand times more.

221
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,400
As expected...

222
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,480
you're living up to my expectations.

223
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,150
Oh Hyeon Jae, you know it too, right?

224
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:55,340
You and I are the same kind of person.

225
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,310
How do you feel right now?

226
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,520
How does it feel to play with someone's life?

227
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,250
It's thrilling, isn't it?

228
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:16,340
That sense of superiority from having someone's life and death at your fingertips.

229
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,930
I guess it's bearable.

230
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,180
It's too bearable.

231
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,300
I, anyway ... just like you...

232
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,850
I don't feel pain or fear anyway.

233
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,680
Anyway, have you found the answer?

234
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,550
Think carefully.

235
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,280
The scorpion and the frog

236
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,370
crossing a river. That story.

237
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,670
 "Scorpion, you promised not to sting me."

238
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,480
 "Why did you sting me?"

239
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,840
 That's when the scorpion said in a very sad voice,

240
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,730
 "Sorry, Frog."

241
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,600
 "That's naturally how I was born,"

242
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,340
 "so I guess I can't help it."

243
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,520
 Murderers follow their natural instinct.

244
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,370
 According to their natural instinct. That's all.

245
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:49,110
It's sophism... It's just how you were born.

246
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:54,720
Even without my words, you would have ended up like this anyway. That's it.

247
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,480
You created me.

248
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:14,070
No. You just wanted to enjoy the pleasure of murder.

249
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,310
Because that's your natural instinct. Don't you get it?

250
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,370
There's a lot of blood.

251
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,280
Keep pressure on this.

252
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,690
We have to go up?

253
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,280
What's wrong with this? Hold on.

254
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,440
Seriously! What is this crazy behavior?!

255
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,730
Detective Oh is trying to see this to the end by himself without anyone's interference.

256
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,830
What? No way...

257
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,050
He's trying to die with him.

258
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,050
Oh Hyeon Jae. Oh Hyeon Jae.

259
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,820
It's time for you to die, Kim Yo Han.

260
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,830
Han Isu.

261
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:40,080
The one who killed Han Isu

262
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,970
is someone else.

263
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:48,590
Don't be weak. You'll be fine.

264
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,580
No way. Team 2 has already...

265
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,370
How did they find out about this place?

266
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,810
The two of you, please take these cars respectively and lure Team 2 away.

267
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,060
Like we're chasing Detective Oh?

268
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,920
Yes, that's right. I'll do whatever I can to make my way in.

269
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,470
Okay.

270
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,280
Detective Cha, you were like Team Leader just now.

271
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,550
That car. Follow them!

272
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,710
If I die here,

273
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,270
for the rest of your life,

274
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,720
you'll regret this moment.

275
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:16,370
If you're going to let me down, why not a little bit more?

276
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,630
Look, if you can't convince me,

277
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,730
this will crash your skull.

278
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,030
Begin.

279
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,250
The one who

280
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,990
killed Han Isu...

281
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:59,690
is you, Oh Hyeon Jae.

282
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,840
 But... it’s too soon to be at ease.

283
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,870
 You don’t need to scare me.

284
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,260
 I’m scared enough.

285
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,230
 Anyway, don’t push yourself too much.

286
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:35,920
Han Isu was the first person I failed to kill.

287
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,600
Think carefully. Han Isu ...

288
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,730
She was alive until then.

289
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:18,350
Believing that you would come

290
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:24,460
and save her.

291
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,890
A moment's hesitation...

292
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,710
 Hyeon Jae! Hyeon Jae!

293
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,890
 Hyeon Jae! Hyeon Jae!

294
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,830
 Oh Hyeon Jae!

295
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,290
That hesitation

296
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,480
killed...

297
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,660
Han Isu.

298
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,720
Your desire

299
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,420
killed...

300
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,810
Han Isu.

301
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,510
Shut up.

302
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,260
Shut up, you bastard!

303
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,450
No.

304
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,970
Not right now.

305
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,530
- You can't see? Can you not see? 
 - No.

306
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,980
Please, give me a little more time...

307
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,480
I'm here, Oh Hyeon Jae.

308
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,860
Come out.

309
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,550
Come out.

310
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,920
Hey, I'm right here.

311
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,560
Don't hide and come out!

312
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,780
Right now!

313
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,840
Detective Oh!

314
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,740
Detective Oh! Detective Oh!

315
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,330
Detective Oh! Detective Oh!

316
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,820
It must be Cha Soo Yeong.

317
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,760
She's really amazing.

318
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,250
After all these years,

319
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,470
she found her mother's hit-and-run driver.

320
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:58,490
Thanks to her, meeting you has become more dramatic.

321
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,050
Oh Hyeon Jae,

322
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:15,220
the fact that the one who caused Han Isu to die was you...

323
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,710
I'm sure you don't want to acknowledge it.

324
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,710
That's why you're chasing after us like crazy.

325
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,060
Hwang Ha Yeong, who said Han Isu's name...

326
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,450
Me, who tried to kill Han Isu...

327
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,720
- That's BS. 
 - No.

328
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,490
That's not the truth.

329
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,400
That's not the truth.

330
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,720
I'm sure you don't want to acknowledge it,

331
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,930
but it's the truth.

332
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:07,600
Oh Hyeon Jae, you didn't try to see the truth,

333
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,700
and you didn't try to state the truth. That's your sin.

334
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,760
I didn't kill Isu!

335
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,220
I tried to save her.

336
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,910
I tried to rescue her until the end!

337
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,700
You're just another human after all.  You're too weak.

338
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,730
I'll kill you quickly.

339
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:37,440
Oh Hyeon Jae, I'm saying this just in case,

340
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,700
but don't worry about Cha Soo Yeong. She's next after you.

341
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,860
After I kill you,

342
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,240
I could really become a perfect being.

343
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,730
We don't have much time.

344
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,520
I'll kill you now.

345
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:35,540
Kim Yo Han, people see what they want to see,

346
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,720
and hear what they want to hear.

347
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,840
They only believe what they've experienced.

348
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,920
As for me, I never told you that I couldn't see.

349
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,980
It was just your belief, that's all.

350
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,290
Tell me one person whom you want to kill.

351
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,170
Hurry.

352
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,330
There are so many.

353
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:16,620
I guess it's still bearable.

354
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,520
I'll give you another chance.

355
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,180
The name I want to hear... hurry and tell me.

356
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,150
Oh Hyeon Jae.

357
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,890
Don't disappoint me.

358
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,680
Tell me. Hurry.

359
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,710
Kim Yo Han.

360
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,980
Alright.

361
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,630
Detective Oh!

362
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,270
 May I ask you a question?

363
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,970
 Go ahead.

364
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,050
 You said you weren’t interested.

365
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,530
 Why did you help me?

366
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,240
 I never helped you.

367
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,020
 Then why?

368
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,880
 I pitied you.

369
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,110
 I pity myself, too.

370
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,380
 What did you mean by that?

371
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,260
 Scars...

372
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,980
 A sense of loss for those whose tomorrow will never come.

373
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,010
 Look here, Cha Soo Yeong.

374
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,630
 Try to fight it.

375
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,460
 If you don't want to be weakened.

376
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,520
 I believe in you too, Detective Oh.

377
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:24,190
Look here, Cha Soo Yeong.

378
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:27,790
Did you know I wouldn't kill him?

379
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,280
I had faith in you, Detective Oh.

380
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:45,950
This bastard probably thinks he's dying happily.

381
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:51,720
But when he wakes up, his pain will begin.

382
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,590
You said you wanted to become a good police officer, right?

383
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,640
Tell me.

384
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,830
Are you a good person,

385
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:10,390
or... the opposite?

386
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:18,260
♫  It's impossible to contain in my two hands  ♫

387
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,190
Tell me what you saw.

388
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,380
♫  The memories which you have lost  ♫

389
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:40,610
♫  In an instant I recall you as if you were a picture  ♫

390
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,370
♫  Will be wandering again  ♫

391
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,540
It's said that...

392
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:49,600
people live according to the way they're born.

393
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,660
But I don't agree with that.

394
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:58,790
A good-natured person can be overtaken by darkness,

395
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:05,900
and an ill-natured person can overcome their darkness.

396
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,760
♫  As though putting together fragmented traces  ♫

397
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,230
I'll tell you what I saw.

398
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,870
I saw the will.

399
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,640
The will to fight until the end in order  to not get overtaken by darkness.

400
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,380
Whether someone is good or not,

401
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:34,970
♫  In an instant I recall you as if you were a picture  ♫

402
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,550
the person makes his or her own choice.

403
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,270
♫  Will be lost again  ♫

404
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,190
Now,

405
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,000
I need to

406
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,890
♫  Before I realized it  ♫

407
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:02,480
go see someone.

408
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,260
♫  You were beyond my sight  ♫

409
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:18,830
♫  You left me behind  ♫

410
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:24,890
♫  Who wandered alone searching for you  ♫

411
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,660
- Let's move her quickly to the operating room. 
 - Yes.

412
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,770

413
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,280
Inspector Do Jin Cheol, you are under arrest for falsely reporting and

414
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,840
for the attempted murder under Article 18 of the Police Officers Act.

415
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,800
Deputy Commissioner Park Soon Woong,

416
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,300
you are under arrest on charges of attempted murder and abuse of authority

417
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,130
under Article 19 of the Police Civil Service Act.

418
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,280

419
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,080
Hyung, I came.

420
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,810
I look terrible, don't I?

421
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:38,300
You didn't come visit me while I was admitted at the hospital,

422
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,490
so it felt strange.

423
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,110

424
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,200
The case...

425
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,690
has been resolved well.

426
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,720
And Oh Hyeon Jae has disappeared like before.

427
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:04,960
I should have listened more closely to everything you told me before.

428
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,530
I'm regretting it.

429
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:10,340
I'm going to try and live well.

430
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,020
I'm going to live a life where I won't feel ashamed in front of you at the very least.

431
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,090
Please watch me.

432
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,900

433
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,230

434
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,810

435
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:15,640
Dad, has something happened? What's the matter?

436
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,040
 What's the matter with you?

437
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,900
 Is it still hard?

438
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:26,340
No, it's not. I've been here two years already.

439
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,270
Hey, we're mobilizing!

440
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,490
- I have to go. 
  - Okay, be careful.

441
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,640
Hey, Detective Kim, get our equipment.

442
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,050
Yes, sir.

443
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,530
I'll do that right away.

444
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,930
- Hey, move it! 
 - Yes, sir.

445
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,990
S-Spare me.

446
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,830
Say something that makes sense.

447
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:15,590
If I was going to spare you,

448
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:18,480
why would I have dragged you all the way out here?

449
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,970
What the?

450
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:40,880
This is not how you use a hammer.

451
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,650
He's really a horrible punk.

452
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,040
Hey, Detective Lee, arrest him.

453
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,740
Stay still, you bastard.

454
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,050
Let me go!

455
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:59,250
Take him away!

456
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,680
Hey!

457
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,960
Why aren't you coming?

458
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,240
Are you okay?

459
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,880
You can relax now. We're the police.

468
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:16,340

469
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:46,340
 Why do we always arrive a step too late

470
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,970
 and end up having to see the victims' bodies?

471
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,630
 Look here, Cha Soo Yeong.

472
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:57,400
 Listen carefully.

473
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,730
 There is no such thing as divine retribution in this world.

474
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,860
 There's only the law that people have created.

475
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,480
 The kind that catches criminals by chasing them until the end.

476
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,970
 I just hope that what we do

477
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:37,490
 comforts those victims who have passed away, even just a little.

478
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,080
 I think it's a good thing that I became a police officer.

479
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,400
 I think so too.

480
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,250
 Pardon?

481
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,750
 It's good that you became a police officer, Cha Soo Yeong.

482
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:07,370

483
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:18,320

Why are you about to fall?

00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,930
Okay.

495
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,670
Hey!

496
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,060
Cut.

00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,410
You can wait outside for a bit.

498
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,520
Please give us her shoes.

499
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,580
You have to hold that up well.

500
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,780
Hold it in that position.

501
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,620
I'll do this over here.

502
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,130
It's like this. So then with your hand...

503
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,880
Action!

504
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,570
Cut, we will go once more.

505
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,130
Oh, wow.

506
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,020
I have to kill him.

507
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:39,100
This guy is that bastard.

508
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,750
I'm Dong Sik.

509
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,350
It will be revealed soon.

510
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,030
The reality is that we can't win.

511
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:53,410
Hold on. Send more back up.

512
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:57,390
Look, Soo Yeong.

513
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,380
This is the feeling we need here.

514
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,100
Cut, okay.

515
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,400
Team Leader Hwang, let's get your take from there once.

516
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,570
Team Leader Hwang?

517
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,980
My chest...

518
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,980
I'm a scaredy cat so in case my hand might get crushed since they're closing the door...

519
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,180
I flinched earlier, too.

520
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,110
- This bastard. 
 - Welcome.

521
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,680
I'm Section Chief Bang Sang Sik from Hwayeong Police Station.

522
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,240
If you enter the site without following official procedure—

523
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,200
Hello. This is the culprit.

524
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,480
It's the witness. Then what am I supposed to say?

525
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,300
My legs.

526
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,980
One, two!

527
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:44,200
Hyeon Soo!  It was a misunderstanding! I won't do it again! I was wrong!

528
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,360
Hit my back twice,

529
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,060
and then press you down.

530
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:03,930
Come, then I'll hold you like this and...

531
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:11,170
- It looks like Dong Sik, right?
- Yes, it looks like Dong Sik.

532
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:14,790
The action synchronized really well.

533
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:19,500
Because I have long hair, it seems like I have more speed.

534
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,560
Action.

535
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:37,270
Cut, okay!

536
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,490
That's good.

537
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:47,150
Gosh, I'm tearing up.

538
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,620
Tissue. Are there any tissues?

539
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,860
Let's check the audio.

540
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:58,300
Jjajangmyeon  (black bean noodles)  for Detective Lee! He only eats jjajangmyeon.

541
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,600
What are you laughing at?

542
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,970
What are you laughing at?

543
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,970
One more time.

544
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:24,860
So that's why!

545
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,300
The end.

546
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:33,840
