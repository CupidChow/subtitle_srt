1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,300

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,770

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,210

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,720

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,350

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,280

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,960

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:36,110

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,430

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:55,350

11
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,300
Hey.

12
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,480
 It's storage 3.

13
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,730
Cha Soo Yeong is in danger.

14
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,980
- That way! 
 - Who was it?

15
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,210
Cha Soo Yeong.

16
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,640
Find her.

17
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,660
Hey. Why did you follow me without any fear?

18
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,240
Who is it?

19
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,050
Who's hiding?

20
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,810
Hide well.

21
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,510
Are you the crazy bastard who texted me?

22
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,070
 Cha Soo Yeong has disappeared.

23
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,060
No, she's still in there.

24
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,590
 I heard the sound of a door closing.

25
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,570
She is not here.

26
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,230
Where did she go?

27
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,120

28
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,370
Let's go this way.

29
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,340
What is this?

30
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,530
Policewoman Cha!

31
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,990
- Hey, Detective Jang! 
 - Yes?

32
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,490
Policewoman Cha!

33
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,640
Policewoman Cha! Policewoman Cha, are you okay?

34
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,510
Let's get her up.

35
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,980
-  Search thoroughly! 
 - Okay.

36
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,020
- Look carefully inside and upside, you punk! 
 - Yes.

37
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,680
Nothing here.

38
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,410
Nothing here, either.

39
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,450
He disappeared.

40
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,760
Nice going.

41
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,510
- Detective Jang, lift her up. 
 - Ah, yes.

42
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,500

43
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm sorry. I should've waited until you came.

44
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,890
You knew that, but you entered alone?

45
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,140
Drink it.

46
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,250
That's why you should have reported it to me!

47
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,680
You think you're the only detectives?

48
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,830
If you had worked with us in the first place, this wouldn't have happened.

49
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,920
You came here to work together, Chief?

50
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,870
It's fine that you have your personal grudge or ambition,

51
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,450
but let's think of the organization first.

52
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,300
It'll be revealed later what is good for the organization.

53
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,810
Send the policewoman back to her original post

54
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,210
instead of uselessly making things into a bigger problem.

55
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,970

56
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,750
Geez, what is this?

57
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,850
You can't take pictures!

58
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,850
 Please don't!

59
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,180
Hey, Forensic Team.  Be careful not to break the ice!

60
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,260
What are you doing? If you're done moving swiftly, block them!

61
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,880
Hey, don't let them take pictures!  What are you doing?  Block them!

62
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,300
Yes, it's confirmed.

63
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,830
It looks like he slipped into the water tank in the freezer storage and froze.

64
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,810
We'll know once we have an autopsy done on him

65
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,530
but I'm sure he drowned to death.

66
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,300
That's a relief.

67
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,250
How about that thing?

68
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,200
That is...

69
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,350
His head is still in the ice.

70
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,790
I don't think a drowning guy would have died while sucking candy.

71
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,180
Wrap it up quickly.

72
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,220
Yes, I understand.

73
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,570
It's me.

74
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,000
 I thought you might be curious about this.

75
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,120
There was no mint.

76
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,480
 Outwardly, there was no sign of murder either.

77
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,350
 I'll contact you again once the autopsy result comes out.

78
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,160
No mint showed up.

79
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,120
Someone else definitely must've been in the freezer storage.

80
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,660
That guy knew that Jeong Chan Goo would go there.

81
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,080

What is this?

82
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,060
Because he himself lured him to the place.

83
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:35,050
But no mint showed up?

84
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,710
 Are you the crazy bastard who texted me?!

85
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,980
Team Leader, there's something I wanted to ask you.

86
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,030
Is the Kang Seung Hwan case going to be wrapped up now?

87
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,100
Since the suspect is dead,

88
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,690
there is no right of arraignment, so the case will be closed.

89
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,220
Why?

90
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,080
Once this case is over, I have to go back to the precinct, right?

91
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,760
Since I came here for that.

92
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,930
Detective Lee will take care of the paperwork.

93
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,740
  Around 6:30 AM today, Mr. Jeong

94
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,010
 who was being pursued by the police on charges of serial kidnapping and murder

95
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,780
  was found dead in a freezer in the City of Mucheon.

96
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,800
  The police stated that there was no suspicion of murder

97
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,830
 and suspect that it was an accidental death.

98
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,230
Let's start.

99
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,940
Today, at 6:37 AM, Jeong Chan Goo, suspected of murdering Kang Seung Hwang,

100
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,630
was found as a dismembered corpse in a freezer.

101
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,460
There was no sign of forced entry upon investigation,

102
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,190
and according to the medical examiner, murder is highly unlikely.

103
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,930
For now, it is presumed that Jeong Chan Goo slipped into the water accidentally and drowned.

104
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,990
It looks like, by the forensic team's mistake, the ice-making machine got started,

105
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,060
and the body inside of the ice was cut into pieces by the machine.

106
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,510
You all must know that even the superiors are interested in this case.

107
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:10,150
Resolve this well  so that there isn't any more talk in the future about the mint killer or whatever.

108
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,890
Yes, I understand, Commissioner.

109
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,650
Commissioner, there's something I have to tell you.

110
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,450
Team Leader Hwang, what do you think you're doing now?

111
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,200
It's nothing, Commissioner.

112
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,810
Team Leader Hwang Ha Yeong, do you have something to say?

113
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,150
There's a high chance that this case is part of a serial murder.

114
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,550
What's that supposed to mean?

115
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,330
The autopsy results said the death was an accident.

116
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,480
I apologize. I'll wrap this up, Commissioner.

117
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,430
Wait.

118
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,640
Do you have proof?

119
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,030
You must have some sort of evidence.

120
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,010
There was circumstantial evidence that there was a third person at the scene.

121
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,300
When I was first appointed, you taught me to

122
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,260
consider everything with an open mind and conduct clear-cut investigations.

123
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,770
And so?

124
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,230
Please give us permission to continue investigating.

125
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,710
I'll wrap things up, Commissioner.

126
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,820
If Team Leader Hwang is willing to go against her superiors to tell me this,

127
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,320
that means something is up.

128
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,890
Will you take responsibility if you can't find anything?

129
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,090
I will.

130
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,050
Yes, I understand.

131
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,510
Also, can I request one more thing?

132
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,430

133
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,360
I sent the official papers to the police station.

134
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,410
Thank you.

135
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,190
I said you don't have to do it, so stop.

136
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,450
You're making dust fly everywhere.

137
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,970
Why would someone who is going to leave clean this place?

138
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,970
I finished, it's okay.

139
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,980
Still, I feel sad about you leaving since we spent time together for several days.

140
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,250
Hey! Then you should've been nicer to her when you had the chance.

141
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,990
Who knew this would happen? I thought she would stay longer.

142
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,750
You all had more to worry uselessly about because of me.

143
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,560
Thank you.

144
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,700
Well, at least you know.

145
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,690
Right. Don't think about the Metropolitan Investigation Unit,

146
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,530
but work hard at the police station from now on.

147
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,210
It's better in the countryside, with good air and less cases.

148
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,580
Hello?

149
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,940
Yes, I understand. Goodbye.

150
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,090
Policewoman Cha, the team leader wants to see you on the rooftop.

151
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,750
Why?

152
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,280
You're in big trouble now. Oh dear.

153
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,260

154
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,010
It's a good place to come to when I want to clear my head here and there.

155
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,790
What was it like in the investigation unit?

156
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,650
If I'm being honest,

157
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,730
it was much harder than I had expected.

158
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,390
But when I go to the crime scene,

159
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,710
I felt that I was alive, so it was good.

160
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,950
The investigation unit isn't for everyone.

161
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,890
It's a place where people hang on just with their mettle and pride.

162
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,580
So the other detectives have no reason to like you.

163
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,130
You've worked hard.

164
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,390
You worked hard as well, Team Leader.

165
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,040

166
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,020
You're officially a part of the team starting now.

167
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,410
Don't regret it.

168
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,520
I won't.

169
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,700

170
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,620
Is the air going in or not?

171
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,330
- Hey, Dong Sik!
- Yes?

172
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,000
- Cha Soo Yeong is staying in the Metropolitan Investigation Unit. 
 - What?

173
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,930
I'm serious, I just received the call.

174
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,960
Chief, what kind of a lie is that?

175
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,390
Are you serious?

176
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,260
She always went on and on about joining the investigative unit.

177
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
I guess you have to keep saying it for it to come true.

178
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,820
Then she's not working here anymore?

179
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,320
Did you even listen to a word I just said?

180
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,640
What crappy thing did you bring in this time?

181
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,220
Just focus on your work!

182
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,920
Why isn't the air going in?

183
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,820
It's getting annoying.

184
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,160
Hey, Cha  Soo Yeong.

185
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,960
Hello, Sunbae. Did you hear?

186
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,190
Yeah, I did. I heard it so well, and I'm so sad.

187
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,510
Out of everyone, don't you think you should have told me first?

188
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,420
If I called the chief, it would be automatically relayed to you.

189
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,120
Isn't the top-down method good for everything?

190
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,550
What? Top-down?

191
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,150
Man, are you using English now?

192
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,530
Huh? You're bragging that you're in the Investigative Unit?

193
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,150
I thought you called to congratulate me.

194
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,620
Oh, yeah, congratulations. I really congratulate you.

195
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,560
I congratulate you so much. Clap, clap, clap, clap.

196
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,320
But, even if you're there, you have to remember

197
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,590
where you started, what precinct you started in. Got that?

198
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,710
Yes, of course.

199
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,760
I'm Cha Soo Yeong from the proud Hongwoon Police Station in Hongwoon-myeon.

200
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,050
Anyway, don't feel discouraged by the people around you.

201
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,590
 Stand with your shoulders straight. You can do this!

202
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,940
Okay.

203
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,180
And remember to visit and treat us to a nice meal. You can do this!

204
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,330
 And take us to rounds two and three —

205
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,730
Hello? Hey! Cha Soo Yeong!

206
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,140
That bad-girl attitude. She hung up on me again.

207
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,950
Oh, she's so annoying. Oh, man.

208
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,000

209
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:40,840
♫  Left alone in the rough wind  ♫

210
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,560
♫  The petals withered  ♫

211
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,280

♫  The petals withered  ♫

212
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:55,390
♫  Filled with you I fall sleep  ♫

213
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:02,160
♫  The world turns redder  ♫

214
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,820
♫  Deep in the dark  ♫

215
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,930
♫  Your sigh seeps in before I know it  ♫

216
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:16,890
♫  In the withered petals  ♫

217
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,040
♫  The color spreads  ♫

218
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,220
Whoa, Cha Soo Yeong!

219
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,330
Salute. Policewoman Cha Soo Yeong from Hongwoon Police Station—

220
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,590
Salute. Policewoman Cha Soo Yeong

221
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,630
from Hongwoon Police Station to Metropolitan Investigation Unit Team 1.

222
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,260
I received a transfer order so I'm reporting in.

223
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,600
Attention!

224
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,890
Congratulations.

225
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,460
What's this?

226
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,220
Attention! Policewoman Cha...

227
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,590
- Why's she here? 
 - It just happened like this.

228
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,000
Don't be like that. Let's take a commemorative photo.

229
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,460
- Come on, Team Leader, stand in the middle. 
 - You go ahead.

230
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,090
Don't be like that. Come in the middle.

231
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,600
- Hyung-nim, get in here. 
 - No, I'll take the picture.

232
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,430
Come here, I'll take the picture.

233
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,530
Come closer, closer. I'm going to take it. Come closer.

234
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,360
Come closer, Hyung-nim.

235
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,260
Ready. One, two, three!

236
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,530
I'm late.  I'm sorry.

237
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,730
What's the matter that you wanted to see me outside?

238
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,360
I have something important to discuss with you.

239
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,520
What's the matter that you're taking so much time to tell?

240
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,210
Firstly...

241
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,340
I thought you should be aware of this, Deputy Commissioner.

242
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,470
What is this?

243
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,380
I found this in the Jeong Chan Goo's mouth.

244
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,280
Then you're saying he was murdered?

245
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,330
We don't know it yet.

246
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,980
Then that bastard is really...

247
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,890
We don't know. Just like the Joonggeon three-way intersection explosion 5 years ago.

248
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,120
 Search every corner thoroughly! Quickly!

249
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,550
 Yes.

250
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,620
What about Team Leader Hwang?

251
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,880
She must never know, of course.

252
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,500
Can we bury this until the end?

253
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,410
The media and internet already went really crazy.

254
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,290
What are you going to do about it?

255
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,310
Everything will be fine if you trust me and follow well.

256
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,580
Aigoo, you've already started.

257
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,660

258
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,330
 Soo Yeong, match these blocks as you see in the picture here.

259
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,790
 One, two, three.

260
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,620
 Would you try it?

261
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,450
 Her IQ is average and she is normal in memory.

262
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,000
 But  my daughter is very forgetful of things.

263
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,850
 Will it be okay?

264
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,490
 In your daughter's case,

265
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:29,260
 her occipital lobe, which processes visuals, is more developed than those of normal people's.

266
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,210
 People's brains are very mysterious.

267
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,890
 If one part gets better, then other parts get dull relatively.

268
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,420
Mom.

269
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,330
I will definitely catch

270
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,330
the culprit who killed you.

271
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,900
Kang Seung Hwan died due to strangulation.

272
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,270
Jeong Chan Goo was found drowned and dismembered.

273
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:43,240
There was no mint in Jeong Chan Goo's mouth.

274
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,110
 There was no mint.

275
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,850
It was just a copycat crime.

276
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,010
Or it could be a separate case.

277
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:57,420
No. Kang Seung Hwan and Jeong Chan Goo hid their relationship from the outsiders.

278
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,420
There was no one that knew about their relationship.

279
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,030
But they successively died by chance?

280
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:09,580
If it was not planned, what's the percent chance of that occurrence?

281
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,980
This was definitely done by the same criminal.

282
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,050
 As for the mint, his plan went awry.

283
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,450

284
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,180

285
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,660

286
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,790
♫ If I go, where would it be?

287
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,500
Ah, geez! What is this? Which bastard—

288
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,390
Ah, this is really driving me crazy!

289
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,000
What is this? Ah, how dirty!

290
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,370
Ah, damn it.  If I catch him, this bastard... Ah, seriously.

291
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,300
This bastard.  I washed my car yesterday.

292
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,140
If you get caught, you'll be dead.

293
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,880
You.  I'll catch you.

294
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,560
What is this?  It's really a piece of bad luck.

295
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,170

296
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,710
How many floors are there?

297
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,720
Wow.  I'm just a frog in a tiny pond...

298
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,380
What are you doing here?

299
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,060
You said you would visit me and you're really here.

300
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,150
Do you know I had to finish all the civil complaints

301
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,610
in order to make it in time for your leaving work?

302
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,300
Why are you acting like this?  I feel burdened.

303
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,810
But I'm still happy to see you.

304
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,210
By looking at your face, I can see that you're barely keeping up.

305
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,520
Me?

306
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,070
What are you talking about?  As soon as I got here, I settled in right away.

307
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,700
I can tell right away that you're having a hard time.

308
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,320
The very scary Team Leader Hwang and Team 1 under her—

309
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,840
Be quiet. Be quiet.

310
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,310
Someone will hear you!

311
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,940
Who cares if someone hears or not? It's a fact.

312
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,780
Wow, anyway, this is on another level.

313
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,830
And it has many floors too.

314
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,700
By the way, where is Metropolitan Investigation Unit Team 1's office?

315
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,820
- It's upstairs. 
 - Let's stop by so I can see your seat as well.

316
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,000
- Right now? 
 - Yeah.

317
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,440
No, we can't.

318
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,000
Why not?

319
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,910
Well, it's not tidied up and it's messy.

320
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,190
Are you acting like this because you feel embarrassed of me?

321
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,760
Do you feel embarrassed because I'm a countryside police man?

322
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,230
What are you talking about?

323
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,760
Why would I feel embarrassed of you, Sunbae?

324
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,660
Oh my, oh my.  Your eyes are wavering right now.

325
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,620
Am I weird right now?

326
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,260
No, it's not like that.

327
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,380
I want to buy you a cup of coffee. Let's go.

328
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,920
- Did I misunderstand? 
 - Yes, it's a misunderstanding.

329
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,900
- You're sure, right? 
 - Of course.  Let's go.

330
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,730
- I misunderstood, right? 
 - It's a misunderstanding.

331
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,830
Do you know that kind of feeling?

332
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,910
I wanted something so dearly but when it actually came true...

333
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,270
I feel a little dazed?

334
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,320
I think I'm a little scared too.

335
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,270
Just try facing it head on.

336
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,080
If you keep doing something tenaciously, luck will follow you.

337
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,500
Then you will also end up achieving what you really wanted to.

338
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,330
While doing so, you'll meet your mate and your dream will come true.

339
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,670
That's how people live their lives, don't you think?

340
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,130
I don't wish for a lot.

341
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,180
In the end, I only have one dream.

342
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,720
What is it?

343
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,780
Just something.

344
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,640
What about you? Do you have a dream that you wish to achieve?

345
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,020
Hmm... I think I have the same dream as the one I had in my young age.  Living an ordinary life.

346
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,700
What is that?

347
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,760
What do you mean?  It's very hard to live an ordinary life.

348
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,210
How can I live in obscurity among the people?

349
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,490
For me, sticking out is what I hate most in the world.

350
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,460
Wow, you're simpler than I thought.

351
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,220
Yes, I'm simple.

352
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,990
Since I was young, people said I was simple,

353
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,680
so my nickname was stuffed picked cucumber  (play on the word "simple") .

354
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,410
Gosh, you're no fun.

355
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,930
I'll get going to protect Hongwoon.

356
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,950
Oh, right.

357
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,260
What is this?

358
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,120
I bought this for me to wear.

359
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,440
But you wear it.

360
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,990
Why do you spend money on this stuff?

361
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,640
You said you wanted to live a simple life.

362
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,620
You're so pretentious...

363
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,150
I don't own one of these.

364
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:50,060
You?  By any chance... are you... Detective Cha of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit?

365
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,990
Wow! You look so good.

366
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,790
You look like a detective from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit. You'd better wear those.

367
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,520
- Really? 
 - Yes, good.  Look at your pose.

368
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,840
Oh, good.  Okay. Keep this pose. It's good.

369
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,780
- Are you leaving? 
 - Goodbye.

370
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,840

371
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,550

372
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,590
Chief Choi Hyeong Pil, it's Na Joon Seok.

373
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:06,410
Just in case for safety, I'd like to request some protection.

374
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,040
Yes.

375
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,790
Does our team have to do this kind of thing, too?

376
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,310
He's a public figure.

377
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,780
Chief Choi specifically instructed us to do this.

378
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,010
They're just, you know,

379
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,070
trolls on the internet fooling around.

380
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,770
How is it threatening?

381
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,690
Hey, Cha—

382
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:41,130
Where did she go? I need to pee so badly.

383
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,660
Oh, shut up. Keep watch carefully.

384
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,760
Oh, the release was a bit...

385
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,630
Hyung-nim! There is an attacker.

386
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,210
Hey!

387
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,340
You bastard!

388
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,490
Are you okay?

389
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,940
There was someone who tried to harm Professor Na Joon Seok.

390
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,400
He is fleeing to the market. Please back up.

391
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,730
Hey, halt right there, you bastard!

392
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,040
Detective Cha, catch him!

393
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,080
Stop right there!

394
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,940
Go quickly!

395
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,470
Where did he go?

396
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,300
He's definitely in the vicinity.

397
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,930
He could go into the stores.

398
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,790
Look for him focusing on the stores.

399
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,510
Follow me.

400
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,420
Detective Yang, the man over there with the checkered shirt.

401
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,150
 Checkered shirt. Check the guy with the checkered shirt.

402
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,040
Okay, got it.

403
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,580
I am arresting you on suspicion of attempted murder.

404
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,250
Anything you say can be used against you. You have the right to an attorney.

405
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,430
I've told you your rights.

406
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,590
Let me go!

407
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,320
Let go. I said let go!

408
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,270

409
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,550
Team Leader Hwang.

410
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,580
I heard that asshole was caught.

411
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,570
Oh...you worked hard, even going on a stakeout.

412
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,760
The Metropolitan Investigation Unit isn't a personal bodyguard unit.

413
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,650
It must be nice to have such powerful backers.

414
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,350
Isn't this a given?

415
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,970
We're all in the same family.

416
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:36,800
Please take care of me in the future too, Team Leader Hwang.

417
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,850
Kim Myeong Ho, you acknowledge your crime, right?

418
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,510
Why did you do it?

419
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,750
Because he deserves to die.

420
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,270
So why did you try to kill him?

421
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,660
Even if you've suffered an injustice,

422
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,610
you should still try to resolve it with the law, isn't that so?

423
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,530
The law?

424
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,900
What can the law do?

425
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:19,060
I... I... because of him, I became a murderer.

426
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,260
Thanks to that, my younger sister committed suicide.

427
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,240
Hey, you! This is attempted murder!

428
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,760
You’ll be subject to aggravated punishment.

429
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,700
Kim Myeong Ho.

430
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,470
Why did you put a mint in his car?

431
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,650

432
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,110
Thank you. Have a nice day.

433
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,960
Have fun reading. Next.

434
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,330
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

435
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:52,450
I'm such a huge fan. You're so cool.

436
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,070
Thank you. Here you go.

437
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,780
You're the best, Professor!

438
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,710
Next.

439
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,560

440
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,040
I enjoyed your broadcast.

441
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,050
Thank you.

442
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,220
You make a good first impression.

443
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,830
Are you going to keep your promise?

444
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,820
What promise are you talking about?

445
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,900
You'd bet your life that the bastard isn't alive.

446
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,820
That promise.

447
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,400
That will never happen.

448
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,370
My conjecture has never been wrong.

449
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,000
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

450
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,830
Next.

451
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,260
Hello.

452
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,990

453
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,320
Kim Myeong Ho, 29 years old, 7 prior convictions.

454
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,990
He completed his sentence for the armed robbery and was released from prison this February.

455
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,240
At that time, the victim, an old woman, passed away.

456
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,450
He insisted he had only stolen money and not killed her,

457
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,330
but this wasn't accepted.

458
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,840
At the time, Professor Na Joon Seok was the profiler for the case.

459
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,980
Any family members?

460
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,690
He had a younger sister,

461
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,780
but she committed suicide while he was serving his sentence.

462
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,670
What about the mint that was found in his car?

463
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:26,480
He said that was intentionally placed there to scare him.

464
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,780
What is it?

465
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,710
- It's a package. 
 - Package?

466
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,120
Cha Soo Yeong, give me the knife.

467
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,680
- Who sent it? 
 - It doesn't say.

468
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,190
Ah, it seems like Professor Na Joon Seok sent this.

469
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,780
Gosh, he's sure working hard to promote this.

470
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,660
What's this? He wrote tomorrow's date on this, Hyung-nim.

471
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,130
Gosh.  That man, he is so out of it.

472
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,880
He's always acting like he's the smartest, but...

473
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,640
 Come to the hideout.

474
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,210
To see what we missed...

475
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,690
Whether we made an error during the verification process... I went over it again.

476
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:58,120
The conclusion is that it's certain Jeong Chan Goo was killed by that bastard.

477
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,590
In the autopsy results, there was no sign of murder.

478
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:05,110
The ice-making machine running was not part of his plan.

479
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,970
If he had been found intact,

480
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,870
signs of murder would have been found.

481
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,720
But there wasn't a mint on Jeong Chan Goo's body.

482
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,030
It took a long time because of that variable.

483
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,300
Variable?

484
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,870
The mint.

485
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:22,340
Kang Seung Hwan and Jeong Chan Goo were killed by the same person.

486
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,380
So we should've found a mint on Jeong Chan Goo's body.

487
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,230
Someone definitely took it.

488
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,610
What do you mean?

489
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,500
Chief Choi.

490
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,600
How do you know that?

491
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,750
On the day of the incident, Chief Choi went into the autopsy room.

492
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,860
He could've gone there as the person in charge of the investigation.

493
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,590
There's no direct evidence that he took it.

494
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:45,250
If a mint had been found, Chief Choi would be the one with the biggest headache.

495
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,860
That is sufficient as a motive.

496
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:52,900
Then, why did that bastard kill those two?

497
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,030
He wants to express himself through murder.

498
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,280
Express himself how?

499
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,420
Sense of superiority.

500
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,680
By murdering Kang Seung Hwan and Jeong Chan Goo,

501
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,750
he wanted to show that he is superior.

502
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,270
If that bastard really is the culprit,

503
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,970
whom is he trying to show off to?

504
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,440
It's a message for me.

505
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,380
He wants me to know that he's still alive and well.

506
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,290
Of course, my deduction could be wrong.

507
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,390
But what's certain is that more murders will happen,

508
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,130
and they'll happen faster and faster.

509
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:45,170
You see, that bastard has been starving.

510
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,600
Then, who is the next target?

511
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,930
The next target is Na Joon Seok.

512
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,050
Kang Seung Hwan imitated that bastard's signature

513
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,690
and even tried to take his achievements.

514
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:00,560
 I'm the mint serial killer.

515
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,910
Accomplice Jeong Chan Goo probably saw that bastard's face.

516
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,120
 Are you the crazy bastard who texted me?

517
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,440
So as for Na Joon Seok, it goes without saying.

518
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,910
He has been publicly blabbering about how that bastard is dead.

519
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,180
 It makes no sense at all.

520
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:20,000
 The real culprit died in an explosion incident five years ago.

521
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,320
And somehow I think that bastard

522
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,480
might have accepted how Professor Na continuously belittled you, Detective Oh,

523
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,200
as an insult to himself.

524
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,380
That's a good hypothesis.

525
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,210
You have a point.

526
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,930
The important thing now is how he will murder

527
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,630
and when he will murder.

528
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:45,750
 What's this? He wrote tomorrow's date on this, Hyung-nim.

529
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,250

530
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,230
Yesterday, someone sent over Professor Na's book to the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

531
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:57,580
The strange thing is that the autograph and the written date were in different handwriting.

532
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,030
The written date is today.

533
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:02,330
Then, is he giving us a warning of his murder?

534
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,880
What's certain is that this time,

535
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,010
it'll be a very public murder in front of many people

536
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,460
so that everyone can see his resurrection.

537
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,040
Professor Na has a live broadcast at 8 PM today.

538
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,190
- How much time do we have? 
 - Thirty minutes.

539
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,540
At the last broadcast,

540
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:22,090
someone with the ID Peppermint Candy asked this question:

541
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,620
If that bastard is alive...

542
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,380
 What would I do?

543
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,510
 Well, could that happen?

544
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,090
 I'd even bet my life that he's not alive.

545
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,100
Detective Lee, look into the person with the ID Peppermint Candy

546
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,460
and track the location of his phone.

547
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,460
Okay.

548
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,510
Yes, I understand.

549
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,940
What is it?

550
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,350
She said to come to the broadcast station right away because Professor Na Joon Seok is in danger.

551
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,850
- What? Professor Na Joon Seok? 
 - Yes.

552
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,040
What?

553
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,730
She said to come to the broadcast station because Professor Na Joon Seok is in danger.

554
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,120
What kind of danger is he in?

555
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,360
I don't really know the details.

556
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,180
Gosh...

557
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,450
I'll follow you right away.

558
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,040

559
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,110
You're not going to answer?

560
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:35,350
It's nothing important. How annoying.

561
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,320

562
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,470

563
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,030
 This call cannot be connected so you'll be forwarded to voice mail.

564
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,010
He won't answer.

565
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,690
The broadcast will start in 10 minutes.

566
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,720
What should we do?

567
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,150

568
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,080
Team Leader, I tracked the Peppermint Candy ID but it's not a registered phone.

569
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,190
The registered owner is dead.

570
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,330
And the location of the phone is at the broadcasting station.

571
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,270
I'm heading out now.

572
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,360

573
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,270
Now, five minutes to standby.

574
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:36,180
 PD, we received a call from the police

575
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,740
telling us that Professor Na Joon Seok is in danger

576
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,410
and to stop the live broadcast.

577
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:40,880
Are they crazy?

578
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,260
Is a live broadcast a joke to them?

579
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,350
Say we'll take care of it and hang up.

580
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,380
Are they serious? It's a live broadcast.

581
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,910
- Get ready. 
 - Okay.

582
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,450
Please focus until the end of the live broadcast.

583
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,330
Please give loud responses, okay?

584
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,350
Yes.

585
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:08,350
Standby. Three, two, one.

586
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,130
Clap!

587
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,900
 Hello viewers.

588
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,620
 Covering the truth of cases that you didn't know,

589
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,990
we'll now start the live profiling.

590
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,430
Hello, Professor Na Joon Seok.

591
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,920
Hello, nice to meet you.

592
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,150
I'm Profiler Na Joon Seok.

593
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,460
Your book became the number one best seller.  Congratulations.

594
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,790
It's an honor. Thank you. It's all thanks to you.

595
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,080
Horrific crimes are always happening.

596
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,630
They have in the past and still do now.

597
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:55,040
But with accurate analyses, we can minimize crimes in the future.

598
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,490
I hope all the criminals will get caught soon with your profiling, Professor.

599
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:01,630
I also look forward to it.

600
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,470
Team Leader.

601
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,610
Team Leader, what do you mean that bastard is here?

602
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,830
There is a high possibility that that bastard is here.

603
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:10,030
What exactly are you...

604
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,730
Are you sure the tip isn't a prank?

605
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,220
I'll go to the control room. You guys look inside.

606
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,070
Okay, got it.

607
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,010
 The culprit is in his mid-thirties.

608
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,060
His height is average and his frame is probably not that big.

609
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,340
 His outfit will be achromatic so that he doesn't stand out.

610
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,430
 He's probably buttoned up to his neck.

611
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:32,640
He has a tendency to be elaborate and meticulous.

612
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,940
He probably calculated and planned his run-away route perfectly already.

613
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,420
Participating texts in real time keep coming.

614
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,860
Professor Na, you have many fans.

615
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,460
Thank you.

616
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,450
 A middle-aged idol, handsome profiler.

617
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,430
I'm embarrassed.

618
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,580
 I'm hearing titles nowadays that I didn't hear even when I was younger.

619
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,000
 I'm embarrassed.

620
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:02,110

621
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,840
Cut. Who are you?

622
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,380
Stop the broadcast immediately.

623
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,550
Are you crazy? Can't you see that we're in the middle of a live broadcast?

624
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,390
Professor Na Joon Seok might be in danger.

625
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,850
Might be in danger?

626
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,250
Does it make any sense to stop a live broadcast now?

627
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:25,100
Then if something happens, will you take responsibility?

628
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,050
Then if nothing happens, will you take responsibility?

629
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,810
Now that I see you in person, you're really handsome.

630
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:35,050
It was true that you're better looking in person.

631
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,160
- Block that side first.
 - Yes.

632
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,940
There's no doubt that you have a fan club.

633
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,910
I'm going to join Profiler Na Joon Seok's fan club from today onward.

634
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,060
I'm honored.

635
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,130
I've been such a...

636
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:46,960
 What could it be?

637
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,340
 Without showing up himself,

638
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,960
 a method to kill in front of people...

639
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,280
 Radio wave noise...

640
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,570
 People _ _ _ themselves _ _ _

641
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,570
 Someone is cutting off the radio signals.

642
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,730
They call themselves in-room profilers.

643
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:07,360
There have been a growing number of people who search articles and books, too.

644
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,290
That's right.

645
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,880
This means a lot more people are interested in crimes.

646
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,030
It's true that serious cases like serial murders...

647
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:14,810
What are you doing?

648
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,340
are now talked about very easily.

649
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:23,900
- I think it's due to the fact that people hope for them to be resolved quickly. 
 - That's right.

650
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,380
Ah really.

651
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,700
Aren't we poking around too much when we're not even sure?

652
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,830
Check together. Start from there again.

653
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,700
Okay.

654
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:42,180
Please give me a close up of the person who is texting in the passageway.

655
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,900
Jimmy jib, please get a close up of the phone at the passageway.

656
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:55,710
Detective Cha, check the guy on the left with the hat and black jacket.

657
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,190
What the? Give it back.

658
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,770
Sorry.

659
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,670
It's not him.

660
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,230
They don't have set timing.

661
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,640
I hope everyone takes note.

662
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:15,840
Cha Soo Yeong, there is interruption from external frequencies over there.

663
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,850
My radio will be cut off soon.

664
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:22,150
As per that bastard's pattern, he'll kill Na Joon Seok soon.  There is not much time left.

665
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,630
Listen carefully.

666
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:27,820
From an isolated area of the studio away from people,

667
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,560
 that bastard will use something.

668
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:38,690
What is it?

669
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,570
Sorry.

670
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:51,450
Now... you have to take care of it.

671
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,220
It doesn't matter to me if the question is a difficult one.

672
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,740
The more difficult the question is, the more I enjoy it.

673
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,720
I see.

674
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:06,650

675
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:16,200

676
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,490
Shall we look at the next text?

677
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:22,160
"Who is the next victim of that bastard?"

678
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,360
That's the question we received.

679
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,470
I'm not sure.

680
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:28,960
Since he died, there will be no next victim.  Right?

681
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,690
Yes.

682
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,480
As expected, it was a clear and cool answer.

683
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,900
We'll look at the next text.

684
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,930

685
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:44,580
What? What's going on?

686
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:47,060
What is that?

687
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:54,560
A mischievous viewer said the next victim would be Professor Na Joon Seok.

688
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,590
What do you think, Professor?

689
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,260
I'm not sure.  I'm a little flustered.

690
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:03,640
- But there are many cameras and audience members in front of me. 
 - What?

691
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,420
- I'm sorry. 
 - So would that be possible?

692
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:09,340
If he is confident, I would like to say, "Try me."

693
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,580
 As expected, Professor Na Joon Seok.

694
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,100
 I think that even the culprit will be shaking with fear in front of you, Professor.

695
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,130
We'll be back after the commercial break.

696
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,120
Aren't you scared when you receive these kinds of texts, Professor?

697
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,670
It's the fate of a profiler.

698
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,800
The more accurate the analysis, the more it stimulates a culprit's psychology.

699
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,480
His weaknesses are revealed, so he becomes more aggressive.

700
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,610
 That bastard wants to kill Na Joon Seok and

701
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:41,620
 show off that he controls this case.

702
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,780
 He will use something.

703
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:49,240
 Like people or tools.

704
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,420
We'll be back on again.  Everybody, stand by while clapping.

705
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:34,440
Stand by! Three, two, one.

706
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,190
 On now!

707
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,590
 Professor, is a psychopath born that way or does he become that way?

708
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:42,050
Well, a psychopath—

709
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:00,680
What's this?  What's wrong with him?

710
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,740
Cut.  Cut!

711
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,200
Start a commercial.  Start a commercial.  Start a commercial!

712
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,300
Block the entrance!

713
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,670
Don't move!  Stay put!

714
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,890
Please stay still!

715
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,260
Don't let even one person get out!

716
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,920
Don't move!  Stay put!

717
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Stay put!

718
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,760
- This is the police! 
- You can't. Please, you can't get leave!

719
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,870
Please sit still!

720
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,980
Please, stop!

721
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,130
No, no.  Please calm down!

722
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,020
 Over this way! This way!

723
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,070
You can't leave.

724
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:10,500
No, no!

725
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,200
Someone was watching us.

726
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,350
Stop over there!

727
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,850
 What's going on!

728
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,230
I lost him.

729
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,180
It's that bastard.

730
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:01,280
That bastard finally showed up.

731
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:36,650

732
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:43,230
♫  Left alone in the rough wind  ♫

733
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,960

734
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,960
 How did Team Leader know that Professor Na would die?

735
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,250
 Look into Team Leader Hwang.

736
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,620
 It’s too strange for it to be a coincidence.

737
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,080
 You were with that bastard in the same space,

738
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,050
 but you didn't see anything.

739
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,350
 Where do you think that bastard is right now?

740
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:01,030
 He could be watching us from someplace else.

741
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,830
 I think the detective who was transferred to the Metropolitan Investigation Unit has something going on.

742
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,500
 I think someone came into my room.

743
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,680
 If he didn't take anything, then he must've gotten some information.

744
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,150
 Be careful. You could be his next target.

745
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,990
♫  In the withered petals  ♫
