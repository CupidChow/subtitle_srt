1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,480

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,640

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,350

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,990

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,490

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,410

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,990

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:36,710

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,000

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,770

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,910
 Tell me one person whom you want to kill.

12
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,750
  - Hey, Dong Sik!
- Yes?

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,440
 Cha Soo Yeong is staying in the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,790
 Are you serious?

15
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,950
 Hey, what are you doing here?

16
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,570
 Wow, anyway, this is on another level.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,150
 By the way, where is Metropolitan Investigation Unit Team 1's office?

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,570
 - No, we can't. 
 - Why not?

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,240
 What about you? Do you have a dream that you wish to achieve?

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,010
 I think I have the same dream as the one I had in my young age.  Living an ordinary life.

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,640
 What kind of a child was Yo Han?

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,430
 There was no one odd like him.

23
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,110
 - He had a knack for drawing people to him. 
 - Yo Han! Yo Han!

24
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,980
 The three of them always went around together.

25
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,980
 Father, stop bothering Gyeong Soo and Yo Han.

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,240
 - What? 
 - It's all my doing.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,660
 Yo Han was Luciel, Gyeong Soo was Gabriel,

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,400
 and Jeong Hwan was Michael.

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
 The three of us are of one body.

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,810
 It's really strange, Section Chief.

31
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,510
 I feel like it's not a suicide.

32
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,500
 You know that Section Chief Bang died, right?

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,440
 Of course, I do. I saw him in person.

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,900
 In order to hold a corroborative investigation,

35
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,500
 we've requested for him to be dispatched here.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,040
 Sunbae.

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,440
  Soo Yeong.

38
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,280
 I'll take you to where you can meet the bastard.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,540
 At the critical moment when you have to tell someone about me,

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,390
 At the critical moment when you have to tell someone about me,

41
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,710
 you'll protect me, right?

42
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,960
 Even if it means putting your lives on the line!

43
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,630
 Oh Hyeon Jae.

44
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,500
 It's my turn next.

45
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,880
 - It seems like you're going somewhere to meet someone. 
 - Pardon?

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,250
 Your boyfriend?

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,040
 We've pinpointed the location of Isu's phone.

48
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,280
 It's heading toward Joonggeon three-way intersection.

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,530
 Oh Hyeon Jae, stay cool.  She'll be alright.

50
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,500
 Five years ago, at Joonggeon three-way intersection,

51
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,580
 there is a hidden secret.

52
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,240
 They're the handcuffs that Oh Hyeon Jae put on that bastard five years ago.

53
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,150
 But that bastard took off the handcuffs that Oh Hyeon Jae put on him.

54
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,280
 It means he had the key for the cuffs that were distributed that year.

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,970
 That bastard... is a policeman.

56
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,840
 You find me.

57
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:13,790
 I'll tell you who told me to kill Isu.

58
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,660

59
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,580
Team Leader Hwang, you can't die yet.

60
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,970
Because you're a card that will torment Oh Hyeon Jae until the very end.

61
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,170
Good work.

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,600
Team Leader, are you okay?

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,100
- Detective Jang and Lee, take care of the scene. 
 - Okay.

64
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,940
Are you okay?

65
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,730
What's going on?

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,850
What happened?

67
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,760
I caught Shin Gyeong Soo when he was running away,

68
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,590
and we got into an accident while I was taking him with me.

69
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,470
Hwang Ha Yeong.

70
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,470
Fine.

71
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:46,370

72
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,700
I know you came up with this game plan.

73
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,250
I could have caught him,

74
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,250
but I lost him.

75
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,940
No. You weren't going to be able to catch him from the first place.

76
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,520
That bastard just cut off his tail, that's all.

77
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,000
 That's the wrong question, Detective Oh Hyeon Jae.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,940
 The three of us are of one body.

79
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,630
 Tell me one person whom you want to kill.

80
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,950
 Tell me one person whom you want to kill.

81
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,090
The memory of his first murder...

82
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,450
This is a memento of that day's memory.

83
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,950
Oh Hyeon Jae, you think you know me?

84
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,740
You must've taught Shin Gyeong Soo

85
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,950
how to kill Lee Bo Gwang and to disguise himself as him.

86
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,220
You probably found out everything about Shin Gyeong Soo.

87
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,930
 So this is how it feels to be strangled.

88
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,550
Communicated insanity.

89
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,180
You probably found out everything about the three of us, right?

90
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,930
The three children who witnessed the incident at the orphanage...

91
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,130
 Who pushed him? Who pushed Daniel?

92
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,190
 I did it.

93
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,060
 Yo Han, you tell me.

94
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,210
 Father, stop bothering Gyeong Soo and Yo Han.

95
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
That's bullshit.

96
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,330
The three of them inflicted it.

97
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,790

Next.

98
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,820
 Next.

99
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,960
 Next!

100
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,050
 Next.

101
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,370
 Oh yeah?

102
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,040
 Pick it up.

103
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,010
 Aren't you going to pick it up?

104
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,720
 This brat! Aren't you going to pick it up?

105
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,050
 Aren't you going to pick it up?

106
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,840
 Hey!

107
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,420
 What's this?

108
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,510
 What are you looking at?

109
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,500
 And what are you looking at?

110
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,000
 Hey, move.

111
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,350
 These bastards.

112
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,940
 What?

113
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,950
 These poor little things.

114
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,350
 What the?

115
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,960
 The euphoria of murder that the three of you committed together.

116
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,740
 You probably delivered

117
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,730
 the feelings of thrill and excitement to those idiots.

118
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,420
The thrill and excitement probably gradually tied the three of you into one.

119
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,310
 What are you doing?

120
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,400
Those idiots believed it to be true even when they were dying

121
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,920
without knowing that it was just a delusion.

122
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,910
Even though we're cut apart, we're still one soul.

123
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,710
You just cut off the tail, that's all.

124
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,970
With indifference since you don't have empathy.

125
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,810
Just like how I am right now.

126
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,750
I can see an outline of you.

127
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,260
But will you be able to figure me out?

128
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,190
Just wait.

129
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,510
We'll meet soon.

130
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:57,410
Oh Hyeon Jae, you'll never be able to figure me out.

131
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,870

132
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,910

133
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,680

134
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,950
 He said he would spare me. I'm sorry.

135
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,800
 What?

136
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,260
 Save me...

137
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,290
 No!

138
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,230
 The corpse of the 10th victim of the mint serial killer, that bastard, was found.

139
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,790
 It's assumed that Ms. Lee was killed around December 1.

140
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,390
 She was found seven days after having gone missing on November 24.

141
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:05,130
 The cause of her death was strangulation according to the result of her autopsy.

142
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,390
 Since her body was in a state of decay,

143
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,920
 figuring out the exact time of death is said to be difficult.

144
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,260
 Your real memorial day is November 29.

145
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,910
 I will definitely catch that bastard.

146
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,090
 I will kill that bastard.

147
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,200
Here's the data you asked for.

148
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,170
Thank you.

149
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:59,200
This reminds me of the saying "keep your friends close and your enemies closer."

150
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,750
Catch that bastard.

151
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,550

152
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:25,680
This fellow, Kim Jeong Hwan, was scraped by something under the right knee.

153
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,990
Shin Gyeong Soo...

154
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,500
You're here.

155
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,960
The cause of death for both of them is the same.

156
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,070
They were both poisoned with potassium cyanide.

157
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,890
They both committed suicide.

158
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,640
It'll take a few days for additional details.

159
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,280
These two died around same time.

160
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,780
The appearance of their conditions is the same when looking at how long their blood was exposed in the air.

161
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,670
One of them was at Joonggeon three-way intersection.

162
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,980
 I'm letting you live since you got the answer right.

163
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,930
 You did well. Good job.

164
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,930
 I'm sure that one of you must've been with that bastard.

165
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,560
Team Leader?

166
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,120
Yes?

167
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,030
Detective Lee, do you remember what I said?

168
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,150
 Take the path you want.

169
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,890
 From now on, as a detective,

170
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,570
 carry out the investigation in the way you believe is right.

171
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,670
Yes.

172
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,800
I will be sure to catch that bastard.

173
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,600
- To do that, I need you. 
 - What do I need to do first?

174
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,070
Please investigate Priest Kim Jeong Hwan.

175
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,610
Check where he went in reverse chronological order from the day he died.

176
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,370
Okay.

177
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,950
Oh Hyeon Jae! How long has it been?

178
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,560
These two bodies are the hands and feet of that bastard from five years ago.

179
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,190
What?

180
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,100
How many more bodies will come into the National Forensic Service?

181
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,510
It'll be the same as five years ago.

182
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,720
Look here, Doctor Han.

183
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,240
Shall I tell you something interesting?

184
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,250
How is the bastard who died five years ago still walking around right now?

185
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,890
That might be possible if someone in the National Forensic Service

186
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,210
used someone else's body

187
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,870
under the condition to keep it a secret.

188
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,190
What is it that you want to say?

189
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,340
This contains the list of policemen

190
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,690
who received the handcuffs made five years ago.

191
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,970
I'm one of them as well.

192
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:23,260
I think the person who unlocked my handcuffs and ran away is one of them too.

193
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,140
That bastard must've had a handcuffs key from the beginning.

194
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,080
Then there are two possibilities.

195
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,870
That bastard must either be a policeman who had a handcuffs key

196
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,900
or have killed a policeman and disguised himself as one.

197
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,150
It's interesting, isn't it?

198
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,630
Tell me what happens next in the story.

199
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,480
What I want to hear.

200
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,940

No matter how many times I run the test, nothing is there.

201
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,150
 I only found Detective Oh Hyeon Jae's fingerprints.

202
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,340
 Are they Detective Oh Hyeon Jae's handcuffs?

203
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,310
 Close your mouth and your ears.

204
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,000
 You don't know anything.

205
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,500
Back then, nothing else was there besides your fingerprints.

206
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,190
Director Choi removed it from the evidence list.

207
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:30,940

208
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,370

209
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,080

210
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,660

211
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,270

212
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,520
Now...

213
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,210

214
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,410
Okay.

215
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,950
Now...

216
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,630

217
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,200
- Good morning. 
 - You're here early.

218
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,000
Yes.

219
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,730
- Oh! 
 - Hey!

220
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,510
- What's this? 
 - Just a little something I prepared.

221
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,470
This rascal.

222
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,960
By the way, I heard that something big happened yesterday.

223
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,640
Don't bring it up. Shin Gyeong Soo committed suicide,

224
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,580
and a strange priest also committed suicide in the area.

225
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,360
What kind of priest commits suicide?

226
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,000
- Right. 
 - Good morning.

227
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,730
 - What is this? 
 - Drink it.

228
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,510
Good morning.

229
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,020
Who is it?

230
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,270
What is it?

231
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,810
It's an appreciation plaque sent by the International Youth Investigation Organization.

232
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,990
Just put it up there.

233
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,640

234
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,190

235
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,760
Priest Kim Jeong Hwan's baptismal name is Dominique.

236
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,510
It's confirmed that he grew up in the same orphanage as Shin Gyeong Soo.

237
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,620
We're currently tracking down his vital reaction.

238
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,990
Shin Gyeong Soo and that bastard were in communication with one another.

239
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,210
What about that priest?

240
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,210
We need to look more into the relationship among the three of them.

241
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,700
Organize the estimated dates of that bastard's murders from five years ago and give it to me.

242
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,880
If the victim's body had been found later,

243
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,020
the actual time of death might be different from the time of death estimated by a medical examiner.

244
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,700
Mark the additional two to three days prior to and after the estimated dates.

245
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,080
Give me the presumed place of murder, the victim's last whereabouts, everything.

246
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,040
Yes.

247
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,620

248
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,230

249
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,460
 Come to the hideout. There's work to do.

250
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,890
Detective Yang, may I go out for a bit?

251
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,100
Sure.

252
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,260
But, Cha Soo Yeong, where are you—

253
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,260
She already left.

254
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,310
Gosh, seriously.

255
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,620
We have to finish up Chim Sa Bong's case

256
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,150
and Shin Gyeong Soo's case as well.

257
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,340
Let's finish up Chim Sa Bong's case first.

258
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,200
- Something is weird... something. 
 - What?

259
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,130
After Chim Sa Bong got here, a lot of incidents keep happening.

260
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,550
I don't think she's an ordinary woman.

261
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:59,320
Cha Soo Yeong, there's something you must do.

262
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,790
What is it?

263
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,010
Chim Sa Bong.

264
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,330
I didn't know you were interested in Section Chief Bang's case.

265
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,050
In the Chim Sa Bong's ledger, there were Section Chief Bang's name and Kim Sang Gil's name.

266
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,520
That means those two are definitely connected.

267
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,490
Section Chief Bang was killed after he found out about Kim Sang Gil.

268
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,340
How do you know?

269
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,990
It's still just a speculation.

270
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,850
Then what do I need to do?

271
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,860
Get a confession.

272
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,460
Go interrogate Chim Sa Bong.

273
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,240
Okay, I understand.

274
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,620
I'll have the receiver on.

275
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,900
Hey, eat some jjamppong  (spicy seafood noodle soup) .

276
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,760

277
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,560
Detective Lee, eat some jjamppong first.

278
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,790
Hey, your jjamppong is getting soggy!

279
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,140
What are you working so hard on, you punk?

280
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,260
I told you earlier that I wasn't going to eat.

281
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,590
Hyung-nim, I told you!

282
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,970
Jjajangmyeon  (black bean noodles)  for Detective Lee! He only eats jjajangmyeon.

283
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,550
Why did you order jjamppong for Detective Lee? Now he won't eat!

284
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,470
- Then you should've from the beginning— 
 - Detective Yang.

285
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,030
Good timing. Detective Cha, eat some jjamppong.

286
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,330
No thank you, I'm not hungry.

287
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,820
Couldn't you just say you would consider it even if it were lip service?

288
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,550
You're not considerate at all.

289
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:37,710
Detective Yang, I think I need to interrogate Chim Sa Bong.

290
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,880
 Section Chief Bang was killed after he found out about Kim Sang Gil.

291
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,300
When was the day that Section Chief Bang asked about Kim Sang Gil?

292
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,130
Was it the day that Section Chief died

293
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,930
or was it the day before?

294
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,260
Show her the crime scene pictures of the suicide case.

295
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,500
I really didn't kill Section Chief Bang.

296
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,250
Same goes for the other people.

297
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,480
The fact that Chim Sa Bong is denying the murder by using Section Chief Bang as a shield means that

298
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,190
 she knows someone else murdered him.

299
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,620
You must make her confess.

300
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,230
Cha Soo Yeong, try saying this.

301
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,470
Bong Yeon Ja, you're taking a high risk gamble right now.

302
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,450
Using the card of, "I didn't kill Section Chief Bang,"

303
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,940
"so I'll use him as a shield"

304
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,830
"in order to deny the crime of having murdered others."

305
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,220
 But think about it carefully.

306
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,640
If this card were turned over,

307
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,280
you would get blamed for all the crimes, including the murder of Section Chief Bang.

308
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,920
All circumstances and evidence point only to you.

309
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:49,470
And that bastard will get rid of you, the most conclusive evidence,

310
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,660
whether you're in jail or someplace else.

311
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,550
You know the truth, don't you?

312
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,870
If you don't want to take the fall for everything, tell me what you know.

313
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:22,320
Jong Soo said he heard a strange sound.

314
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,300
Summon Kim Jong Soo.  Now I can get his statement.

315
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,750
A person around Section Chief Bang.

316
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:38,520
A policeman or someone associated with the police...

317
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,880
What are you doing?  Bong Yeon Ja confessed everything.

318
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,350
Tell us about the strange sound.

319
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,710
When I killed Park Choon Gil,

320
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,750
I left behind the money for cigarettes.

321
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,110
 I didn't want to get caught, so I went back to get it, but...

322
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,760
I have a briefing to do on Bang Sang Sik's case.

323
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,540
We haven't found the culprit of that case yet.

324
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,400
I know.

325
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,950
If you know, then are you saying you found the culprit?

326
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,970
Maybe.

327
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,770
Okay, brief.

328
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,030
The person who killed Section Chief Bang is

329
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,930
that bastard.

330
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,260
In Chim Sa Bong's ledger, two key figures for this case turned up:

331
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:04,520
Section Chief Bang Sang Sik and Kim Sang Gil.

332
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:11,780
It was revealed through a secret investigation that Kim Sang Gil is that bastard's father.

333
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,200
Section Chief Bang was killed while he was looking into Kim Sang Gil,

334
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,660
because he stepped on that bastard's tail.

335
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,880
The witness is Kim Jong Soo, who is a culprit of another murder case.

336
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,840
On his way back to getting rid of his own trace, he saw two people.

337
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,220
The culprit.

338
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,320
 This bastard...

339
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,690
 You bastard.

340
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,860
 What is this? Gosh...

341
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,850
 Hey! What kind of bastard are you?

342
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,720
 What kind of bastard—

343
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,210
 This bastard!

344
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,460
 What kind of bastard makes threats over taking out small private loans?

345
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,080
 Hey! I'm a police officer, you bastard.

346
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,260
 You want me to embarrass you and then throw you in jail?

347
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,230
 Who are you? Who are you, you bastard?

348
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,060
 Look at this bastard. You bastard!

349
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,490
 Hey, you bastard! What are you—

350
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,250

351
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,030
Father Dominique

352
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,340
and the other one, Kim Yo Han.

353
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,320
That's that bastard's name.

354
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,800
But what's interesting is...

355
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,310
that bastard is a police officer.

356
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,830
Section Chief Bang's investigation was a secret investigation.

357
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,150
Who could have predicted it?

358
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,070
Probably someone who was acquainted with him

359
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,410
or someone who was working with him in close proximity.

360
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,600
That bastard is one of us.

361
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,480
He is hiding in this police organization

362
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,350
while squeaking like a rat.

363
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,650
I'm Inspector Seo Gi Seok from the Office of the Inspector General.

364
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,400
I'm Inspector Kim Joong In.

365
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,370
Concerning an absurd rumor that the bastard is alive,

366
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,440
you came all the way out here.

367
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,900
How long have you both held your positions?

368
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,920
It's been seven years.

369
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,860
Seven years?  How dare people who have only worked for seven years

370
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,320
show their faces at the director's room without any fear?

371
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,480
Please refrain yourself from making unnecessary comments.

372
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,750
There was an inside report that

373
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,610
the investigation of the mint serial killer's case had been manipulated.

374
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,960
Shin Gyeong Soo who died not too long ago wasn't the culprit either—

375
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,740
I told you that is a false rumor!

376
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,250
I confirmed myself that bastard's body five years ago.

377
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,020
I finished up the case myself.

378
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,810
Next time, you will need to submit the investigation reports

379
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,510
of the mint serial killer's case that you yourself drew up.

380
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,510
What?

381
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,430
We'll contact you again.

382
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,290
The inspection team was here.

383
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,510
Fabrication of the mint serial killer's case.

384
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,530
I guess they were already notified.

385
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,100
How could you do that to a person

386
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,710
who was doing his best to resolve the crisis situation?

387
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,470
If you were trying to resolve the situation,

388
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,880
why would you go poking around the case?

389
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,630
You who were poking around should take the responsibility!

390
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,140
- I'm standing on the edge of a precipice right now. 
 - Deputy Commissioner Park!

391
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,920
If you're trying to bring me down too,

392
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,690
you should just take all the blame!

393
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,870
Say that you alone fabricated the investigation of that bastard's case.

394
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,300
Are you telling me you're going to cut the tail off?

395
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,960
In order to survive alone?

396
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,040
Admitting to your past wrongdoing

397
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,930
and neatly resigning

398
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,170
is an ending that befits you.

399
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,920
Do you think the organization that you strived so hard to protect

400
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,160
will protect you?

401
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,330
I told you that I would throw you away.

402
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,950
I'll give you one last chance.

403
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,410
Like five years ago, either cover up that bastard,

404
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:20,580
or resign yourself from the organization taking all the blame for that bastard's case.

405
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:25,960
If I catch and kill him without anyone knowing,

406
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,770
it seems that the problem will be solved.

407
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,790
Ah, lunatic bastard.

408
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,410
By when do you think you can catch that bastard?

409
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,710
I think it may take time to catch him.

410
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,580
If I gave you the information, you should've already found him!

411
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,600
How did you work—

412
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,370
Oh Hyeon Jae found out that the bastard is a police officer.

413
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:02,510
- What? 
 - The range was narrowed down more so it'll be confirmed soon.

414
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,140
And to catch that bastard, I need Detective Lee.

415
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,440
I'll keep him for now.

416
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,020
Whether you keep him or throw him away after using him, do whatever you want to do.

417
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,010
If we don't find him this time, it'll be really all over.

418
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,750

419
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,470
What is it?

420
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,600
 The handcuffs that had Oh Hyeon Jae's fingerprints back then.

421
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,110
You failed to extract DNA anyway!  Stop talking about it.

422
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,130
Well it's that... I think it's possible to extract DNA.

423
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,500
The world really changes rapidly.

424
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,540
- Do you think you can find who it is? 
 -  Yeah.

425
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,750
Make it top secret.

426
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,910
 I got it.  Just bring the handcuffs.

427
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,440

428
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,370
If killing him with my own hands is a way for me to survive,

429
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,340
I must kill him.

430
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,600
- Hey, Cha Soo Yeong. 
 - Yeah?

431
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,320
This place is unsettling.

432
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,820
Why is everything so complicated here?

433
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,490
Have you been digging into this case the whole time?

434
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,720
That's why you've been busy?

435
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,790
Yeah.

436
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,500
Don't be so vague. Tell me about it in detail.

437
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,510
I really can't figure out what is going on at all.

438
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,660
What is the case related to Kim Sang Gil?

439
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,130
Kim Sang Gil was the driver who hit my mom and ran.

440
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,550
No way.  How did you find out about Kim Sang Gil?

441
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:22,130
How I found out about Kim Sang Gil is what you're curious about?

442
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,930
Well, it's not that...

443
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,590
Ah really. I'm really disappointed.

444
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,950
You found the driver who hit your mom and ran, but why didn't you tell me about it?

445
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,270
I know better than the Metropolitan Investigation Unit

446
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,690
that you wanted to find the driver who hit your mom and ran.

447
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,580
How could you not share it with me?

448
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,100
I couldn't say anything.

449
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,460
Why?

450
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,960
Whenever I tried to talk about it, my tears would well up.

451
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,930
I just held my dad and bawled.

452
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,910
Not being able to do anything when I missed her so much drove me completely crazy.

453
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,880
What is that?

454
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,030
I missed my mom very much but I couldn't do anything.

455
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:05,310
I can't bring her back to life...

456
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:12,910
Sunbae, you really don't know what it's like to miss someone, huh?

457
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:16,090
Countryside Detective Kang Dong Sik.

458
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,920
Hey, it turned out well anyway.

459
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,090
How long will it take?

460
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,930
It won't be done in the blink of an eye.

461
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,430
It'll probably take one and a half days?

462
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,410
Finish within one day.

463
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,520
I'll try my best.

464
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:48,270
Including Hwayeong Police Station where Section Chief Bang worked, Ganggae Police Station,

465
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,340
Parkdong Police Station,  Parkdong Patrol Station, Yeowool Patrol Station...

466
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,950
We need to check attendance records from 5 years ago

467
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,320
of the policemen and detectives who worked there.

468
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,720
There are about 60 people.

469
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,340
If we check about 60 people's daily work records and investigate them,

470
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,600
I think it'll take about three days.

471
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,960
Finish it faster.

472
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,540
Considering those we have checked so far...

473
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,310
On top of that, the retiree's daily work records were discarded, so I can't find any information on them.

474
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,050
I think it'll take some time.

475
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,450
Team Leader, how about making it an open investigation?

476
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,500
Not yet.

477
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,300
We can't trust anyone for now.

478
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,320
 Your real memorial day is November 29.

479
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,900
Try to find out by focusing on the policemen who took time off on November 29.

480
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,470
 November 29?

481
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,140
Okay.

482
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,160

483
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,570
It's me.

484
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,920

485
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,080
 I think I can get the result within 24 hours.

486
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,710
 I don't have much time, so do it as fast as possible.

487
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,880
Team Leader Hwang, come to my office.

488
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,590
Come in.

489
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:31,160
We've narrowed it down to about 60 people after looking into and cross analyzing data.

490
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,030
I got it.  I'll check the rest.

491
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,310
What is the reason you're proceeding hastily all of a sudden?

492
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:46,620
At this point, I'm sick and tired of anything related to that bastard.

493
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,310
Team Leader Hwang.

494
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,260
Yes?

495
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,660
If we catch that bastard...

496
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,180
 Under the guise of emergency,

497
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,600
 I'll use my discretion.

498
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,330
That's all you want?

499
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:08,020
Yes. You can take the credit for the rest.

500
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:12,260
Okay, I understand.

501
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,080
Keep it confidential.

502
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,140
You can start from Hwayeong Police Station where Section Chief Bang worked.

503
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,710
Let's talk about the rest when we meet.

504
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,840
We need to check the DNA of the policemen on the list.

505
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,820
Collecting their hair strands should do it.

506
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:46,970
Move quietly.

507
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,410
Yes, I understand.

508
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,950
I think Director Choi is doing something.

509
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,440
Find out what he is up to.

510
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,140
Okay.

511
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:26,030
 Try to find out by focusing on the policemen who took time off on November 29.

512
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,800
Team Leader Hwang is trying to find policemen

513
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,420
who took time off on the day she was kidnapped.

514
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,570
 I think I can get the result within 24 hours.

515
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,000
 I don't have much time, so do it as fast as possible.

516
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,740
But what is Director Choi up to?

517
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,400
Within 24 hours...

518
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,030
What has to be done?

519
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,740

520
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,070
Hello.  I'm from the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

521
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:10,420
May I see Sergeant Yoo Dae Jin?

522
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,820
Team Leader, what are you going to use the hair strands for?

523
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,740
You don't need to know.  We have a lot of places to stop by, so get in quickly.

524
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,890
Goodbye.

525
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,580
Goodbye.

526
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,970
Yes.

527
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,010
Work hard.

528
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,900
Hey, Dong Sik.

529
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,160
Yes, Chief.

530
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,120
 Since I'm working at the Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency's Investigation Unit these days,

531
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,610
I haven't been able to visit you.

532
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,290
Everything is okay, right?

533
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,800
 Yeah, of course.

534
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,050
But why did Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency take my hair strand?

535
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,840
 You know the reason, right?

536
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,620
Hair strand?

537
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,980
It must be because of the unsolved case.

538
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,260
I don't know.  I need to go out now, so let's hang up.

539
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,490
Do a good job there so you don't receive criticism!

540
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,740
Okay, I understand.

541
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:32,430
Director Choi must have found my DNA or something.

542
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,530
Oh Hyeon Jae will have to do some self-reflecting.

543
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,350
It looks like Team Leader Hwang and Director Choi will find me first.

544
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,540
Things are going interestingly.

545
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:49,630
Team Leader, Inspector Do is collecting hair strands of the 60 officers who are on the list.

546
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,710
Hair strands?

547
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:54,120
Yes. I think he's trying to get their DNA sample.

548
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,400
But there's no control group. How is he going to specify it?

549
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,920

550
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:05,500
 They're the handcuffs that Oh Hyeon Jae put on that bastard five years ago.

551
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,140
 But that bastard took off the handcuffs that Oh Hyeon Jae put on him.

552
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,690
The handcuffs that Director Choi is in possession of. That bastard's DNA...

553
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,750
He will specify it soon enough since 60 people isn't a lot.

554
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,340
Where is Director Choi right now?

555
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,400
I think he went to the get-together dinner for Mucheon Agency's executives.

556
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,170
Today is a dinner get-together for Mucheon Agency,

557
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:40,220
 so Deputy Commissioner Park and Director Choi should be together.

558
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:42,800

559
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,610

560
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,940
 But what's interesting is...

561
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,180
 that bastard is a police officer.

562
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,770
It's strange.

563
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,540
If Detective Oh was his usual self,

564
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,660
he wouldn't have shared information.

565
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,390
Why did he do that?

566
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,210
 Then what do I need to do?

567
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,800
 Go interrogate Chim Sa Bong.

568
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,980
 Okay, I understand.

569
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,580
He was getting the firearm ready.

570
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,930
What is he trying to do with that firearm?

571
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,420
No way...

572
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,410
- Let's have a drink. 
 - Yes.

573
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,390
But why is Director Choi not here?

574
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,640
He should be on his way.

575
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,680
Commissioner, please allow me to pour you a glass.

576
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,790
Team Leader Hwang, what is it?

577
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,760

578
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,890
Team Leader, I think Detective Oh has planned something dangerous.

579
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:21,860
What?

580
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,610
Detective Oh has a firearm.

581
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,100
It's strange. I think he shared information during the briefing on purpose.

582
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,530
I got it. I'll find out Oh Hyeon Jae's whereabouts.

583
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,630
Let's move together.

584
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,580

585
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:49,020

586
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,370

587
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,960

588
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,260

589
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,050

590
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,630
Look here, did you come for the handcuffs?

591
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:22,290
As expected, you took the bait.

592
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,110
 Detective Oh, you were right.

593
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,880
 Director Choi came with the handcuffs.

594
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,380
 Now tell him that there's DNA of an unidentified person on the handcuffs.

595
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,510
 What is it?

596
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,640
 The handcuffs that had Oh Hyeon Jae's fingerprints back then.

597
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,330
 You failed to extract DNA anyway!

598
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,370
 Well it's that... I think it's possible to extract DNA.

599
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,560
 The world really changes rapidly.

600
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,110
 Do you think you can find who it is?

601
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,640
 Yeah.

602
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,060
 Make it top secret.

603
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,400
 I got it.  Just bring the handcuffs.

604
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,250
 The handcuffs that Director Choi is in possession of. That bastard's DNA...

605
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:58,360
 He will specify it soon enough since 60 people isn't a lot.

606
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,920
There was no DNA on the handcuffs from the get go.

607
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,910
It was false information leaked by me, knowing you'd be listening in.

608
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,500
- Where is Detective Oh? 
 - They lost contact at the NFS.

609
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,000
What is he up to?

610
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,010
Take off your mask.

611
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:44,600
Now, tell me, who told you to kill Isu?

612
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,450

613
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,420
Team Leader.

614
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:11,010
What is it?

615
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,400

616
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,940
Follow me.

617
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,830
You bastard.

618
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,770
Are you trying to show me the power of the police?

619
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,840
You bastard...

620
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,360
I will catch you with my own hands no matter what...

621
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,970
With your own hands?

622
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:47,380
I will be sure to catch you.

623
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,130
You must catch him.

624
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,470
Detective Oh!

625
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,790
Oh Hyeon Jae!

626
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,750
Ask for back up now.

627
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:51,710
Detective Yang, come to the NFS right now!

628
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,580
Director.

629
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,380
Director.

630
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,330
Oh Hyeon Jae!

631
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,170
Director.

632
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:29,390

633
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,280

634
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,390
 It happened because he went at it alone.

635
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:47,460
 Once he gets caught by Oh Hyeon Jae—

636
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,900
 No, that must never happen.

637
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,080
 It's definitely that bastard's doing.

638
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,980
 You mean the mint serial killer?

639
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:56,820
 Profiling is all about figuring out the psychology between one choice and the next.

640
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,720
 Are you saying you've profiled me or something?

641
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,860
 You seem anxious I'll be caught by someone else.

642
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:09,320
 You know... all I want to know is

643
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,930
 who asked for Isu to be killed.
