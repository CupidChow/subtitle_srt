1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,530

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,750

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,290

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,100

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,430

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,740

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,940

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:36,230

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,200
 I could have caught him,

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,530
 but I lost him.

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,380
 No. You weren't going to be able to catch him from the first place.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,100
 Team Leader Hwang, you can't die yet.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,790
 Because you're a card that will torment Oh Hyeon Jae until the very end.

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,730
 Oh Hyeon Jae, you'll never be able to figure me out.

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,730
 Section Chief Bang's investigation was a secret investigation.

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,250
 Who could have predicted it?

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,540
 Someone who was acquainted with him or someone who was working with him in close proximity.

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,080
 He is hiding in this police organization like a rat.

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,330
 That bastard is a police officer.

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,800
 Do you think the organization that you strived so hard to protect will protect you?

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,280
 You should just take all the blame!

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,110
 If killing him with my own hands is a way for me to survive,

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,590
 I must kill him.

24
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,760
 Team Leader, I think Detective Oh has planned something dangerous.

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,290
 It's strange. I think he shared information during the briefing on purpose.

26
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:31,610
 Look here. Now, tell me, who told you to kill Isu?

27
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:45,290

28
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,990
 I will be sure to catch you.

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,820
 You must catch him.

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,020
 I can see an outline of you.

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,810
 But will you be able to figure me out?

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,040
 Just wait. We'll meet soon.

33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,430
 Oh Hyeon Jae, you saw that bastard's face.

34
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,690
 Team Leader Hwang, how much do you know?

35
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,420
 I will be the first to catch that bastard.

36
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,320
 Kim Yo Han, I knew you would be here.

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,170
 I really like it here.

38
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,790
 Your objective isn't to use government authority to throw me in jail.

39
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,220
 It's Isu, right? Han Isu.

40
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,490
 You want revenge.

41
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,080
 I know her well. Since five years ago,

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,000
 around the end of November, she always bought freesias.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,060
 Every year?

44
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,960
 Oh Hyeon Jae, you are under arrest as a suspect for the murder of Director Choi Hyeong Pil.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,800
 That's what Cha Soo Yeong saw. How interesting.

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,530
 We were in a state of disorder when you arrived

47
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,900
 and it's the same now as you're leaving.

48
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,590
 Or did it become that way when you got here?

49
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,640
 I'm sure Hwang Ha Yeong didn't want me to catch that bastard.

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,110
 Hwang Ha Yeong, what's the secret you're hiding?

51
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,230

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,480
Rubbing the forehead means she feels very uncomfortable.

53
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,970
You're blocking the negative memories from getting into your brain, unconsciously.

54
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,240
Hwang Ha Yeong, you're scared right now.

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,840

56
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,290
Can I leave now?

57
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,130
I might call you again, but that's it for today.

58
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,080
Okay.

59
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,400
I'll get going.

60
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,250
Wait.

61
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,380
Yes?

62
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,540
It's been a while, so I don't know if you remember.

63
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,480
Five years ago, you took time off on November 29.

64
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,290
By chance, do you remember what you were doing that day?

65
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,050
I don't even remember well what I did a month ago.

66
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,240
Wh-Which date?

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,830
November 29, 2015.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,010
November 29... November 29... 29...

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,310
Ah, I was with a friend of mine.

70
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,060
A friend from childhood.

71
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,460
A friend? Would it be possible to know who that friend was?

72
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,350
You probably know him, too.

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,750
Me?

74
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,160
Yes, my friend.

75
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,600
You blew his head off.

76
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,850
Don't you remember?

77
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,980
Shin Gyeong Soo.

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,200
Say it the way you did back then.

79
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,980
"Spare me. Spare me!"

80
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,900
 Spare me.

81
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,820
 Spare me!

82
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,780
Why can't you say it?

83
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,640
You said it well back then.

84
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,960
 Tell me the name.

85
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,970
Don't worry. Today is not the day.

86
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:14,970
I'll let you live today for the grand party I'm preparing for you guys.

87
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,430
No... it can't be.

88
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,290
Kang Dong Sik. That bastard.

89
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,370
I must catch him.

90
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,210
Detective Yang.

91
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,180
 Oh, Soo Yeong!

92
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,260
 Detective Yang tells me he is busy right now.

93
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,880
So I'm answering his phone in his place.

94
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,230
 I'm busy right now, so can you tell me quickly if you have something to say?

95
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,480
Where are you right now? Where are you right now?

96
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,320
Where are you right now?!

97
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,720
If you miss me that much, just wait a little bit.

98
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,570
By any chance... by any chance... to Detective Yang...

99
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,860
I'll send him off in no time.

100
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,280
No, I'll come to you. I'll come.

101
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,540
Where are you?

102
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,040
Where are you, you crazy bastard?!

103
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,070

104
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,590
Hey, Soo Yeong.  Don't get excited. Don't.

105
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,960
 Look up. Up here!

106
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,280
What's going on!

107
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,520
Get help! Hurry!

108
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,990
This is the invitation that I'm giving you guys.

109
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:36,040
Team Leader, they said that they will take Detective Yang to the National Forensic Service first.

110
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,950
Team Leader?

111
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,660

112
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,720
Can you leave for a moment?

113
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,800
 - Team Leader. 
 - Yes?

114
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,560
 When was the last time you got any sleep?

115
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,240
 Why are you pretending?

116
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,620
 - What do you mean? 
 - As if you're all right.

117
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,260
 When you don't look okay.

118
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,660
 Also, don't disappear like how you did five years ago.

119
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,390
 You know, right?

120
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,510
 My phone is always on.

121
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,380
 Come closer, Hyung-nim.

122
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,320
 Ready. One, two, three!

123
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:21,100
♫  The memories which you have lost  ♫

124
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:30,300
♫  In an instant I recall you as if you were a picture  ♫

125
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,060
Our Hyung Man Soo, it must have hurt a lot.

126
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:03,380
♫  Before I realized it, you were beyond my sight  ♫

127
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:14,200
♫  You left me behind  ♫

128
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,870
♫  Who wandered alone searching for you  ♫

129
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,320

130
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,940

131
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,790
 I think I have the same dream as the one I had in my young age.  Living an ordinary life.

132
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:07,030
 You? By any chance... are you... Detective Cha of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit?

133
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,370
 You look so good.

134
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,310
 Hey, no matter how busy you are, you should still contact your father.

135
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,630
 The whole village is worried about your father.

136
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,990
 Sunbae, take care of him well for me.

137
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,330
 Wow, her shamelessness is through the roof.

138
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,410
 Why else do you think I'm here now?

139
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,530
 - Hey! 
 - What?

140
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,150
 - In front! In front! 
 - What?

141
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,870
 - In front! 
 - What?

142
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,780
 Watch out for poop!

143
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,910
 - Hey, hey! Dong Sik! Dong Sik! 
- Yes?

144
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,980
 - We have a newcomer today. 
 - Who?

145
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,690
 - Cha Soo Yeong's the only one who'd come here, don't you think? 
- Cha Soo Yeong?

146
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,650
 You know the one who was always hanging around the patrol division day in and day out

147
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,470
  saying she wanted to become an officer.

148
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,560
 Oh, I think I know whom you're talking about. Who was that again?

149
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,780
 Oh, seriously.

150
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,210
 Sir, I, Officer Cha Soo Yeong, have been assigned to Hongwoon Police Station.

151
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,960
 I am reporting for duty! Salute!

152
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,580
 Yes, I was right! Cha Soo Yeong!

153
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,690
 Good to see you! This is great!

154
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,900
 Wow, that's amazing. You really became Hongwoon-myeon's protector.

155
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,700
 I'll formally introduce myself to you, Sunbae.

156
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,850
 I'm Cha Soo Yeong. Please take care of me.

157
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,170
 Yes, let's do our best.

158
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,240
 Come here, I'll take you to your seat.

159
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,950
 Here's your computer and other things you need.

160
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,510
 Tell me the name.

161
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,590
 Isu.

162
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,520
 Han Isu.

163
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,420
Why did you do it?

164
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,950
Why?

165
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,210
Why Isu?

166
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,090
If I had said another name,

167
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,580
would it be different for us now?

168
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,850
I wanted to live.

169
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,600
When Isu's name was said that day,

170
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,170
Hwang Ha Yeong died.

171
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,410
The moment Detective Yang died,

172
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,350
Policewoman Hwang Ha Yeong died as well.

173
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,560
Even though I knew the truth about Kang Dong Sik being that bastard,

174
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,210
I...

175
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,880
couldn't...

176
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,920
do anything.

177
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,010
Because I was scared.

178
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,150
Now, there's...

179
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,250
nothing...

180
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,130
nothing I can do.

181
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,470
Then, die.

182
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,020
If there is really nothing you can do.

183
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,240
Then it will all be over.

184
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,280
 Unni, my most precious unni gave me the best gift in the world.

185
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,230
 Thank you.

186
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,390

187
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,370

188
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,220

189
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,060

190
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,480
 Detective Oh Hyeon Jae? It's me.

191
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,050
What's wrong?

192
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,620
 Did something happen?

193
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,820
 It's okay. You can tell me everything.

194
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,990
Who else would understand your feelings as well as I do?

195
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,580
The name you didn't say, Hwang Ha Yeong...

196
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,450
The name I wanted to hear, Hwang Ha Yeong...

197
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:37,430
But then again, for the past five years, the name you've been dying to find out

198
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,730
was Hwang Ha Yeong in the end.

199
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,590
 I understand why you don't sound well.

200
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,390
Then what are you going to do now?

201
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,670
Will you kill Hwang Ha Yeong?

202
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,500
Or did you already kill her?

203
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,000
The fact that I now know that name also means

204
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,880
there's no reason for you to live any longer.

205
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,330
No, that's not it, Detective Oh.

206
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,260
Maybe you thought Hwang Ha Yeong was the final answer,

207
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:13,500
but she's only just the beginning to another question.

208
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,210
Why did I choose Hwang Ha Yeong?

209
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,990
Why did Hwang Ha Yeong say Han Isu?

210
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,360
Aren't you curious?

211
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,480
Is that important?

212
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,920
She was just your amusement.

213
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,790
As expected...

214
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:42,970
But... that answer is only worth about 50 points.

215
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:48,800
The Detective Oh I know wouldn't be satisfied with that.

216
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,170
Use your head

217
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,820
instead of acting like you know.

218
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,740
 You have to find that 100-point answer.

219
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,480
You're curious, aren't you?

220
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,060
When exactly did our red thread of fate get tied together?

221
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,660
So hurry and find me, Detective Oh Hyeon Jae.

222
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,820
Don't worry.

223
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,020
I will be standing there right behind you

224
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,680
at the moment when you least expect it.

225
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,330
That's right.

226
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,440
 I look forward to it.

227
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,240
It's not your fault.

228
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,090
It is my fault.

229
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,660
I saw what I wanted to see.

230
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,000
And I believed what I saw as is.

231
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,050
That kind of person...

232
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,180
Having that kind of bastard by my side,

233
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,790
laughing with him, talking to him, and depending on him...

234
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,600
Being dumb is also a fault.

235
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,670
It is my fault.

236
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,510
If you had been suspicious, could you have stopped it?

237
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,420
Everyone has his or her own story and pain.

238
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,230
But we have to judge it based solely on the end result.

239
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,570
So this outcome

240
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,130
- is my fault. 
 - Team Leader.

241
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,930
I will definitely catch that bastard.

242
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,160
Let's catch that bastard together

243
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,920
and let him receive the judgment of the law.

244
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,350
Yes, Team Leader.

245
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,250
I met Oh Hyeon Jae yesterday.

246
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:32,110
Oh Hyeon Jae will probably kill that bastard and then end his own life.

247
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,170
And he'll leave me to make my own choice.

248
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,340
- Team Leader. 
 - Don't worry.

249
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,470
I remembered what Detective Yang used to say.

250
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,520
If you recognize and accept your fears,

251
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,320
you can become a real detective.

252
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,980
I won't do anything that will make Detective Yang feel ashamed.

253
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,260
I will save Oh Hyeon Jae too.

254
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,250
So will you trust me and help me?

255
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,290
But you didn't have to say all this to me.

256
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,840
Couldn't you have just given me orders as usual?

257
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,780
I don't want to lie to my people anymore.

258
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,950
I believe those words, Team Leader.

259
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,860
I believe in you too.

260
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,050
Cha Soo Yeong, you will become a good police officer.

261
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,950
A good police officer unlike the rest of us.

262
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,740

263
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,990
Is this true? Is Kang Dong Sik really the mint—

264
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:55,000
Team Leader, is Kang Dong Sik really that mint bastard?

265
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,600
Good. There's no need for me to give a long explanation.

266
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,220
Starting now, we'll go after Kang Dong Sik.

267
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,250
And we'll definitely make him stand in a court of law.

268
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,470
Yes, no matter what—

269
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,830
But our superiors will never admit that Kang Dong Sik is the mint serial killer

270
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,860
because that would be admitting to their own mistake.

271
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,810
Hey, Detective Lee! How can you say such—

272
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,850
I'm saying we need to look at this situation objectively!

273
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,020
If we make a wrong move, the superiors can shackle us.

274
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,420
Don't worry. At the very least, I have a plan to arrest Kang Dong Sik.

275
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,650
Revealing that bastard's identity will come afterwards.

276
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,210
What's going on? I wasn't briefed on this.

277
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,430
What is she announcing?

278
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,730
We're also not sure.

279
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,060
The murder of Section Chief Bang Sang Sik on March 11,

280
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,870
the murder of Director Choi Hyeong Pil two days ago at the NFS,

281
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,320
and the murder of Detective Yang Man Soo yesterday,

282
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,680
we have found crucial evidence that

283
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,990
these murders were committed by the same person.

284
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,780
The prime suspect of the investigation, Mr. Kang,

285
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,680
along with Section Chief Bang Sang Sik of Hwayeong Police Station,

286
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,940
received bribes from a loan shark.

287
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,770
In the process of distributing bribes while committing irregularities,

288
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,500
he committed murder due to a conflict,

289
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,410
and when Director Choi and Detective Yang uncovered that fact,

290
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,100
we suspect that he murdered them in order.

291
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,490
Section Chief Bang Sang Sik's case was disguised as a suicide,

292
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,330
but I heard that Director Choi Hyeong Pil and Detective Yang Man Soo were garroted with a fishing line.

293
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,670
This is the same way that bastard committed crimes five years ago.

294
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,390
By any chance, do you think the suspect Mr. Kang is that bastard?

295
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,790
As we have stated each time, that bastard died from an accident five years ago.

296
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,200
That is the police's official position.

297
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,910
It is just coincidence that the method used to commit the crime was the same.

298
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,620
We, the police, will do our best to catch

299
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,910
 the suspect Mr. Kang who ran away.

300
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,430
 This is the end of the briefing.

301
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:08,010
A checkmate move.

302
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,580
Hwang Ha Yeong made a checkmate move

303
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,590
by using the Metropolitan Investigation Unit as an official line.

304
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,210
Because if they try to arrest Kang Dong Sik as that bastard,

305
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,170
the superiors will undoubtedly try to stop them anyway.

306
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,970
Tying him with Section Chief Bang through corruption

307
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,990
to say that he murdered two detectives to hide that matter...

308
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,710
Not a bad move.

309
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,840
Now it's your turn.

310
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,520
What will you do, Kim Yo Han?

311
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,020
Of course, you were already expecting this.

312
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,680
But you have only one card.

313
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,740
Crash!

314
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,730
Turning the table upside down.

315
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,350
What will you do?

316
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,950

317
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,550
- Excuse me. 
 - How can I help you?

318
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,630
Is this where...

319
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,280

320
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,810
Where's Oh Hyeon Jae?

321
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,680
I couldn't get in touch with him.

322
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,100
Team Leader, Kang Dong Sik was put on the wanted list.

323
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,700
And we also got the search warrant for Hongwoon Police Station and his residence.

324
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,430
Let's go.

325
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,520
We will contact you when we arrive.

326
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,420

327
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,050

328
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,340
Please check every little thing without any exception.

329
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,920
Yes.

330
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,680
Based on his character, he wouldn't have left any clues behind.

331
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,120
Most of the kitchenware are disposable items.

332
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,360
I think he has been preparing to disappear anytime as soon as his identity was revealed.

333
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,500
Team Leader.

334
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,470

335
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,430
Yeongwoon Metropolitan Police Agency is the first place Oh Hyeon Jae worked at.

336
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,430
I think that bastard has known Oh Hyeon Jae

337
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,610
for a much longer period than we thought.

338
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,350
Maybe long before he started serial killing in full swing...

339
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,060
Yes, Detective Lee?

340
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,710
 Team Leader, there's nothing much at the police station.

341
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,700
Okay. You can leave.

342
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,370

343
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,570
Looking back on it now,

344
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,840
he was strangely obsessed with Oh Hyeon Jae.

345
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,130
Isn't it common for serial killers to become obsessed with

346
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,620
detectives or profilers who are on their tail?

347
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,010
It's kind of like rivalry.

348
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,360
But it's too obsessive to call it that.

349
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,490
Could there be another reason?

350
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,760
Something between just the two of them which we don't know...

351
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,730
Yes, something even Oh Hyeon Jae doesn't know.

352
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,480
Find the connection between Kim Yo Han and Oh Hyeon Jae.

353
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,350
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

354
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,940
Detective Lee, did you sit here after coming back to the office?

355
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,630
No, I came in just now. Why?

356
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,200
 Let's go.

357
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:07,370
 The position of the chair changed. Maybe...

358
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,950
 Cha Soo Yeong.

359
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,380
H-Hold on.

360
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,360
- Detective Lee. 
 - Yes?

361
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,200
- Check your computer log records. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

362
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,140
Detective Oh, where are you? Did you know that that bastard—

363
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,880
That bastard's plan...

364
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,000
What?

365
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,230
I had a thought. Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency.

366
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,150
Why did that bastard come to Mucheon Metropolitan Police Agency?

367
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,520
Because this is the safest place?

368
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,360
No, on the contrary, it's more dangerous for him there.

369
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,740
Because he's on Team Leader Hwang's list.

370
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,690
Then it was only a matter of time before his identity would be revealed.

371
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,770
He had another goal.

372
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,110
A goal that meant he had to come to Mucheon Metropolitan Police Station at all costs.

373
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,940
The reason he had an interest

374
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,830
 is because I'm here, all exposed.

375
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,330
Think back on what that bastard has said before.

376
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,700
 Hey, Soo Yeong.  Don't get excited. Don't.

377
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,010
 Look up. Up here!

378
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,000
 What's going on!

379
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,550
 This is the invitation that I'm giving you guys.

380
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,310
Invitation? He used the term "invitation."

381
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,880
Was there anything special in what he said?

382
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,830
 I'll let you live today for the grand party I'm preparing for you guys.

383
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,270
A grand party prepared for us.

384
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,120
To prepare something...

385
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,980
Remember it, Cha Soo Yeong.

386
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,550

387
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,530
 Oh, Soo Yeong.

388
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,940
Joo Sa Gang! He was looking at Joo Sa Gang's file.

389
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,850
Team Leader, it's Joo Sa Gang's file.

390
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,870
Yesterday, someone printed files related to Joo Sa Gang.

391
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,420

392
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,000
But why Joo Sa Gang—

393
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,150
Detective Oh?

394
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,020
Detective Oh! Detective Oh?

395
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,890
He printed out not only the case files, but also his psychological analysis results.

396
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,590
It's too hard even for him to turn the tables all alone.

397
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,320
He probably needed an assistant.

398
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,950
Like Shin Gyeong Soo and Dominique.

399
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,720
But even for that bastard, it was probably too hard to brainwash someone in such a short time.

400
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,790
But it's different for Joo Sa Gang.

401
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,710
He killed his father, Ha Tae Sik, as well as three members of the Sinwol faction.

402
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,060
Joo Sa Gang, the left-handed serial killer.

403
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,010

404
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,340
Team Leader, Joo Sa Gang—

405
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,860
Team Leader, today is Joo Sa Gang's appearance at the prosecution.

406
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,110
Call the detention center and find out what time his departure is.

407
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,220
This is Detective Lee Ji Min from Mucheon Metropolitan Investigation Unit Team 1.

408
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,260
What time is Joo Sa Gang leaving for the prosecution today?

409
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,470
- Okay. He said he left not too long ago. 
 - We have to prevent it.

410
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,340
- Yes, then I will ask for back up. 
 - No.

411
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,600
Our team will catch him alone.

412
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,980
That bastard is after Joo Sa Gang. Why?

413
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,720
That much, I also don't really...

414
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:21,000
That bastard, Joo Sa Gang, Hwang Ha Yeong, Oh Hyeon Jae...

415
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:28,590
If that bastard is after Joo Sa Gang, then Oh Hyeon Jae will show up there, too.

416
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,500
I don't need anything else. Go and arrest Oh Hyeon Jae.

417
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,130
Pardon?

418
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,850
But that bastard...

419
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:39,030
We can somehow lock up that bastard and make him shut up.

420
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,440
The important thing now is to muffle Oh Hyeon Jae.

421
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,940
So go and arrest Oh Hyeon Jae.

422
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,560
Yes, sir.

423
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,240

424
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,310
I came since they said Attorney Kim was here. Who are you?

425
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,640
Yes, Attorney Kim was busy with something,

426
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,370
so I came instead.

427
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,090
I'm Attorney Jeong Woo Sik.

428
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,160
But I think I've said everything I need to.

429
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,180
Looking at it, I think so, too.

430
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,670
Okay, then.

431
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,260
The person I want to talk to isn't Joo Sa Gang.

432
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,970

433
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,960
It's the other bastard inside you.

434
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,940
Hey, Lefty.

435
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,260
Let's talk for a bit.

436
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,280
 No, please. Don't do this.

437
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,550
 Don't do this.

438
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,650
Until that bastard appears, we will only follow closely.

439
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:25,690
As soon as he senses something strange, he'll disappear.

440
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,220
Remember, this is the last chance to catch that bastard.

441
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,370
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

442
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,980
- Move your car right now! 
 - Move your car!

443
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,080
Sorry, I can't seem to start the car.

444
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,590
- Pardon? 
 - Just hurry and move it!

445
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,890
Yes, Detective Oh, it's done.

446
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,570
Where's your key? Give it to me.

447
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,370
What?

448
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,940
 Could it be Detective Oh?

449
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,860
 Detective, tell the car behind you to move his car first.

450
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,440
No!

451
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,540
Detective Oh Hyeon Jae, Deputy Commissioner Park wants to see you.

452
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,660
Seriously, Oh Hyeon Jae!

453
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,140
Okay, Oh Hyeon Jae.

454
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,280
If I arrive first, I'll hold onto him.

455
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,050
Then that car earlier...

456
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:07,570
I'm certain. It was Jo Bang Man, Oh Hyeon Jae's informant.

457
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:11,240
I'm sure Detective Oh came to the office while we were out.

458
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,090
He found out everything then.

459
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,580
Why did he contact you then?

460
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,890
No way, is he trying to share intel and get that bastard—

461
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,690
No. Detective Oh probably wanted Team Leader to come alone.

462
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,900
Once I figured out that bastard is after Joo Sa Gang,

463
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,330
he must have known I'd tell Team Leader right away.

464
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,200
But we figured that out first.

465
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,350
In order to separate us, he must have given orders to Jo Bang Man.

466
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:35,410
Why did he want to separate us?

467
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,930
Detective Oh probably thinks there's something

468
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,860
just the three of them need to resolve together.

469
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,430
Detective Oh just used you again, can't you tell?

470
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,590
No.

471
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:52,890
I'm sure there's a reason.

472
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,280
I expected you to figure out my plan.

473
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,830
But you came sooner than I thought.

474
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,620
What the? You're by yourself?

475
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,120
You're going to catch me alone?

476
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,260
I'm very disappointed.

477
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,870
Hwang Ha Yeong.

478
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,210
You think I'm that easy?

479
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,900
The weather is really nice today.

480
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,890
He's here right on time.

481
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,560
This is fun.

482
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,090
In front of me is Hwang Ha Yeong,

483
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,420
and behind me is Oh Hyeon Jae.

484
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,540
 You're a little late, Detective Oh Hyeon Jae.

485
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,900
 Why are you so late?

486
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,980
 I've prepared a present for you today.

487
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,590
What could this be?

488
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,690
You're curious, aren't you?

489
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,380
 In the transport vehicle over there,

490
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:59,420
I've prepared a present. A time bomb.

491
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,490
It'll be fun, no?

492
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,910
I wonder how big the explosion will be.

493
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,590
If you stand nearby, you'll get hurt.

494
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,140
You'll have to run away.

495
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,430
 But for a final party,

496
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,140
I don't think it's a suitable location.

497
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,930
I'm hanging up now.

498
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,770
Why? You're going to shoot me?

499
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,510
If you do, it'll cause a problem.

500
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,770
Hwang Ha Yeong!

501
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,930
Go!

502
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,290
 Hyeon Jae!

503
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,830
Isu.

504
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,920
 Hyeon Jae. Hyeon Jae.

505
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,990
 Isu!

506
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,060
 Isu!

507
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,830
Thank you.

508
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,220
Domyeong Elementary School...

509
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:21,240
Oh Hyeon Jae, are you okay?

510
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,850
Where are you?

511
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,610
Okay, got it.

512
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:29,180
Team Leader is at Domyeong Elementary School right now.

513
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,010
Domyeong Elementary School.

514
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,930
It's been shuttered. It's not far from here.

515
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:37,780
But that school... it's where that bastard used to attend.

516
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,390
What is this? Why there of all places?

517
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:42,210
He didn't just happen to end up there while running away.

518
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,480
It could be a trap. This won't work.

519
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,430
I think we need to ask for back up.

520
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,700
- Detective Jang. 
 - Yeah.

521
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,320
This is Detective Jang Tae Seong of Team 1 of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

522
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,950
Please send back up to Domyeong Elementary School right away.

523
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,330
Leaving? To where?

524
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,650
To Domyeong Elementary School, which was closed ten years ago.

525
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:10,100
Team 1 is chasing after Kang Dong Sik right now.

526
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,100
Team 1 is chasing after Kang Dong Sik?

527
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,420
Yes, that's right.

528
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,140
Don't leave yet but be on standby. I'll go talk to Team 2.

529
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,430
But they're asking for back up, and Kang Dong Sik is...

530
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,060
Okay, I understand.

531
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,040
You bastards, won't you get your heads screwed on straight!

532
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,080
How can all of you lose against Oh Hyeon Jae?

533
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,840
This is really our last chance.

534
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:13,620
Do whatever you have to in order to shut Oh Hyeon Jae and Kang Dong Sik's mouths.

535
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,400
 You get what I'm saying?

536
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,680
Yes, I understand.

537
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,980
How is it here?

538
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:39,210
The last location for a party I've prepared for you guys.

539
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,020
Isn't the atmosphere to kill for?

540
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,800
Kang Dong Sik, it's all over now.

541
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,560
Could that really be true?

542
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,250
Why do you think I dragged you guys all the way here?

543
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,960
I wanted to show you guys.

544
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:05,390
How advantageous this world is for people like me.

545
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:11,450
In this world, there are too many like me.

546
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,580
Like that.

547
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,420
Who could they be?

548
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:28,690
They wanted to rip up Oh Hyeon Jae to pieces as badly as I do.

549
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,620
So I invited them to the party.

550
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:39,920
Be careful. You'll end up covered in wounds.

551
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,100
Look here, Kim Yo Han.

552
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:46,280
There's something we need to discuss.

553
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:10,090
It's starting again. Let's see if you can avoid it this time, too.

554
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,640
Aren't you filled with emotions of your memory?

555
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,540
Do you want to hear something interesting?

556
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:52,690
The name you gave me last time was the wrong answer,

557
00:55:55,710 --> 00:56:00,250
but this time, it's the correct answer.

558
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:09,650
Tell me the name of the person whom you want to kill.

559
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,670
The one person you want to kill...

560
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:22,350
Tell me the name.

561
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,570
Hurry up.

562
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,680
No one!

563
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:53,610
There's no one I want to kill, and there's no one to die by your hands!

564
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,520
No one will die, Kang Dong Sik.

565
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,040
I'll make sure that even someone like you receives the judgment of law.

566
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:26,100
Because...

567
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:30,990
I'm a police officer.

568
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,670
Oh Hyeon Jae!

569
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:12,740

570
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:27,840

571
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,370
 It's an order from our superior.

572
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,770
 Get off this case from this moment onwards.

573
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:33,720
 As soon as you find them, kill them both.

574
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,320
 What is Detective Oh thinking?

575
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,750
 No way. Even so, he wouldn't kill him...

576
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,480
 Detective Oh is trying to see this to the end by himself without anyone's interference.

577
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,960
 What is this crazy behavior?!

578
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,870
 The pain and dread that you made your victims feel...

579
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:55,980
 I will never kill you until you feel it a thousand times more.
