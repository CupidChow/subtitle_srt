1
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,041
going to work
at the little company I've built

2
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,043
with all my heart, blood and tears…

3
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,670
Movex.

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,847
-Hi, ma'am Zuri!
-Hello, ma'am!

5
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,852
-What's wrong?
-She's choking!

6
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,687
-Hug!
-Like this? Like this?

7
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,813
Then do this!

8
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,357
From the bottom, do it harder.

9
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,193
There. Go!

10
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,444
You got it!

11
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,029
Movex is family.

12
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,947
I joke around with my people.

13
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,116
Sometimes, I even go out with them.

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,412
I'm still their boss
and the respect is still there.

15
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,372
This is the kind of family I want.

16
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:26,002
We're happy, we stick together.
Unlike my real family.

17
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,254
When I was a toddler,

18
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,133
I already figured out
what kind of family I didn't want.

19
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,513
Why is the electricity bill so high
when the power is always out?

20
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:41,100
Why is the cable bill so high
when we don't even have a TV?

21
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,356
Darling, my chest feels tight.

22
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,359
Me too, darling.

23
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:55,281
Wait. Before we die,
we must give Zuri to a new family.

24
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:59,661
Luckily, before they died,
they got me a new family.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,086
To my infertile aunt.

26
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,506
I don't want her, sweetheart.

27
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,133
Look at her!

28
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,845
She's not growing. I think she's cursed.

29
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,140
Sweetheart, you're the one cursed.

30
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,975
It's so obvious with your thing…

31
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,061
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,231
I'm not the one cursed with being barren.

33
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,816
I'm leaving you.

34
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,985
Before that, we have to get rid of Zuri.

35
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,154
What a worthless family.

36
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,825
From then on, I got passed around
to whomever would take me in.

37
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,749
Until I landed with the sixth male cousin

38
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,295
of the fifth cousin of my barren aunt's
next door neighbor!

39
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,756
I did everything, hon.

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,928
Nothing I do can fix her irregular period.

41
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,598
My grandparents say

42
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,392
it's bad luck
to have someone like that at home.

43
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,518
Okay.

44
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,772
Does that mean you plan to pass me off
to avoid bad luck?

45
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,857
Yeah, I said it.

46
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,820
I couldn't take just how
narrow-minded they were.

47
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,946
Oh, no, I'm fine.

48
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,948
Yes, you don't have to do it.

49
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,951
My armpits are getting sore
from getting passed around.

50
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,077
I'll do it.

51
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,871
I'll do it.

52
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:29,459
Since then, I've survived without a family
to take care of me.

53
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,338
I got through all those hardships
on my own.

54
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,716
Congrats, my magna cum laude best friend!

55
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,093
I idolize you. You're amazing!

56
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,261
Congrats to us!

57
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,513
-Congrats to us!
-Yeah, the both of us.

58
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,850
So, can we date now?

59
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,647
Bestie, I told you I have plans in life.

60
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,523
This isn't one of them.

61
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,192
You shouldn't wait for me.

62
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:59,781
Well, I hope you don't mind me
sticking around for those plans.

63
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,076
Yes, of course. Fine.

64
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,786
What if

65
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,665
we start with one of your plans
over there? Game?

66
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,791
-There?
-There.

67
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,751
-That's why I'm with you.
-Yeah.

68
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,671
With my bestie's help,

69
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:19,425
I got to work on my dream
of starting my own company.

70
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,513
-Why "Movex"?
-What?

71
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,223
Why'd you name it "Movex"?

72
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,186
with extra success! Like that!

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,814
-Oh, really?
-Yes!

74
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,815
Sounds lame.

75
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,775
Really lame.

76
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,610
-Wow!
-Hey, hold on!

77
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,905
Greg helped a lot when I started Movex.

78
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,867
He and my distant relative, Brian.

79
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,869
Zuri, Zuri.

80
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,621
-Zuri!
-Bri?

81
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,498
-I forgot to tell you…
-What?

82
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,918
Our antivirus program needs an update.

83
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,880
-Oh.
-And… we need to expand our cloud storage.

84
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,135
I really thought
all my relatives were gone.

85
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,637
That's when Brian showed up.

86
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,683
He's in-charge of Movex's IT aspects.

87
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,686
We're not a big name in the industry yet.

88
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,940
For now, we handle
mail, parcels and packages.

89
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:22,071
But only for mainland Luzon
and its hard-to-reach towns and cities.

90
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,658
Someday, we'll be able to reach
Visayas and Mindanao.

91
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,244
And then we'll be able
to expand our services.

92
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,622
What's important
is that we're growing steadily.

93
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,251
And more importantly, my team.

94
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,671
They never left me
through the ups and downs of Movex.

95
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,257
They're the family that I truly deserve.

96
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,259
And it's not like I'm going anywhere.

97
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,220
I'm godmother to their kids.

98
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,638
Hey!

99
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,058
-You scared me.
-Wow, big reaction.

100
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,018
-Good morning.
-Ma'am Zuri!

101
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,227
Good morning, dear.

102
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,645
Boss ma'am…

103
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,608
Could I maybe ask you to be
my kid's godmother?

104
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,692
Oh, don't be silly.

105
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,152
Yes. When's the christening?

106
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,737
It's not a christening.

107
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,405
It's a confirmation.

108
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,406
Come here!

109
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,783
Hi, Godmother!

110
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,659
This is Pauline, your goddaughter.

111
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,286
It'll be her confirmation soon.

112
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,455
Oh, this is her!

113
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,290
A confirmation, you say?

114
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,876
Do you want me to do the slap now?

115
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,629
I'm kidding.

116
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,713
Don't be so serious.

117
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,425
-I thought you were serious.
-Of course. Come here, you cutie.

118
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,927
Pay respects to her.

119
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,428
There you go, dear.

120
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,389
Am I destined to just be the godmother?

121
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,310
I wonder what it'll be like
when I have my own.

122
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,403
It's natural for me to
feel like this at my age, right?

123
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,949
Will I ever be a mother?

124
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,456
Doc!

125
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,583
Why did you kill the music?

126
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,336
I just wanted you to shut up.

127
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,714
All I asked was "How are you?"

128
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,762
All right. Okay, Doc…

129
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,888
Doc?

130
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:51,137
When we first discussed
your irregular period,

131
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,100
why it was a sign that
there's something wrong.

132
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,020
Were you right in the middle

133
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,482
of a voice-over when I was explaining it?

134
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,610
Well, what you explained
was really shocking, Doc.

135
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,987
And I haven't gone into menopause.

136
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,004
for the probability of
pregnancy to go down

137
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:30,885
Because the peak of fertility,
in our twenties is over.

138
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,267
normally, the number of
fertile egg cells go down.

139
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,061
You, Zuri,

140
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:55,493
Because all your tests
have all yielded unpromising results.

141
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,996
So, your wish to have your own child?

142
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,339
-Why do you have that thing out, Doc?
-I'm sorry.

143
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,591
Doc…

144
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,302
How did this happen to me?

145
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:21,227
it's hard to determine
exactly what phenomenon

146
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,979
is the root cause of DOR.

147
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,362
Are there any other options

148
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,823
that would allow me to have children?

149
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,325
Aside from adoption.
I don't want adoption.

150
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,584
Not for me, Doc. I don't want that.

151
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,044
I myself have been through adoption.

152
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,131
I wouldn't want that for my child because…

153
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,674
Doc, what if…

154
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,760
What if my adopted child

155
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,638
went looking for their parents?

156
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,767
And then, the parents take my baby away.

157
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,478
They would just take the kid away from me.

158
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,896
What if that happens?

159
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,316
No way. No! I will not allow it, Doc.

160
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,317
I won't.

161
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,362
Although, I have nothing against those
who are willing to adopt.

162
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,323
They're happy with that. That's okay.

163
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,991
But… No, Doc.

164
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,579
You watch too much TV.

165
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,789
Well…

166
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,715
But…

167
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,676
in your case,

168
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,096
there might be pregnancy-related risks.

169
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,933
Not to mention
adverse effects on your child.

170
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,186
Doc, what if…

171
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,483
I find a way to get pregnant
in a few months' time?

172
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:01,327
Greg, we need to go after
MoliNapoles Construction and Supply

173
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,703
for their balance.

174
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,081
How come they haven't settled yet?

175
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,709
The boss is out of the country
so no one will sign it.

176
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,671
I'm on top of this.

177
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,255
You're coming in too hot.

178
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,298
Wait.

179
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,092
Well, I am hot.

180
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,968
Is the air conditioner broken?

181
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,556
It's already at 16 degrees.

182
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,309
And it's on full blast.
It feels like Antarctica.

183
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,896
I'm freezing here.
And that's saying a lot.

184
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:33,067
You don't have to take it out on us
just because you've got DOR.

185
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,693
Chill out.

186
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,195
Relax.

187
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,909
-Bestie.
-Yes?

188
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,662
Will I always be the godmother?

189
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,746
What?

190
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,837
Well, if you really want
to get knocked up…

191
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,797
Fine! Let's go.

192
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,757
Let's make it happen. I'm willing.

193
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,426
-Hey!
-The stock room's vacant.

194
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,052
I've saved up for a week.

195
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,846
As long as you keep this a secret,

196
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,556
-don't tell my girlfriend.
-Idiot!

197
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,391
I'm being serious, Greg.

198
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,309
It's because you're too picky!

199
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,270
You won't get an adoption.

200
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,314
I get that. You won't get a sperm donor.

201
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,401
I don't know why you want the natural way.

202
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,319
You want it to be someone you know.

203
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,488
And you don't want my sperm.

204
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,157
I can't understand you.

205
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,245
Maybe what you need
is a boyfriend you can marry.

206
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,413
I don't know.

207
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,793
You might need someone
to build a family with.

208
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,963
A guy you'll marry eventually.

209
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,090
Oh, you're back, Zuri.

210
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,802
Brian!

211
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,515
Yoli came by to drop off your laundry.

212
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,058
Along with your goddaughter.

213
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,227
They asked for you.

214
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,647
How was the meeting?

215
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,398
It went okay.

216
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,983
It's dark in here.

217
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,402
I ordered your food for dinner.

218
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,987
From Botejyu.

219
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,739
I just had dinner.

220
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,742
But their food is solid. It's the best.

221
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,203
Well, at least clean up after yourself.

222
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,872
Sorry. I haven't finished my meal.

223
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,374
What did you have for dinner?

224
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,254
Chicken and some rice.

225
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,881
Then, some more chicken.

226
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,525
How come?

227
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,363
Anne Curtis…

228
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,116
Angelica Panganiban…

229
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,707
Maja Salvador.

230
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,169
How come?

231
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,301
How come?

232
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,385
Zuri?

233
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,597
-How come?
-Zuri?

234
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,182
What is it? Are they your friends?

235
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,187
No.

236
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,527
You know, every one of them
have children now.

237
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,988
While I'm gathering dust.

238
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,116
And maybe I'll be alone forever.

239
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:14,204
Right when I was finally ready,
this dumb uterus says no.

240
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,749
I'm curious.

241
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,544
Why are you so intent on having a child?

242
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,589
It's a terrible time to have kids.

243
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,677
And are you sure you want to raise a child

244
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,138
-in the world we live in?
-Brian…

245
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,895
It's natural for us
to want a child of our own.

246
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,358
One that comes from our womb.

247
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,819
Okay? Do you understand?

248
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,404
One that comes from here.

249
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,198
Right here.

250
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,948
Look.

251
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,992
Look!

252
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,120
See, Bri?

253
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,540
My own child.

254
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,003
My own flesh and blood.

255
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,381
Someone who'll never leave me.

256
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,925
Someone who'll love me.

257
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:55,014
And become the purpose of my life.

258
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,599
The end of all that I am.

259
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,728
Baby…

260
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,487
You know, because I wanted…

261
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,449
to be successful…

262
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,243
Because I wanted to be successful so bad…

263
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,788
There! I missed it!

264
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,168
I realized it too late.

265
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,880
I missed it.

266
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,597
Zuri.

267
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,517
Don't worry.

268
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,062
I'm here for you.

269
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,649
Come on. Eat up.

270
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,782
Good thing the consignee's
on the way to Zuri's thing.

271
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,118
That's what you call…

272
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,373
-Right?
-Try again.

273
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,167
-That seems wrong.
-Try again.

274
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,546
-upon one mouth.
-Really?

275
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,759
It's hitting two birds
with one stone, bestie.

276
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,135
-That's it.
-One…

277
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220
Are you sure?

278
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,650
Stop the car, bestie.

279
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,368
Stop the car, bestie.

280
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,120
Bestie?

281
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,164
-Bestie, stop the car!
-I already did!

282
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,583
I stopped when you said it the first time!

283
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,918
-We've stopped?
-Yes!

284
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,545
What is it, bestie?

285
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,840
-What's happening?
-Zuri!

286
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,008
-Hey!
-Ma'am and sir.

287
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,469
Come buy this.

288
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,471
Bring it home for your kids.

289
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,306
Bestie!

290
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,016
Please come check this out.

291
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,769
Andy?

292
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,735
Hey!

293
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,612
What do you guys want?

294
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,532
What is it?
We don't want whatever you're selling!

295
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,658
Leave!

296
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,661
Beybeh, I think there was something
in the food.

297
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,705
Come on, I need to find a toilet.

298
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,081
-What's happening?
-Excuse.

299
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,959
What's happening? I don't understand!

300
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,127
Andy?

301
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,674
Who was that guy you had a moment with?

302
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,433
That was Andy.

303
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,898
He's Andres Dela Resma.

304
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,993
You dated that burnt statue?

305
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,913
Hey! Your jealousy is out of line.

306
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,458
I'm more surprised
that you had a boyfriend.

307
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,002
-How?
-We got together ten years ago.

308
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,546
I think you were overseas then.

309
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:05,013
I think we were together for
about six months?

310
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,808
Actually,

311
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,937
we broke up when I found out
he was going abroad.

312
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,858
Actually, I found out
when he was already there!

313
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,320
Zuri, do you still have feelings
for your ex?

314
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,488
I don't!

315
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,907
This kid…

316
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,326
Bestie, why are you mad?

317
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,161
Are you being honest?

318
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,956
Swear by all your remaining--

319
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,083
Try me. Finish that sentence.

320
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,335
I said that I don't.

321
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,297
But I've been thinking about it and…

322
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,133
He's just what I need, bestie.

323
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,594
He's exactly what I need.

324
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,723
You saw him earlier.

325
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,144
What?

326
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,437
We have history.

327
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,856
We know each other. This makes it easy.

328
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,359
Bestie, it didn't seem like he knew you.

329
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,738
He got shy earlier. He knows me.

330
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,614
Wow! So pretty!

331
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,616
-The universe itself…
-Yeah?

332
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,578
…provided the solution to my problem.

333
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,748
But now, I have another problem.

334
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,167
I don't know where he lives.

335
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,376
In Sitio Halupi.

336
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,754
-What?
-Look, Zuri.

337
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,423
-I found his location.
-Let me see.

338
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,971
That's so far.

339
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,686
I need to go to Sitio Halupi.

340
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,231
I want to give this a shot.

341
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,025
I have to.

342
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,532
Does this hurt?

343
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,660
This is where it comes from.

344
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,745
Here?

345
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,206
What about here? Does this hurt?

346
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,541
Does this hurt? And this?

347
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,127
Believe me, it's the neck.

348
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,545
It's the neck.

349
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,590
It's here. Here.

350
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,300
Right here.

351
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,970
There you go. Right here.

352
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,722
Here.

353
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,390
-Andy?
-Yeah?

354
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,351
You never finish your sketches.

355
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,355
-Who's this woman you're drawing?
-Put that back.

356
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,690
How many girls have rejected you so far?

357
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:25,403
Maybe you can't remember her
because she doesn't want you to.

358
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,738
Whatever!

359
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,448
-Put it back!
-I always tell you

360
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,742
that you won't achieve anything
with these.

361
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,743
-Auntie!
-What?

362
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,869
-Auntie!
-What?

363
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,995
She can't breathe!

364
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,873
Sorry. What's wrong with you two?

365
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,291
This early in the morning?

366
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,292
She started it!

367
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,003
I have a patient here!
She has neck problems!

368
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,255
It's Beybeh's fault.

369
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,965
She's picking on me again!

370
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,634
-What'd she say?
-That I should give up on love

371
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,969
because no girl wants me.

372
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,387
-Is that true?
-Well, sure.

373
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,180
-What?
-I mean, no!

374
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,641
Beybeh! What's wrong with you?

375
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,727
Can't you leave Andy
out of your romantic pessimism?

376
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,020
Enough!

377
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,107
-Mom!
-No! What's wrong with you?

378
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,942
-Mom!
-Beybeh!

379
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,194
Stop picking on your big brother! Okay?

380
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,363
-Ugh.
-What's wrong with you?

381
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,157
Son, stop crying.

382
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,450
-But, Mom--
-No!

383
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,661
Believe me when I tell you…

384
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,662
Okay?

385
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,833
One day,
you'll find the girl you'll marry.

386
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,460
-Really?
-Yes.

387
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,587
I believe you.

388
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,807
Here! Get this!

389
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,561
Didn't I tell you it would be far?

390
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,233
Jeepneys and bikes
only have trips once a day.

391
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,027
It's fine! Actually, bestie,

392
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,906
I'm taking a six-hour jeepney ride,

393
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,826
and then stay for a night
before I take a bike out in the morning.

394
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,747
Oh, God, Zuri.
Just… don't forget why you came.

395
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,333
-You might get side-tracked.
-Bestie…

396
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,751
Are you Miss Zuri?

397
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,419
Yes, I am.

398
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,296
Please come aboard. It's a long ride.

399
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,631
-Okay.
-Go ahead, please.

400
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,091
Where do I put my…

401
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,104
This is my stop, sir.

402
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,732
Carding, help them with these.

403
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,527
-Help unload these.
-Sure.

404
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:16,366
Welcome to our Sitio Halupi, Ms. Zuri.

405
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,285
What brings you out here?

406
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,203
I'm going to lay…

407
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,871
with Andy.

408
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,791
-What are you doing with Andy?
-Oops.

409
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,169
I'm sorry.

410
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,798
I was just enjoying the sights.

411
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,884
I meant… I'm going to stay with Andy.

412
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,177
That was quite a ride.

413
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,472
It took five whole days to get here.

414
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,893
They're building a bridge
inland from the coast.

415
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,229
Then we'll be closer to the centers.

416
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:51,401
We hope they'll remember Sitio Halupi.

417
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,238
A forgotten paradise

418
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,409
with sights so beautiful to behold

419
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,203
that would fill anybody
with the thrill of love.

420
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,374
What did he say?

421
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,123
I'm thrilled!

422
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,918
I'm so thrilled, I need to pee.

423
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,379
Where can I use the toilet?

424
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,589
That way. You can go by the spring.

425
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,675
Thank you, sir!

426
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,761
-Take care.
-Okay.

427
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,385
Snake!

428
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,012
Snake?

429
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,267
Slit!

430
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,144
-Huh?
-Slit!

431
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,168
-Oh, wait!
-What happened?

432
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:28,099
We'll go ahead, Andy.
We're taking these to your house.

433
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,142
Okay.

434
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,686
Don't worry.
Snakes around here aren't venomous.

435
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,021
They're constrictors.

436
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,025
I'm sorry about what happened.

437
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,695
Don't worry about it.

438
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,739
-It's pretty big.
-What?

439
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,284
You've gotten pretty big!

440
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,329
I mean, you've changed.
You're so manly now.

441
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,213
I'm sorry, but… do we know each other?

442
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,508
Seriously? It's me! Zuri!

443
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,011
Oh, sorry.

444
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,514
Yeah. It's me, Zuri.

445
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,809
No, I said "sorry."

446
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,646
I can't seem to remember. I have…

447
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,190
amnesia.

448
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,322
Let's go.

449
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,117
What?

450
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,956
You want to stay here
to be with my nephew?

451
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,374
Why?

452
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,752
Andy's my ex.

453
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,880
Ex?

454
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,051
You mean we were lovers?

455
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,886
Yes, we were, Andy.

456
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,849
It's been ten years since we broke up.

457
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:02,986
Andy?

458
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,113
Hey.

459
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,574
This is normal for him.

460
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,658
Sit down.

461
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,119
-Actually, stand up.
-Stand up?

462
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,747
Wait. If you were really
together, tell me…

463
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,999
What's his full name?

464
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,544
Andres Tolentino dela Resma.

465
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,088
What's his middle name and how old is he?

466
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,756
Tolentino, like I said.

467
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,928
And we're the same age, so…
he should be 35 years old.

468
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,263
Very good!

469
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,474
But you're really here
to get laid with Andy, right?

470
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,851
Oh, my!

471
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,811
Oh, no, you got the chair!

472
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,522
I lost the game of Musical Chairs.

473
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,648
Were we playing?

474
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,734
Yes, it's my favorite game.

475
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,861
Oh, really?

476
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,404
But don't try to fool me!

477
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,531
Tell me.

478
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,451
You came to lay with Andy, didn't you?

479
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,244
-Oh, my!
-Wait!

480
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:57,707
I mean, you plan to lay a scam on Andy.

481
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,127
Can't you just let me finish?
I can't let it all out.

482
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,129
My daughter here

483
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:06,382
told me that a bunch of scammers
approached them in Manila.

484
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,344
And according to Andy's description
of the leader…

485
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,429
-Yes?
-…you're a perfect match.

486
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,851
-Why?
-What is it?

487
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:24,233
Andy can't stop thinking about me.

488
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,488
But if you've been apart for so long,
why did you come back?

489
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,621
I came because…

490
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,669
Because I still love him.

491
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,547
I came back because…

492
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,884
I want us to get back together and…

493
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,804
I want to un-ex him.

494
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,013
-Un-ex?
-Un-ex?

495
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,061
Madam Mameng, by un-ex, I mean…

496
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,106
I want to undo us being exes.

497
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,774
For us to get back together.

498
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,402
To un-"ex" him.

499
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,532
Oh, dear…

500
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:16,744
The thing is, it will take time

501
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,956
for Andy to process this
because of his amnesia.

502
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,794
And here at Sitio Halupi,

503
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,547
we don't believe in rushing things.

504
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,261
But don't worry. This is fine with me.

505
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,679
-Mom!
-You can stay.

506
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,597
-Mom.
-Okay?

507
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,850
Thank you.

508
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,518
-But, Mom…
-Yes, it's fine.

509
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,395
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

510
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,482
Mom…

511
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,401
Bestie?

512
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,198
Bestie?

513
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,326
Bestie?

514
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,913
Bestie? There you are!

515
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,416
Bestie! You know…

516
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,837
they use archaic words here.

517
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,257
My Filipino skills are being tested.
Believe me when I tell you.

518
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,009
Hold on a minute.

519
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:17,305
So you played them into thinking
that you came back

520
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,892
to rekindle your romance with Andy?

521
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,061
-Oh, no.
-You must be hustler of the year.

522
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,316
Bestie, I didn't bring enough medicine.

523
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,903
Hello?

524
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,238
Zuri?

525
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,574
Hey! Hey…

526
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,326
Wait! Don't hang up.

527
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,661
There!

528
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,997
I said I didn't bring enough medicine.

529
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,834
Bestie, why don't you just
come back to Manila?

530
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,712
He might not even understand
in his condition.

531
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,548
You can't rattle him or rush him.

532
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,051
You need to be calm around him.

533
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,886
It's so confusing.

534
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,304
And then,

535
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,390
he needs to be
the first one to make a move.

536
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,810
Bestie, here's what I'll do.

537
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,896
I'll just spend as much time
as I can with Andy.

538
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,232
That way, he'll warm up to me.

539
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,399
After that…

540
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,444
he'll want to un-ex me.

541
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,696
And until…

542
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,740
he'll have sex with me.

543
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,702
Bestie?

544
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,454
Bestie?

545
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,805
I heard everything.

546
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,890
Madam Mameng! Please don't!

547
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,976
Here! Take a look. Here.

548
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,812
DAY AND NIGHT. REGINE. WOOH!

549
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,231
"Regine, Regine.
All-day all-night! Woooh!"

550
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,280
Do it again! Like Regine Velasquez.

551
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,115
Yes! That's it! That's exactly it!

552
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,534
Regine Velasquez! I'm a Regine fan.

553
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,537
And that's my favorite song of hers.

554
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,580
What's this?

555
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,747
A password.

556
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,958
-A password?
-Yes.

557
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,794
-For the Wi-Fi.
-You have Wi-Fi out here?

558
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,215
I bought one of those
cheap satellite dishes.

559
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,093
That's why people hang around.

560
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,053
I'm the only one here who has one.

561
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,471
Okay.

562
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,056
-You know, Zuri…
-Yes?

563
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,309
I'm rooting for you.

564
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,144
-What?
-Yeah.

565
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,938
You mean to spend time
with my nephew until

566
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,566
he gains confidence
to make his move on you.

567
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,406
I don't want Andy to go through

568
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:44,035
what I went through with Beybeh's dad.

569
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,496
To be left behind by love,

570
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,499
especially when love itself comes around.

571
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,420
-So…
-Yeah?

572
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,380
Zuri?

573
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,716
I want to thank you

574
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,303
for still loving my nephew,

575
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,349
even after all these years.

576
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,684
Thank you so much.

577
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,816
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

578
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,193
All right.

579
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,658
-Would you like some too?
-Oh, no. I'm fine.

580
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:29,038
Is everyone clear on our plan
for the next four months?

581
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,375
Every able man is assigned to farming.

582
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,920
And in our downtime,
we're to plant vegetables.

583
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,215
We are to take shifts
as the night's watch.

584
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,550
And our schedules are posted on the board.

585
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:45,012
And our weekly community cleaning
on Saturdays

586
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,764
must be done before noon.

587
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:52,311
If there are any concerns,
you may relay them to me.

588
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,479
Yes, sir.

589
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,690
Ma'am…

590
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:02,071
Aren't there government officers
to handle these things?

591
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:07,118
Oh, yes. Public officials
find it hard to drop by here.

592
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,412
It's mostly just us.

593
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,248
The head caretaker is taken in shifts.

594
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,375
It's Andy's turn right now.

595
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:20,923
Andy, there might be delays
in our supply imports.

596
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,719
We won't be able to repair our only boat
until the next week.

597
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:32,810
I think we can hold on
until those supplies arrive.

598
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,271
You all know we've been
through this before.

599
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,981
Is that something we'll forget?

600
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,274
-No!
-No!

601
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,525
Because?

602
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,653
-To forget, one must not!
-Not!

603
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,531
One must remember always!

604
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,701
-Always!
-All of Halupi will overcome!

605
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,077
-Overcome!
-Yes!

606
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,954
Thank you!

607
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,372
-Thank you, Andy!
-Thank you.

608
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,124
Welcome.

609
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,501
-Take care.
-Thanks, Andy.

610
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,926
Andy! I'm coming with you.

611
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,387
To where?

612
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,556
To plant the fields.

613
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,142
Teach me how to plant. Because, well…

614
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,769
Don't they say…

615
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,065
planting is no joke?

616
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,901
All right, sure.

617
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,444
-Sure. You can come.
-Really?

618
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,695
Okay, I'm coming.

619
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,946
There.

620
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,865
Oh, gosh…

621
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,158
Oh, my gosh.

622
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,701
So? Where do we start?

623
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,912
-By the, um…
-I'm ready.

624
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,538
By the big coconuts…

625
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,539
I mean, the…

626
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,417
-By the big plot that's wide and…
-Which plot?

627
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,710
-Plump!
-Where?

628
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,253
-The land is plump.
-Where?

629
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,797
-Over there!
-Show me!

630
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,591
-The path is wide enough for two.
-No, because…

631
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,511
-You have to show me where it is!
-I feel dizzy.

632
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,060
Are you sure you want to wear that?

633
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,561
Do you like it?

634
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,147
I'm worried you'll get a sunburn.

635
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,526
That's fine. I need the vitamins anyway.

636
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,194
-How does that work?
-This?

637
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,697
-Okay.
-Okay, point it this way.

638
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,325
-Okay, we're pointing it.
-Okay, it's pointing now.

639
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,743
-Ouch.
-Hey!

640
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,455
I want to dance!

641
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,249
-What?
-Yeah.

642
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,128
That hurts.

643
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,838
That hurts.

644
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,508
That hurts.

645
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,385
That hurts.

646
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,393
Yay!

647
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,872
Hey!

648
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,082
Zuri! Are you okay?

649
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,417
What happened? Hey!

650
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,016
Rice cakes for sale!

651
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,727
Rice cakes! Freshly made!

652
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,646
I told you to stop selling.
It doesn't suit you.

653
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,983
You'd be better off being a nun!

654
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,027
You'll grow old single anyway.

655
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,407
Hey!

656
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,492
What did you say?

657
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,996
What's wrong with growing old single?

658
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,206
It's better than you.

659
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,082
Body odor with human on top!

660
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,376
-Do you know what a bath is?
-Try it!

661
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,879
Stop eating so much and take a bath!

662
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,631
Mind your damn manners!

663
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,801
Let's go, Beybeh.

664
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,056
Go on ahead. Go on!

665
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,307
Go on, Beybeh.

666
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,353
Rice cakes!

667
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,817
You're good at cleaning.

668
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,243
-Andy!
-Hey!

669
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,495
-Zuri!
-I have something for you.

670
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,539
Beybeh was supposed to do that.

671
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,166
It's fine. I wasn't busy anyway.

672
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,376
It's all right.

673
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,295
I'll just put this here.

674
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,922
-Have a seat.
-No, I'm okay.

675
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,173
I'm okay.

676
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,341
Are you sure?

677
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,052
Oh, no, it's…

678
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,763
This is nothing.

679
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,014
Did a bug crawl up?

680
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,224
Oh, no! No.

681
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,519
It's probably just my clothes.

682
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,104
-Oh, my!
-Oh!

683
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,939
Hey! What are you two doing?

684
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,941
It's…

685
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,693
Ouch!

686
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,906
Something's itching in my clothes.

687
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,242
A bug crawled up in there. But…

688
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,785
It's gone now!

689
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,954
How about you?

690
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,040
-I just need to sit down.
-All right.

691
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,251
Do you want a cup?

692
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,294
-What?
-Coffee?

693
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,503
-Coffee?
-Coffee.

694
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,754
-Sure.
-Want one?

695
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:11,797
-Yes.
-Coffee?

696
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,465
-Let's have coffee.
-Coffee?

697
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:19,722
Neighbors, our pest problem
is getting worse

698
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,223
because of those birds.

699
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,226
And the pesticides are still delayed.

700
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:33,861
Excuse me, but I believe I have
a temporary solution.

701
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,916
She's been at it for days.

702
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,168
Being a scarecrow.

703
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,378
I'm getting worried for Zuri.

704
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,422
Come play with us!

705
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,342
The pesticides have arrived.
I'll tell her.

706
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,219
-Be careful, Andy.
-Hurry.

707
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,640
Everything's fine now.

708
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,099
Leave her alone now.

709
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,517
Go on ahead.

710
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,478
-Are we good?
-We're good.

711
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,235
-Ouch!
-Are you okay?

712
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,320
Yeah!

713
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,780
Can you walk?

714
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,281
Let's go?

715
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,284
-How many?
-Just one.

716
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,078
I'll take that.

717
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,288
-Thank you!
-Here, baby!

718
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,956
Say "ah."

719
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,625
Baby?

720
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,462
Why are you so put off by romance?

721
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,632
-They'll break up in no time.
-Hey!

722
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,760
True love doesn't really last.

723
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:44,181
If it did, then I'd still have a dad.

724
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,808
But, no.

725
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,310
He left us for somebody else's.

726
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,522
I've already forgotten what love is.

727
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:57,903
Well, what do you think about me and Andy?

728
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,739
To be honest,

729
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,075
I'm starting to think
you're a good person.

730
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,701
But kind of stupid…

731
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,287
Sometimes.

732
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,081
But good at heart.

733
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:14,461
Though, I'm still not sure
if you'll be a good mom or wife.

734
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,340
Well, I wouldn't know for sure.

735
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,426
But I know this.

736
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:24,179
If you two actually end up together,
you better not have children.

737
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,683
You know, Beybeh…

738
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,770
women like us are really lucky because

739
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,983
we get to bring children into the world.

740
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:40,404
Children we can love

741
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,865
and love us back in return,

742
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,992
who'll never leave us.

743
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,119
Children leave their parents all the time.

744
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,329
So you plan to leave your mom?

745
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,539
I'd never leave Mom!

746
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,333
I could never do that to her.

747
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,295
I don't think I can.

748
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,591
And if I ever move out of the house,

749
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,593
I'd visit her every day.

750
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,137
I love my mom.

751
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,933
I'm not about to leave or forget her
like my dad did.

752
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,271
Neighbors!

753
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,649
My neighbors, a newcomer has arrived!

754
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,443
A newcomer?

755
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,533
-That's him.
-Thank you, sir.

756
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,077
Who's here? Excuse us.

757
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,329
Excuse me.

758
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,705
Coming through.

759
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,248
-It's nice out here.
-Who's…

760
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,543
-Brian?
-She knows him.

761
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,628
Zuri?

762
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,424
What are you doing here?

763
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,467
Wow.

764
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,137
Can't you even ask
how I am or how my trip was?

765
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,389
I even brought you your medicine.

766
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,183
I got you your cream and stuff.

767
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,644
Okay, fine…

768
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,395
I know him.

769
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,480
Yes!

770
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,066
He's a relative. A distant relative.

771
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,360
He came all the way from Manila.

772
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,362
Andy, this is Brian.

773
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,613
Andy!

774
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:05,781
Hello.

775
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,242
This is Madam Mameng.

776
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,494
-This is Bri.
-Madam Mameng.

777
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,455
-Zuri, have you seen…
-What?

778
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,416
There's another reason I'm here.

779
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,543
What?

780
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,214
Seems he likes the older ones.

781
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,425
-Excuse me.
-Oh, wow.

782
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,512
The kid has a thing for the mature.

783
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,222
Me?

784
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,807
Excuse me, ma'am.

785
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,860
Good afternoon, Beybeh.

786
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,654
I'm Bri.

787
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,285
We've already met in Manila.

788
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,683
Mom!

789
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,684
Mom!

790
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,894
I don't understand what's happening.

791
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,106
What's with him?

792
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,232
What?

793
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,152
Hey, Brian!

794
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,988
You came all the way here for Beybeh?

795
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,489
Really? Beybeh?

796
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:33,243
I have feelings for Beybeh.
Strong feelings.

797
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,369
Right here!

798
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,829
So you think you're in love?

799
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:38,498
Yes, Zuri. I'm sure about this.

800
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,626
I want take this chance.

801
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,717
Why do you dislike love so much?

802
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,927
I don't hate it. I just don't care.

803
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,222
I'm indifferent. That's it.

804
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,018
I think… I don't know,
I just don't believe in it.

805
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,436
Okay, fine.

806
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,229
Let's agree to disagree.

807
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,316
This is from your doctor, Zuri.

808
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,568
Your results.

809
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,921
These results aren't good.
I have to fast-track my plan.

810
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,508
What's that?

811
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,468
Come on! It's coming!

812
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,012
You're almost there! Come on!

813
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,891
Push!

814
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,477
-Almost there!
-Come on!

815
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,603
It's coming!

816
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,150
Hey! I'm in labor here!

817
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,902
-She's giving birth!
-Oh, yes!

818
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,487
Push! One, two, three!

819
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,280
Push!

820
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,117
You're almost there!

821
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,828
Get me my sterile tools!

822
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:58,995
Get the tools!

823
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,163
Hurry up!

824
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,124
Hand them to me, now!

825
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,166
Excuse me, move it!

826
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,544
Hurry up! Give them to me!

827
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,922
Okay, push! Push!

828
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,928
This is your fault!

829
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,012
Ouch, Cathy!

830
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,932
I'm not Pablo.
But if this is helping, go ahead!

831
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,058
Go ahead!

832
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,146
It's helping! Keep doing it!

833
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,439
Push!

834
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,447
One more! One, two, three!

835
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,993
-There it is! It's out!
-It's out!

836
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,036
-Hand me the towels!
-Towel!

837
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,329
Here.

838
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,498
-Give them to me.
-Please pass it.

839
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,544
Here.

840
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,798
Still a bit dirty.

841
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,594
There, take it easy.

842
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,061
Lay it down.

843
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,398
There.

844
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,068
Being a mom suits you.

845
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,496
Madam Mameng, here.

846
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,542
Being a grandma suits you.

847
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,631
Are you trying to say I'm old?

848
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,512
Yes. You're right.

849
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,764
See what happened last night?

850
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,976
That's how lucky women can be.

851
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,603
That's what I meant.

852
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,355
Hey, Zuri.

853
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,773
Hey!

854
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,859
You know, carrying a baby
really suits you.

855
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,903
Really, Andy? Do you want one?

856
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,196
Want what?

857
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,661
I meant…

858
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,664
If you want me playing with Cathy's baby.

859
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,458
Yeah, it suits you.

860
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:34,734
Bri!

861
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,030
Andy?

862
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,532
Oh, Zuri.

863
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,535
You know, when you're cutting wood,

864
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,079
you have to hit it with all you've got.

865
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,373
Imagine, the girl you really like.

866
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,126
Because I think there's a girl
you're really into.

867
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,463
Think about that girl
when you're hitting it.

868
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,340
Let it motivate you.

869
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,595
Okay?

870
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,013
Right?

871
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,222
Okay, Andy. Thanks.

872
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,016
Zuri, let me help you with that.

873
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,059
We're fine, Bri. Let's go!

874
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,938
Take care!

875
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,066
-I did well, right?
-I don't know.

876
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,781
Andy!

877
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,451
There you are.

878
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,538
What's that?

879
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,128
It's my dream home.

880
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:39,090
One day, I'll build it here
in our paradise of a town.

881
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,093
Of course, I'd be with…

882
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,471
my future wife.

883
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,978
You know, this town actually is paradise.

884
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,104
Sitio Halupi.

885
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,066
But there are some things missing.

886
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,320
We're happy with what we have.

887
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,948
We lack most things.

888
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:07,410
But when one needs something,
another is eager to share.

889
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,246
Much like a family.

890
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,499
That's enough for us.

891
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,460
You know, Andy…

892
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,757
lives could be much better
for people in Halupi.

893
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:24,135
But I can feel you're already
contented with this.

894
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:33,520
I think you feel like
the world has forgotten you,

895
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,604
because…

896
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,733
you've stopped wanting
good things for yourselves.

897
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:46,032
And if you really think of yourselves
as a big family…

898
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,703
then enough is a low bar.

899
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:54,207
Each and every family… Any kind of family…

900
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,292
deserves more than enough.

901
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,297
So, I thought of a plan…

902
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,926
to put you all back on the map.

903
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,231
Zuri? What are these?

904
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,784
Rice cakes for sale!

905
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:30,910
Hi, there!

906
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,799
That's non-LoD.

907
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,968
What?

908
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,681
Don't you mean non-CoD?

909
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:56,478
Non-LoD stands for non-Love-on-Demand.

910
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,109
Where else are you going?

911
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,824
-It's working.
-It's working?

912
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:10,909
Yeah.

913
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,245
We finally have a
stronger Wi-Fi connection!

914
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,533
We'll have a ceremony

915
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:55,787
to celebrate the opening of the bridge

916
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,373
from the coast to the center.

917
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:02,043
This bridge is from
MoliNapoles Construction.

918
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:05,547
-Long live, Captain Zuri!
-Long live!

919
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:10,218
Now, the town will be able
to dream of greater things.

920
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,803
Being content is great.

921
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,974
But I think it's better
to improve continually.

922
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:19,936
And from now on,
the world will not forget Sitio Halupi!

923
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,493
My glasses!

924
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,597
You're stepping on the broom.

925
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,140
-Move, Bri!
-Sorry.

926
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,392
-No, it's fine!
-I'm sorry. So sorry.

927
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,435
It's fine.

928
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,020
Go back to what you were doing.

929
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,105
I just needed the broom.

930
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,566
-Excuse me.
-Let me do that.

931
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,109
No, it's fine!

932
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,154
Hey!

933
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:16,159
I just got an email
about my job application.

934
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,786
I thought they already ignored it.

935
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,747
You applied for work, Andy?

936
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:22,832
It's not like that.

937
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,167
I was just trying it out.

938
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,753
It's the first time we have
a good Internet out here.

939
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,671
It's nothing serious.

940
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,758
Actually, the most serious thing here

941
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,219
is you pursuing
and winning my cousin over.

942
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,929
This is a very serious matter.

943
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,973
What about you?
When do you plan to formally court Zuri?

944
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,475
Ruben, you're here.

945
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,185
I didn't know you were with us.

946
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:47,440
Andy, she came all the way here
to rekindle the past!

947
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,568
That's the kind of love that never fades.

948
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:54,864
A lover who never forgets

949
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,951
holds a love that never lets go.

950
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,246
So don't let her go.

951
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:05,917
Or else,
love itself will leave you behind.

952
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,880
When night falls,
I shall make it official.

953
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,800
How so, Andy?

954
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,635
We'll discuss it as we dine.

955
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,637
Let's go.

956
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,766
Zuri!

957
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,393
Zuri!

958
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:26,062
Zuri! Come quick! Come out here!

959
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,772
Hurry!

960
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,816
Hurry up!

961
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,527
Hurry up!

962
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:39,951
Come here!

963
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,497
Come closer.

964
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:57,844
Wow!

965
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:03,391
My lady… Zuri Yolanda Soriano…

966
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:08,187
May I serenade you tonight?

967
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,024
-Yes!
-Yes!

968
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,301
Someone to love

969
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:41,471
Anyone who has feelings must have

970
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,515
Someone to love

971
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:48,061
Just like you and I

972
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:51,439
Who have feelings for each other

973
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:55,526
Feelings of love

974
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,113
And now love each other with

975
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,033
Feelings that are true

976
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,540
And that is why

977
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:13,044
I am filled with joy

978
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:16,422
By your

979
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:20,093
True love

980
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,721
The beauty of everything

981
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,224
I see in you

982
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,977
In your shining eyes

983
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,898
In your supple lips

984
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:37,235
And character, without question

985
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:40,571
Wrapped up in

986
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,449
A charm, a body

987
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:48,621
That is real

988
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:54,001
Yes, Brian Soriano,
I allow you to court me.

989
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,170
Nice!

990
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,133
Yes!

991
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,135
Then I formally court you,

992
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,304
my lady, Teresita Dela Resma,

993
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:10,977
Every day, until we are together.

994
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,774
My lady, Zuri Yolanda Soriano,

995
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:21,028
may I formally court you?

996
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:25,199
That I may relay my heart's true desire?

997
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:30,371
And day by day, earn your sweet approval?

998
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,420
Say yes, Zuri.

999
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,677
Hurry up! Say yes!

1000
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:46,763
Go!

1001
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,600
Yes, Andy.

1002
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,226
Nice!

1003
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,269
Oh, my!

1004
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,937
How exciting!

1005
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,523
Thank you!

1006
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,693
I'm so happy for you!

1007
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:01,736
Mom!

1008
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:02,779
What?

1009
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,405
Your underwear!

1010
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,615
What?

1011
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:06,699
Your panties!

1012
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,576
What panties?

1013
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,119
Oh, no! My panties!

1014
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,621
Sorry, it's really loose.

1015
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,664
The garter's old. Yeah, so old.

1016
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,751
-Why not help me instead?
-My gosh, Mom. So embarrassing.

1017
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,461
The garter's old.

1018
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,005
That's why it's cold.

1019
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,131
Let's go home.

1020
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,174
Bye.

1021
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,176
Mommy, put some baby powder on him.

1022
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,887
-He's been playing all day. Bye, Frank!
-Bye!

1023
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:32,934
Oh, Madam Mameng.

1024
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,690
-What is it?
-Nothing.

1025
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:40,942
I'm just happy.

1026
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,360
It's nice to see that you

1027
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:45,780
work and take care of children
at the same time.

1028
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,950
You'll make a great mother.

1029
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,370
-Really?
-Oh, no question!

1030
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,872
Oh, dear.

1031
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:58,668
You know,
if you and Andy really get together,

1032
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:03,130
that would make me
the happiest aunt in the world!

1033
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,799
So happy.

1034
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,137
Oh, dear.

1035
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,648
-Madam Mameng?
-Yes?

1036
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,984
I'm curious about something.

1037
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:28,906
How did Andy get amnesia?

1038
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:36,372
To be honest, I don't
know the whole story.

1039
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:41,085
All they said is,
after he came back from Spain,

1040
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,462
he had an accident.

1041
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:48,342
So, with my limited resources,

1042
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,386
I tried to cure him of it.

1043
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,848
He cries a lot.

1044
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:57,226
He says there's no hope
for people like him.

1045
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:00,146
In love and in life.

1046
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:03,858
Until…

1047
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,321
you came along!

1048
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,531
No, really!

1049
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,534
When you came along, it's like…

1050
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,872
the old Andy came back.
The one before he went abroad.

1051
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:22,668
The old Andy before the accident.

1052
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:26,797
The old Andy who could dream.

1053
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:32,386
The old Andy who fought,
no matter how hard it got.

1054
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:38,643
The old Andy came back when you came back.

1055
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,063
So, thank you.

1056
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:46,484
Thank you so much!

1057
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,656
Oh, dear, there I go again.

1058
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,991
I'm so happy, I teared up.

1059
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:00,831
Thank you so much.

1060
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,799
Wait. That serenade was just

1061
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,511
to formally ask to court you?

1062
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:16,555
Yes, that's what they do.
They really take their time.

1063
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,934
You know, I don't know
what annoys you more.

1064
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:22,395
The slowness of what's
happening to you there

1065
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:26,315
or the speed at which love
has burst into your heart

1066
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,900
that you've long been denying.

1067
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,027
I'm not! What are you talking about?

1068
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,990
Bestie, I'm feeling guilty.

1069
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,785
I'm feeling deep guilt.

1070
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:41,038
Then go back to Manila
and visit your doctor.

1071
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,332
Continue with the medication.

1072
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:46,335
I'll just fast-track my plans. Okay?

1073
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,630
He's formally courting me now, anyway.

1074
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,633
That makes it easier
for me to get what I want.

1075
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,969
So, you're going to fool him more?

1076
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,596
You know, if you were a guy,

1077
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,433
I would have already
beat you up! Seriously!

1078
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,226
There's no point. I'm already here!

1079
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,103
You're all talk, you know?

1080
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,063
Okay, bye.

1081
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,608
Andy!

1082
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,236
Thank God, you're here. Can you help me?

1083
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,280
-Sure, what…
-It's…

1084
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,073
the hook on my bra…

1085
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,410
-Okay.
-I can't seem to get it on.

1086
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:21,620
Take a look.

1087
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,164
-Oh.
-Look.

1088
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,666
-Is this it?
-Yeah.

1089
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,085
-Do I hook it on?
-Yeah.

1090
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,337
There. I need them aligned.

1091
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,547
Go ahead.

1092
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,132
There.

1093
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,386
-Andy!
-What is it?

1094
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,263
I just remembered something funny.

1095
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:43,100
Did you know that the old Tagalog

1096
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,894
-for bra is…
-Yeah?

1097
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,105
"Boob holder."

1098
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:53,319
I didn't know that. I'll fix this.

1099
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,446
-Do you want to hold them?
-What?

1100
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,622
Would you like to come to my room?
Just the two of us.

1101
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:06,749
Okay.

1102
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,086
Okay.

1103
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,387
We're alone today.

1104
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:26,018
Because Auntie Mameng, Beybeh and Bri

1105
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,729
went to Ruben's to treat his sprain.

1106
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,278
-Are you ready?
-For a long time.

1107
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:46,539
So you prefer the lights on.

1108
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:09,812
Are these all me, Andy?

1109
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,357
There are so many!

1110
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,612
There are so many!

1111
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,156
Zuri…

1112
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,036
Even if this thing can't remember…

1113
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,582
this one will never forget.

1114
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,796
Let me prove to you

1115
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:41,594
that I can rightfully be
your husband and lover.

1116
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:44,638
And father to your children.

1117
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:52,354
I can better myself.
I'll find work and fix myself.

1118
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:56,483
I'll work hard
to prove to you that I'm right…

1119
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,452
Zuri!

1120
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,662
Zuri, thank you.

1121
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,831
Thank you for the kiss.

1122
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,708
But I won't take advantage of you.

1123
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,543
I don't want to because…

1124
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,171
-We're not going steady yet…
-We're going steady.

1125
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:18,589
Really?

1126
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:19,798
-Yes, we are.
-We are?

1127
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,717
-You're my girlfriend?
-Yes!

1128
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,010
Thank you!

1129
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:24,762
Thank you!

1130
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:25,888
Thank you, Zuri!

1131
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,432
Don't worry. I'll prove to you everyday

1132
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:31,143
that I deserve your love.

1133
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,229
Please stay there. Stay there!

1134
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,105
I just need to get something.

1135
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:58,462
Oh.

1136
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:03,008
Sorry, but this is all I could prepare…

1137
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,554
for our first date.

1138
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,098
That's all right.

1139
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,976
I think it's cute, actually.

1140
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:18,107
It's a sweet way to
celebrate our un-exing.

1141
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:19,984
Un-ex?

1142
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,568
Un-ex!

1143
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,154
It means that we're no longer

1144
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,949
each other's exes
because we're together again.

1145
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,043
For my ex,

1146
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:42,172
who's no longer my ex, because…

1147
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,383
she un-exed me.

1148
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:03,193
This one was my first sketch of you.

1149
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:07,448
Even though I didn't know
whose face it was,

1150
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:10,868
I always felt that she was important

1151
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,078
and special to me.

1152
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,624
I still remember my dream.

1153
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:21,712
In that dream, everything was a blur

1154
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:24,882
except for your face.

1155
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:30,763
-I could see it clearly.
-Wait!

1156
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,265
-You're in Spain?
-Babe.

1157
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,642
The flight was so sudden!

1158
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:39,313
And they took my phone away!

1159
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:40,814
Okay, let's do this, then.

1160
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:44,693
Since you're already there,
let's break up.

1161
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,032
You were talking a lot.

1162
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:52,826
But I couldn't remember
what you said in the dream.

1163
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,206
And I had another dream.

1164
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:02,544
I remember letters and postcards.

1165
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:07,174
But even in that dream,

1166
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:09,593
the only thing
I could remember was your face.

1167
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,930
You were smiling.

1168
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,433
I think I was writing them for you.

1169
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,021
I had another dream,
but it was a little different.

1170
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,315
I was holding my cell phone

1171
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,109
and I was running…

1172
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,612
but your face was still there.

1173
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,908
And then, my vision went black.

1174
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:39,790
But even in the dark,
I could see your face.

1175
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,463
It was my only light.

1176
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,891
Wait, I'm remembering something…

1177
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,404
Zuri!

1178
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:17,870
Zuri!

1179
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,413
Zuri, what happened?

1180
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:36,096
You had that accident
because I broke up with you…

1181
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,516
on that video call.

1182
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:42,895
And then…

1183
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:49,109
I burned all your letters and postcards.

1184
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:53,989
And I blocked you
so you couldn't contact me.

1185
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,909
Your story reminded me of all of that.

1186
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:00,829
What?

1187
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:07,377
Your story about

1188
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:11,173
being excited…

1189
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,052
and that you wanted to go to me,

1190
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:18,972
that's the day you had an accident.

1191
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,271
You must've been
on your way back home to see me.

1192
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,357
And then you got hit by a car.

1193
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,776
Andy, if not for me…

1194
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,822
you could have had a better life.

1195
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,252
I don't care about that anymore, Zuri.

1196
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,422
What matters is what's here and now.

1197
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:54,383
You and me!

1198
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:58,512
Fate brought us back together

1199
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:01,056
-so we could have a second chance!
-Andy.

1200
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:04,101
I have a rare condition.

1201
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:10,399
My egg cells are dying
at an alarming rate.

1202
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,443
I came here because…

1203
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:16,905
I wanted to get pregnant.

1204
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:23,537
But now you know, maybe you could help me.

1205
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,955
Even if it's for one night.

1206
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,375
Get me pregnant.

1207
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:32,879
Just one night.

1208
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,464
Okay?

1209
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:37,384
Get me pregnant.

1210
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,763
You don't have to support us financially.

1211
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,640
It's fine.

1212
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:45,267
I can take care of things.

1213
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:49,021
You know, I really didn't mean
for us to get back together.

1214
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:53,317
I didn't want you to fall in love with me,
or for me to fall for you.

1215
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,486
I just want you
to get me pregnant. Please?

1216
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:07,039
You remembered me

1217
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,749
because your uterus is dying?

1218
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,633
Do you mean that…

1219
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:21,470
the entire time you were here…

1220
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:28,935
-So you never loved me?
-Andy…

1221
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:36,777
Everyone who has ever said
they loved me, has left me.

1222
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,072
They all say the same thing!

1223
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,741
So, my heart's all gone. It's gone!

1224
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:45,410
I don't believe in love anymore.
All I need is a child.

1225
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,913
All I need is a child.

1226
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,999
A child who'll take care of me,

1227
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,377
who I can take care of,
who will never leave me!

1228
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,586
I just need a child!

1229
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,338
A child is all I need, Andy.

1230
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:10,811
I hope…

1231
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,815
one day, your child will be proud of you.

1232
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,238
Proud of her mother
who broke other people's hearts.

1233
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,577
A mother who doesn't know how to love.

1234
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,876
Do you know why you can't love?

1235
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:37,921
Do you know why?

1236
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,007
Because you're too scared to try.

1237
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:51,143
I hope you never feel how I feel.

1238
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:56,273
To forget how love feels.

1239
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:38,083
WELCOME TO
SITIO HALUBI

1240
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:24,004
That's enough.

1241
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:25,922
I said, that's enough!

1242
01:21:27,173 --> 01:21:30,218
That's enough…

1243
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,471
-That's enough…
-Aunt…

1244
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,824
It's like a premature menopause.

1245
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,827
And that's why
you're experiencing frequent…

1246
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:09,633
It's a good thing
you've had your eggs frozen!

1247
01:22:12,802 --> 01:22:17,098
Your crazy Sitio Halupi trip
has done something good for you.

1248
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:21,811
Maybe.

1249
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,613
Get one more thing frozen,

1250
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:33,573
and you'll make Elsa feel insecure.

1251
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,283
That's a little much, Doc.

1252
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,660
Sorry.

1253
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:46,753
What about your desire
to have your own child?

1254
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:47,963
Have you let that go?

1255
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,214
Not at all, Doc.

1256
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:53,385
I'll get back to that
when I'm ready to have a child.

1257
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,606
Thank you, Doc. Thank you.

1258
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,318
They were beside your frozen eggs.

1259
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,945
What was that, Doc?

1260
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:16,992
Happy Halloween, Doc.

1261
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,084
Yes, your balance with us is settled.

1262
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,963
Sir, what about the bridge?

1263
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,216
Okay.

1264
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:35,260
Yes.

1265
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:40,265
I just need to double-check the schedule
then I'll get back to you.

1266
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,143
Okay, thank you, sir.

1267
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:50,150
Bestie, are you sure you're okay to work?

1268
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:52,610
-Yeah.
-No symptoms kicking in?

1269
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,405
They're just symptoms.
I can kick their asses.

1270
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:57,991
That's my bestie!

1271
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:00,785
You'll be godmother to my baby.
That's next month.

1272
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,705
What if I kick your ass instead?

1273
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,457
-Hey!
-I'm kidding!

1274
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,042
-I'm kidding.
-That was harsh.

1275
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,209
I'm kidding.

1276
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:11,421
Zuri, I just want to remind you

1277
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:13,465
of our groundbreaking event next month.

1278
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:18,303
Oh, no, seems like it's the same time
as your godchild's christening?

1279
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:21,473
Well, if you can't come…

1280
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:22,974
Zuri?

1281
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:26,061
At least approve my paternal leave.
Come on!

1282
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,316
I can never read you.

1283
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:32,567
You've got your leave.

1284
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:35,445
Let's go.

1285
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:08,728
On behalf of our beneficent
Mayor Leonora Teresa,

1286
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:13,942
I, Captain Nonits Bascunias,

1287
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:17,028
give our heartfelt thanks

1288
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:20,907
to Mr. Tolits Moli-Napoles.

1289
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:25,286
On this site will rise
the bridge to Sitio Halupi!

1290
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:33,628
We also give our heartfelt gratitude

1291
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:37,048
to Ms. Zuri Yolanda Soriano

1292
01:25:37,757 --> 01:25:38,842
and to Movex.

1293
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:42,971
Without her, this wouldn't be possible.

1294
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:56,442
I'm just going to see Beybeh.

1295
01:25:57,902 --> 01:26:00,029
Hey, go ahead.

1296
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:14,586
Beybeh,

1297
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:19,090
you're all I think about, day and night.

1298
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:22,844
-I have dreams about you.
-Hey.

1299
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:24,429
Don't use that song!

1300
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:26,347
It's getting old.

1301
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,099
But, seriously, Beybeh,

1302
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,310
I hope that

1303
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:34,272
you'll let me continue courting you.

1304
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:37,692
When the bridge is done,

1305
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:40,695
I'll see you every day.

1306
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:45,116
And I won't stop until we're together.

1307
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:49,829
You idiot.

1308
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:54,167
Have you eaten yet?

1309
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,962
Maybe we could eat at the banquet.

1310
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,088
Okay.

1311
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,049
Which way?

1312
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:03,218
Mom, come eat with us.

1313
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:04,677
I'll come with you.

1314
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:38,795
You look different.

1315
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:42,423
Just a little.

1316
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:47,387
A lot has changed with me, Andy.

1317
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:58,856
I'm going to see Mr. Tolits' engineers.

1318
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,108
Want to come?

1319
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:04,320
I'm fine. I have to pack.

1320
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,324
Where are you off to?

1321
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:10,743
To…

1322
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,287
To Germany.

1323
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:15,957
I got a job as a wheat farmer there.

1324
01:28:22,505 --> 01:28:23,923
Oh, yeah.

1325
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:28,094
Madam Mameng mentioned
you were applying for jobs.

1326
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,223
When are you leaving?

1327
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:38,521
I'll leave town tomorrow.

1328
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,150
But I'm flying to Germany in three weeks.

1329
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:56,414
You know,
you'll be learning a new language.

1330
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,168
I already know a little.

1331
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,628
Some German.

1332
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:05,965
Auf Wiedersehen.

1333
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:13,264
Doesn't that mean…

1334
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:15,516
"goodbye"?

1335
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,062
Kind of.

1336
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:21,856
What it really means is,

1337
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:25,651
"Until we meet again."

1338
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:43,294
Thank you for…

1339
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:47,882
hurting me.

1340
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:51,052
And also…

1341
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:56,599
for making me believe you un-exed me.

1342
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:08,152
The…

1343
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:10,696
The pain?

1344
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,074
I won't forget it.

1345
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:18,830
But… I might have needed that.

1346
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:23,668
Because it made me remember things.

1347
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:28,923
It all started when

1348
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:33,427
I showed you all of those sketches.

1349
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:37,223
Really? What did you remember?

1350
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:39,600
Things like…

1351
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,604
when we first met.

1352
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,652
How I first…

1353
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:52,572
pursued you.

1354
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,659
And…

1355
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:01,455
why I fell in love with you.

1356
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,301
But don't worry.

1357
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:17,597
My memories won't bother you anymore.

1358
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:22,226
All I'll be thinking about

1359
01:31:23,102 --> 01:31:26,230
is how I can grow in Germany.

1360
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:36,616
Andy?

1361
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:48,336
Even if I wanted to ask forgiveness

1362
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:53,132
for everything I did to you…

1363
01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:57,136
I know that would never be enough.

1364
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:03,559
So, thank you.

1365
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:09,190
For teaching me how to love.

1366
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:12,693
This is it.

1367
01:32:14,403 --> 01:32:15,404
This feeling.

1368
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:18,449
So, this is what love is.

1369
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,328
To surrender.

1370
01:32:23,162 --> 01:32:24,205
To let go.

1371
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:27,124
To be set free.

1372
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:38,427
So, then…

1373
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:41,305
How do you say it?

1374
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:45,393
-Auf…
-Wiedersehen.

1375
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:47,144
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Auf Wiedersehen.

1376
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,233
Auf Wiedersehen… ex.

1377
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,742
Until we meet again…

1378
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:04,745
ex.
