1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,517
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:01,853
Ro-eum?

3
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,230
Who is it?

4
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,900
What the heck did you do?

5
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,359
A con.

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,778
Why?

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,738
It's what I do.

8
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,992
What did you do
while I was getting this back?

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,079
Did you cry 4 liters of tears?

10
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,876
Who's at the door?

11
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,639
Hey, Mr. Attorney Han.

12
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,182
Who is that?

13
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,226
I need to talk to you.

14
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,819
How did you get all this?

15
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,573
Han Moo-young.

16
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,784
If you don't come out,
I'll break in.

17
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,619
Hurry up.

18
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,169
Woah.

19
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,213
What now?

20
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:16,219
Do you realize you are very strange
Mr. Han?

21
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,014
You're the strangest attorney
I know.

22
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,015
Excuse me?

23
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,058
What?

24
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,728
I wonder why you are

25
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,648
so out of breath?

26
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,942
Oh.

27
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,611
I was cleaning up in a rush.

28
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,946
The house was a mess.

29
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,030
Because of me?

30
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,198
To invite me inside?

31
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,116
What?

32
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,326
I did carve out my busy time

33
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,370
to bring you home from the ER,

34
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,329
so

35
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,832
the least you could do
is have a beer with me.

36
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,917
I can't. I have to go to work tomorrow.

37
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,586
Exactly, that's tomorrow.

38
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,880
Do you have beer at home?

39
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,715
Excuse me.

40
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,593
Why were you cleaning
in the dark?

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,095
Wow, Tron.

42
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,973
As expected from a lawyer.
Is this the dressing room?

43
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,309
No, no, no. Let's go out
and get some beer.

44
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,518
You don't have any at home?

45
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,811
No. I don't drink.

46
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,104
Then…

47
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,982
You do have beer.

48
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,610
A lot.

49
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,750
Mr. Han…

50
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,588
Are you…

51
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,216
A heavy drinker?

52
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,885
Wow, nice.

53
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,059
Four, twelve.

54
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,528
Woah.

55
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,572
Bro.

56
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,368
I'm not your bro, you punk.

57
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,994
Is your last name Kim?

58
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,412
What?

59
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,456
What are you all doing here?

60
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,416
Is there a party going on?

61
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,002
Yes, there is.

62
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,712
You didn't know?

63
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,719
Why are you doing this to me?

64
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,390
The punks
you rounded up randomly

65
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,933
took my money and ran.

66
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,645
So, do you want to get beat up randomly?

67
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,063
Or beat up a ton?

68
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,691
I never met those guys before.

69
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,900
They just sold…

70
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,944
This is hilarious.

71
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:20,862
Hey.

72
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,488
He's putting on a performance.

73
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,199
Look at him trying so hard.

74
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,415
Huh?

75
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,668
Hey.

76
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,086
Dude.

77
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,171
Hey.

78
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,967
Hey.

79
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,928
Here's to your eyes.

80
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,641
LEE RO-EUM
FRUSTRATING

81
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,895
Why did you put the can down
without even taking a sip?

82
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,772
I'm the only one drinking here.

83
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,609
JUST HOLD ON A BIT.
I'LL MAKE SURE HE LEAVES SOON.

84
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,320
So tell me,

85
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,240
are you going to get
a new doctor or what?

86
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,035
Why are you so interested in my doctor?

87
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,620
Well,

88
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,414
a friend of mine is a psychiatrist.

89
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,708
I'm just saying you have to
choose the right person.

90
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,628
-Someone good and accurate.
-This isn't fortune-telling.

91
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,505
Right.

92
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,597
I WANT TO GO OUT

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,558
GANG IN THERE.
GO TO-HAN WILL BE LEAVING DOON.

94
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,520
When are you going to leave?

95
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,605
I

96
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,690
still don't get why it's called

97
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,984
calamari rings or potato rings.

98
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,240
What on earth are you talking about?

99
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,118
If your mind is all over the place,

100
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,661
does that mean you're a tree?

101
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,579
What?

102
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,248
It's all

103
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,084
because of parents.

104
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,087
What does that even mean?

105
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,714
Sheesh, Moo-young.

106
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,635
If you wanted to be friends,
you should've just said so.

107
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,471
When you wash your feet,

108
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,348
do you need a raccoon?

109
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,893
What are you talking about?

110
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,605
What if the East Sea
and Baekdu Mountain dry up?

111
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,803
So dizzy.

112
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,228
Pants…

113
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,230
Help me take them off.

114
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,526
-Take them off.
-Got it.

115
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,820
-Got it.
-Take them off.

116
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,238
Okay.

117
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,244
Got it.

118
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,734
Ro-eum?

119
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,949
-Hey.
-What?

120
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,158
You scared me.

121
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,160
What? What's going on?

122
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,454
Ro-eum?

123
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,123
You told me to wait.

124
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,378
Since when
did you start listening to me?

125
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,556
What?

126
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,518
-Her room…
-I asked Ro-eum.

127
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,187
We're in love.

128
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,064
What?

129
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,984
Water pipes burst at my place.

130
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,656
I'm leaving.

131
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,076
Hey.

132
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,078
Aren't you going to see me out?

133
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,163
See you out?

134
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,000
Just to the street.

135
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,880
Bye then.

136
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,465
Wait.

137
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,801
My toilet gets clogged up
frequently too.

138
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,555
Last time, everything gushed out
and it was a huge mess.

139
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,848
Just like in Parasite.

140
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:00,850
How about

141
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,561
letting me live with you too?

142
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,523
I can't but a much younger woman

143
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,651
who has a professional relationship
with you can?

144
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,612
Does your generosity come and go?

145
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,739
I have a spare room

146
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,450
and I'll be sending her back
as soon as her place gets fixed up.

147
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,701
You tried to hide her.

148
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,912
-I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.
-I totally have the wrong idea now.

149
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:22,872
Because of you.

150
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,294
Mr. Han, the strangest attorney I know.

151
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,506
Oh, right.

152
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,010
What happened with
that incident last time?

153
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,345
The one at Dolma Park.

154
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,387
The police

155
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,847
dismissed her without charges.

156
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,558
I guess you did your job as a lawyer.
This time.

157
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,810
Ro-eum didn't have bad intentions.

158
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,811
I know.

159
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,397
He was a sex offender
wearing an ankle monitor.

160
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,401
And he was the one who picked a fight,
not the other way around.

161
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,072
I'm sure she had a very good reason
for messing with him.

162
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,365
However,

163
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,618
that is not what she should be doing.

164
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,373
In fact, it's exactly the opposite
of what she should be doing right now.

165
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,709
Responding to everything
in her own way.

166
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,714
Don't bother trying to explain
her actions to me.

167
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,716
You may not realize it
since you're too busy

168
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,094
running to her side whether
she's stuck in the mud or the swamp,

169
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,345
but my job

170
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,265
is to make sure she doesn't go
anywhere near the mud.

171
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,979
Don't get too close to her.

172
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,983
You're only her lawyer after all.

173
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,865
Thanks for the drinks last night.

174
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,757
RO-EUM

175
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,431
Da-jeong.

176
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,182
Ringo.

177
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,228
It hurts so much.

178
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,773
Did I get punched in the face too?

179
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,275
A little.

180
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,323
Oof.

181
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,200
Da-jeong, have you eaten anything?

182
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,661
Was this about the fake bank accounts?

183
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,330
You didn't just have
cup noodles, did you?

184
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,583
They ran off
because you passed out, didn't they?

185
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,043
Don't tell me they're coming back.

186
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,840
They are. The high schoolers that sold
their accounts took the money and ran.

187
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,470
If they find out I'm still alive,
they'll come back for me.

188
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,221
I need to go into hiding for a while.

189
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,683
Da-jeong, promise to eat
even if I'm not around?

190
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,979
How much did they get away with?

191
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,983
About… 50K?

192
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,320
Don't tell Ro-eum about this.

193
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,739
She'll be disappointed if she finds out
I still work in this business.

194
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,574
How can you even
talk about her right now?

195
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,328
Because, I'm hers.

196
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,246
You know that.

197
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,249
She didn't ask for me yet, right?

198
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,710
Not yet.

199
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,795
Okay, okay, okay.

200
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,506
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

201
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,376
Now tell me

202
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,669
what you did.

203
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,589
I'll hear you out.

204
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,717
What kind of cons do you actually pull?

205
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,513
It's HAPPY.

206
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,597
What?

207
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,267
Hunt.

208
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,893
Appointment.

209
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,978
Plow.

210
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,062
Propose.

211
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,021
Yield.

212
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,025
I hunt,
make an appointment, plow,

213
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,028
propose, and reap the yield.

214
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,823
HAPPY.

215
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,461
Cast the bait and make them bite.

216
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,964
As you know, I cast a bait
towards the adoptive mother.

217
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,676
I told her that her problematic son
had the genius gene.

218
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,386
Based on the information
I obtained on her,

219
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,973
I took control of how she thinks
based on her level.

220
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,101
Ma'am.

221
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,728
Yes?

222
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,272
Didn't you have
soy braised beans

223
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,357
and seasoned squid for breakfast?

224
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:02,860
Oh my.

225
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,447
And your husband
uses hairline powder, does he not?

226
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:07,907
Yes.

227
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,159
When you were in school,

228
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,536
you ranked last in your class?

229
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,923
Once they take the bait,
and the bait inflates,

230
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,674
it'll rip their mouth open.

231
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,636
But the interesting thing is,
depending on what you do,

232
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,514
they'll bite down harder on the bait
instead of spitting it out.

233
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,475
Without even realizing
they'll lose all their teeth.

234
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,978
Ma'am.

235
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:38,896
Yes?

236
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,608
This is a graph
of a brain test carried out

237
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,819
on leaders around the world

238
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,156
by Professor Emeritus John Kerr William
of Harvard University

239
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,200
who has also been a nominee

240
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,535
for the Nobel Prize of medicine,

241
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,747
And these are the results
of ordinary people.

242
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,166
-The two are clearly different, right?
-Yes.

243
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,044
What matters is the percentage.

244
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,423
Can you read the number
under Bill Gates's graph?

245
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,883
56%.

246
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,177
And your son?

247
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,263
60%.

248
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,558
Laying the groundwork

249
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,143
is the highlight of cons.

250
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,483
Bring any book from home.

251
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,319
The harder the better.

252
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,879
Open the book to any page

253
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,298
and tell me the page number.

254
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,473
Page 22.

255
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,561
"After taking in a friend's child,
you had the audacity

256
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,271
to take out 15 life insurance policies,

257
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,441
and killed him on holiday,
covering it up as a drowning.

258
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,526
According to the law
that a pushover I know

259
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,694
has absolute faith in,

260
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,821
the punishment for killing
someone's 18-year-old son,

261
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,491
and wrongfully gaining
430,000 dollars

262
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,369
is only a maximum of ten years
and a fine of 50,000 dollars."

263
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,871
Wow.

264
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,664
You got every single word right.

265
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:26,837
My "Einstein cell" percentage
is only 12%.

266
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,465
Wow.

267
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,885
Chapter 4, Propose.

268
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,429
If you want to succeed, remember.

269
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,640
Don't propose first.

270
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,604
When it comes to your son's brain,
you've won the lottery.

271
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,774
The problem is,
you don't have much time

272
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,193
to claim your winnings.

273
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,072
His potential intelligence
at this time is at a maximum,

274
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,366
but it is most likely that it will
atrophy within a short time.

275
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,955
As a child psychologist…

276
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,707
See here?

277
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,378
I'm an adviser
for an educational institute

278
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,256
whose name I'm not at liberty to say.

279
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,052
I must go now.

280
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,053
Goodbye.

281
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,056
Please don't do this.

282
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,017
-Doctor.
-Doctor.

283
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,227
Doctor, please.

284
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,022
How can we get our son
into that educational institute?

285
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,565
There must be a way, right?

286
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,983
You know, don't you?

287
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,819
You could apply for a two-year course

288
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,862
at the San Francisco center,

289
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,697
but there's a wait-list

290
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,699
of over 100 children each semester,

291
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,284
and more importantly,

292
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,912
the tuition is quite high.

293
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,038
How much?

294
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,498
In Korean won,

295
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,333
it'd be about 500 million.

296
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,543
500 million.

297
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,836
Hang on.

298
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,380
Give us a little time to think.

299
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,049
But having the money

300
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,760
does not mean he automatically gets in.

301
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,970
What?

302
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,180
Even children
of governors in the States

303
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,891
are on a wait-list just to get tested.

304
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,644
What was the point
of telling us about it then?

305
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,855
I just thought

306
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,274
it was a pity.

307
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,942
Ignoring such a gifted young man

308
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,611
would be a dereliction of duty
as an educator.

309
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,737
There must be a way…

310
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,655
I really must go.

311
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,615
-Wait.
-We can't let you go.

312
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,076
The wait-list.

313
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,995
We can get on that at least, right?

314
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,497
It's not impossible…

315
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,416
We

316
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,459
have

317
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,671
money.

318
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,590
We recently came into some money.

319
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,675
We'll pay in advance with this,

320
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,344
and get the rest with a loan

321
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,846
or a mortgage.

322
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,308
Is that so?

323
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,101
LIFE GARDENER *430,000 DOLLARS

324
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,940
You're telling me
they handed over that sum that easily?

325
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,901
I just gave you the gist.

326
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,278
Ro-eum,

327
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,655
are you really a con artist?

328
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,533
What did I just tell you?

329
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,966
What are you doing?

330
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,552
We have to give it back.

331
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,804
Are you insane?

332
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,475
Is it your plan
to leave Korea?

333
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,145
They probably reported this by now.

334
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,355
They know your face

335
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,149
and there'll be
a record of the transaction.

336
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,692
I'm not an amateur.

337
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,194
I don't leave a record.

338
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,074
And they can't report me.

339
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,076
Just do as I say.

340
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,036
I told you, they can't report me!

341
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,464
What is this?

342
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:58,966
My insurance.

343
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,096
Insurance?

344
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,473
I told you,
they can't report me.

345
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:07,975
That's why.

346
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,352
What is it?

347
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,437
Stop talking and look for yourself.

348
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,440
What are you trying to do?

349
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,568
Did you forget you're on probation?

350
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,780
If you steal this
from the adoptive parents,

351
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,906
then what?

352
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,868
Wasn't your objective
to help Seo Gye-suk?

353
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,997
Then what's your objective?

354
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,042
Why are you doing this?

355
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,088
You scoffed when I said
there was only one viable option.

356
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,008
The most effective and realistic option.

357
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,761
That's the only reason why

358
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,888
you used your brain and time?

359
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,433
Just admit it.

360
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,560
I did something you can't.

361
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,521
You're right.

362
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,898
I can't. And it's not just me.

363
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,069
Most people, normal people,
don't take action in this way.

364
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,158
You said that Seo Gye-suk is also
responsible for what happened,

365
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,744
but you also related to her situation,
didn't you?

366
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,831
Relate to her?

367
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,833
You didn't?

368
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,588
To me, your safety matters the most.

369
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,966
There was absolutely no need
for you to do this.

370
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,510
Whether you're a murderer
or a con artist,

371
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,388
I have no intention of using you.

372
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,808
And this isn't right.

373
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,394
Really?

374
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,814
Return the money.

375
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,733
It's not too late.

376
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,028
The cell phone too?

377
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,323
What on earth is on it?

378
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,242
Think carefully.

379
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,328
Don't regret it later.

380
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,372
I'll give you a choice.

381
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,833
If I return the money,

382
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,960
the cell phone goes back too.

383
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,381
If we use what's on the cell phone,
we have to use the money too.

384
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,634
I'll give you a week.

385
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,179
The passcode is 1234.

386
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,972
Ro-eum.

387
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,572
Why haven't you replied?

388
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,449
I asked if Ringo was on standby.

389
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,953
He can't work right now.

390
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,204
Why not?

391
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,665
He's in the hospital.
And he's being hunted down.

392
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,504
Is he still doing odd jobs
for the mob?

393
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,968
Before you tell him off,
think about it from his position.

394
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,516
I don't care
about his position.

395
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,271
He's old enough to know
what's more important, isn't he?

396
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,524
Get him back on the job
within a week.

397
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,944
Aren't you going to check up on him
at the hospital?

398
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,280
What could I even do?
I'm not a doctor.

399
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,323
Aren't you even
worried about him?

400
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,117
You know how he thinks about you.

401
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,078
It's not my business to know
how he thinks about me.

402
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,956
I know you're only helping
because there's something you want.

403
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,541
Don't try to appeal to emotion.

404
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,422
Mr. Han. I need your help.

405
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,590
Da-jeong..

406
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,674
What's going on?

407
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:13,303
I can't go to the police because
what Ringo did was illegal.

408
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,013
You have to help me.

409
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,432
Come in and tell me what happened.

410
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,020
Please don't tell
Ro-eum about this.

411
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,441
Why not?

412
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,829
Tell me what's going on.

413
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:42,999
To you?

414
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,296
I'm here to see him.

415
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,298
You might not care

416
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,717
but I thought he might.

417
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,637
You met him once
and you're acting like he's your friend?

418
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,807
I came to see someone
who could help me.

419
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,393
I want to hear what she has to say.
Is that okay with you?

420
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,313
Ringo

421
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,900
a friend of mine who runs
an errand center was kidnapped.

422
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,194
Kidnapped?

423
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,071
He was buying up fake bank accounts.

424
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,658
He bought the accounts
from naive people,

425
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,661
and handed them over
to a voice phishing organization.

426
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,497
But some teenagers who sold theirs
suspended their accounts,

427
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,957
and took the money
that a victim had sent

428
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,792
and ran before the mob could get to it.

429
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,544
Hang on a sec, damn it.

430
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,170
Hurry up, will you?

431
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,588
Here it comes.

432
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,215
Got it.

433
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,136
-It's our money.
-Yes!

434
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,514
What Ringo did was wrong.

435
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,974
But the problem is,

436
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,642
the mob thinks that Ringo

437
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,978
and the kids who ran off
are working together.

438
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,980
That's why they kidnapped him.

439
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,358
Ringo is sick
and something awful might happen to him.

440
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,446
I know that mob and if they think
the cops are on to them,

441
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,323
they'll never cooperate.

442
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,160
But I thought you might
be able to get through to them.

443
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,747
If you say you're his lawyer
and we get Ringo back…

444
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,956
Come on.

445
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,381
They think he's in cahoots with the kids
who ran off.

446
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,051
You honestly think they'll give up

447
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,635
before rounding them all up?

448
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,347
What about the money?

449
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,558
You know

450
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,393
what you have to do.

451
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,980
Do you still need a lawyer?

452
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,648
Ro-eum.

453
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,776
What exactly can you do?

454
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,571
Before you butt in,

455
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,323
make your choice.

456
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,704
Mmm.

457
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,375
Damn it.

458
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,127
Why do we have to eat instant noodles
by the river in a luxury car?

459
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,046
Don't you know anything?

460
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,631
This is what rich kids do.

461
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,049
They don't save
the seasoning in instant noodles,

462
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,467
they don't lick the foil
of yogurt containers,

463
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,136
and they only eat the drum sticks
of fried chicken and throw out the rest.

464
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,055
You can just order
the drum sticks these days.

465
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,181
Hey.

466
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,642
I'm just saying, dipstick.
It sound good.

467
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,394
Oh.

468
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,436
Let's go on a trip.

469
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,854
And eat fancy food.

470
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,773
-I'm in.
-Are you in?

471
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,066
-Yeah.
-Okay?

472
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,568
Are you sure we'll be okay?

473
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,070
We'll be fine.

474
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,115
What they're doing is illegal too
so they can't report us.

475
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,368
They'll just take it as bad luck
and won't be able to do a thing.

476
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,329
Cheers.

477
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,039
-So, we're going?
-Yeah.

478
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,749
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

479
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,672
Got you, you rat.

480
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,719
I'm starving.
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

481
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,849
And keep an eye on that rat.

482
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,350
Make sure he doesn't run away.

483
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,268
Got it, boss.

484
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,608
I'll finally get to see her.

485
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,609
Ro-eum.

486
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,365
TO DO ERRAND CENTER, TD

487
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,950
There are two options..

488
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,202
Option one, repay the money
the kids took off with…

489
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,663
This would be a loss
since Ringo didn't steal the money.

490
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,998
Or option two,

491
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,625
catch the kids myself
and serve them up.

492
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,961
I'm not the type that takes a loss,

493
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,546
so I'm here to run a delivery.

494
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,841
This is the list of fake accounts

495
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,551
that Ringo bought.

496
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,053
Next, I need a hacker
to do grunt work.

497
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,431
Let's skip forward.

498
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,828
What exactly can you do?

499
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,293
Think carefully.

500
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,587
Don't regret it later.

501
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,798
I'll give you a choice.

502
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,300
If I return the money,

503
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,385
the cell phone goes back too.

504
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,140
If we use what's on the cell phone,
we have to use the money too.

505
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,683
I'll give you a week.

506
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,779
THE ADOPTIVE MOM SAID
THEY'D RAISE THE SETTLEMENT MONEY.

507
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,364
I'M JUST GOING TO JAIL…
I'M SORRY.

508
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,763
Hello?

509
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,223
I need you to do a job.

510
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,642
Who is this?

511
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,852
It's Ro-eum.

512
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,903
Hey.

513
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,822
Come pick me up.

514
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,699
I'm at Ringo's call center.

515
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,783
Oh.

516
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,451
I… I…

517
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,037
I can't right now.

518
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,163
What?

519
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,040
I can't d-drive.

520
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,085
I can't drive right now.

521
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,754
It's just that, Ro-eum…

522
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,144
Damn it.

523
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,065
What is it?

524
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,444
What the hell is going on?

525
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,155
What's wrong with everyone?

526
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,908
Did you expect them to be fine then?

527
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,870
What do you mean?

528
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,121
It's been ten years.

529
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,373
For ten years…

530
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,168
No, almost 20 years…

531
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,670
I asked what you meant.

532
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,006
Don't you get it?

533
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,134
Besides, you've been
in prison all these years.

534
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,053
I know.

535
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,974
I was the one in prison,

536
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,519
so why are you the ones all messed up?

537
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,113
Call up the guys
who work for Ringo at least.

538
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,107
I'm Yoo-il and this is Yoo-neung.

539
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,317
We're Ringo's right-hand
and left-hand men.

540
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,029
Anyway,

541
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,614
Ringo is okay, right?

542
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,287
Okay.

543
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,749
Why did you go see Han Moo-young?

544
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,169
Do you know what he asked me to do?

545
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,924
The sex offender's phone you cloned.

546
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,053
He wanted me to scrub all the personal
data of the victims on the web.

547
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,181
Was there someone he knew?

548
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,600
Of course not.

549
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,355
He just cared about them. Even though
they were complete strangers.

550
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,694
He's a total nut job.

551
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,529
No, he's kind.

552
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,949
That's why I thought he might help.

553
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,618
Who else would help

554
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,620
people like us?

555
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:02,999
So that's why

556
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,043
you asked someone you met once

557
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,420
to save Ringo?

558
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,467
I kept telling you about it
but you wouldn't listen.

559
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,469
It's a different story
if he was taken.

560
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,845
Because you need him.

561
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,390
Because you need Ringo.

562
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,560
Not because he's important
to you, or you're worried about him,

563
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,313
but because you need him.
That's why you're doing something.

564
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,860
What are you trying to say?

565
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,655
I'm saying you only see people
as a tool.

566
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,303
No, the left.

567
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,513
Geez.

568
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,476
-The left.
-Geez.

569
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,187
I can do it.

570
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,398
Go and check out the car.

571
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,072
HAN MOO-YOUNG

572
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,960
Yes, Mr. Han.

573
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,087
Did you find the kids?

574
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,547
Yes.

575
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,591
Are you really going to hand them over
to the voice phishing organization?

576
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,761
You came to me for advice.

577
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,276
I'm here at the police station.

578
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,575
-Who was that?
-Mr. Han.

579
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,287
He's at the police station.

580
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,587
Get those two kids,

581
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,130
and the bag of cash.

582
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,549
Make sure to check the amount.

583
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,758
Right.

584
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,093
Copy that.

585
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,140
Then what?

586
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,227
It's okay, we can finish up
our conversation.

587
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,735
So, you went to the police
to file a report?

588
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,778
Yes.

589
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,780
That day…

590
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,781
A WEEK AGO

591
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,117
You came to me for advice.

592
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,244
I gave her an answer.

593
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,830
I'm here at the police station.

594
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,791
I'm going to file
a missing person report for Ringo.

595
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,419
The only answer
I could give as an attorney.

596
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,504
The police will start investigating,

597
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,257
and they'll find the kids.

598
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,384
I wanted Ro-eum to know.

599
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,969
Tell Ro-eum

600
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,597
that I'm at the police station.

601
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,765
And that the police

602
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,558
will start looking for Ringo soon.

603
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,144
Letting Ro-eum know…

604
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,772
Did that mean

605
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,024
anything to you?

606
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,027
It was important.

607
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,028
Why is that?

608
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,822
All the choices I made that day

609
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,078
was because of her.

610
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,545
Before you butt in,
make your choice.

611
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,305
ATTORNEY KIM KYUNG-JIN

612
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:51,727
Hello?

613
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,853
Mr. Han.

614
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,774
Ms. Kim Bo-ra wishes to reach
a settlement by the end of the week.

615
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,820
If not, she wants to renegotiate
the settlement amount.

616
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,864
Is that so?

617
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,241
To be frank,

618
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,994
we think we've given your client
more than enough time.

619
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,871
The case was ruled as an accident.

620
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,165
She's not expecting

621
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,084
a sudden plot twist, is she?

622
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,171
For her sake, as soon as possible…

623
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,480
Wasn't your objective
to help Seo Gye-suk?

624
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,507
Do you have any idea what kind
of danger you've put Ringo in?

625
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,843
That mob is the lowest of the low.

626
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,305
They won't just come after the money,
they'll come after our organs.

627
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,766
Leave that mob to the police.

628
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,854
I couldn't care less about them.

629
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,982
What matters is
bringing Ringo back safely.

630
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,318
What about the safety
of the high school kids?

631
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,611
That's none of my business.

632
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,404
Let the kids go.

633
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,657
The police
are already on their way.

634
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,035
So it's in your best interest
to find a way

635
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,704
to keep Ringo and the kids safe,

636
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,249
and return the money to the victim,
so that you won't be in trouble

637
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,293
even if the police investigate.

638
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,221
Get in.

639
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,849
Looks like we'll have to cancel
the delivery and start from scratch.

640
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,923
If the cops move,
Ringo will be arrested,

641
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,467
Even if he gets out,
the mob will retaliate.

642
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,345
We have to move faster than the cops.

643
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,223
First, return the money to the victim.

644
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:37,226
Then, let the high school kids go…
Damn, this is so annoying.

645
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,980
Ow, ow, ow, that hurts.

646
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,315
There now, that's a good boy.

647
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,360
How dare you try to steal from me?
You want to die?

648
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,028
Where's your cell phone?

649
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,573
Here it is.
Geez, you little punk.

650
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,617
Can you brush my hair back for me?

651
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,578
It's been tickling me for a while now.

652
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,455
-Shut it.
-Come on.

653
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,623
I really didn't know.

654
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,126
Where did you hide the money?

655
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:03,961
Huh?

656
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:07,923
Geez.

657
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,801
-I didn't know.
-I knew it, you punk.

658
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,928
You're all dead.

659
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,388
Hello?

660
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,806
Is this the high schooler?

661
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,018
This is Park Gyu-ri
from Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

662
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,728
Am I speaking to Park Hae-dong?

663
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,856
Is your real name Park Hae-dong?

664
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,570
I'm taking the call
on his behalf.

665
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,282
And what is your relationship
with Park Hae-dong?

666
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,367
Oh, I'm…

667
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,995
I'm his uncle.

668
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,581
He's in the shower right now.

669
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,542
We'll, we've found
the $50,000 in cash he reported stolen

670
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,296
last night at 11:25 p.m.

671
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,465
If he's not available
to come to the phone right now,

672
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,926
would you like to take the call for him?

673
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,219
Excuse me?

674
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,095
Oh, uh… Yes, sure.

675
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,847
Okay, then may I have

676
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,475
your name
and cell phone number?

677
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:03,979
I'm Kim Sam-pal.

678
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:08,317
And my number is 010-845-5738.

679
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,444
He impersonated a prosecutor.

680
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,322
He told his victim that her bank account
was used in a crime,

681
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,408
and that the money had to be moved
to a different account

682
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,494
to prevent further loss.

683
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,288
The victim was strung along
for no less than four hours.

684
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,832
She transferred $50,000
to five different accounts.

685
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,418
It was mental torture
that clouded her judgment.

686
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:30,005
And he threatened her that hanging up
would lead to criminal liability.

687
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,384
Government employees do not
threaten people in any way.

688
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,261
Only con artists.

689
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,763
We have arrested

690
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,057
two teenagers for theft.

691
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,476
As Park Hae-dong
claimed that the cash the kids stole

692
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,811
belongs to him,

693
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,105
he must come in for questioning
as a witness.

694
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,315
Oh, that money.

695
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,441
Yes, it's our money.

696
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,651
What?

697
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,778
Sheesh.

698
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,738
Thank you, Ms. Prosecutor.

699
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,949
We have to transfer the money

700
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,285
into Park Hae-dong's bank account,

701
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,204
but they've all been frozen

702
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,414
at the moment.

703
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,916
Do you have an account
that we could use?

704
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,835
Yes, of course.

705
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,171
You'll be sending
the money right away?

706
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,339
Before that,

707
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,925
we need Mr, Park Hae-dong's consent.

708
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,427
Is he

709
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,887
able to come in
for questioning immediately?

710
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,307
Oh… Yes.

711
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,684
Then we'll ask the police to send

712
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,811
a patrol car to your location.

713
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,104
May I have your address?

714
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,731
Oh, it's…

715
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,400
Uh…

716
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:36,030
Walk out to the street
and a patrol car will be waiting.

717
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,283
If you talk,
you know what'll happen, right?

718
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,577
Sheesh. Hey.

719
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,550
Watch your head.

720
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,105
It was Ro-eum, right?

721
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,691
Yes. it was.

722
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,026
Can I see her?

723
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,361
No.

724
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,154
I'm supposed to take you
to the hospital.

725
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,951
How was it actually meeting her?

726
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,912
Just like I heard.

727
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,544
I got him safe and sound.

728
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,630
I'll head back as soon as
I drop him off at the hospital.

729
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,717
Buckle up.

730
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,263
Let's go.

731
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,348
Yeah.

732
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,689
We just

733
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,484
picked up Park Hae-dong.

734
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,903
And he gave his consent to send

735
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,781
the $50,000 to your account.

736
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,032
Good, good.

737
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,494
Should I give you my account number now?

738
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,829
Yes, please do.

739
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,163
Okay.

740
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,581
It's Samsam Bank.

741
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:16,380
3371-810-1966745.

742
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,466
Then to verify identification,

743
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,344
we'll be calling you
on your personal cell phone.

744
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,971
Yes, thank you.

745
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,892
Destroy Ringo's phone.

746
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,981
Have you seen my phone?

747
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,232
No.

748
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,109
Maybe I left it in the car?

749
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,624
SAMSAM BANK MONEY WITHDRAWAL
AMOUNT $10,000

750
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,542
What the?

751
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,169
Why did I get
so many calls?

752
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:00,674
"Kim Sam-pal's bank account
has been used…"

753
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,468
What the heck is this?

754
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,303
"Please check your bank account…"

755
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,387
Huh?

756
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,389
Hello?

757
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,225
Hello, this is Samsam Bank,
Manager Lee Ji-young.

758
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,435
Have you been on the phone

759
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,938
with the number 010-347-5698 just now?

760
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,064
Ms. Lee!

761
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,233
The prosecutor needs you
to take the call!

762
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,028
Any person who has carried out
the following acts

763
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,279
with the intent of committing

764
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,989
telecom and financial fraud

765
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,201
will be punishable by a maximum sentence
of ten years or a fine of $100,000.

766
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,578
Wait, hang on.

767
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,288
I'll put you on with the prosecutor.

768
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,372
What?

769
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,708
This is
Prosecutor Seo In-gyung

770
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,418
from Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

771
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,836
What…

772
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,257
I just talked to a prosecutor.

773
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,676
Oh no. It seems as if
you have been involved

774
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,261
in a vishing scam.

775
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,679
Didn't this person say

776
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,099
she was Prosecutor Park Gyu-ri?

777
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,728
There is no one of that name
at Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

778
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,271
It's a scam.

779
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,774
We've been trying to get
in touch with you.

780
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:02,444
because we noticed
some strange activities on your account.

781
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,739
It could be the vishing organization
we've been after,

782
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,699
so that's why we called.

783
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,701
You have no time to waste.

784
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,037
Your money is probably
being withdrawn $10,000 at a time.

785
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,080
Huh?

786
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,165
Oh no.

787
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,917
That's right.

788
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,002
Oh no.

789
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,170
Oh no.

790
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,213
What do I do?

791
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,591
All your personal information
has been leaked.

792
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,969
In order to prevent further loss,

793
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:29,888
you must transfer all the money
in your current account

794
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,559
to an encrypted account managed by

795
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,103
the Prosecutors' Office.

796
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,604
Do you think you can do that?

797
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,814
Yes, yes, yes.

798
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,023
I'm hungry.

799
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,567
Damn it.

800
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,235
I'm hungry.

801
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,571
Don't die now. My battery…

802
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,409
Woah.

803
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:54,162
Resident registration number.
7712… 7712121.

804
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,583
Resident registration number.

805
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,251
Resident registration number.

806
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,838
Idiot, you can't even remember
your resident registration number?

807
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:05,924
Woah.

808
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,136
154… 382.

809
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,304
What is this?

810
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,388
ID.

811
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,056
Why is this so complicated?

812
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,267
Why are they making me do so much?

813
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,565
$180,000.

814
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,071
Huh?

815
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:29,990
What the?

816
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,451
The system is down.

817
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,535
Bastards.

818
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,204
You've got to be kidding.

819
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,497
Huh?

820
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,917
-This number is not in service.
-What?

821
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,211
-Please confirm…
-The number doesn't exist?

822
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,173
What's going on?

823
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,257
Huh?

824
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:50,677
Hello?

825
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,928
This is Prosecutor Park Gyu-ri.

826
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,139
Did you receive the money?

827
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,182
Excuse me?

828
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,601
Oh… Uh…

829
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,436
Are you sure you checked?

830
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,689
Prosecutor Park Gyu-ri?

831
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,108
Yes, at 15:22

832
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,653
we transferred $50,000.

833
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,032
Oh uh… Excuse me,

834
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,618
but who was
the person that called me

835
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,827
just now then?

836
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,120
Sorry?

837
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,039
What are you talking about?

838
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,999
Just now,

839
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,168
another prosecutor called

840
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,045
and said that you were

841
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,339
a voice phishing scammer.

842
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,385
What kind of scam
transfers money to you?

843
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,680
Oh, there was a transfer limit

844
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,599
so I sent it in amounts of $10,000.

845
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,059
But then…

846
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,437
who did I transfer that money too?

847
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,605
Excuse me?

848
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,859
You transferred your money elsewhere?

849
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,529
Oh no…

850
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,867
No! My money!

851
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,035
My money!

852
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,704
Hey!

853
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,746
Oh no!

854
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,915
Which bank is this? Find it!

855
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:02,958
Hello?

856
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,002
Hello?

857
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,255
Hello?

858
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,180
Delivery.

859
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,112
My money!

860
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,864
Thank you.

861
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,657
Thank you.

862
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,442
Who the hell are you?

863
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,359
Mr. Han?

864
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:13,653
Yes?

865
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,157
The cell phone.

866
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,036
You said Ro-eum took a cell phone

867
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,537
from the adoptive parents.

868
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,209
What was on it?

869
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,216
ATTORNEY KIM KYUNG-JIN

870
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,432
Can we

871
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,184
talk about that next time?

872
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,061
Of course.

873
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,021
We can end today's session here.

874
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,405
About what you said…

875
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,617
How looking away

876
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,787
is only part of the process of healing,
not the end result.

877
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,416
I think I get what you mean now.

878
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,763
-Hello?
-Hello?

879
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,306
Have you seen the news?

880
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,599
No.

881
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,018
Take a look. You'll enjoy it.

882
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:33,733
Hi.

883
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,360
Sorry.

884
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,237
Come on!

885
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,030
This is Kim Mi-hwa of News Y.

886
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,574
Don't watch the news.
Moo-young can't watch the news.

887
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,908
In our next piece of news,

888
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,452
we reported a while ago about

889
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,621
how a young boy who was adopted

890
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,957
returned as a corpse.

891
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,209
A woman had sent her teenage son

892
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,003
to be adopted by a friend,

893
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:56,089
and she claimed that
he had died in suspicious circumstances

894
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,675
during a holiday
with his adoptive parents.

895
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,261
The case had been ruled
as an accidental death,

896
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,763
but new evidence has come to light.

897
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:09,227
Don't read other articles.
Read mine. It's a masterpiece.

898
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,982
HOPE EMERGES - EVIDENCE PROVES
IT WAS MURDER, NOT AN ACCIDENT

899
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,835
You won.

900
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,008
SON'S ACCIDENTAL DEATH..
A MURDER BY ADOPTIVE PARENTS

901
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,093
The video you'll now be seeing

902
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,931
is crucial evidence that
will be a turning point in the case.

903
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,016
There are no explicit pictures

904
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,977
but we have to warn you
that the content is brutal.

905
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,354
Kim Ga-jin, reporting.

906
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,565
The evidence was found
in an unexpected place.

907
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,152
The answer was in a phone belonging to
the biological daughter

908
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,363
of the adoptive parents,
who constantly filmed videos.

909
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,239
This video shows exactly what happened

910
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,117
on the day of the incident.

911
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,788
-Prosecution has reopened the case.
-Mom! Dad!

912
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:12,040
Dad, Myeong-hun is calling you.

913
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,500
Help!

914
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,168
-It's okay.
-Dad!

915
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,505
-Mom, it's Myeong-hun.
-Mom!

916
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,174
-He's just fooling around. Eat up.
-Dad!

917
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,217
Help!

918
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,551
Eat your watermelon.

919
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,430
Mom,
I can't see Myeong-hun anymore.

920
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,970
The police
are already on their way.

921
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,472
So it's in your best interest
to find a way

922
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,684
to keep Ringo and the kids safe,

923
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,937
and return the money to the victim,

924
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,566
so that you won't be in trouble
even if the police investigate.

925
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,019
A week ago,

926
00:55:57,395 --> 00:56:00,148
Han Moo-young filed a report.
Find out which police station.

927
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,780
It's Myeong-hun's journal
that was found at his school.

928
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:10,575
Mom,
why did you have me?

929
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,202
Myeong-hun

930
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,205
didn't resent you.

931
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,417
I wonder why.

932
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,921
If it weren't for me,
you'd have been happy.

933
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,382
That's why
I couldn't ask to live with you.

934
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,682
When I grow up
and start making money,

935
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,643
then I'll be able to look after you.

936
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,354
Just hang in there.

937
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,481
Just get through this.

938
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,110
Just wait a little longer, mom.

939
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,446
He worried about you,

940
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,492
and understood.

941
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,893
Even now, I'm sure he'll want you
to be happy.

942
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,181
Ro-eum.

943
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,272
Did you look into it?

944
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:21,623
I combed through nearby
police stations, Ringo's center,

945
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,875
and Mr. Han's outgoing calls.

946
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,045
I checked to see if there were any
open investigations into Ringo

947
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,214
or if there was a missing persons report
into the high school kids.

948
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,257
And?

949
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,218
But if you think about it,

950
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,931
he doesn't even know Ringo's real name
or where the call center even is.

951
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,727
He never filed a report.

952
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,617
Let's work together.

953
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,410
What?

954
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,496
Let's do it together.

955
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,581
Whatever is it you're trying to do.

956
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,084
And what is that?

957
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:09,837
Conning.

958
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,753
Have you heard of
Red Eye Kids?

959
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,964
We were like an elite unit.

960
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,049
I remembered

961
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,176
what kind of person I used to be.

962
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,595
I'm going to run a con.

963
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,346
I'll show you

964
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,599
the difference between
a lawyer and a con artist.

965
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,602
I found an easy target
but I need a place to gamble.

966
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,644
Who's playing?

967
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,812
Right here.

968
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,689
It's a good plan, right?

969
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,316
You would know.

970
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,567
Someone's here.
