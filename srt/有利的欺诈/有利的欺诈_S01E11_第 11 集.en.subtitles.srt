1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,267
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,126
How much longer?

3
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,878
We're almost there.

4
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,613
Well?

5
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,240
Go and get him.

6
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,491
I'll wait out here.

7
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,700
Oh, of course.

8
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,900
What do you think you're doing?

9
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,131
Come on, focus.

10
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,591
What?

11
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,842
Hang on, hang on.

12
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,760
Ma'am.

13
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,303
Watch where you're going.

14
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,473
Oh, sir.

15
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,308
-Your feet, your feet.
-Where's my wife?

16
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,643
She's right here.

17
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,521
Watch your head.

18
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,606
Careful.

19
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,609
He's wasted.

20
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,985
Geez.

21
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,558
Say hello.

22
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,685
This is Jay.

23
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,734
We meet again.

24
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,200
I need you to tell me.

25
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,372
What was Lee Ro-eum
trying to steal from Kyung-ja?

26
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,628
A notebook.

27
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,754
A notebook?

28
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,589
Yes.

29
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,883
Director Ahn Chae-hong's notebook.

30
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,219
Ledgers on Red Eye?

31
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,764
Kyung-ja handed those
over to the Chairman years ago.

32
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,683
There was one last one.

33
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,560
Only Jang Kyung-ja knew about it.

34
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,062
The last one?

35
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,564
Yes.

36
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,609
And why did Ro-eum want that?

37
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,322
Apparently, it revealed
the Chairman's identity.

38
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,998
You mean, she knows who the Chairman is?

39
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,334
Yes.

40
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,504
And where is the notebook now?

41
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,757
I don't know.

42
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,634
But Jang Kyung-ja took it back.

43
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,386
The last time I saw it anyway.

44
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,279
That must be why I'm out, right?

45
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,368
Wow, Kyung-ja is one scary woman.

46
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,789
Not only did she keep it hidden away,

47
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,833
she held on to it all this time
creating this mess.

48
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,636
How about doing another heist with me?

49
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,262
What do you think?

50
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,889
Excuse me?

51
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,601
She could've hid that notebook
somewhere else,

52
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,021
or made another copy.

53
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,524
If we get our hands on it,

54
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,402
we could get rid of her for good.

55
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,905
Nothing more would get in our way.

56
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,867
You can plant a camera
in her office, right?

57
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,286
The kind you're good at making.

58
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,163
With sound.

59
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,551
What do you mean

60
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,970
he'll be helping us?

61
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,888
Exactly that.

62
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,350
Was this a group decision?

63
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,942
Ro-eum.

64
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,194
Can we talk?

65
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,135
Did you go to see him
or did he come to see you?

66
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,775
I met him by chance.

67
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,527
Whose idea was it

68
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,862
to help us?

69
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,704
Is there anything I can do to help?

70
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,372
We both reached an agreement.

71
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,001
Having one of her people working with us
isn't so bad.

72
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,878
You're always like this.

73
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,339
You believe that your goal
justifies any means.

74
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,299
Me?

75
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,846
I thought you were done with this problem.

76
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,432
Yeon Tae-hun.

77
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,894
Yeon Tae-hun isn't anything like him.

78
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,396
How can you even trust him?

79
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,441
Didn't you say Yeon Tae-hun
was someone you can't empathize with?

80
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,778
He beat up Ringo without blinking an eye.

81
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,742
What do you think the Red Eye Kids were?

82
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,038
Jay was trained to be an assassin.

83
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,667
And if we did anything wrong,
the rule was to be punished.

84
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,960
Ringo knows that.

85
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,754
It's not an issue of knowing or not.

86
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,383
Are you saying we should be thanking him
for not killing Ringo?

87
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,843
With Jay,
all we have to do is follow the rules.

88
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,971
How can you be so sure?

89
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,016
Trust based on

90
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,685
experience.

91
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,353
Trust?

92
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,277
If you

93
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,529
insist on bringing him in,

94
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,656
then I'll be laying down the rules.

95
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,075
-What?
-From now on,

96
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,077
you won't be the one talking to him.

97
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,120
It'll be me.

98
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,749
You don't have an issue with that, do you?
Since you and I are a team.

99
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,627
The revolver.

100
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,964
I need you to find my revolver.

101
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,852
You guys must really
depend on that lawyer.

102
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,855
He's a good guy.

103
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,361
Should I leave?
Am I making you uncomfortable?

104
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,615
Why are you asking me? Ask Ringo.

105
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,868
You want me to leave?

106
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,745
No.

107
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,331
I mean, you can if you want to.

108
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,957
Why are you here?

109
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,668
I kept thinking about the past.

110
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,256
I owe her like you all do.

111
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,684
Were you always so formal with me?

112
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,395
We were never on casual terms.

113
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,007
I guess you didn't give her
my message after all.

114
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,759
She thinks we've never met.

115
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,469
I didn't get around to it.

116
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,057
Why do you want to help us?

117
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,185
Didn't Ro-eum tell you?

118
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,145
I'd like to hear it from you.

119
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,069
The Chairman chose Mr. Ma over Ms. Jang.

120
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,532
She'll be in danger after the Closing.

121
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,951
Ro-eum just wants the Chairman

122
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,411
so I'm willing to help

123
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,497
in exchange for my safety and Ms. Jang's.

124
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,794
I see.

125
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,049
Then from now on, call me on this number.

126
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,221
Why don't you like me?

127
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,351
Do I have to like you?

128
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,280
About Jayâ€¦

129
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,739
You don't need to explain.

130
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,662
I went to the auto repair shop
to see Na-sa.

131
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,418
But Jay was there.

132
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,882
So, why did you bring him here?

133
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,592
If you went to see Na-sa,

134
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,802
you should've tried to find him.

135
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
I wanted to drive Jang Kyung-ja insane.

136
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,267
Na-sa will probably
be off somewhere gambling anyway.

137
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,269
He said he was going back

138
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,188
to Red Eye.

139
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,773
He said he'd work at Navis.

140
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,401
Who would even hire him?

141
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,029
I want you to bring him back.

142
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,285
Bring him back.

143
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,413
Not Jay, Na-sa.

144
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,635
Yes?

145
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,969
Where are you?

146
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:24,887
I'm out.

147
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,555
I'm on my way home.

148
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,777
There was a proposal that
the CFO brought over last time.

149
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,740
Tell him to bring it
to my office, discreetly.

150
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,701
Stock manipulation follows a process.

151
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,455
Ma Kang-su has a stock in mind
and has a team in place.

152
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,125
And we planted a spy in this stage.

153
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,890
It may look like
an empty drive but it's a hacking tool.

154
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,601
Just drop it in different places
around the company.

155
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:39,605
When people pop it into their computers,
we'll be able to access their network.

156
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,792
Mr. Yeon has started work
as an engineer who'll be creating

157
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,877
a favorable factor to raise stock prices,

158
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,506
but he hasn't formed a connection
with Ma Kang-su's team yet.

159
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,133
He's just considered an outside advisor.

160
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,096
Ma Kang-su's men
always stand guard outside his office.

161
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,309
He also sweeps everyone
who enters his office.

162
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,563
The only thing we can use is a recorder,

163
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,234
so for now, we can only access
information that Mr. Yeon hears himself.

164
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,403
It's a total fortress.

165
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,905
In stock manipulation,
info has to be kept under tight wraps

166
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,991
because if word gets out,
they'll all be ruined.

167
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,785
Ma Kang-su is half out of his mind.

168
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,247
Because if he fails,
he'll be going straight back to prison.

169
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,498
Does that have a camera?

170
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,083
It's a recorder.

171
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,339
Stand up straight.

172
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,466
Get up.

173
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,437
Get up.

174
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,315
Stand up, you bastards.

175
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,943
This isn't some mom-and-pop shop.

176
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,571
Would you invest with this if it were you?

177
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,739
Would you?

178
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,948
I'm sorry, sir.

179
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,203
And the daughter?

180
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,582
She said she'd text
the date of the meeting.

181
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,877
Daughter?

182
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,755
He's referring to the financier.

183
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,633
They need a large chunk of cash
to move on to the next stage.

184
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,011
If they want to buy up stock,
they need money.

185
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,431
That's why they bring in a financier.

186
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,516
So it's not the Chairman
who puts up the cash?

187
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,643
Stock manipulators
never use their own money.

188
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,813
Ma Kang-su's financier
is Min Chae-pyo, a private money lender

189
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,607
who he has known since his Darsua days.

190
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,733
They must be close.

191
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,568
But while Ma Kang-su was in prison,

192
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,362
Min Chae-pyo's daughter, Min Kang-yun
took over the domestic business.

193
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,740
Oh, that's why he calls her
"the daughter."

194
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:58,118
Ma Kang-su is in charge of
the business plan for this meeting.

195
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,375
Business plan?

196
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,837
It details how they'll manipulate prices
and how much money they need,

197
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,756
and what they'll be doing

198
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,175
with the money, and with whom,

199
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,093
and so on.

200
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,428
It's basically
a collection of hard evidence.

201
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,389
Yes, so we'll use
editing the file as an excuse

202
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,934
to access
the hard drive that has the file.

203
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,686
If we can get a hold of that,

204
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,731
we'll be able to control their operation.

205
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,451
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to edit the file one last time.

206
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,416
Just send it to me by email.

207
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,136
Come in.

208
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,436
Oh.

209
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,148
You should go and eat. I have a meeting.

210
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,608
All right.

211
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,286
I was wondering

212
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,163
if I could get

213
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,831
the floor plans of this center.

214
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,915
Floor plans?

215
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,292
Yes, uhâ€¦

216
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,377
It'd be easier

217
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,837
to plant a device.

218
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,214
Wireless can be unstable.

219
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,508
Okay.

220
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,552
Getting you the floor plans is easy.

221
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,387
But,

222
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,348
don't you think the order is all wrong?

223
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,725
Hmm?

224
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,187
I still haven't received
anything from you,

225
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,813
other than demands.

226
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,400
If I get you the floor plans,

227
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,695
when will I have eyes
on Kyung-ja's office?

228
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,616
Su-ho?

229
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,284
Yes?

230
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,036
I remember you as a kid.

231
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,163
You always did what you were told,

232
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,123
and you were cute.

233
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,876
But do you remember when
you were the most compliant?

234
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,464
The day after getting beat up.

235
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,677
Are you still the same?

236
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,388
Uhâ€¦

237
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:28,352
Once I get the floor plans, I'll be able
to plant the device by tonight.

238
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,645
Right away.

239
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,563
Okay, good.

240
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,899
-Do that.
-Yes, sir.

241
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,960
What are you doing?

242
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,045
Mister. Lee Ro-eum sent you, didn't she?

243
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,464
This right here.

244
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,633
Guess who made it?

245
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,760
It's one of my older models.

246
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,346
I told them

247
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,224
not to put me in danger.

248
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,310
I've joined up with Director Ma,
but if they plant a spy in here,

249
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,479
who do you think will be suspected first?

250
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,150
I don't know what you're talking about.

251
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,446
Then you don't know
anything about this either?

252
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,867
That's mine.

253
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,204
Go tell Lee Ro-eum

254
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,415
if she doesn't take you out,
I'll blow the whistle.

255
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,054
Why did Su-ho go over to Ma Kang-su?

256
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,640
This is crazy.

257
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,522
The date of the meeting
is going to be texted, right?

258
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,733
What do you have in mind?

259
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,027
For startersâ€¦

260
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:04,197
Ask Jay to send over the rotation schedule
of the security detail.

261
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,115
Ro-eum.

262
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:07,993
Plan B.

263
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,595
Shit.

264
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,014
JAY

265
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,232
Are you insane?

266
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,734
What are you doing here?

267
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,694
It's just an auto repair shop.

268
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,238
Ma Kang-su is searching
high and low for you.

269
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,157
Are you sure you didn't have a tail?

270
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,037
I heard that you're working for him.

271
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,164
Yeah.

272
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,168
If he finds this,
I'll be the one who he suspects first.

273
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,088
Are you trying to get me killed?

274
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,215
These drivesâ€¦

275
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,592
Get them out of there.

276
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,135
If you don't, I'll tell him.

277
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,095
I mean it.

278
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,514
Ma Kang-su's meeting with the financier.

279
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,519
Are you trying to stop the Closing?

280
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,896
The date will be texted to him.

281
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,272
I need the date.

282
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,066
What do you expect me to do?

283
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,819
I won't get the drives out
until I know the date.

284
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,362
Did you come here to threaten me?

285
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,702
Did you plant a camera
in Jang Kyung-ja's office yet?

286
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,248
You'll be working at night,

287
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,667
so you'll have to avoid the security team.

288
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,669
I'll send you their rotation schedule.

289
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,337
Is this some sort of trap?

290
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,339
No, it's not.

291
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,716
Da-jeong doesn't want
to see you get killed,

292
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,720
and Ringo keeps seeing you get
beat up in his dreams.

293
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,807
Ro-eum.

294
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,103
Were you really trying to kill me?

295
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,108
No. Why would I want to be arrested
before I even get to meet the Chairman?

296
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,111
I just did it out of habit.

297
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,405
I thought it'd make you listen.

298
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,991
Because I'm a slave?

299
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,201
Yes.

300
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,370
And I am too.

301
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,166
Good luck with the camera.

302
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,542
Just hang in there.

303
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,545
Oh.

304
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,130
Hey.

305
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,300
You're not that kid anymore.

306
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,011
If they beat you, bite them back at least.

307
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,387
What are your teeth for?

308
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,908
Why are you so serious?

309
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,701
You're making me nervous.

310
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,414
Are you all right?
You're not sick, are you?

311
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,085
What is Moo-young up to these days?

312
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,879
These daysâ€¦

313
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,756
He said he's been busy.

314
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,800
Oh, right. Yesâ€¦

315
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,597
By any chance,

316
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,017
it doesn't have anything to do
with that girl, Lee Ro-eum, does it?

317
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,478
Oh, come on.

318
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,021
Of course not.

319
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,272
Are you sure?

320
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,317
No.

321
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,447
You have to stop him.

322
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,993
Moo-young has to stay far, far away
from Red Eye and Lee Ro-eum.

323
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,119
R-Red Eye?

324
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,539
For now,

325
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,041
I need you to look into it.

326
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,751
I don't want Moo-young

327
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,628
anywhere near this case.

328
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,847
How did it go?

329
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,684
I'm sure I got through.

330
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,727
Did Jay say anything?

331
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,231
He just sent over the schedule

332
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,816
when I told him you needed it.

333
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,069
What is his deal?

334
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:13,989
What do you mean?

335
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,533
What is he to you?

336
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,952
What's your relationship?

337
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,580
I just want to understand.

338
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,751
I used to like him.

339
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,421
What?

340
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,964
I used to like him.

341
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,340
Jay.

342
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,523
Sir.

343
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,360
When you meet Ms. Min,

344
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,196
is there anything I can do to help?

345
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,577
Come in.

346
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,997
Hey.

347
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,623
Leave it and go.

348
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,584
Wow.

349
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,420
Now, this is the real thing.

350
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,547
Tangerines straight from the farm. Nice.

351
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,175
Try some.

352
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,095
No, thank you.

353
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,307
You don't like tangerines?

354
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,184
Just try one.

355
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,227
These are my favorite.

356
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,314
Here.

357
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,816
Try it.

358
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:33,902
Come on.

359
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,907
It's really good.

360
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,044
Is something going on with you these days?

361
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:54,964
I'm fine.

362
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,219
-Hi, you're back.
-Yes.

363
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,764
Hi.

364
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,392
How is Mr. Yeon doing?

365
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,977
Ma Kang-su fired him today.

366
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,772
Is he okay?

367
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,192
Yes. He gave this to us and left.

368
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,860
He looked a little sad though.

369
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,530
Is that the last recording?

370
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,951
Yes. He said we didn't need to listen
to it since there's no worthwhile info.

371
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,327
I'll take a listen anyway.

372
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,122
What for?

373
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,375
Can you send the file by email
so that I can listen to it at home?

374
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,334
Sure.

375
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,055
Is something going on with you these days?

376
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,559
I'm fine.

377
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,729
Come on, smile a little.

378
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,272
It's a good day.

379
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,445
Other than the fact
I can't smoke these days,

380
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,282
my life is good.

381
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,120
Nothing beats

382
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,873
health and freedom.

383
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,711
It's time to wrap up.

384
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:15,712
Do you

385
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,258
happen to know

386
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,138
a Yeon Ho-jung?

387
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,189
What's that?

388
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,065
A person?

389
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,909
Doctor,

390
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,078
you've been asking
a lot of questions lately.

391
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,010
Hello?

392
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,346
It's Han Moo-young.

393
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,975
You did good work.

394
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,978
Thank you.

395
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,108
We'll always remember
your daughter, Ho-jung.

396
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,018
It's me.

397
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,730
I'd like to meet my father.

398
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,774
I'm glad you changed your mind.

399
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,179
ALWAYS KEEP YOUR PHONE WITH YOU

400
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,307
I BELIEVE IN YOU

401
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,769
IT WILL BE PAID ENTIRELY BY CASH

402
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,895
THANK YOU

403
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,743
Ma Kang-su's meeting with the financier.

404
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,912
The date will be texted to him.

405
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,038
I need the date.

406
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,541
You're not that kid anymore.

407
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,252
If they beat you, bite them back at least.

408
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,629
What are your teeth for?

409
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,675
Come in.

410
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,679
Uhâ€¦

411
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,847
If I can have your phone,

412
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,434
I'll set it up so that
you can see Ms. Jang's office.

413
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,854
You got in?

414
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,772
Yes.

415
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,425
YOUR ITEM FROM JANGSU FARM HAS ARRIVED

416
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,726
FIXED DEPOSIT FOR VIPS

417
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,026
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RELEASE

418
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,491
INVESTMENT PARTY AT 8:30 P.M.
MYEONGJIN GARCIA CLUB LOUNGE

419
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,624
It's all done.

420
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,675
If you apply a little pressure on her,
I'm sure you'll be able to find out

421
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,886
where she hides her important stuff.

422
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,471
Yes.

423
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,681
I'm hoping it's somewhere
inside her office.

424
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,683
If you give me a few more days,

425
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,602
I could plant a tracker too.

426
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,730
Well, look at you working so hard.

427
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,943
Okay.

428
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,070
Good work.

429
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,280
You can go home now.

430
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,208
Kyung-ja.

431
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,420
I heard about

432
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,925
what Ro-eum tried to steal from you.

433
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,930
This is what I think.

434
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,934
Considering the decision you made
in that situation,

435
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,646
you must've made a copy.

436
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,527
And finding it is only a matter of time.

437
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,153
Don't you think?

438
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,823
What are you talking about?

439
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,828
I now hold something over you,

440
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,496
and you know that.

441
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,582
Whatever it is you're up to,

442
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,669
if it gets in the way of my op,

443
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,256
I won't let you walk away unscathed.

444
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,387
Do you think the game is over?

445
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,269
Come on, Kyung-ja!

446
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,859
You don't like getting blood
on your hands.

447
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,444
So why are you clinging on to this

448
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,947
when you're not even prepared
to take any risks?

449
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,992
Is that what you think?

450
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,580
That

451
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,707
I'm not prepared?

452
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,253
What?

453
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,714
Are you planning a revolt?

454
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,642
Mr. Yun took it.

455
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,894
My revolver.

456
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,648
If you get it back for me,
then I'll believe

457
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,817
what you told me.

458
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,092
AT 8:30 P.M.
MYEONGJIN GARCIA CLUB LOUNGE

459
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,427
Ro-eum.

460
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,806
AT 8:30 P.M.
MYEONGJIN GARCIA CLUB LOUNGE

461
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,852
The party is hosted by
Ma Kang-su's financier's daughter.

462
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,730
She meets potential business partners
at these parties,

463
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,148
and if she likes them,

464
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,484
that's when she invests.

465
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,736
Currently, she's the only person

466
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:23,157
who has enough cash to give Ma Kang-su
the 200 billion won he needs.

467
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,492
In other words,

468
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,119
if Ma Kang-su can't get the deal,

469
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,496
their op is a flop.

470
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,290
Then I guess
we have to mess up their deal.

471
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,835
Ma Kang-su will do everything possible.

472
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,380
And so will we.

473
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,048
To do that,

474
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,925
I guess we'll have to go to that party.

475
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,927
How can we get in?

476
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,470
It's a private party.

477
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,514
You're right.

478
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,600
Additional invitations can only be
obtained through VIPs.

479
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,062
There's a name we know on the VIP list.

480
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,564
Professor Shin Seo-ra.

481
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,778
Professor Shin is a VIP

482
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,655
to a party thrown by a loan shark?

483
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,449
Unbelievable.

484
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,076
I'm gonna go

485
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,662
and turn her house upside down.

486
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,955
No, don't.

487
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,248
Don't flip out on her.

488
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,666
We need an invitation.

489
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,460
We need you too.

490
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,212
Me?

491
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,380
Me?

492
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,508
We need an entirely new face
for this plan.

493
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,885
And when you ask her for an invitation,

494
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,722
tell her that you'll be the one going.

495
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,016
Come on.

496
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,601
Why are you doing this to me?

497
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,520
Also, bring a date.

498
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,564
You can't go on your own.

499
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,152
Mr. Han.

500
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,029
Don't do this to me.

501
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,992
You can return the favor with dinner.

502
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,161
For meâ€¦

503
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,954
Next weekend is fine.

504
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,833
Can't you think
like a normal person for once?

505
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,377
I'm giving you a chance.

506
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,464
A chance to right your past wrongs.

507
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,511
I mean, why are you even a VIP for a party

508
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,722
thrown by a loan shark?

509
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,932
Don't you need my help once you get in?

510
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,976
I'm serious about giving you a hand.

511
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,608
Bring Jae-in to the dinner.

512
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,443
Why should I bring her?

513
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,861
What did you two

514
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,489
talk about when you met?

515
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,202
Work that you are not ashamed of at all.

516
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,871
But she was, very much.

517
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,374
Jae-in

518
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,250
is a nice girl, isn't she?

519
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,006
What are you getting at?

520
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,009
I see you're on the defense.

521
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,811
The invitation.

522
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,562
If you get it, call me.

523
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,279
Should we go for lunch?

524
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,239
Doctor.

525
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:09,949
Huh?

526
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,170
All right.

527
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,088
Excuse me?

528
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,298
Are you serious?

529
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,302
Even though her intentions are obvious?

530
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,387
What intentions?

531
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,018
I know she's not an easy person
to deal with.

532
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,688
She wouldn't have agreed
without any strings attached.

533
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,982
Still, she likes me.

534
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,444
That's what I find
so fascinating about you.

535
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,364
Usually, I don't like the people
Professor Shin likes.

536
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,532
But youâ€¦

537
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,663
You don't seem

538
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,832
like the type she usually warms up to.

539
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,543
Then again, she doesn't even
like me, her own son.

540
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,836
That's not true.

541
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,546
She loves you a lot, actually.

542
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,798
Professor Shin

543
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,175
is a very good actress.

544
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,594
Look at how she's been
doing that talk show of 20 years

545
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,678
looking like Mother Theresa.

546
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:17,183
We've lived together for years,
but I still find it hard to deal with her.

547
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,102
Maybe I'm just lacking.

548
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,770
She's family.

549
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,689
And families are hard.

550
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,649
And it's not because
you're lacking in any way.

551
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,111
Are you really going to have dinner
with me and Professor Shin?

552
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,029
Yes.

553
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,656
Aren't you afraid of how she'll act?

554
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,495
I have no control over what she does,

555
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,290
and ultimately, I'm helping out the team,

556
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,250
so I want to give it a shot,
whatever it is.

557
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,293
Wow.

558
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,712
That's so cool of you.

559
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,134
Then, do you want to be my date
for the party too?

560
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,199
Do you need anything?

561
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,409
Why is he suddenly

562
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,870
locking the door to his office?

563
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,958
I think he's been locking up recently.

564
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,419
But if he's suspended,

565
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,090
shouldn't he be barred
from using our printer?

566
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:32,967
Think about it.

567
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,928
He shouldn't ask Ms. Park to do
work for him either.

568
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:38,931
I don't mind.

569
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:42,101
Besides, since you lost a case recently,

570
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,436
I have some time on my hands.

571
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,357
What's wrong?

572
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,902
Oh, nothing.
I've never been suspended before,

573
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,240
so I was wondering if suspended lawyers

574
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,158
are always that busy?

575
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,702
Something's up with him.

576
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,082
Do you know something?

577
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,709
Huh? What?

578
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,711
No.

579
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,796
I mean, the other time,

580
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:15,467
I wanted to stay in company housing for
a few days because of mold at my place,

581
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,261
but he said I couldn't.

582
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,762
I mean, it's not even his.

583
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,855
What are you doing? What's going on?

584
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,984
Your case has been reassigned.

585
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,612
Why?

586
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,655
By who?

587
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,669
It's time for you to take on a big case.

588
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,631
What kind of big case?

589
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,590
Oh.

590
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,301
I see you're not very astute.

591
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,721
I expected as much.

592
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,599
You could never find the right line
to stand in.

593
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,893
I'm not sure I understand.

594
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,437
Why are you digging into Navis Well-being?

595
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,357
Didn't you want me to recognize you?

596
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,859
No, Navis Well-beingâ€¦

597
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,236
I'm transferring you
out of town for a while.

598
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,196
Out of town?

599
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,740
Chief Prosecutor Ji Baek-jun
will take care of you.

600
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,201
And once you come back,
things will all be cleared up.

601
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,202
Excuse me?

602
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,707
I'll back you so just go for a while.

603
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,504
So this was it?

604
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:34,880
Did I

605
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,299
make the right connection?

606
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,135
I mean,

607
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,763
I got so tired of transferring
schools for my son,

608
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,766
and only getting to see him on weekends,

609
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,393
so I thought

610
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,977
if I broke open a big case,

611
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,563
I'd at least get some recognition
for my hard work,

612
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:54,691
but it turns out I've formed
the right connection.

613
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,114
So it was never about what I did,

614
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,783
but who I went after.

615
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,077
Are you thanking me

616
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,037
or insulting me?

617
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,040
What do you think?

618
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,554
Mr. Han.

619
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,721
Mr. Ryu.

620
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,684
I have to go.

621
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,019
I'm sorry about this.

622
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,605
I only have myself to blame.

623
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,774
You gave me a choice.

624
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,193
But they won't, so what can I do?

625
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:33,040
It's a tragic story
you won't hear anywhere else.

626
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,293
I'll take her home.

627
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,140
Hey.

628
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,854
I read your files.

629
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,526
It'sâ€¦

630
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,194
No, you don't need to explain.

631
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:04,988
It's all right here.

632
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,658
Lee Ro-eum had a tough life.

633
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,994
I understand why you're helping her.

634
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:12,955
I'm sorry.

635
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,123
Why are you apologizing to me?

636
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,876
You're the one
who brought me into the firm

637
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,923
so that I wouldn't throw away
my career to help others.

638
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,883
I don't want you feel as if

639
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,927
everything you did for me,

640
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,555
getting me into therapy,
giving me a place to stay,

641
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,599
and worrying about me
was all for nothing.

642
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,602
So that's not what you're doing?

643
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,855
Are youâ€¦

644
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,692
getting better?
Are you still going to therapy?

645
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,989
Why not? Why aren't you going?
Are you all better now?

646
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,201
You're better, but you just happened
to get sucked into a client's life,

647
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,829
and ended up getting suspended,
yet you're still

648
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:54,955
helping her?

649
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,041
I wanted to cure this illness

650
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,003
because I hated myself.

651
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,755
I hated who I was.

652
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,340
As long as I had this illness,

653
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,428
I was a useless human being,
like my father always said.

654
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,639
I became a lawyer to help others,

655
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,058
but I only got in the way,
because of my illness.

656
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:18,186
When I started to get treatment,
it was the clients that got in my way.

657
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,440
I couldn't see the end.

658
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,067
What's the point of living
as a useless lawyer

659
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,862
when I don't even know if I'll get better?

660
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,030
I have

661
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,701
never met a lawyer
who was competent as you.

662
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,370
You know I was very selective
about which clients to take on.

663
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,248
I'm the one who selected them for you.

664
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,417
I'm not trying to blame you.

665
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,586
Even if I fail as a lawyer,

666
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,631
and even if what I'm doing
may be reckless,

667
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,883
I've decided to accept myself as I am.

668
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,010
That's what I'm trying to say.

669
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,316
Gyu.

670
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,331
Hello?

671
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,250
You said I should call you on this number.

672
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,086
What is it?

673
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,213
Please tell Ro-eum

674
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,132
that the item she asked me to get

675
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,425
will take more time.

676
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,551
An item?

677
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:33,845
Yes.

678
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,348
All right.

679
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,239
What?

680
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,076
What is it?

681
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,042
What's the item you asked Jay to get?

682
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,175
You don't

683
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,636
trust me at all, do you?

684
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,680
What are you talking about?

685
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,974
I told you there would be a better ending.

686
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,518
But the fact that you're still
looking for the revolver,

687
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,813
and you're willing to trust the man
who said he'd bring it for you

688
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,315
means you don't trust me.

689
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,237
Why can't you say anything?

690
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,198
What do you want me to say?

691
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,659
That I trust you?

692
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,870
Yes.

693
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,329
That's what I want to hear.

694
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,209
You expect me to believe
we can capture the Chairman

695
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,377
without shedding any blood?

696
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:48,879
Why can't you?

697
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,385
You may have started this on your own,

698
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,971
but look how many people
empathize with you now?

699
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,682
Don't you realize that people are willing

700
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,392
to be in this together with you?

701
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,688
If revenge was possible with sentiments,
this would've been over a long time ago.

702
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:10,776
How long are you going to act like
the way Red Eye trained and groomed you?

703
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,861
How long are you
going to believe that is right?

704
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,279
I told you.

705
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,448
I've always been this way.

706
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,325
No.

707
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,576
You're wrong.

708
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,248
You barely know me. So how would you know?

709
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,793
Did this empathy you're talking about

710
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,004
make you set fire to your
parents you met after ten years?

711
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,380
Or did it make you

712
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,592
dream about that moment
every single day for ten years?

713
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,054
Have you been where I am?

714
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,765
If you think you know me

715
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,267
by reading a few files about me
for a few months,

716
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,812
then you're wrong.

717
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,772
That's not empathy, that's fantasy.

718
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,941
It's not something you're
actually feeling but a delusion.

719
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,108
No wonder it's an illness.

720
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,864
At least Jay respects and understands

721
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,159
the kind of revenge I want.

722
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,371
That's what I need right now.

723
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,132
You still remember the code?

724
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,552
What were you doing?

725
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,929
Go take a shower first.

726
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,016
Should we see a movie?

727
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,935
Is something going on?

728
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,398
Something always has to be up
for you to take an interest.

729
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,240
I think I've found a way.

730
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,493
What way?

731
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,245
Looking back,

732
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,540
I've always managed to survive.

733
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,877
And I'll survive again.

734
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,295
What's your plan?

735
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,965
I'm going to prove my worth

736
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,345
to the Chairman.

737
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,267
What exactly are you going to do?

738
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,273
What about you?

739
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,067
What are you doing with Lee Ro-eum?

740
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,989
I just talked to her for a moment.

741
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:21,907
Because of you.

742
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,410
Same for me.

743
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,829
I'm doing this for us.

744
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,960
I'm sorry for having you followed,

745
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,046
but I don't want you

746
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,215
to see her again.

747
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,718
There's no knowingâ€¦

748
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,433
what I'll do to her.

749
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,440
Ms. Jang took it.

750
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,904
She said she'd take the revolver.

751
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:11,164
Why are you standing here
instead of coming in?

752
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:15,418
I need you two to do some reconnaissance.

753
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,295
We have to preset the device.

754
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,243
Wait for me here. I'll go and park.

755
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,956
Did you hear me?

756
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,751
Why don't you like Jay?

757
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,673
What are you trying to say?

758
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,053
Are you mad?

759
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,429
Yes.

760
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,098
I get it.

761
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,225
You had feelings for him
when you were young.

762
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,311
You probably didn't have anyone

763
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,188
who understood you and treated you

764
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,647
like a human being.

765
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,191
I did.

766
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,860
There was someone like that,

767
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,696
when everyone else treated me
like a clown for their own amusement.

768
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:08,907
That's good to know.

769
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,744
Then from now on, remember that person.

770
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:13,912
Not someone like Jay.

771
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,916
Whoever you like, and whoever you need,

772
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,085
that's up to you and I respect that.

773
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:23,254
But the person who will help you
until the very end,

774
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,882
is me, not Jay.

775
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,471
So don't talk to me

776
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,599
as if you'll never see me again.

777
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,195
What does the ring look like?

778
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,447
It's just a ring

779
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,990
but it's really important to me.

780
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,952
If it's your engagement ring,
do you happen to have a picture?

781
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,288
We'll look for it ourselves
so there's no need to concern yourself.

782
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,250
I'm afraid that won't be possible
due to internal regulations.

783
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,627
We just need to take a look around.

784
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,922
Why don't you write down
where and when you lost it,

785
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,674
and leave your information?

786
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,467
All right.

787
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,263
Which way is the rest room?

788
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,009
Ro-eum.

789
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,260
It's me.

790
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,678
Are you in there?

791
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,269
Is it done?

792
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,689
Ask the front desk if they found anything,

793
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:07,650
and check the rest room
and hood just in case.

794
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,829
Let's get out of here.
I know a place to hide.

795
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,795
We should go.

796
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,097
Ro-eum.

797
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,433
The last number is 25.

798
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,645
What can you tell us
about participant number 25,

799
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:44,771
Ro-eum?

800
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,361
Do you remember?

801
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,238
You picked my number.

802
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,324
What is it?

803
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,660
It was you.

804
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,709
It was you, wasn't it?

805
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,045
Number 25.

806
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,301
Yes.

807
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,406
SPECIAL THANKS TO AHN NAE-SANG
FOR HIS GUEST APPEARANCE

808
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:58,011
We're going to use the party
to drive a wedge between them.

809
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,346
So that the investment falls through.

810
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,057
Looks like the game is over
so don't try too hard.

811
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,185
It's not just business
with that man, is it?

812
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:09,105
If I don't get the money
from Min Kang-yun today,

813
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:12,275
both you and Kyung-ja are dead.

814
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:15,570
You're telling me
not to invest with Ma Kang-su?

815
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,281
I have a bomb
that will blow up the Closing.

816
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,867
I was thinking about
cutting a deal with you.
