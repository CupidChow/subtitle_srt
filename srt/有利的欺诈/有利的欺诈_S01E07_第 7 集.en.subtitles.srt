1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,267
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,443
Mom!

3
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,587
Attorney Han Moo-young. Any final words?

4
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,633
I was a judge advocate,
when I learned I had an illness.

5
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,470
I overly empathize with others

6
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,391
which affects me to the point
that makes it hard to live my own life.

7
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,937
That's why I took cases
that others couldn't understand.

8
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,773
Turning away from
the vulnerable, the poor,

9
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,235
and those in need

10
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,363
was the only way
I could function as a lawyer.

11
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,785
Lee Ro-eum had been in prison for
the horrifying crime of parricide,

12
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,205
but when I found out she had been framed

13
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,332
and had already served ten years,

14
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,126
I believed I could help her

15
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,587
by betraying the true killer,

16
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,049
and my client, Ye Chung-sik.

17
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,428
And for the first time, I felt that
justice had been delivered.

18
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,931
Through this, I realized

19
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,600
that the law

20
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,354
is not always fair to everyone.

21
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,898
Unlike in trials,

22
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,236
the world cannot be divided
into just guilt or innocence.

23
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,117
It was my decision
to inflict damage on my client.

24
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,870
I will not ask for leniency,

25
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,998
and accept the consequences.

26
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,881
The disciplinary hearing rules as follows.

27
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,427
We understand Attorney Han's
desire for justice,

28
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,430
and work ethics as an attorney.

29
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,599
However, you have inflicted
considerable damage

30
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,767
to your client
and violated the duty of good faith

31
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,644
which cannot be overlooked.

32
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,856
Therefore, taking under consideration
your mental health issues,

33
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,733
Attorney Han Moo-young

34
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,235
is suspended for three months.

35
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,289
This is all the money that
your husband brought to the game.

36
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,832
It's 500,000 dollars.

37
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,334
Would you like to check?

38
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,586
It's all right.

39
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,796
Okay, then goodbye.

40
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,256
Ms. President.

41
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,856
I mean,

42
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,276
if I'd known how much
you hated taking their money,

43
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,528
I would never have taken it.

44
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,281
It's not like I was taking their side.

45
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,449
I just…

46
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,992
I was in a bad situation,

47
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,786
so I borrowed from them.

48
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,205
I didn't know you'd be so mad over it.

49
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,332
And to be honest, that money

50
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,167
is probably just chump change for them.

51
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,044
If you had really
thought of me as a brother,

52
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,879
you could've repaid the loan for me.

53
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,464
But you…

54
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,759
You remember the revolver, right?

55
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,429
I don't have to bother explaining, do I?

56
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,434
You need me.

57
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,353
You need me, Ro-eum.

58
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,188
That's why you came to me.

59
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,612
You want me to tell you
why you're still under Red Eye's thumb?

60
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,197
Come on, Ro-eum. I…

61
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,865
It's because of your servility.

62
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,201
You better stay focused.

63
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,871
If you don't want to see
that gun again that is.

64
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,297
Han Moo-young still isn't here?

65
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,464
No.

66
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,676
How many sessions has he missed
including today?

67
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,014
Including the one he missed today…

68
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,016
That would be three.

69
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,892
Hmm…

70
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,859
What if

71
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,321
I just take off with it?

72
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,198
What?

73
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,200
What?

74
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,247
I'm just asking you to help me
return it to the rightful owner.

75
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,753
You've become really vague
now that you're temporarily on a break.

76
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,969
Oh, come on.

77
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,304
What do you take me for?

78
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,806
You know this is complicated.

79
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,769
It's not like I can deliver the money
by drone or something.

80
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,562
And why do you even have

81
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,856
Myeong-hun's
insurance money in the first place?

82
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,777
I can't tell you because of
attorney-client privilege.

83
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,695
What?

84
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,324
This has something to do with Seo Gye-suk?

85
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,533
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:13,247
I heard you asked Mr. Woo
to look into Red Eye.

87
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,583
You're staying in a touch with a reporter?

88
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,001
Yes.

89
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,294
Thanks to you.

90
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,879
You're staying in touch?

91
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,297
With Lee Ro-eum?

92
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,925
Yes.

93
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,218
Thanks to you.

94
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,930
Mr. Woo told me

95
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,890
he had a big story in the works.

96
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,560
Is this a part of that?

97
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,855
Am I a part of this big game?

98
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,690
What exactly do you think it is?

99
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,567
I may look calm on the outside,

100
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,820
but I'm paddling furiously
to keep afloat, like a swan.

101
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,656
I've been shedding
buckets of tears and sweat

102
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,699
just to stay in Seoul,

103
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,953
while gliding across the Han River

104
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,830
day and night.

105
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,706
Do you know what that's been like?

106
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,834
Just tell me one thing.

107
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,878
Is this something bad?

108
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,630
Tell me, based on your conscience.

109
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,009
No, it's not.

110
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,304
Fine, then leave it here.

111
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,098
I'll try to find a way to return it.

112
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,725
This is way more work

113
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,352
than what Mr. Woo has to do.

114
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,522
Oh, by the way,

115
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,150
I heard you're taking a three-month break.

116
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,401
Do you have a plan

117
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,654
for what you'll be doing?

118
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,201
You're still going to do this with Mr. Han

119
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,579
even after what I just told you?

120
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,748
Yes. What about it?

121
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,125
How could you?

122
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,503
He's not like us.

123
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,465
He may be suspended,
but he has a place to go back to.

124
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,842
He's not someone we can just use and dump.

125
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,929
Back then, we were young and didn't know
any better, but it's different now.

126
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,560
What is he to you?

127
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,230
Why don't you tell him yourself then?

128
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,817
Tell him who ruined his family
by running a con at 14.

129
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,363
You can't, for one reason.

130
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,158
Because you were a part of it.

131
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,495
You don't have the guts to tell him,

132
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,623
and you're whining about it to me,
acting all worried about him.

133
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,757
I have a job to do,
and that's what matters the most.

134
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,552
It's not any of your business who I use,

135
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,471
so keep your mouth shut.

136
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,766
If you don't want to ruin things that is.

137
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,124
ATTORNEY HAN MOO-YOUNG

138
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,750
Can I offer you something to drink?

139
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,464
Have a seat.

140
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,437
What's going on?

141
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,106
I'll tell you.

142
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,274
About what?

143
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,152
Why my parents died.

144
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,198
You want to be a part of this con.

145
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,658
Then you should at least know why.

146
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,204
Yeah.

147
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,372
Okay.

148
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,794
Ten years ago,

149
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,464
I had a plan.

150
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,094
A plan to get a hold of a weapon
big enough for the Chairman

151
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,681
to agree to a deal so that I could leave
Red Eye permanently.

152
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,769
It just so happened there was
someone who wanted to leave Red Eye too.

153
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,564
He found out something he shouldn't have.

154
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,442
The director of Red Eye.

155
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,737
Ahn Chae-hong.

156
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,215
The funny thing is

157
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,676
I was a part of his get-away plan.

158
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,099
Come here a sec.

159
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,185
Make it short.

160
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,443
I need you to come with me somewhere.

161
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,403
Where?

162
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,239
Cambodia or Singapore,
wherever I can get tickets to.

163
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,242
Also, you have a few passports, right?

164
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,411
I'll buy you what you need
when we get there.

165
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,162
Did the Chairman ditch you?

166
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,546
You know nothing.

167
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,549
Never mind.

168
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,843
What would be the point
of telling you anything?

169
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,636
Just come with me.

170
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,370
Ahn Chae-hong
compulsively recorded everything.

171
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,456
And for the ten years he ran Red Eye,

172
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,375
he kept a record of everything,
the politicians and businessmen

173
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,378
who had official and unofficial ties
to Red Eye, their positions,

174
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,256
and cash flows
that he could hold over them.

175
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,931
This will keep us alive.

176
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,935
Sort out the ones that will be
most useful to us as fast as you can,

177
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,979
so that it'll fit into one bag.

178
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,359
Ten years' worth
of Ahn Chae-hong's ledgers.

179
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,570
That was more than enough.

180
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,414
Get your passport and pack your things.

181
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,124
I'll send Chang-gi over in the morning.

182
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,753
Before the flight early the next morning,

183
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,963
I had only one choice.

184
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,425
Jang Kyung-ja.

185
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,019
It's been a while.

186
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,979
Yes, it's good to see you.

187
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,689
Has it been ten years?

188
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,650
Yes, already.

189
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,406
Don't just stand there!

190
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,658
Hurry!

191
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,825
What…

192
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,371
You need to tell me what's going on.

193
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,541
Shut up.

194
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,000
Shut up!

195
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,212
Where are your bags?

196
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,589
Me?

197
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,007
You want me to go alone?

198
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,842
Whose wife are you?

199
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,012
So just tell me what's going on.

200
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,056
You expect me to just leave everything?

201
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,936
I won't go without an explanation.

202
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,688
Just

203
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,315
tell me what this is about.

204
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,071
I found out today

205
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,782
who the Chairman is.

206
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,826
I saw him today.

207
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,329
I ran into him.

208
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,625
He knew I was digging into him.

209
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,419
What do you think he'll do to me?

210
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,380
I know who he is. He won't keep me alive.

211
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,341
We have to leave the country

212
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,427
before I get killed.

213
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,807
Ahn Chae-hong's escape
was a crisis for Jang Kyung-ja.

214
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,394
Because the man she devoted her life to

215
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,271
was someone else.

216
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,982
Yes.

217
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,526
We've had a long conversation

218
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,987
and we've gotten to know
each other quite well.

219
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,449
I think we learned a lot about you today.

220
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,163
I have one last important question.

221
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,082
As a working woman

222
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,711
and a successful CEO,

223
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,172
what is your driving force?

224
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,966
Your reason for living?

225
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,388
The person I love, of course.

226
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,641
I see.

227
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,105
Jay.

228
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,401
He was already there
when I joined Red Eye. Number zero.

229
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,362
The first Red Eye Kid.

230
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,034
Jay wasn't the type to leave
the country for a woman,

231
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,206
and for Jang Kyung-ja who didn't like me
because I knew Jay,

232
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,917
my escape was an opportunity.

233
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,127
So,

234
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,381
my proposal was actually

235
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,508
quite reasonable.

236
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,347
WE STILL LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE
SINCE YOU LEFT…

237
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,693
Hello?

238
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,528
This is Ro-eum.

239
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,197
Why are you calling me?

240
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,533
Mr. Ahn went home with a black bag, right?

241
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,244
If you hand that bag over to me,

242
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,121
you won't have to leave Korea.

243
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,998
Are you in?

244
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,917
What are you going to do with it?

245
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,712
Make a deal with the Chairman.

246
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,880
I'm going to leave,

247
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,509
and go back to my family.

248
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,013
If you hand over
the bag to me at midnight,

249
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,682
the Chairman will take care of
Ahn Chae-hong himself.

250
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:08,027
But just because
the proposal is reasonable,

251
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,321
doesn't mean the outcome will be too.

252
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,319
The press will be in a frenzy again.

253
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,907
That's not what I meant.

254
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,078
You know, the person who's there for you

255
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,539
when you think it's the end.

256
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,250
It could be your family,

257
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,461
or it could be a friend.

258
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:13,008
Someone you want to depend on

259
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,552
and walk with until the very end.

260
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,720
Yes.

261
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,641
Hearing you say that

262
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,228
reminds me of your company's values,

263
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,231
that being connected with people
should come before well-being.

264
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,286
Ms. Jang?

265
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,082
We still have to do our closing comments.

266
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,333
Is that all right with you?

267
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,212
Why don't you sit back down?

268
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,322
It's been a long time.

269
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,825
Yes.

270
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,493
It's been a long time.

271
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,203
Jay?

272
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,289
Ro-eum told you about Jay?

273
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,332
She said he was the first Red Eye Kid.

274
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,001
She didn't say anything else?

275
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,086
She told me what happened ten years ago.

276
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
Oh.

277
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,426
I've always wondered
about their relationship.

278
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,846
It's like they have some sort of bond.

279
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,891
Jay always listened to what Ro-eum said,

280
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,351
and Ro-eum looked comfortable
around him too.

281
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,853
Of course,

282
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,272
they were together at Red Eye the longest,

283
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,982
so I guess that's why,

284
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,734
but Da-jeong came to Red Eye

285
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,528
around the same time as Ro-eum,
but they weren't as close.

286
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,696
Both of them.

287
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,909
I learned later that Jang Kyung-ja
and Jay were in a relationship,

288
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,203
so I got why

289
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,914
she hated Ro-eum so much.

290
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,666
They both have a similar vibe.

291
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,835
This Jay person.

292
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,421
When Ro-eum tried to leave Red Eye,

293
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,465
did he help her?

294
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,633
Oh.

295
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,427
He was just like them in the end.

296
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,098
He sided with his girlfriend.

297
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,026
You're done?

298
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,819
Who was that earlier?

299
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,283
Who?

300
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,836
Where were you? I was looking for you.

301
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,047
The rest room.

302
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,275
We've had a long conversation

303
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,777
and we've gotten to know
each other quite well.

304
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,030
I think we learned a lot about you today.

305
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,532
Why are you watching this?

306
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,245
I have one last question.

307
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,331
-As a working woman…
-Yes?

308
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,501
And as a successful CEO…

309
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,258
Yes.

310
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,428
That's the kind of info I was looking for.

311
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,596
The connection.

312
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,016
What's the address?

313
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,146
That's not what I meant.

314
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,025
-The person who's there for you
-Yes.

315
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,360
when you think it's the end.

316
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,571
It could be your family…

317
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,906
The notebook in your inner pocket.

318
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,408
Why won't you show me that?

319
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,126
You want to see what's on this?

320
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,595
If you do,

321
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,972
you'll go to hell as well.

322
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,434
Do you know who I saw today?

323
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,686
The Chairman.

324
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,567
Only I know

325
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,070
who the Chairman is.

326
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,823
I'm saving your life.

327
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,495
Ahn Chae-hong tracked the Chairman

328
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,538
until the very end.

329
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,833
The red note book

330
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,128
that records the identity of the Chairman

331
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,298
who no one knows.

332
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,695
Jang Kyung-ja hid it,

333
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,740
and I'm going to steal it.

334
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,417
Hyemyung Hotel.

335
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,629
A hotel built in the 80s
and had a few stars.

336
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,798
Jang Kyung-ja's parents were VIPs here.

337
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,176
After her family lost their money
and her parents died,

338
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,054
she still kept the membership

339
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,430
because

340
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,934
they have a special floor
with a vault only for VIPs.

341
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,067
Recently…

342
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,777
at Greendale Hotel,

343
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,114
-A tooth…
-Toilet brush.

344
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,741
Yes, with a toilet brush.

345
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,369
Cups, cups.

346
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,620
Cups.

347
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,123
The cups in the rooms.

348
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,584
The news
that they were washed all together…

349
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,668
You saw that, right?

350
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,586
Yes.

351
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,796
But that could never happen at our hotel.

352
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,674
But I heard you have rats.

353
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,760
What? Where?

354
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,928
Uh…

355
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,431
Where was it? The parking lot?

356
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,807
Basement level 5.

357
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,436
That's where our vault is.

358
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,562
Yes, there.

359
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:45,150
Was it cockroaches or rats?

360
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,401
Or sandworms?

361
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,445
Uh, excuse me.

362
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,613
Excuse me.

363
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,200
Our hotel has never gotten
a complaint of that kind,

364
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,827
and we make sure to stay on top
of pest control.

365
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,247
You keep them at the hotel?

366
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,790
As pets?

367
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,543
What are you talking about?

368
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,379
I think I need to see for myself.

369
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,256
Of course.

370
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,591
You can go check.

371
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,178
Your ID has to be confirmed

372
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,472
to take the elevator to the vault.

373
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,808
I'll lead the way.

374
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,852
First, I need to see some ID.

375
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,487
Thank you for coming in for the interview
on such a short notice.

376
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,907
Why did you apply for

377
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,826
a contract position with your experience?

378
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,454
I was actually looking
for a contract position.

379
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,165
I'm planning on moving back abroad soon.

380
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,583
Mmm.

381
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,088
I see you've worked
at Spain's DAP Hotel for a long time.

382
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:52,676
You must know Niki Pojo.

383
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,849
I'm sorry.
I would appreciate it if you asked

384
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,144
professional, not personal questions.

385
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,189
We broke up recently.

386
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,941
He's a guy.

387
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,109
Niki.

388
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,576
We don't have, uh

389
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,161
any prejudices,

390
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,162
-you know.
-Yes.

391
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,455
Whatsoever.

392
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,999
Right?

393
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,752
These are the schedules

394
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,671
for the security and staff.

395
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,966
I'll check the wiring and switchboard
and run a simulation.

396
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,807
As you can see,
there's no way pests could get it.

397
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,146
It's in here.

398
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,024
The identity of the Chairman.

399
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,699
Oh, over there.

400
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,577
It's big enough for a mongoose
to get through.

401
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,912
Ma'am,

402
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,915
as you can see,
accessing this floor is very difficult.

403
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,876
We have double layers of security.

404
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,295
You need a one-time password
from the inside.

405
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,463
A mongoose?

406
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,674
How could that get inside?

407
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,553
Then, let's check to see

408
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,221
if you're right.

409
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,153
What the…

410
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,285
I guess that floor isn't airtight.

411
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,539
If the smoke is leaking like this,
no wonder you have pests.

412
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,083
I don't understand.

413
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,168
Ma'am.

414
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,586
You're mistaken, we…

415
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,129
Of course it leaks.

416
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,923
Their pan room isn't really a pan room.

417
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,633
The vent pipes are all fake too.

418
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,680
They digitized their safes in early 2000.

419
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,600
They added sensors and a cooling system,

420
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:08,603
and expanded the space
more than they should.

421
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,816
So the wall by the pan room
became thin like a fake wall.

422
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,818
So, if we can assess the pan room.

423
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,985
Fan room.

424
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,196
Pan room.

425
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,698
Fan.

426
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,617
Fan room.

427
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,077
Okay, okay.

428
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,832
So, if we can access the fan room,
I can tunnel into the vault.

429
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,712
You really have to put this up
to exterminate?

430
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,676
Then would you rather put a sign
that the vault floor is under repair?

431
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,428
No.

432
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,346
Please, don't.

433
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,808
Oh, remember the smoke
we showed you earlier?

434
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,769
That could blow towards this area.

435
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,938
Of course, it's not harmful at all.

436
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,859
Damn.

437
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,777
No way.

438
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,696
Come on.

439
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,658
The vault has a sensor inside.

440
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,369
It goes off
if more than one person goes in,

441
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,164
and if it detects
any unnecessary vibrations.

442
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,790
I'm going to tunnel a path,

443
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,835
but the wall itself will be torn down
on D-day.

444
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,713
So, only I can go in
and only I can open the vault.

445
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:17,881
Hey, you two.

446
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,156
What about the security cameras?

447
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,701
There are 12 in the lobby,
132 on the upper floors,

448
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,620
and 56 in the basement.

449
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,955
The security office is on level four.

450
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,040
If I work all night,

451
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,418
I'll be able to make a copy that
can play on a loop within 48 hours.

452
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,670
The vault floor is easier
since few people come and go.

453
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,132
There are no cameras inside
for privacy reasons.

454
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,176
Even if we get inside,
we need a one-time password

455
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,719
to open Jang Kyung's safe.

456
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,012
That's the problem.

457
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,015
We either have to access
the wi-fi she uses,

458
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,642
or get her cell phone.

459
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,062
No one here can go near her.

460
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,445
I'm not close to that woman.

461
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,989
It was Jay who brought me the money.

462
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,033
I'll go.

463
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,246
How?

464
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,747
Under what pretext?

465
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,707
I'm a suspended lawyer.

466
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,334
Because of you.

467
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,132
Okay, fine.

468
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,969
You can go in as yourself.

469
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,097
A week from now, on December 9,

470
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,183
Jang Kyung-ja made an appointment
to the vault.

471
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,936
That's our D-day.

472
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,864
You're going back to your place?

473
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,699
Where's my revolver?

474
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,450
What are you going to do with it?

475
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,618
What do you think?

476
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,620
Would I scratch my back with it?

477
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,917
I would want to kill him too.

478
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,295
But not everyone

479
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,547
puts their thoughts into action.

480
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,215
Because they don't have what it takes.

481
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,800
Because it's not worth it.

482
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,804
Those people
aren't worth risking your life over.

483
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,348
Your premise is wrong.

484
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,267
Not all lives are worth something.

485
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,228
Even your own life?

486
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,607
Not after all the things I did.

487
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,986
I have no desire to be forgiven
as a perpetrator.

488
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,282
So I'm hoping my perpetrators
have that much conscience at least.

489
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,994
I don't need a ride.

490
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,924
I have one last important question.

491
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,592
As a working woman

492
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,386
and a successful CEO

493
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,430
what is your driving force?

494
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,808
Your reason for living?

495
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,648
The person I love, of course.

496
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,274
RESUME: HAN MOO-YOUNG

497
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,598
Attorney Han Moo-young?

498
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,268
Hello.

499
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,777
We're going to access
the wi-fi at her office.

500
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,488
I installed an app for you.

501
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,498
Is the lounge okay with you?

502
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,626
Or would you prefer
to go somewhere more private?

503
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,629
Why don't we go to your office?

504
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,552
The meeting room is okay, right?

505
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,554
Yes, of course.

506
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,722
Have a seat.

507
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,891
What if I can't get into her office?

508
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,102
Then we'll use Bluetooth.

509
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,270
Na-sa.

510
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,274
Link this to your phone.

511
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,110
Put it within a meter
to the phone you want to hack.

512
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,741
Press this, then this.

513
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,659
Press this first.

514
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,369
Oh.

515
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,913
I'll try that again.

516
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,999
Press this, then this.

517
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,084
Press this, then this.

518
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,336
Are you technically challenged?

519
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,213
It's not that hard.

520
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,717
Press this, then…

521
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,968
Press this… Uh…

522
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,344
It's not working.

523
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,930
This is going to take all day.

524
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,100
It'll search for cell phones
in the vicinity for ten seconds,

525
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,561
then once it gets a hit,
it'll connect for 30 seconds.

526
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,396
I'll call you back later.

527
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,440
Then it'll take
at least two and a half minutes.

528
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,150
Three minutes would be best.

529
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,450
I agreed to see you because
you said this wouldn't take long,

530
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,078
but I have a meeting soon
so I can't give you much time.

531
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,581
I won't take up too much of your time.
Thank you.

532
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,584
I was curious

533
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,045
about Lee Ro-eum's lawyer.

534
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,213
And also,

535
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:55,134
why a lawyer who got suspended
because of her wanted to meet me.

536
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,721
My suspension will be over soon.

537
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,058
I wanted to meet you in person

538
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,935
and ask you about something.

539
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,146
I don't know if I can answer anything.

540
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,690
Only you can answer my questions.

541
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,901
For example,

542
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,986
about Director Ahn Chae-hong,

543
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,073
or the truth about Red Eye.

544
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,703
She still hasn't let go of that?

545
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,081
She still has questions?

546
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:29,043
How much do you know about Lee Ro-eum?

547
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,670
Not much at all.

548
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,089
Other than the fact
she was a scholarship student.

549
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,549
I never took much interest in her.

550
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,135
She has a lot in common with you.

551
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,471
You both lost family
on the same day in 2012,

552
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,765
and you were both suspected
for their deaths.

553
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,225
The only difference is,

554
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,519
her name was cleared,

555
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,856
but the case still follows you around.

556
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,442
Is that why you came to see me?

557
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,945
To see if I really killed my husband?

558
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,531
No.

559
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,201
I want to know who killed him.

560
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,125
By any chance,
do you know who the Chairman is?

561
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,879
The Chairman?

562
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,257
Before Ye Chung-sik died,
the man behind the Geumseong murders,

563
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,635
he told me about the real power
behind Red Eye.

564
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,931
About the actual person behind
the Geumseong murders, the Chairman.

565
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,935
Do you know who he is?

566
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,232
What Chairman are you talking about?

567
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,570
I heard he was
the secret leader behind Red Eye.

568
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,906
Your husband never said anything?

569
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,534
This is the first time
I'm ever hearing about a Chairman.

570
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:47,914
I believe this Chairman
is also behind your husband's death.

571
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,552
What if it disconnects?

572
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,971
Then start over.

573
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,807
Press this.

574
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,856
Okay. And once it's done?

575
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,776
Then I'll make it buzz. Don't worry.

576
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,780
You don't even have a name.

577
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,532
All you have is a nickname,

578
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,953
and you want to dig into a case
that happened ten years ago?

579
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,205
Don't you think that's a little rash?

580
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,166
I thought you would
want to get to the truth

581
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,293
of your husband's death.

582
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,880
Me?

583
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,215
I saw the show.

584
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,385
If seemed like you would
do anything for the person you loved.

585
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,012
Please, sit down.

586
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,347
I believe

587
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,683
that you are the one person

588
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,977
who will tell me the truth about Red Eye.

589
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,107
If I do,

590
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,360
will you keep it confidential?

591
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,446
I could be your lawyer if you need one.

592
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,174
To me, Red Eye was
just where my husband worked.

593
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,594
I didn't know anything about
what was going on there,

594
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:29,473
During the time I paid back the money
he embezzled after he died,

595
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,017
and the foundation dissolved,

596
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,644
I never heard of a Chairman.

597
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,896
That's all I know.

598
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,064
I'm sorry.

599
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,444
You didn't know anything
about what they did,

600
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,779
and you just thought

601
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,531
it was an ordinary foundation?

602
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,537
Why? Did Lee Ro-eum say
anything different?

603
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,622
Well, it's not ordinary

604
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,667
for a foundation to prevent a child
from seeing her family

605
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,461
for ten years.

606
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,421
Why is that the foundation's fault?

607
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,966
In my opinion, it was her own choice.

608
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,928
Family doesn't mean anything
to someone like her.

609
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,099
Didn't you just say you didn't know her?

610
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,269
Some things, you can just tell.

611
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,021
She was never really a child,

612
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,899
and that smart brain of hers was a curse.

613
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,484
Look what happened to her.

614
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,198
I finally see why

615
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,367
not a single adult in Red Eye

616
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,494
stood up for their scholarship students.

617
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,953
A true grownup

618
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,414
would never define
a teenage girl in that way.

619
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,753
People are shaped once they are born.

620
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,172
If it were me, I would never have

621
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,674
that kind of bias
against a child I don't know.

622
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,011
And I would at least feel
a little guilty over the things I said.

623
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,227
That illness you have…

624
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,313
Being excessively empathetic.

625
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,274
I hear
you can't turn away from people in need.

626
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,777
And that's why you helped Lee Ro-eum.

627
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,280
I see you've done your research.

628
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,991
Of course.

629
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,618
I can't just meet anyone.

630
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,371
I agreed to meet
because I thought it'd be interesting.

631
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,796
You have a call.

632
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,051
Answer it. It's fine with me.

633
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,771
My car key was stuck.

634
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,824
I took up too much of your time.
I apologize. I'll get going then.

635
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,459
My illness doesn't make me
help just anyone.

636
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,296
It only makes me relate to people
who are worthy of empathy.

637
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,675
Mr. Han.

638
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,855
I can't hire you then.

639
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,581
Tell Mr. Park I said hello.

640
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,043
You know our managing partner?

641
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,920
Didn't you know?

642
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,671
We play golf together.

643
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,135
He seems to care about you very much.

644
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,974
He's someone who knows how to
look out for people in this tough world.

645
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,477
We should have a meal together

646
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,437
when your

647
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,980
suspension is over.

648
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,566
Let's do that.

649
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,953
Call me anytime.

650
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,790
I'd like to see you more often.

651
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,614
Oh, hey…

652
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,418
Did you tell Jang Kyung-ja about me?

653
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,128
What?

654
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,713
The CEO of Navis Well-being.

655
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,423
How do you know her?

656
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,260
I got to know her
playing golf a few times.

657
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,472
She's really nice, isn't she?

658
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,100
Did you talk about me?

659
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:27,187
Just this and that.
There was a lot going on with you.

660
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:31,442
I just talked to her
about the people I work with…

661
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,863
Don't do that again.

662
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,489
Stay away from her.

663
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,682
ATTORNEY HAN MOO-YOUNG

664
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,146
What?

665
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,606
Where are you?

666
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:11,815
Your place?

667
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,318
Have you eaten yet?

668
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,031
No.

669
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,532
Do you want to get some ramyeon?

670
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,326
I'll go over to your neighborhood.

671
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,286
No.

672
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,454
I'll go to you.

673
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,873
Okay then.

674
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,099
What?

675
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,727
In case you ask more questions
in exchange for ramyeon.

676
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,938
Did I do that?

677
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,189
Always.

678
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:53,690
Eat up.

679
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,109
I won't make you talk.

680
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,253
No questions?

681
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,505
I didn't ask you over to ask questions.

682
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,257
I just wanted to make you some ramyeon.

683
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,476
Your illness…

684
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,727
What's the cause?

685
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,521
My illness?

686
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,647
Yes.

687
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,316
Did you bang your head
when you were a kid or something?

688
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,987
No, I was just

689
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,115
always a sensitive kid.

690
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,201
I was a judge advocate in the military.

691
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,496
You get to work as an officer
once you pass the bar.

692
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,584
Anyway, that's when I realized
how serious it was.

693
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,422
You the one asking me questions now?

694
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,346
I know you didn't ask,

695
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,974
but there's only one reason why
I became a lawyer.

696
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,352
It was because I met a kind adult
who gave me hope when I was weak.

697
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,695
If you had met

698
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,157
someone like that that day,

699
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,869
maybe things could've been different.

700
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,079
That's what I think.

701
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:36,001
But it feels like you're blaming yourself
instead of the environment you are in,

702
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,253
and that weighed on my mind.

703
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,007
That's why

704
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,176
I can't give you the revolver.

705
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,221
I know I said I would help you
get your revenge.

706
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,890
but I believe there's a better ending.

707
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,270
And what's that?

708
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,650
Judging the Chairman by the law,

709
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,737
not by your hand.

710
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,656
Openly and safely.

711
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,700
That's the only thing a lawyer can do,

712
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,329
and it's the only way
to protect your life too.

713
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,675
It's definitely an illness.

714
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:29,513
You're too nice
and that's why you got that illness.

715
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,641
You should learn how to ignore things.

716
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,353
It's not like you can make the world
a better place.

717
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,450
I'm not nice.

718
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,786
And I'm not moral.

719
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,497
You don't know me.

720
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,874
Also,

721
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,795
I'm way past the stage of ignoring
thanks to you.

722
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,132
I've never told anyone,

723
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,342
but my illness has gotten better
after I met you.

724
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,264
So, you're using me?

725
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,309
That's not what I meant.

726
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,686
Use me. What's wrong with that?

727
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,938
I'm using you.

728
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,655
This is interesting.

729
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,245
Since you're smart, you should know

730
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,206
about the theory that

731
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,751
all people are connected
by six degrees of separation.

732
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,962
I know you, and through you,

733
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,631
I know Han Moo-young,

734
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,925
and he knows Na Su-ho,

735
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,095
and I just happen to be
his probation officer.

736
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,555
But I,

737
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,225
who knows Su-ho, who knows you,

738
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,019
who knows Ro-eum, who I know,

739
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,148
came to this comic book store
to meet the hacker who runs this place,

740
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,775
and ran into you.

741
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:54,533
I guess you and this hacker
know each other.

742
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:58,495
I know that Korea is pretty small,

743
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,374
but all these people
are within six degrees.

744
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,501
And there's even one spot left.

745
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,169
Wow.

746
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,131
How do you all know each other?

747
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,175
Friends?

748
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,344
No.

749
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,512
Family?

750
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,973
No, no, no.

751
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,225
Then…

752
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:23,729
Captives?

753
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,650
That would make a little sense.

754
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,861
Let's say,

755
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,531
if you were scholarship students
of the same foundation.

756
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,658
For example.

757
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,664
Who are you?

758
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,087
You know me.

759
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,383
I'm your probation officer.

760
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,221
Call him.

761
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,601
Your lawyer.

762
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,561
Call him.

763
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,644
Why am I hiding?

764
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,783
Did you know

765
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,036
they're all part of a team?

766
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,664
Are you working with them too?

767
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,752
Is the fact that I know them a problem?

768
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,672
What do you want?

769
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,133
What do you think?

770
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,303
My job as a probation officer

771
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,723
is to keep an eye on
and protect my probationer.

772
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,893
I'll be sharing everything I know

773
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,938
with the agency I am part of,

774
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,649
and I'll be tracking
every single thing you do,

775
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,694
and every single breath you take.

776
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,195
And I will start with

777
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,364
what happened

778
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:42,409
at Nasa Car Center on November 22.

779
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,082
Mr. Han,

780
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,294
persuade me.

781
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,713
Plead their case.

782
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,842
Tell me why I should look the other way.

783
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,152
Why are you working so late?

784
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,862
I'm writing up warrants.

785
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,575
SUMMONS

786
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,951
It's a summons.

787
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,079
LEE RO-EUM

788
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,750
I'm just writing them up in advance.

789
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,460
For all of them.

790
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:34,878
What?

791
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,241
What are you making?

792
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,079
Do you need some help?

793
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,840
Do you know why there are
so many Yo-hans in comic books?

794
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,555
Do you?

795
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:31,309
You're the owner so I thought
you might know.

796
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,229
I've always been curious about that
ever since I was a kid.

797
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:54,874
Just kill me now.

798
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,501
How could you say that?

799
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,294
Let's talk.

800
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,755
Right. I heard you got suspended.

801
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,386
Things are moving too slow.

802
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:10,015
How are we going to shake him off
for half a day to go to the hotel?

803
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,725
What a pain.

804
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,270
My guys are getting an IV drip.

805
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,064
Can the probation officer

806
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,567
really put away Ro-eum and Na-sa?

807
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,318
He could if he got a subpoena.

808
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,197
Such a huge pain.

809
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,532
But

810
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:30,160
what if he chooses our D-day
to make a move?

811
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:34,289
So far, it was one person doing the luring
while the others got away,

812
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,708
but we'll all be in one spot on that day.

813
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,462
Can you look into Go Yo-han?

814
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,547
What are you planning to do?

815
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,279
GARAGE

816
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,140
Everyone's hiding?

817
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,019
I was just about to make my way
to Ro-eum's place.

818
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,562
She won't be there though, will she?

819
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,314
No.

820
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,690
I'm the only one left.

821
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,528
You can come see me.

822
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,208
Come on in.

823
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,168
Mr. Han.

824
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,756
Have a seat.

825
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,341
What are you scheming?

826
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,051
You wanted me to plead their case.

827
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,638
I'll do that.

828
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,498
All set.

829
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,333
Let's do this.

830
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,344
Go.

831
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,705
Just get to the point.

832
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,374
We have to start all over.

833
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,626
How much time
before Jang Kyung-ja arrives?

834
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,503
Mr. Han?

835
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:12,632
Mother, I heard you selected
the scholarship students for Red Eye.

836
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,176
They overly obsess over the endgame.

837
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,220
Whatever they do,
they'll end up messing it up.

838
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,098
Get the notebook
and get out of there, quick.

839
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,766
Make sure he doesn't come back.

840
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,685
Where is Ro-eum?

841
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:27,605
I'll make you realize
that you're only a pawn too.
