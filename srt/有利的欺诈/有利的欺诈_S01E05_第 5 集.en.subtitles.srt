00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,058
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,517
CHILD ACTORS FILMED
UNDER GUARDIAN SUPERVISION

3
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,637
Father.

4
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,277
Where is your father?

5
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,578
Moo-young! Han Moo-young!

6
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,790
Hold on.

7
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,961
From now on, talk to me.

8
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,381
Just call me.

9
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,770
Let's do it together.

10
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,647
Whatever is it you're trying to do.

11
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,233
And what is that?

12
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,359
Conning.

13
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,822
What do you mean?

14
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:37,991
Exactly what I said.

15
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,701
Let's do it together.

16
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,244
Whether it's revenge or a con.

17
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,037
Revenge…

18
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,123
Or a con…

19
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,709
We'll do it your way.

20
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,339
I'll help you get your revenge.

21
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,802
You're talking like you know
what I'm going to do.

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,518
Woah, Da-jeong.

23
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,395
It's getting so chilly in here.

24
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,691
Is that why you lied?

25
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,571
You said you'd report me
but then represented Ringo.

26
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,282
You told me to save Ringo

27
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,534
but to let the high schoolers go.

28
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,995
You were nowhere near the police

29
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,039
but you told me they were on their way,

30
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,458
tracking us already.
You lied, didn't you?

31
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,170
Answer me.

32
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,756
Yes.

33
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,424
I lied.

34
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,886
So,

35
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,432
how do you expect me to trust you
and run a con with you?

36
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,519
Because, you need me.

37
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,608
When this is all over
and you get caught,

38
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,486
I'll be there.

39
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,322
As someone who knows
the full story,

40
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,742
and the only attorney
who will represent you.

41
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,588
Apparently, you blowing off
the damages suit was the last straw.

42
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,427
The Bar Association
is questioning your judgment.

43
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,057
The judgment of our ace attorney.

44
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,982
I… I'm okay.

45
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,818
I'm totally okay. This won't shake me.
I won't even blame you.

46
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,153
I'm not that small-minded.
I'm the head of this firm.

47
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,572
Park Gyu, Managing Partner
of Park & Cue.

48
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,493
I've started meditating lately.

49
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,869
I can regulate myself.

50
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,289
I… I can control my feelings.

51
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,250
This is called
the 3-3-3 breathing technique.

52
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,376
Inhale for three seconds.

53
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,919
Then exhale for three seconds.

54
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,172
Then make an "ah" sound
from your lower abdomen.

55
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,098
It's no big deal.
We'll prep for the disciplinary hearing.

56
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,725
We'll be ready.

57
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,268
How, you ask?

58
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,936
How do you think?

59
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,813
Quietly.

60
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,648
Without causing a fuss.

61
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,358
Without getting caught up or meddling,

62
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,694
or sticking your nose in here and there.

63
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,737
Keep a low profile.

64
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,490
A low profile.

65
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,453
We can sort this out.

66
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,621
We have to.

67
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,082
Now get out. Inhale.

68
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,336
Get out.

69
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,546
Exhale.

70
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,717
You can go, I'm fine.

71
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,147
Ah.

72
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,691
Ah, ah.

73
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,210
DISCIPLINARY HEARING NOTICE

74
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,094
I'm Han Moo-young.

75
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,305
Oh, you're the lawyer.

76
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,308
Da-jeong told me about you.

77
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,185
You offered to represent me?

78
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,478
Yes.

79
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:36,979
Why?

80
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,024
Because I'm interested.

81
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,694
Oh.

82
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,864
Ro-eum does have an irresistible charm.

83
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,533
I agree.

84
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:52,036
Not just in Ro-eum,
but you and Da-jeong too.

85
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,414
I'm interested in all of you.

86
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,958
What the heck?

87
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,334
Why?

88
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,585
It's an illness.

89
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,797
I need your help.

90
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,133
I have a lot of questions.

91
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,175
Oh.

92
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,889
Three questions.

93
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,225
I'll take three questions.

94
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,853
Since you helped
Ro-eum and Da-jeong,

95
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,980
and you offered to represent me
in an emergency.

96
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,273
Deal?

97
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,484
First, I'd like to know

98
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,279
why you, Ro-eum, and Da-jeong
are a "we."

99
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,321
Oh…

100
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,492
Have you ever heard of
the Red Eye Kids?

101
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,079
It's the nickname Red Eye gave Ro-eum
when they gave her a scholarship.

102
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,206
Yes, so you know.

103
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,750
Ro-eum was number one.

104
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,213
Da-jeong was number two.

105
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,303
Na-sa was number three.

106
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,096
Let's take the picture.

107
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,267
And number four,

108
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:57,977
Me.

109
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,778
I was the youngest
and officially, the last Red Eye Kid.

110
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,040
Are you going to go?

111
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,833
SHIN GI-HO HAS PASSED AWAY.

112
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,670
I was invited so I should.

113
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,048
What about Jang Kyung-ja?

114
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,841
I think she'll be landing as scheduled.

115
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,426
Okay.

116
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,679
What about Han Moo-young?

117
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,805
Dig into him.

118
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,934
Find out everything you can
about him and bring it to me.

119
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,467
American style?

120
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,385
Yup.

121
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,447
Excuse me.

122
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,492
Are you Ms. Lee Ro-eum?

123
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,081
I'm Jung Seong-ho,
Professor Shin's personal assistant.

124
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,791
It was his wish

125
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,960
to repay his debt.

126
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,590
Here. You'll be able to find
what you want in here.

127
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,017
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,519
I didn't

129
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,812
tell you.

130
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,318
It's been a while since
I stopped taking my meds.

131
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,155
When my ability to feel came back,
I started remembering

132
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,906
who I used to be.

133
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,286
It was so painful
that I even passed out.

134
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,622
I was a mess

135
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,708
and didn't really get anything done.

136
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,379
But for the first time in a while,
I was at peace.

137
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,797
I may be a nobody

138
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,925
but being myself gave me peace.

139
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,805
I became a lawyer to help people,

140
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,976
but my excessive empathy
didn't help them at all.

141
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,439
I think I can be different now.

142
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,443
Stopping crime as someone
in the legal profession,

143
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,779
and siding with my clients
as an attorney…

144
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,032
It might be possible to do both.

145
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,078
Hmm… Did you find a way?

146
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,039
I'm going to go

147
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,124
into the eye of the storm.

148
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,918
What do you mean?

149
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,255
I'm going to run a con.

150
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,656
Bring Na-sa.

151
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,575
We have to be at
the auto repair shop by five.

152
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,788
I'm not sure,
but I think we'll need a lawyer.

153
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,672
Some people just need
a dose of reality to get it.

154
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,425
I'll show you

155
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,095
the difference between a lawyer
and a con artist.

156
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,601
AUTO REPAIR SHOP

157
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:34,920
Na-sa.

158
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,381
What the heck?

159
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,010
Time out.

160
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,052
Stop playing.

161
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,220
I'm serious. I'll be right back.

162
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,263
Damn it.

163
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,514
Hey.

164
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,224
My buddy.

165
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,226
Glad you came.

166
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,021
-Do you have some money?
-Geez, you reek of booze.

167
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,732
-Hey, what's with your eyes?
-Sheesh.

168
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,401
Who are the dudes hanging around
the auto repair shop?

169
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,696
No idea. Do you have any money or not?
Can you get a cash advance?

170
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,741
If you don't know, who does?
Did you go to a loan shark again?

171
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,035
Shove off, dude.

172
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,538
Ro-eum is out. Did you know?

173
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,170
If you're not gonna give me any money,
just get the hell away from me.

174
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,216
-What the hell?
-What?

175
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,634
I told you not to deal.

176
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,177
Why were you playing without me?

177
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,638
Are you scamming me
out of my money? Huh?

178
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,474
Deal the cards again.
Don't mess with me, damn it.

179
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,644
Let's get
the auto repair shop back first.

180
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,479
Who's this?

181
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,897
Our lawyer.

182
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,732
We have a lawyer?

183
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,276
Yes, we do now.

184
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,321
A lawyer?

185
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,617
Okay.

186
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,629
Hi.

187
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,217
This is Attorney Han Moo-young.

188
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,635
And this is Na-sa.

189
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,303
Hello.

190
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,141
So, there are some
scary dudes here.

191
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,145
You know that law about illegally
squatting on someone else's business?

192
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,397
Can you go and tell them?

193
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,065
Thanks.

194
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,024
Right.

195
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,235
But no one's here.

196
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,249
You look good.

197
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,211
Hey.

198
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,296
Ro… Ro-eum.

199
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,089
It's good to see you.

200
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,884
I sent those lenders away.

201
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,845
Uh, they left, just like that?

202
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,680
How much did you borrow from them?

203
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,017
I… I'm… I'm paying them back.

204
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,852
It wasn't much, really.

205
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,353
Doing what?

206
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,814
What are you doing to pay them back?

207
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,732
Oh… Uh…

208
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,943
I just fix up cars and…

209
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,947
You don't have a bookie?

210
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,575
What? What are you talking about?

211
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,743
Of course not.

212
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,707
Ro-eum.

213
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,001
Looks like you already met.

214
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,085
That was fast.

215
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,381
Na Su-ho.

216
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,674
Yes, Ro-eum?

217
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,469
Can I borrow this place?

218
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,388
Huh? What…?

219
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,602
I found an easy target
but I need a place to gamble.

220
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,738
Woah.

221
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,838
Park Jong-gu.

222
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,217
Runs a waste disposal facility
in North Gyeonggi with his wife.

223
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,638
He has a long rap sheet for gambling,
sexual harassment, and assault.

224
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,725
He goes in and out of police stations
and got away with fines several times.

225
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,644
The last time
he went on a gambling spree

226
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,979
was in the winter of 2021.

227
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,524
He barely got away from the crackdown
on gambling dens in the North.

228
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,735
Because of that, gambling dens
have completely dried up in that area.

229
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,778
Woah.

230
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,488
He must be
itching to gamble then.

231
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,739
I'll lure in the target.

232
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,199
With Ringo.

233
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,659
Okay.

234
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,494
Na-su, you build the gambling house

235
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:39,164
and set up cameras and transceivers
so that we can read the cards.

236
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,918
You set up
a background for me and Ringo

237
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,336
and get me everything

238
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,505
on Park Jong-gu's suppliers,
personal schedule,

239
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,048
and financial assets.

240
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,258
Also…

241
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,718
Why does it have to be him?

242
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,055
Because he has a lot of money.

243
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,306
Why do you need money?

244
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,642
What kind of question is that?

245
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,602
We're living in an age of capitalism.

246
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,689
Why do you need money
to go after Red Eye?

247
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,621
For god's sake,

248
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,539
Da-jeong.

249
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,624
Am I the only one
who finds this awkward?

250
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,128
Because we do.

251
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,507
Red Eye is not some tiny
mom-and-pop shop.

252
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,637
Then why does it have to be
Park Jong-gu's money?

253
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,848
You have a lot of questions.

254
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,687
If we break him, we get a bonus.

255
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,646
Satisfied?

256
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,192
I'll tell you more
once we break him first.

257
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,236
If you're just here to play detective,
you should quit now.

258
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,323
Besides, our engineer here owes money.

259
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,454
It's not that much.

260
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,876
For real, it's not that much.

261
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,505
Hey.

262
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,715
Thanks.

263
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,758
I mean it.

264
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,384
We'll be playing Go-Stop.

265
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,512
There will be three teams of four.

266
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,056
In addition to our player,
we'll hire actors.

267
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,766
Bring your gambling buddies.

268
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,683
Got it.

269
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,727
Who's going to be our player?

270
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,062
He's right here.

271
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,236
He's also our bank.

272
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,947
Are you talking about
Myeong-hun's insurance payout?

273
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,116
If you can bankroll this
with your own money, you can.

274
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,785
Why do we have to use that money?

275
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,287
Because that money

276
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,165
is evidence that you're an accomplice.

277
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,042
Ro-eum.

278
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,710
You said you were in

279
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,837
on our con.

280
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,882
If you're getting cold feet,
you can get out right now.

281
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,053
Are you out?

282
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,269
Myeong-hun's adoptive parents
apparently still believe you.

283
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,689
Even in jail, they're telling people
their son will be going

284
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,524
to the States to study.

285
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,193
But once they hire an attorney

286
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,154
and realize the situation they're in,

287
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,614
it'll only be a matter of time
before they find out.

288
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,242
I'll just send them a couple
of pamphlets then.

289
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,004
Their attention is on the trial for now,

290
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,464
and the insurance company
will only sue after their sentence,

291
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,591
so there's no rush.

292
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,302
We have to give it back
once we're done here.

293
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,015
If taking someone else's money
weighs so much on your conscience,

294
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,558
how are you going to trick

295
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,226
Park Jong-gu?

296
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,978
To gamble or not is his choice.

297
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,063
But this is gambling fraud.

298
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,607
You're just rationalizing it.

299
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,284
What are you doing?

300
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,535
Not today.

301
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,162
I'll bring it

302
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,497
to the repair shop on the day.
Will that be okay?

303
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,127
Just get some practice.

304
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,337
Don't ruin it.

305
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,068
Come out when you're done.

306
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,320
-I'll walk you to the bus stop.
-No, thanks.

307
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,701
The bus will be arriving shortly…

308
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,161
By the way,

309
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,705
do you know a hacker by any chance?

310
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,709
It's just that

311
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,796
this is my phone,

312
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,798
and I think it's been hacked.

313
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,467
-You can't turn it on?
-No.

314
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,969
Then did your bank account
get cleaned out?

315
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,553
-No.
-Then what?

316
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,642
It's just weird.

317
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,395
Then, just use it.

318
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,440
Yeah, what would you know
about electronic devices anyway?

319
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,152
You can go now.

320
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,737
I can take a bus from here.

321
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,905
Where are you going?

322
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,407
I have some place to go too.

323
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,287
You're not going to ask where?

324
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,997
Where are you going?

325
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,082
Well, in my case…

326
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,582
Lee Se-hwa of Geoddeun Foods.
You went to art school in the States

327
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,667
but returned to learn
the family business.

328
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,336
You're looking into

329
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,838
the cost of waste disposal
to move your factory.

330
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,176
Here you go.

331
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,222
I'm Yoo-il, that's Yoo-neung.

332
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,058
We're Ringo's left arm and right arm.

333
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,060
We're his arms.

334
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,686
Having both arms is important.

335
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,063
Right.

336
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,315
He'll also be helping out.

337
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,026
I'm Han Moo-young.
I appreciate your help.

338
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:45,155
So, we'll be playing Go-Stop.

339
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,073
Okay.

340
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,700
How will this go?

341
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,000
Here.

342
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,301
Did you find your way here okay?

343
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,220
It's so out-of-the-way.

344
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,554
Why don't we go in?

345
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,185
Here you go.

346
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,231
Don't you have any iced Americano?

347
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,691
Who drinks instant these days?

348
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,238
You're the boss?

349
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,409
I'm the director, Shim Gyeong-hwa.

350
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,702
I see.

351
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,122
Then where's the boss?

352
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,665
He's on his way.

353
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,211
I'll just be making a phone call then.

354
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,212
Oh.

355
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,716
Of course.

356
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,325
Geez…

357
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,452
This is so upsetting.

358
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,412
AHN YOON-SIK

359
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,080
I'm the only one getting older.

360
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,183
Don't drink too much.

361
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,643
I know you have a bad back.

362
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,576
Park Jong-gu likes women

363
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,120
who are young, bubbly, and giggly.

364
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,749
But he doesn't like them easy.

365
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,794
He prefers high-risk, high-return,
just like gambling.

366
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,423
Hello.

367
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,591
I…

368
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,012
Oh, I'm sorry.
This will only take a sec.

369
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,100
Is it that easy
to find a gambling den?

370
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,853
Wow, I'm so disappointed in you.

371
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,904
I did study the rules a bit,

372
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,948
but can we do
a practice game first?

373
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,074
Oh, sure.

374
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,159
Let's do that.

375
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,747
I'm sorry about that.

376
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,043
An attorney friend of mine

377
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,836
is deep into gambling.

378
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,548
I mean, I get why.

379
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,134
Do you know how to play Go-Stop too?

380
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,052
Excuse me?

381
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:56,888
Oh my.

382
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,184
You must go by the book.

383
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,145
One of those civil servant types.

384
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,772
Oh, well…

385
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,482
I wouldn't say that…

386
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,361
He's an only son and believes
that men are superior,

387
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,656
but he doesn't have any skills compared
to his very capable wife,

388
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,950
so he has a major inferiority complex.

389
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,368
Actually,

390
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:22,205
Your wife wanted to talk business

391
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,875
but what's the point
of talking to another woman?

392
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,461
You're the boss.

393
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,799
Yes, that's true.

394
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,800
Uh-huh.

395
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,552
Okay, what will you do now?

396
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,137
-Call.
-Call?

397
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,805
Die?

398
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,515
Darn, I'm out.

399
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,267
-You?
-Call.

400
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,562
Call? Okay, then

401
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,189
on three we'll show our cards.

402
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,149
Okay.

403
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,860
Okay, one, two, three.

404
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,034
-Huh?
-Huh?

405
00:26:59,117 --> 00:26:59,951
Huh?

406
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,036
Did I play good?

407
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,288
What…

408
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,415
How did you end up with this?

409
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,502
My dad
told me to check it out.

410
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,213
It's cleaner than I expected.

411
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,342
I dressed casually since I was coming
to a waste disposal company.

412
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,635
Oh… uh…

413
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,096
This is our office,

414
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,766
and the waste is treated
at a different site.

415
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,268
I see.

416
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,938
I heard that the waste disposal business
is quite promising these days.

417
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,067
How did you get into this line of work?

418
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,612
I love listening to men
talk about their success stories.

419
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,741
Well…

420
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,368
Excuse me.

421
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,452
Oh, yes.

422
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,121
What now?

423
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,916
Yeah.

424
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,125
You found a place?

425
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,046
Yeah.

426
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,255
Me?

427
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,465
I…

428
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,675
Do I have to be there?

429
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,471
You only call me the goddess of luck
when you need me.

430
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,139
The heck I am.

431
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,141
Okay.

432
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,686
Moran? Isn't that in the country?

433
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,731
Fine, okay.

434
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,442
Okay!

435
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,152
Yeah.

436
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,488
He must've found a place.

437
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,240
Excuse me?

438
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,409
A gambling den.

439
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,119
Oh.

440
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,204
I guess so.

441
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,497
Apparently,

442
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,958
he found one all the way in Moran.

443
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,751
I can't seem to stop him.

444
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,587
So, what were we talking about?

445
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,928
Geez, this is so unfair.
I can't do this anymore.

446
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,179
You shuffle.

447
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,097
Hey.

448
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,515
Let's play a different game.

449
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,766
-Okay?
-Okay.

450
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,684
Just play
the same game.

451
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,894
No, you keep winning.
Just change it.

452
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,020
He doesn't get it yet.

453
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,647
No.

454
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,065
Two cards each.

455
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,243
PRISONER CALL FOR YE X-SIK REQUEST
HAS BEEN APPROVED.

456
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,626
Hey. How about meeting up for a drink?

457
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,003
Don't you have any friends?

458
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,881
I had one friend, but he died.

459
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,300
If you say something like that…

460
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,844
Meet me at the convenience store
at the rear gate of Dolma Park.

461
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,304
I'll be waiting.

462
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,640
Aren't you going to hang up?

463
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,725
Me?

464
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,029
Is something going on?

465
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,198
No.

466
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,580
Then what is it?
It's so out of the blue.

467
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,958
Didn't we

468
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,710
agree to be friends?

469
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,882
-I have no recollection of that.
-That's alcohol related dementia.

470
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,091
You should be careful.

471
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,145
Mr. Go.

472
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,523
Yes?

473
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,150
Why did you

474
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,569
become a probation officer?

475
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,614
What about you?

476
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,908
Why did you become a lawyer?

477
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,493
I asked you first.

478
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,870
Come on, I asked you last.

479
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,544
When I was in high school,

480
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,089
my father's factory went bankrupt.

481
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,718
Moo-young.
Han Moo-young.

482
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,975
-Hold on, hold on.
-Who the hell are you?

483
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,142
Hold on.

484
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,352
Look.

485
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,604
I'm his lawyer, Kang Gyeong-ho.

486
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,691
-From now on, talk to me.
-Why are you protecting him?

487
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,359
Are you all right?

488
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,987
If you have something to say,
you can talk to me.

489
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,363
Just tell me.

490
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,079
You're in 12th grade

491
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,039
so you can drink coffee, right?

492
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,379
Don't worry.

493
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,340
You look like you have the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

494
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,925
Your father is going to be all right

495
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,052
and I'll handle the debt problem.

496
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,722
You can count on me.

497
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,142
I handled the suit against your father's
company pretty well too.

498
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,853
I don't have any money.

499
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,480
Try not to think about the debt for now.

500
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,233
I don't have any money for a lawyer.

501
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,778
You don't even have 50 cents?

502
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,863
Search your pockets.

503
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,864
How about 10 cents?

504
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,626
Okay.

505
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,586
You paid my retainer.

506
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,213
I'm your lawyer now.

507
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,267
That's why you became a lawyer.

508
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,104
You were lucky.

509
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,441
I was lucky.

510
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,111
In this world though,

511
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,614
not so many are.

512
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,784
Now it's your turn.

513
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,454
Why did you become a probation officer?

514
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,624
Woah, look at the time.

515
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:40,959
I have to go.

516
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,253
Thanks for the drinks.
Can you clean up?

517
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,546
What the heck?

518
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,979
KANG BYEONG-TAE

519
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,404
Yes, Byeong-tae?

520
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,905
Mr. Go.

521
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,825
I asked around
and found a developer.

522
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,328
But he's a former cop.

523
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,706
A former cop…

524
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,709
Won't his fee be high?

525
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,797
Excuse me?

526
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,019
Bye.

527
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,660
I need your guys
in two weeks.

528
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,832
Drop me off at Gongsu Intersection.

529
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,835
I'll give you a ride home.

530
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,962
Gongsu Intersection.

531
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,549
Okay, okay, okay.

532
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,807
You know,

533
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,436
when this is all over…

534
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,522
Getting revenge and conning people

535
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,066
and all that…

536
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,486
Should we live like everyone else,

537
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,862
and date,

538
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,741
and get married?

539
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,495
Fine.

540
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,997
Really? Should we?

541
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,167
I mean,

542
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,252
I'd like to try an ordinary life.

543
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,798
Getting paychecks, celebrating holidays,

544
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,925
You know, lead a simple life.

545
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,720
Yeah.

546
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,265
You do that.

547
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,898
Navis Well-being.

548
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,318
-Navis Well-being.
-Navis Well-being.

549
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,657
Hello.

550
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,992
Navis Well-being…

551
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,997
How much for the magazine?

552
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,708
Oh, it's not for sale…

553
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,955
You walked without shoes?

554
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,084
Go Yo-han knows

555
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,587
something's wrong with his phone.

556
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,839
It'll just have gone dead.

557
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,632
It won't be a problem.

558
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,176
Anything on Han Moo-young?

559
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,471
It's going to take a few days.

560
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,348
I'll tell you when it's ready.

561
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,851
He has a meeting with Ye Chung-sik.

562
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,522
He never stops working.

563
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,609
Do you want to sleep over
if you're tired?

564
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,012
You want some ramyeon?

565
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,273
You know what?

566
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,567
We actually met years ago.

567
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,072
On Surprise 100.

568
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,532
I went to watch when I was 14.

569
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,870
It was such a popular show,
it took me a year to get a seat.

570
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,582
When I finally got one, you were…

571
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,959
nine years old,

572
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,001
probably.

573
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,129
You're right.

574
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,591
It's popularity was waning by then,

575
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,677
so anyone could've come and watched.

576
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,056
You probably don't remember,

577
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,016
but you picked my number.

578
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,728
If I remembered every little detail of
my short term memory trying to be cute,

579
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,355
my head would've have exploded.

580
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,399
Hmm…

581
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,109
you'reour'e right.

582
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,156
How long have you liked ramyeon?

583
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,618
Will you stop talking?

584
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,621
You're way too chatty.
No wonder you're a lawyer.

585
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,583
Da-jeong is always eating ramyeon too
whenever I see her.

586
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,676
Red Eye

587
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,304
was a crime organization.

588
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,347
Where people could contract crimes.

589
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,059
On the outside,
it was Red Eye Academy.

590
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,314
They took in kids who had nowhere to go,
fed them, clothed them,

591
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,691
and educated them.
It was an alternative school.

592
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,651
But in the basement, Red Eye Kids

593
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,695
received an entirely
different education.

594
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,762
We were like
an elite unit of sorts.

595
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,849
They believed they could
train kids from a young age,

596
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,727
and turn them into elite criminals

597
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,813
who followed orders without question.

598
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,607
That's what it was.

599
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,079
We worked really hard too.

600
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,290
We were afraid of getting kicked out
if we became useless.

601
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,125
Then again,

602
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,711
getting kicked out may have been better.

603
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,120
I guess that's why

604
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,997
we all became broken
one way or the other.

605
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,135
SEND IT IN 3 DAYS

606
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,890
SEND THE MONEY

607
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,274
None of us can sleep easily.

608
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,204
We still have nightmares.

609
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,591
And we live

610
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,301
in those nightmares.

611
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,861
It's very risky,

612
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:34,450
but what would you do if it takes him
to the next stage of treatment?

613
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,957
I'm still pondering.

614
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,250
HAN MOO-YOUNG

615
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,587
Leading a normal life
or treating trauma…

616
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,924
What should come first
and which is for the best?

617
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,260
I'm not quite sure.

618
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,805
What did you want to talk about?

619
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,973
I'm going to do it.

620
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,183
Go public.

621
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,354
Go public?

622
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,232
You said you wanted the truth.

623
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,360
I'll tell you everything
that happened that day.

624
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,738
What made you change your mind?

625
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,241
Those bastards lied to me.

626
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,660
Damn it.

627
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,745
I have no idea

628
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,497
how the police knew

629
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,583
I threatened Shin Go-ho at gun point.

630
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,920
But since I was arrested anyway,
he promised to

631
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,674
give me plenty of commissary money
and to pay my debt to loan sharks

632
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:35,302
if I took the fall
for everything that happened that day.

633
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,138
But those bastards
went back on our deal.

634
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,891
Shin Gi-ho was an accomplice?

635
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,142
Yes.

636
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,728
The director of Red Eye
was there that day.

637
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,021
Red Eye.

638
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,064
Red Eye…

639
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,234
Red Eye was

640
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,111
a foundation that sponsored Lee Ro-eum.

641
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:55,281
The Chairman gave all the orders.

642
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,741
The Chairman?

643
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,243
The Chairman

644
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,370
who really calls the shots at Red Eye.

645
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,373
The man at the top who
someone like me doesn't dare approach.

646
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,834
He called in the favor himself.

647
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,587
He even called that night.

648
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,921
-He called?
-Yes.

649
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,634
Look at the consequences
of your choice.

650
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,609
I'll always be watching you.

651
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,320
I'm telling you,

652
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,405
Shin Gi-ho and I
were just the hired help.

653
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,990
Oh, there was one more.

654
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,408
I'd never seen him before.

655
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,326
Anyway,

656
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,286
we're not the ones behind it.

657
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,663
We were just in it for the money.

658
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,416
You killed them for money?

659
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,752
Who says no to money?

660
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,173
The real bad guy is the one
who gave the order, you know that.

661
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,884
You have to go after
the real criminal.

662
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,844
You have to get that Chairman.

663
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,387
Those sons of bitches.

664
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,222
We had a deal
but they broke it,

665
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,267
and now I'm stuck in this shitty prison.

666
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,269
What?

667
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:09,938
You said so yourself.

668
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,067
You said I had a chance.

669
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,611
I came in here for the money,

670
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:19,073
but without any money,
what hope do I have?

671
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,199
Hope?

672
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,117
What? Damn it.

673
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,745
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

674
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,747
We can work together.

675
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,290
How about it?

676
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,503
You

677
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,798
are in here
because you murdered two people.

678
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,967
It's not because of me,

679
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,470
or because of the people
you resent so much.

680
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,472
Hope?

681
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,892
You don't deserve hope.

682
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,565
Come on.

683
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,942
Mr. Han.

684
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,361
Mr. Woo.

685
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,780
Have you heard of the "Chairman"?

686
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,990
-Chairman of where?
-I think it's some kind of nickname.

687
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:05,160
Ye Chung-sik said
he's the real head of Red Eye.

688
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,205
Red Eye…

689
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,625
It's a foundation
so there is no chairman.

690
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,168
The head was Director Ahn Chae-hong.

691
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,336
But he committed suicide.

692
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,506
-He committed suicide?
-Yes, it caused quite a stir.

693
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,467
There were even rumors
that his wife killed him.

694
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:24,388
But the investigation found that he had
embezzled from his company,

695
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,473
so the case was closed
as a suicide.

696
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,892
I'll try to find out more
and be in touch.

697
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,236
Oh, hi.

698
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,075
Who is the Chairman?

699
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,536
Woah…

700
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,163
Is that your last question?

701
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,372
Yes.

702
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,666
I'm sorry,

703
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,626
but I can't answer that.

704
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:55,961
Why not?

705
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,047
Because no one knows.

706
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,008
All we know is that

707
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,093
the face of Red Eye
changed 10 years ago.

708
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,262
From Director Ahn Chae-hong,

709
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,722
to his wife, Jang Kyung-ja.

710
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,894
My promise to you is simple.

711
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,270
Better service.

712
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,271
Better people.

713
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,023
A better life.

714
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,983
What you need

715
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,902
could be information
about an art auction,

716
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,778
or trends in the stock market,

717
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,114
or membership into a country club.

718
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:28,035
Navis will provide you

719
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,454
with everything you need

720
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,080
every step of the way.

721
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,750
We will restructure your values.

722
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:35,667
and restructure

723
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,294
your life.

724
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,088
Navis Well-being.

725
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,628
NAVIS WELL-BEING CEO
JANG KYUNG-JA

726
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,473
Well,

727
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,268
it was installed to track your movement.

728
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,811
It wasn't for universal use.

729
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,522
What does that mean?

730
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,191
It doesn't have
a special purpose.

731
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,277
There aren't any complicated functions.

732
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,112
All it does is track your location.

733
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,906
When you installed it,
did you allow it use your location?

734
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,116
Yes.

735
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,201
Basically, this isn't

736
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,454
a hacking or smishing,
or anything like that.

737
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,540
It's just an app.

738
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,877
But it tracks your location
unlike the original.

739
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,464
So,

740
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,927
it tracked everywhere I went?

741
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,429
Yes, basically.

742
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,600
It must've been an ex-girlfriend
or someone you know, right?

743
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,188
You have someone you suspect?

744
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,609
I do.

745
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,944
Unfortunately.

746
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,960
Through Lee Se-hwa,
Park Jong-gu

747
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,629
obtained information
about a gambling den

748
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,464
in the basement of a building in Moran.

749
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,635
The place we set up
will be the final stage.

750
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,347
Before that,
we have to level-up our easy target.

751
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,307
So that he becomes ripe for the picking.

752
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,686
Okay.

753
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,780
Check it.

754
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:11,907
Are you out?

755
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,326
Okay.

756
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,828
I'll see your four,

757
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,205
and raise you four more.

758
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,915
Okay.

759
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,043
Oh my.

760
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,089
You got a lucky win.

761
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,882
It's just beginners luck.

762
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,638
How many?

763
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,555
Three.

764
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,475
I'll raise you three more.

765
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,019
Here's four.

766
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:45,273
I'll see your three,
and raise you three more.

767
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:49,277
Two, two, five.

768
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:51,988
Call.

769
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,995
-I'm so sorry.
-I'm so sorry.

770
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,416
See this? 33.

771
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,834
You had good cards though.

772
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,268
How many? Four.

773
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,235
Time out.

774
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,952
I'll see your three.

775
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,162
Four more.

776
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,289
I'll see your three.
Raise you five.

777
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,333
I'll see your five, raise you four.

778
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:47,753
I'll see your five.

779
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,171
All in.

780
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,258
Okay, call.

781
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,388
Oh my.

782
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,182
I'm sorry.

783
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,353
No, I'm sorry.

784
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,398
I guess luck is on my side.

785
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,405
I'm so sorry.

786
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,865
How much is all this?

787
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,408
Woah, so heavy.

788
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,326
Woah.

789
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,828
So heavy.

790
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,794
Excuse me,
can I get a beer?

791
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:29,920
One beer?

792
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,259
How much did he lose
in a week?

793
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,594
A little less
than $10,000.

794
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,305
He's had nowhere near enough.

795
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:43,183
Let him stew for a few days,
then tell him about the gambling den.

796
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,060
Okay.

797
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,231
Moo-young, me,
and the target will be here.

798
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,649
Na-sa, you're in the office.

799
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,360
You get the feed
at the comic book store.

800
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,946
Ringo, leave the player and go.

801
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,155
Roger.

802
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,533
This plan

803
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,951
it's going to work, right?

804
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,453
You should know.

805
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,289
You're the lawyer.

806
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,469
There are two points of entry
to the bunker.

807
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,430
One is through the floor
of the office.

808
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,226
The other is the back
door that leads to the drainage pipes

809
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,394
by the stream.

810
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:13,356
Guests will come through the back door
so we can hide the location of the den.

811
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,693
Four will be playing the game.

812
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,737
There will be a total of three teams.

813
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,780
In our game, it'll be me, the target,

814
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,283
Moo-young and one errand boy.

815
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,910
Usually, in games of this size,

816
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:28,580
a card shark could easily
wipe out a target,

817
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,457
but since we don't have
a professional on our team,

818
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,167
we'll be getting help
from some equipment.

819
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,760
Once Na-sa reads the cards
and tells our player,

820
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,804
we'll take turns winning the money.

821
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,474
The goal is to win everything
the target has.

822
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,975
At least $500,000.

823
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:54,856
Se-hwa.

824
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,818
Mr. Park, it's good to see you.

825
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,154
People who are meant to meet really do.

826
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,284
This is the friend
I told you about.

827
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,578
Oh, the lawyer.

828
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,084
Loosen up, will you?

829
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,546
Why don't you sit over there?

830
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,464
Okay.

831
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:29,891
We'll keep
your phones in here.

832
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,017
In here, please.

833
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,311
Okay.

834
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,744
Okay.

835
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:50,662
Eight.

836
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:51,579
Five.

837
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,665
Wow.

838
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,148
Who is it?

839
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,321
Who's there?

840
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,490
Someone's here!

841
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,908
We're in trouble, damn it!

842
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,331
Let's take a break.

843
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:36,833
Why?

844
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,127
I have a headache.

845
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,129
I'm going out for some air.

846
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,840
Okay.

847
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,262
You must be bored.

848
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,307
Why don't you two do something fun
while you wait?

849
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,184
We have some history.

850
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,776
Someone's up there.

851
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,445
Are you sure Na-sa will be okay
on his own?

852
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,530
You should go and check.

853
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,616
Okay.

854
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:20,794
Na-sa.

855
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,088
Someone reported an illegal
gambling den.

856
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,965
-Ro-eum.
-What is it?

857
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,092
If you don't open up,

858
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,802
we'll count to ten,
then we're coming in.

859
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,220
The police are here.

860
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,641
I can hear you in there!

861
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,267
Ten.

862
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,393
Na-sa.

863
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,395
We'll be fine as long as they don't
find the entrance.

864
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,772
-Right?
-Nine.

865
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:43,525
I have a record. If they catch me now,
I'm done for.

866
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,944
-Eight.
-I'll deal with them. You stay calm.

867
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,445
Seven.

868
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,738
Moo-young.

869
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,657
Ro-eum, how are things
at the back entrance?

870
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,242
-Six.
-Can you get out?

871
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,785
Yeah.

872
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:54,702
What about the others?

873
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:55,912
Five.

874
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,080
They can't.

875
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,665
What are you talking about?

876
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,875
-Why not?
-Because I locked them inside.

877
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:01,793
What?

878
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:02,877
Four.

879
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,922
That money

880
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,466
is evidence that you're an accomplice.

881
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,510
Three.

882
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,105
Han Moo-young.

883
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,231
Two.

884
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,608
Turn yourself in.

885
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,028
One.

886
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,448
We're coming in.

887
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,102
Let us out!

888
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,771
Let us out!

889
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,653
Open it up, quick!

890
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,283
Put your hands up.

891
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,825
What's a lawyer doing here?

892
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,411
What the hell is going on?

893
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,454
Jung Da-jeong!

894
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,331
Let's just beg for our lives.

895
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:07,210
You're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

896
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,462
I knew a psychopath like you

897
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,005
would be back.

898
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,132
I'm not just any lawyer.

899
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,468
I'm a really bad lawyer.

900
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,806
Aren't you even curious about whether
I really had him killed him or not?
