1
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,517
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,019
The ledger.

3
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,605
I have it.

4
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,607
All of it.

5
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,777
You need to come here.

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,445
Come and clean things up.

7
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,739
The director

8
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,657
is dead.

9
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,432
Today, I found out who the Chairman is.

10
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,200
Congratulations.
You came to the right place.

11
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,244
What's going on?

12
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,329
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,540
I'm the one who should be asking you.

14
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,336
This is…

15
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,296
You're here to see
the Chairman, aren't you?

16
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,800
The man who founded Red Eye
and made you the director.

17
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,136
Yes.

18
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,013
Chairman Ji Seung-don.

19
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,768
He only lent his name.

20
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,562
He was a good man.

21
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,191
His only flaw was
that he trusted people too much.

22
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,318
Then, you…

23
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,654
You're…

24
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,739
It's you?

25
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,701
Why are you trying to run away now?

26
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,120
What was your plan?

27
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,082
To eliminate the Chairman
and take over yourself?

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,084
I was feeling frustrated.

29
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,545
I wanted a better channel of communication

30
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,629
between leaders.

31
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:59,429
I'm going to liquidate the foundation.
It's no longer needed.

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,934
I'll give you 24 hours.

33
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,187
Run as far as you can.

34
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,650
Jay, that bastard, is the Chairman.

35
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,861
Now I have to run for my life,

36
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,613
since I now know who he is,

37
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,241
and he knows I was digging into him.

38
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,975
By wanting more,

39
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,436
I could end up losing my life.

40
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,368
DA-JEONG

41
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,498
TODAY, I FOUND OUT WHO THE CHAIRMAN IS.

42
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,713
Hey.

43
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,425
"Jay, that bastard, is the Chairman."
This… This says

44
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,760
that Jay is the Chairman.
Can this be true?

45
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,597
We have to find Ringo first.

46
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,019
We're back.

47
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,229
The car, the car. Get the car!

48
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,106
What's going on?

49
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,191
Is this it?

50
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,988
I was expecting more.

51
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,537
Were you just bluffing?

52
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,462
Or did you leave something out
as a surprise?

53
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,058
Why didn't you tell me?

54
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,643
For ten years.

55
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,396
Because it didn't matter.

56
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,775
Not between us.

57
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,862
This changes nothing.

58
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,782
Whether you're the Chairman or not,

59
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,743
you didn't tell me about it either,

60
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,579
so what did I have to gain
by acting like I knew about it?

61
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,540
So I covered it up.

62
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,958
For you.

63
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,376
For us.

64
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,756
I…

65
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,717
I just need you, that's all.

66
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,512
Yes.

67
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,764
I believe you.

68
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,079
There's a suitcase
in a locker at the airport.

69
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,500
There are a map and a phone inside.
Go and wait there.

70
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,258
Use cash only.

71
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,471
Did you hear me?

72
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,602
Go now. Before your name goes up
on the travel ban list.

73
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,211
Mr. Kang.

74
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,172
Is something up?

75
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,177
Mr. Kang.

76
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,220
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,348
I'm sorry, Moo-young.

78
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,268
What's this about?

79
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,106
I can't find your father.

80
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,388
Please… Please don't kill me.

81
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,723
Don't kill me.

82
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,475
P-please…

83
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,981
What do you mean,
you can't find my father?

84
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,902
I should've told you sooner.

85
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,904
What's going on?

86
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,866
I think something happened to your father.

87
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,368
What?

88
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,956
Please don't kill me. Please…

89
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,958
Please don't kill me.

90
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,210
Please don't kill me.

91
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,851
Please don't kill me.

92
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,937
Don't kill me.

93
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,361
No!

94
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,201
Take some pictures quick.

95
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,039
Make sure we all come out.

96
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,002
Geez.

97
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,254
Give me that!

98
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,018
Please…

99
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,864
A month ago,

100
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,826
after seeing on the news

101
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,788
that you were the lawyer
in the Geumseong murder trial,

102
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,458
your father came to see me.

103
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,420
He had given me some cash once,

104
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,465
and he said he needed to tell me
where he got the money.

105
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,258
I should have

106
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,636
told you then.

107
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,262
My father gave you money?

108
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,388
For what?

109
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,559
When you got into law school…

110
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,228
It was for your tuition…

111
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,647
My tuition?

112
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,108
You said it was some sort of scholarship.

113
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,109
He said…

114
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,156
you'd never accept it
if you knew it was from him, so…

115
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,373
I should've pressed him more

116
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,708
about where he got
such a huge amount of cash.

117
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,462
I knew deep down
he couldn't have earned it honestly.

118
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,506
So?

119
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,966
What about that money?

120
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,343
Where did he get it?

121
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,975
I found out a month ago…

122
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,980
that it was payment for murdering someone.

123
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,821
Please don't kill me.

124
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,657
Don't kill me.

125
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,743
RESIDENCE CARD
HAN JAE-SEOK

126
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,903
What?

127
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,493
It was payment for murder?

128
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,166
The money that made me a lawyer

129
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,461
came from my father
who got it for murdering someone?

130
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,837
Moo-young.

131
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,215
What the heck are you talking about?

132
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,302
Who?

133
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,596
Who did he murder?

134
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,727
Who did he kill and who paid him?

135
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,188
The Geumseong…

136
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,024
The Geumseong murders…

137
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,822
He was one of the men
who killed Ro-eum's parents.

138
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:03,949
Your father…

139
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,122
We were just the hired help.
Me and Shin Gi-ho.

140
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,916
And there was one other person.

141
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,334
I'd never seen him before.

142
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,711
They're ghosts.

143
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,712
Ghosts?

144
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,006
That's what Red Eye called
their hired help.

145
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,550
They usually chose people
whose lives had hit rock bottom.

146
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,220
They knew their weaknesses,
so they were easy targets.

147
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,472
And since they had nothing to lose,
they were bold.

148
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,389
Moreover,

149
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,475
they were easily bought with money.

150
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,645
Ro-eum's parents? He killed her parents?

151
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,611
Put this on first.

152
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,155
Come on!

153
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,532
Oh, right.

154
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,367
-Thanks.
-Hurry up and put it on.

155
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,044
Come on.

156
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,679
That's why

157
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,681
your father came to see me.

158
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,058
He told me he didn't know
what he was getting into.

159
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,310
He had no idea
the job involved murdering people.

160
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,187
But since he committed the crime,

161
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,731
he wanted to turn himself in.

162
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,191
He wanted to see you before he did,

163
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,318
and he was supposed to
go to the police with me.

164
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,904
But I didn't hear from him for days,
so I went to see him,

165
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,407
and there was a note that said
he didn't want to cause you trouble…

166
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,828
Moo-young.

167
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,572
Do you like your present?

168
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,246
It was you.

169
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:16,999
What?

170
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,709
Did you think it wasn't?

171
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,295
You trusted me?

172
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,796
You…

173
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,466
Where are you?

174
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,927
Let's talk about your present first.

175
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,970
What the hell are you playing at?

176
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,766
The man you see

177
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,018
killed your parents for ten million won.

178
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,853
Han Moo-young's father.

179
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,231
You wanted to find

180
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,524
the last ghost, didn't you?

181
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,817
No, you're wrong.

182
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,904
I…

183
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,739
Even revenge should follow an order.

184
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,075
You can't take out the Chairman
without taking out the middle men.

185
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,243
I still have your gun.

186
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,954
So I'll help you out.

187
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,789
Cut the crap

188
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,999
and come talk to me in person.

189
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,753
Don't worry. You'll be seeing me soon.

190
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,256
Ringo's here too.

191
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,678
He has lost a lot of blood,

192
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,056
so he can barely speak in Korean,
let alone foreign languages.

193
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,771
Where are you right now?

194
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,189
Where the hell are you?

195
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,817
Calm down.

196
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,110
Ro-eum.

197
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,906
Enjoy this moment.

198
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,923
Ro-eum always had a soft spot
for you, even when you were kids.

199
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,468
How should I put this?

200
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,680
She never hides her weakness.

201
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,142
I used to hate that,

202
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,147
but now,
it's the reason why I'm sparing you.

203
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,942
I want you to be a message.

204
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,447
That everyone around her

205
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,200
will be her weakness.

206
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,449
There's no movement.
I'm getting a bad feeling.

207
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,535
Please leave a message…

208
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,828
Ro-eum's not picking up.

209
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,956
Mr. Han isn't picking up either.

210
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,375
What are they up to? I'm worried sick.

211
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,502
This is driving me crazy. Damn it.

212
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,921
Does this make any sense to you?

213
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,840
Can you believe that Jay…

214
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,260
I had no idea, damn it.

215
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,436
Ro-eum. Where are you?

216
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,478
Ro-eum.

217
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,355
Do you have a location on Ringo?

218
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,400
His watch is pinging in Geumseong,
so that's where we're going.

219
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,235
But Ro-eum,

220
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,071
we found a picture of the orphan,
and it's Jay.

221
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,491
And the notebook from Ringo
says Jay is the Chairman.

222
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,620
But Ringo said
he was going out to meet Jay.

223
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,913
What should we do?

224
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,666
Ro-eum.

225
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,128
Look for him there

226
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,047
and call the police too.

227
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,298
Where are you?

228
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,468
Stay together. Don't go anywhere alone.

229
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,067
Take me to the Chairman.

230
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,959
You won't make it in time for your flight.

231
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,796
Just get to the airport.

232
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,465
This is breaking news.

233
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:02,010
As early as tomorrow, a special
investigation team into Navis Well-being

234
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,264
will be formed at the Seoul
Central District Prosecutor's Office.

235
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,640
Prosecutor Ryu Jae-hyeok

236
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,934
formerly of the criminal division
at the SCDP

237
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,769
is most likely to lead the team.

238
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,356
Prosecutor Ryu Jae-hyeok was demoted
previously for investigating Navis,

239
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,191
and despite being a junior prosecutor,

240
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,527
he is set to be a reliever
for the prosecution

241
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,654
embroiled in suspicions related to Navis.

242
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,532
RYU JAE-HYEOK TO LEAD
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION TEAM FOR NAVIS GATE

243
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,002
Yes?

244
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,503
Hello, Mr. Prosecutor.

245
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,673
Are you really coming back
for the Navis investigation?

246
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,925
Yes, I arrived today.

247
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,636
Wow, that's fortunate.

248
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,764
A lot has happened while you were away.

249
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,767
I'm on a business trip right now, but…

250
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,728
You kept working on it?

251
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:53,979
Of course.

252
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,772
Oh.

253
00:21:55,856 --> 00:22:00,652
I didn't want to bother someone
who had just started somewhere new,

254
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,946
so I didn't share any details.

255
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,741
So, have you been in touch with Mr. Han?

256
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,451
-No.
-Oh.

257
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,328
Then I'll bring you up to speed.

258
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,164
For starters, I left my job.

259
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,458
Were you fired too?

260
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,543
No, no, no. I wasn't fired.

261
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,005
Why? Was anyone else fired?

262
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,968
Let's just call it a hazard
that comes with the job.

263
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,303
It's not like I wasn't prepared for it.

264
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,431
I need to go.

265
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,142
Let's have a drink later.

266
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,062
Oh, wait. Navis… Navis…

267
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,709
-This is his watch.
-Then…

268
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,669
Then, is this… Is this his blood?

269
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,630
He lost so much blood.

270
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,548
What if he dies?

271
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,176
Yes, this is 301 Taeseong-gu, Geumseong.

272
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,677
I need to report a missing person.

273
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,096
Hae-dong!

274
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,263
Park Hae-dong!

275
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,308
Ringo!

276
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,018
-Na-sa.
-Yeah?

277
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,144
It's nearby.

278
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,522
Haeseung Hospital.

279
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,608
The place where Ahn Chae-hong saw Jay…
The Chairman.

280
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,443
Oh.

281
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,903
-Text me the address.
-Yeah.

282
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,711
So, you saved Han Jae-seok.

283
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,047
We'll talk after you let Ringo go.

284
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,674
He won't die.

285
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,718
We should catch up first.

286
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,304
After you let Ringo go.

287
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,681
Why are you so angry?

288
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,776
Should I just kill him?
So that you can focus?

289
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,415
Why did you save Han Jae-seok?

290
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,460
Because of Han Moo-young?

291
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,589
Do you like him that much?
Is he good to you?

292
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,054
I didn't know you were the type
who'd react to that.

293
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,474
I know we haven't seen each other
for ten years,

294
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,186
but still, it feels weird to see
a side of you that I don't know.

295
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,564
I am…

296
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,901
going to kill you.

297
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,820
You don't have it in you.

298
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,406
You've become too soft.

299
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,532
What do you know?

300
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,703
Just because a detail about me has changed

301
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,997
doesn't mean
all our memories together disappear.

302
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,666
We've known each other for years.

303
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,378
Should we start with the day we first met?

304
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,838
October 22, 2002.

305
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,466
The day I decided to save you.

306
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,929
Ro-eum must be very nervous.

307
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,431
Yes, it's understandable.

308
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,977
Okay, Ro-eum. Tell us what you know.

309
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,229
I thought bringing in a gifted child

310
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,773
would be good for the scholarship project.

311
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,319
But on the day I went to check you out,
you happened to make a mistake.

312
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,196
Let's take a break.

313
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,197
Take a break.

314
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,448
Come on down.

315
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,953
That's not what surprised me though.
You were just a kid after all.

316
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,413
But…

317
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,186
You came back.

318
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,731
And finished the taping.

319
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,190
Without any more mistakes.

320
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,527
Even smiling as if nothing had happened.

321
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,529
That's when I knew.

322
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,240
That if I had any family in this world,
it would be you.

323
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,286
We were both born in the gutters

324
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,538
and the type who eventually

325
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,666
dominates the world
even after being abandoned by it.

326
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,177
Why do you say I was born in the gutters?

327
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,598
At the age of nine,
you were out working late.

328
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,685
You didn't get to go to school properly,
and you had no time to eat or sleep.

329
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,022
You had as much as
eight appointments a day,

330
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:32,692
going out of town, all dolled up,

331
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,861
taking pictures and amusing people,

332
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,031
just like a clown.

333
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,995
You wanted it too. Someone to save you.

334
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,538
And,

335
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,416
it's not like I kidnapped you, Ro-eum.

336
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,378
Your parents gave you up for money.

337
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,046
Why?

338
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,215
Because they believed
your value would drop.

339
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,178
How stupid

340
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,763
and short-sighted.

341
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,765
I said I would do it.

342
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,891
Oh.

343
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,102
It was a decision they made
out of respect for you?

344
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,814
Using a talent that sells
is the practical thing to do.

345
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:14,692
Your mental assessments
showed a consistent emotion.

346
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,821
A deep, cold hatred for your parents!

347
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:18,988
So?

348
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,825
So what are you getting at?

349
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,786
Are you saying you saved me? Is that it?

350
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,331
You tried to go back to that gutter.

351
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,669
RO-EUM

352
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,380
WE NEED TO TALK.
I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. I'M IN THE HALLWAY.

353
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,399
How did you know I was here?

354
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,609
Don't worry.

355
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,696
The director doesn't know
about you two yet.

356
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,614
I just…

357
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,867
I wanted you to know that I know.

358
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,910
I'll pretend not to know about it,

359
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,329
so do the same for me,

360
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,206
when I leave.

361
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,167
You're leaving?

362
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,376
I'm going back.

363
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,794
What's the problem?

364
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,508
I thought you considered me family.

365
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,096
What did your parents ever do for you?
Why do you want to go back to them?

366
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,850
I guess I have low expectations.

367
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,116
You were going down the wrong path,
so I had to set it right.

368
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,076
That's what real family does.

369
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,954
And it worked.

370
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,584
For ten years since then,
you've only looked at me,

371
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,960
dreamed about me,

372
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,670
and lived for me.

373
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,715
Thinking about the moment
you'd come back to me…

374
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,177
made me excited.

375
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,809
I am always on your side, Ro-eum.

376
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,228
I'm the only one on your side.

377
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,567
Now answer me.

378
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,987
Do you still believe
you have a place to go back to?

379
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,956
Then I'll destroy it one by one.

380
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,712
I can't leave you alone anymore.

381
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,257
I'll intervene if necessary.

382
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,675
What is it that you want?

383
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,555
Kyung-ja won't be
able to leave the country.

384
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,349
Plan B is to stow away
on a ship from Busan.

385
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,101
There's an employment agency there.

386
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,145
You'll be able to see her there
in a few days.

387
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,983
While I finish up with Navis,

388
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,153
you make a choice that can't be undone.

389
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,365
You really are…

390
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,577
a son of a bitch.

391
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,625
The face of our next project will be you.

392
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,169
It'll be hard for the two of you
to co-exist, don't you think?

393
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,381
You think you can get along?

394
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,139
She was ready to sacrifice her own life

395
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,266
to protect you.

396
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,145
She just has a strong instinct
for survival.

397
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,354
It wasn't to protect me.

398
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,740
Keep your eyes open.

399
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,743
I'll be watching you.

400
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:03,338
The investigation is off to a slow start
due to scheduling issues,

401
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,632
and Prosecutor Ryu held a press conference

402
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,052
stating the direction
of the investigation going forward.

403
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,513
Arrest warrants have been issued
for CEO Jang Kyung-ja

404
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,766
and three other executives
of Navis Well-being.

405
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,309
The second search and seizure

406
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:19,145
will be based on the information
learned from the first,

407
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,649
and will look into digital devices
and the banks they used.

408
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,819
The whereabouts of CEO Jang are unknown,
so a BOLO has been issued

409
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,113
as well as a travel ban.

410
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,824
Our goal is to locate her
as soon as possible

411
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,576
and speed up our investigation.

412
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,536
CEO Jang Kyung-ja of Navis Wellbeing…

413
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,759
Ringo!

414
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,094
Over here.

415
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,019
Hae-dong.

416
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,480
Hello?

417
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,857
This is 27 Taeseong-gu, Geumseong.

418
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,776
-Someone's been injured.
-Are you okay?

419
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,903
You need to hurry.

420
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:09,821
Yes.

421
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,572
Hae-dong.

422
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,908
Hae-dong.

423
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,703
Come on, we'll take you to the hospital.

424
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,088
One more can ride with us.

425
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,214
One more can ride.

426
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,135
You go.

427
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,469
I'll take the car.

428
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,471
You're hurt too.

429
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,140
It's not my blood.

430
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,266
Jeong Da-jeong.

431
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,477
I'll see you at the hospital.

432
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,523
Bring her straight to the hospital.

433
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,816
I will.

434
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,900
Come quick.

435
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,862
Let's go.

436
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,875
Dear God, Jesus, Buddha, Allah…

437
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,462
Hae-dong.

438
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,174
Hang in there, okay?

439
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,134
Just hang in there.

440
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,516
Hae-dong, hang in there.

441
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,893
I'm sorry.

442
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,771
Just hang in there, okay?

443
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,773
Please.

444
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,119
Please.

445
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,664
Moo-young.

446
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,832
Are you all right?

447
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,251
I need you to find my father.

448
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,836
Your father…

449
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,046
He's here.

450
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,804
He needs a blood transfusion too?

451
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,433
Yoo-il is with him, so he'll be okay.

452
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,936
Why did you leave Ro-eum behind?

453
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,521
I'm sorry.

454
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,648
She said she needed to drop by a place.

455
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,859
And that she'd be here soon. I'm sorry.

456
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,945
I'm not saying it's your fault.

457
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,531
-Na-sa.
-Yeah?

458
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,700
I'm going to go to my comic shop.

459
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,660
Why? Just stay here.

460
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,662
I have to find Ro-eum.

461
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,831
Did you get a hold of Mr. Han?

462
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,041
I texted him the hospital we're at.

463
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,169
If he comes, tell him what happened.

464
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,628
What more can we do?

465
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,047
We need to accept the fact

466
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,302
that Jay is the Chairman.
That's the only way to catch him.

467
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,516
Okay, you go.

468
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,477
Yoo-neung. Go with her. I'll stay here.

469
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,313
Got it.

470
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,868
Was it really you?

471
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,370
Were you one of the Geumseong murders?

472
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,706
I want to hear it from you.

473
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:50,958
Is it true?

474
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,795
I was going to turn myself in…

475
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,964
Then why did you suddenly disappear?

476
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,800
You never meant to turn yourself in
in the first place.

477
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,552
I tried to forgive you.

478
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,387
I was going to meet you

479
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,225
and try to see if there was any part
of you that I could understand,

480
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,143
but not anymore.

481
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,812
What did you expect from money like that?

482
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,944
Forgive me.

483
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,153
Please.

484
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,697
I'm not the one
you should be asking for forgiveness.

485
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,245
I asked her for forgiveness too. I did.

486
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,497
What are you talking about?

487
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,375
You met Ro-eum?

488
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,723
I'm sorry…

489
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:50,977
I'm so sorry…

490
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,313
I'm sorry.

491
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,232
I didn't know…

492
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,111
what the job was.

493
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,739
I just…

494
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,658
I just needed money.

495
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,246
Did you…

496
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,167
even regret what you did?

497
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,878
Yes…

498
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,256
I did.

499
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,734
Go

500
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,361
and

501
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,363
tell your son.

502
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,425
She…

503
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,510
saved my life.

504
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,390
Where is she now?

505
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,326
JEONG DA-JEONG

506
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,664
RINGO'S HURT BADLY.
WE'RE GOING TO SANGJIN HOSPITAL. CALL ME.

507
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,672
Ro-eum, where are you?

508
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,715
Why?

509
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,347
Why do you ask, Mr. Han?

510
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,640
Put Ro-eum on the phone.

511
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,600
She's busy.

512
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,311
And she'll keep on being busy.

513
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,271
Where is she?

514
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,481
Did you know

515
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,275
that Han Jae-seok was the last ghost?

516
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:05,945
Hello?

517
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,573
He's your father, isn't he?

518
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,118
How did you know that?

519
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,663
I haven't known for long.
I didn't set it up like that on purpose.

520
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,458
How could I have known ten years ago
that you'd show up?

521
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,710
I couldn't have anticipated that.

522
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,421
Is it you?

523
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,715
Am I what?

524
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,884
Are you the Chairman?

525
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,889
I think it's because of you

526
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,350
that Ro-eum became soft.

527
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,728
I raised her with such care,

528
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,230
and you ruined her.

529
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,606
Where are you?

530
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,524
Why?

531
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,192
Do you miss me now?

532
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,527
Where are you?

533
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,738
What are you going to do if I tell you?

534
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,616
I asked you

535
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,994
if you could ever kill someone for Ro-eum.

536
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,163
How fun is this?

537
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,208
The fact that it was your father
who killed her parents.

538
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,670
He took a different track from his son.

539
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,131
At least he stayed true to his desires.

540
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,841
Is this fun for you?

541
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,469
You call this fun?

542
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,473
Turning innocent kids into criminals,
scamming people,

543
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,184
and turning the victims into perpetrators…

544
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:22,104
You think you can get away with it
because you didn't get your hands dirty?

545
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,190
You think this is over?

546
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:28,736
It doesn't matter.
To her, you and I are both the same now.

547
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,780
The only difference

548
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,076
is that you pretend to be a victim.

549
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,663
You better stop talking
before I rip your mouth open.

550
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,374
Wow, tough talk.

551
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,959
Mr. Han.

552
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,128
I do kind of want to see

553
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,505
the look on your face.

554
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,507
If you hurt her,

555
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,884
I'll kill you.

556
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,802
I just don't believe you.

557
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,640
Do you think I let Ringo live by mistake?

558
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,100
The Red Eye Kids are mine,

559
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,102
and Red Eye is my world.

560
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,688
A toy that I play with.

561
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,734
As long as I'm alive,

562
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,486
that won't change.

563
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,365
I had fun, Han Moo-young.

564
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,289
This cell phone has been turned off…

565
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,053
Hey. I think someone searched the place.

566
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,139
Ro-eum must've taken something.

567
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,185
Can you check what's missing?

568
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,144
Sure.

569
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,219
Ro-eum.

570
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,638
Hello?

571
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,432
Yeah.

572
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,684
Where are you right now?

573
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,937
How's Ringo?

574
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,150
He's out of surgery and in recovery.

575
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,484
Where the hell are you?

576
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,446
-This is an announcement.
-Did the surgery go well?

577
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:39,658
Passengers boarding train 9787 to Sosan…

578
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,243
Yes, it went well.

579
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,829
-I repeat…
-Why didn't you come?

580
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,581
Passengers boarding train 9787…

581
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,665
I'm sorry.

582
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,459
For everything…

583
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,544
Why are you saying that?

584
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,880
Where on earth are you?

585
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,426
Da-jeong…

586
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,013
I promise…

587
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,060
I'll end this.

588
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,813
Ro-eum, I'll try to do anything I can, so…

589
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,406
TRAIN TO SOSAN

590
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,495
Please leave a message…

591
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,461
Mr. Han.

592
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,504
Da-jeong.

593
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,881
Can you track Ro-eum's location?

594
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,133
Her cell phone was turned off just now.

595
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,552
She took another cell phone.

596
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,597
I just talked to her.
She's at Sanjeong Station.

597
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,182
I'll text you the number.

598
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,316
Please leave a message…

599
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,088
Ro-eum.

600
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,840
Where are you?

601
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,430
Ro-eum, I'm so sorry.

602
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,058
For butting into your life
without knowing a thing,

603
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,227
I'm sorry.

604
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,897
Whatever you're planning to do,

605
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,816
don't do it alone.

606
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,819
I'll take responsibility, okay?

607
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,071
Ro-eum.

608
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,490
Ro-eum, please. Please.

609
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,912
I did it your way,
but I've only become more vulnerable.

610
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,499
More than when it was just me and a gun.

611
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,667
Ro-eum.

612
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,128
I was deluding myself.

613
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:57,713
The Chairman

614
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,423
needs to die by my hands.

615
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,968
That's the only way it'll all end.

616
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:03,927
Yes.

617
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,846
You're right.

618
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,514
You do that.

619
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,892
Or it'll end by me dying.

620
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,811
Ro-eum.

621
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,606
That's the only possible ending.

622
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:23,757
Yes?

623
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,759
Mr. Ryu, I saw the news.

624
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,763
We found the last page
of the red notebook.

625
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,392
The head of security at Navis Well-being,
Jay, is the Chairman.

626
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,394
He shot Ringo.

627
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:38,105
Did you report it?

628
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,691
Yes, and he's out of surgery.

629
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,485
I'll send you the info on Jay
that I gathered from Red Eye,

630
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,279
and the data we found on Navis's network.

631
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,364
He laundered money using
the name of Ji Seung-don…

632
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,407
Da-jeong.

633
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,994
I'm investigating Navis Well-being,
not Red Eye, at the moment.

634
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,288
I can't get into the details,

635
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,499
but we haven't acquired any evidence
that the head of security is involved.

636
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,167
Also, evidence obtained in that way

637
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,753
may pose a problem
depending on the circumstances.

638
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,839
Especially the evidence you obtained.

639
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,259
I understand how you feel,

640
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,678
but for this investigation to work out,

641
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,264
we need to follow due process.

642
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,808
If you have any information
regarding the investigation,

643
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,727
call the investigation team from now on.

644
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,062
Then I'll review it
according to regulations.

645
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,282
The case was in 2012?

646
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,241
Yes.

647
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,243
So you're saying

648
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,370
you're the real culprit?

649
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,499
Yes, it was me.

650
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,793
I'm sorry.

651
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,047
The 2012 Geumseong murders.

652
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:49,468
The daughter was falsely charged,
and the real culprit was caught last year.

653
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,845
There were three culprits in total,

654
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,182
and Han Jae-seok is the only survivor now.

655
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,516
And

656
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,644
who are you?

657
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,357
I can be questioned alone.

658
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,817
I'll tell you everything, detectives.

659
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:09,154
I'm his lawyer.

660
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,448
You can talk to me.

661
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,470
Su-ho.

662
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:35,806
Hey, you came.

663
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,684
No one's allowed to see him right now.

664
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,727
He must be in bad shape.

665
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,023
He said he was going
to meet Jay to get the lighter.

666
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,150
He thought

667
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,278
Jang Kyung-ja kept a backup
of the red notebook in it.

668
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,783
I'm the one who told him,
and I got him the fake lighter too.

669
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,453
I'm the one who sent him to the Chairman.

670
00:49:59,037 --> 00:49:59,871
Hae-dong…

671
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:00,956
Hae-dong…

672
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,625
What if he dies? What then?

673
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,836
Ro-eum too…
What if something happens to her?

674
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,632
A toy that I play with.

675
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,524
Mr. Ryu says he can't see you right now.

676
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,570
Oh, I see.

677
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,426
So this is what Red Eye does.

678
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,231
I looked through
all the CCTV feeds of the trains

679
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,817
that left at that hour
and the stations they stopped at,

680
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,736
but I have no clue where she went.

681
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,032
I got the messenger's face
near an abandoned building.

682
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,909
I think they moved in an unregistered car.

683
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,243
A BOLO has been put out.

684
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,745
What about Jay?

685
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,497
He's been using a burner phone,

686
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,623
which he got rid of.

687
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,958
He does have a cell phone under his name,

688
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,461
but it's been turned off,
so we can't get his location.

689
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:32,005
What about his connection to Ji Seung-don?

690
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,801
Ji Seung-don was a donor
to the orphanage since 1991,

691
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,804
and Jay was a judo scholarship student
in high school.

692
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:42,641
But he quit and started working
as Ji Seung-don's personal assistant.

693
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,309
That's probably

694
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:47,521
how he was able to exert influence
over Ji Seung-don.

695
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,189
Anyway…

696
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,942
I'm sure Prosecutor Ryu is working hard,

697
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:55,570
but hearing word through the news
is a little frustrating.

698
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,948
I wonder if he's making
all the connections.

699
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,204
Post his picture online

700
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,374
saying he's a contract killer
and wanted for attempted murder.

701
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,256
Prosecutor Ryu Jae-hyeok,
head of the investigation team into Navis,

702
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,550
has announced the results
of the first round of investigations.

703
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,260
We have obtained a witness statement that

704
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,263
stock manipulation was carried out
under CEO Jang Kyung-ja's orders

705
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,933
and that a portion of the gains was
transferred to her relatives' accounts.

706
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:28,937
Lee, who is in custody on murder charges
regarding Director Ma Kang-su,

707
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:33,191
also confessed and turned in the money
that CEO Jang paid out to him.

708
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,610
In light of these facts,
in addition to fraud,

709
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,238
she's suspected of major crimes.

710
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,783
CEO Jang Kyung-ja,
who is accused of fraud, is now wanted

711
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,494
for fraud, violation of
the Capital Market Act,

712
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,038
and conspiracy to commit murder.

713
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,083
As she is on the run,
executives of Navis Well-being…

714
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,210
and the names of her closet allies…

715
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,176
As expected… I asked Professor Shin
if she knows anything,

716
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,511
and she said she didn't.

717
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:03,847
I'm sorry.

718
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,767
Can you put out a BOLO for Ro-eum?

719
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,146
I know you have the authority to do it

720
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:14,357
if one of your probationers
is out of contact and can't be found.

721
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,567
Please put a BOLO out.

722
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:19,946

723
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,289
How did you find me?

724
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,625
I came just in case,

725
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,501
and here you are.

726
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,671
Who were you expecting?

727
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,131
Jay?

728
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:40,842
The Chairman?

729
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,720
You found out what you wanted.
Why come here?

730
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,814
I was wondering where that went.

731
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,149
You took it?

732
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:58,360
That son of a bitch gave it to me.
To kill you.

733
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,111
That's a lie.

734
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,075
You still believe

735
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,077
you have a future with him?

736
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,788
Don't you even watch the news?

737
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:12,958
To everyone else in this country,
you're the Chairman.

738
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,127
Do you think he's letting this happen
because he's powerless to do anything?

739
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,337
What do you know?

740
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,049
Even if I don't kill you,

741
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,801
he'll come and do it himself.

742
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,469
He can't.

743
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,262
If I die,

744
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,889
he'll be in danger too.

745
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,934
You think I'll die that easily?

746
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,436
I won't go down on my own.

747
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,399
If you kill him, it's fine by me.

748
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,442
Don't use him as an excuse.

749
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,569
This is what you wanted.

750
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,905
I know how much you wanted to kill me.

751
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,700
This moment must be a thrill for you.

752
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,243
Isn't that so?

753
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,167
You're wrong.

754
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,677
I'm only doing this…

755
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,851
to protect the people I care about.

756
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,371
Have you looked into Lee Jay?

757
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,749
You know I can't talk to you
about the investigation.

758
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,044
He's in a relationship
with Jang Kyung-ja, so you must have.

759
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,086
Mr. Han.

760
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,379
Ro-eum is missing.

761
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,756
Mr. Han.

762
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,424
You met Ringo.

763
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,259
He's been shot.

764
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:47,927
And he's still in a coma.

765
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,429
But you know that.

766
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:54,642
I heard what Da-jeong told you,
what kind of data she wanted to send you,

767
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,103
and how you turned her down.

768
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,022
And the reason why I turned her down?

769
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,317
Why

770
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,027
are you refusing our help?

771
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,237
I can't work with you people anymore.

772
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,074
If anyone finds out
about my illegal activities back then,

773
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,867
my investigation loses all credibility.

774
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,827
That's the only reason?

775
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,704
Is catching them all that matters?

776
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,166
You said so yourself. You'd catch them
and have them prosecuted by the law.

777
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,043
It's not like you're going to
exact personal revenge.

778
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,586
Following due process

779
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,421
will only get someone killed.

780
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,006
So you want to skip the entire process

781
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,424
and judge them first?

782
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,718
You don't know that bastard.

783
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,179
He manipulates people into killing

784
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:34,140
and feels
no sense of responsibility or guilt.

785
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,351
While we're following due process,

786
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:39,187
he'll find a way out to get away
and create other victims.

787
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,022
To him, this is just a game!

788
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,024
Mr. Han.

789
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,653
That's enough. Okay?

790
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,113
Just stop.

791
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,865
How can I stop
when nothing has been resolved?

792
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,493
You can't resolve anything
in this way either.

793
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,371
I'm worried you'll cross the line.

794
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,541
All right.

795
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,253
You stop here if you want to.

796
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:07,757
If this can be resolved by crossing
some line, then I'll gladly do it.

797
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,406
It's okay.
You're alive. That's all I need to know.

798
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,494
Mr. Han.

799
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,831
Ro-eum is back. She's on her way
to see Ringo at the hospital.

800
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,684
Ro-eum.

801
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:05,899
Let's talk outside.

802
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,165
Are you okay?

803
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,168
Where have you been?

804
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,633
You said you'd be my lawyer, right?

805
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:36,721
That you'd be there for me
once I ended it all.

806
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,141
I did.

807
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,645
It doesn't matter
what kind of crime I committed?

808
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,314
It doesn't matter.

809
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,944
When I started this,

810
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,031
I wanted to see the bastards

811
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,784
who killed my parents suffer.

812
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,412
I was in a nightmare
but couldn't wake up from it,

813
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,623
and felt so tortured that I wanted to die.

814
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,920
Do you understand how that feels?

815
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,673
I do.

816
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,139
Then promise me.

817
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,851
That you'll be my lawyer.

818
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,854
I promise.

819
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,400
Okay then.

820
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,694
Good.

821
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,102
Lee Ro-eum.

822
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:07,979
Please come with us.

823
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,565
This is breaking news.

824
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:13,985
The police confirmed the identity
of a woman in her 40s

825
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:17,280
who was found dead at an employment
agency in Busan this evening.

826
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,782
The victim was Jang Kyung-ja,
CEO of Navis Well-being,

827
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,243
who was wanted for fraud
and conspiracy for murder.

828
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,454
Jang was found to be in the country,

829
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:27,165
however, people are wondering
if the crime of fraud

830
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,375
that surpassed 0.1 billion
can still be prosecuted,

831
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,878
and criticism against the prosecution
is rising.

832
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:35,381
The police have found evidence
that Jang was murdered,

833
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,635
and have specified a suspect
based on evidence found at the site

834
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,803
and a testimony from an informant.

835
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,279
Lee Ro-eum, you're under arrest
for the murder of Jang Kyung-ja.

836
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,484
Did you really kill her?

837
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,945
You want to put me away, don't you?

838
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,406
Is there proof she didn't?
Then bring it to me.

839
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,032
I'll get you the proof.

840
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,576
I think Jay really is
going to take Ro-eum this time.

841
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:50,164
When Ro-eum gets out,
I don't want her to have options.

842
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:54,043
An article is coming out tomorrow.
That Han Jae-seok is your father.

843
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,004
I don't think I can keep
my promise to be your lawyer.

844
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,548
I lose again?

845
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,466
I'm going to break you out

846
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,051
from the prosecutors' office.
