1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,267
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,896
It was you, wasn't it?

3
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,148
Number 25.

4
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,692
Yes.

5
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,368
Why didn't you tell me?

6
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,167
I did.

7
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,294
I told you I went to watch the show,

8
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,173
and that I saw you when you were young,

9
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,549
that I knew you.

10
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,345
I had no idea you'd remember my number.

11
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,682
I didn't think it was a big deal for you.

12
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:41,726
We should go.

13
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,156
You're still the same,

14
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,324
then and now.

15
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,120
I thought about that boy
from time to time,

16
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,916
wondering what he was thinking,
suddenly showing up to offer his help.

17
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:25,228
If you don't talk about it,
no one will know.

18
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,355
And being alone

19
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,566
is scary,

20
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,567
and lonely.

21
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,529
I believe it when you say
you were lonely and scared.

22
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,835
When stock manipulation fails,
99.9 percent of the cause is this…

23
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,336
Scams?

24
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,629
Internal discord.

25
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,508
Ma Kang-su needs money,

26
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,052
and the financier Min Kang-yun has it.

27
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,431
We're going to use the party
to drive a wedge between them./

28
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,642
She divorced twice,

29
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,396
and both exes were young, rich,
and shared common interests.

30
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,857
And she married them barely a month
after knowing them.

31
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,609
She must believe in fate.

32
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,776
What are her interests?

33
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,529
Min Chae-pyo took her abroad
ever since she was young,

34
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,281
so she's practically a foreigner.

35
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,283
She's fluent in German and English.

36
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,702
I guess we know
who'll be marking Min Kang-yun.

37
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:28,124
Ma Kang-su will be targeted
by Go Yo-han and his partner.

38
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,211
He'll probably bring
someone trustworthy, right?

39
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,254
I'm sure he will.

40
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,763
You're bringing who?

41
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,973
Come on, you heard me.

42
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,685
What are you thinking,
bringing the doctor into this?

43
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,355
You told me to bring a date.

44
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,651
You couldn't find a date
among one of your acquaintances?

45
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,985
She is an acquaintance.

46
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,945
She's my doctor.

47
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,030
-I heard your therapy sessions were over.
-Exactly.

48
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,574
How could you ask her to do this
when my sessions with her over?

49
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,700
This is a dangerous job.

50
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,285
But I…

51
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,038
Wow, I'm feeling a little hurt here.

52
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,707
You didn't think twice
about bringing me into this.

53
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,418
For you, the level of risk
isn't that different

54
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,753
from what you usually do.

55
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,964
You're in no position
to criticize me right now.

56
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,882
I'm the one who got you the invitation,

57
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,093
plus, I'm a key player in your game.

58
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,553
Han Moo-young.

59
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,393
Han Moo-young.

60
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,228
Pull yourself together.

61
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,480
You should me thanking me.

62
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,316
Say, "Thank you, Yo-han."

63
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,234
What?

64
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,236
Come on, say it.

65
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,199
Say, "Thank you, Yo-han."

66
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,577
Wow, this place

67
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,079
looks totally awesome.

68
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,040
-I'm Yoo-il.
-I'm Yoo-neung.

69
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,709
Hi, I'm Go Yo-han.

70
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,129
Hmm.

71
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,839
Those two?

72
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,882
"Hmm, those two?"

73
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,261
Doesn't anyone here know
how to say "thank you"?

74
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,597
The psychiatric doctor I told you about.

75
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,768
I'm Mo Jae-in.

76
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,937
Hello.

77
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,147
I heard.

78
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,106
It's okay.

79
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,401
Doctor, you must know who I am too.

80
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,237
Um… The multilingual?

81
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,201
That's how this op will go.

82
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,996
You two are in charge of Ma Kang-su.

83
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,001
Crypto?

84
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,837
-As in cryptocurrency?
-While Ma Kang-su was in prison

85
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,339
cryptocurrency became hot,
so he'll definitely be interested.

86
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,009
He'd probably ignore anyone
who's not in cryptocurrency

87
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,719
thinking they're beneath his level.

88
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,721
Would he even take our business card?

89
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,972
We'll have to try.

90
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,809
What?

91
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,437
-Yo-han.
-Huh?

92
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,480
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

93
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,647
Oh no.

94
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,112
Exchange cards as you hand him
a hankie, offering to pay for cleaning.

95
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,948
Ma Kang-su won't go berserk
if you do the spilling.

96
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,117
He considers himself to be a gentleman.

97
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,287
Did you have to actually do this?

98
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,832
Yes, exactly.

99
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,251
It was a simulation.

100
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,590
It may have been over a decade,

101
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,383
but he still might recognize us.

102
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,220
The success of this plan depends on

103
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,679
how well you do.

104
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,015
I'll be keeping watch
over the security cameras,

105
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,143
while Yoo-il and Yoo-neung
will be on site to help you out.

106
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,145
We'll all be in communication
through in-ear monitors.

107
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,063
Okay.

108
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,940
Then what about those two?

109
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,777
I'll be working on Min Kang-yun's friends.

110
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,155
Alienating two people requires
manipulating public opinion.

111
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,201
Do we need to learn
any self-defense moves?

112
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,497
You won't need to.

113
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,958
Oh, okay.

114
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,548
Did you drive over?

115
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,675
No, I took the bus.

116
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,051
Oh.

117
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,970
This way?

118
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,430
No, this way.

119
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:11,848
Oh.

120
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,015
Get home safe then.

121
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,851
Okay, good night.

122
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,768
Good night.

123
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,526
Should we say we're dating
or that we're married?

124
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,742
For the party, I mean.

125
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,662
We should get our story straight.

126
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,125
I…

127
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,629
I don't believe in getting married.

128
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,425
Oh.

129
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,179
You didn't have state
your personal beliefs like that.

130
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:52,889
Anyway…

131
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,099
Okay then.

132
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,642
Then,

133
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,316
let's just say we're dating.

134
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,693
Okay.

135
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,153
Okay.

136
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,505
You're a Korean American,
and the head of a startup.

137
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,841
I had to buy an ID since
the Korean society there is so small.

138
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,343
Just play it by ear.

139
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:37,975
Looks a bit old.

140
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,770
It's totally my style.

141
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,859
This one makes you look too young.

142
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,819
It's totally my style.

143
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,119
This is a limited edition watch
from Min Kang-yun's jewelry brand.

144
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,287
What do you think?

145
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,623
Is my suit here?

146
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,583
Bring it in.

147
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,176
Now this is a suit
that'll get me 200 billion won.

148
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,261
Good.

149
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,042
Your invitation?

150
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,555
It's a two-track plan.

151
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,737
Thank you.

152
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:21,078
A fake investment opportunity
will open up to Min Kang-yun,

153
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,291
while a fake investor approaches
Ma Kang-su.

154
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,544
We're injecting a virus into the two

155
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,796
so that it infects their relationship,

156
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,257
and ultimately shuts down the investment.

157
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,308
Places, everyone.

158
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,922
I got the feed.

159
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,757
The host isn't here yet.

160
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,639
Yes.

161
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,865
This is the salad fork.

162
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,909
Oh, this one.

163
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,579
Salad, fish, dinner, dessert.

164
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,748
This is the dinner spoon.

165
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,209
But just eat however you want.
It doesn't matter.

166
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,628
Thanks.

167
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,173
Let's not say thank you between us.

168
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,885
Because that means I'll have to thank
my childhood where I got caned

169
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,971
for failing to memorize the proper order.

170
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,598
Eat up.

171
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,686
Oh, didn't you know?

172
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,647
Navis' new director has
a criminal record for fraud.

173
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,690
Fraud?

174
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,024
Yes.

175
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,989
Their financial structure
wasn't transparent,

176
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,782
so I always thought it was risky.

177
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,203
I heard rumors
that they're going into biotech,

178
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,955
but I think we should be careful.

179
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,665
-We should be careful.
-Yes.

180
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,046
Ma Kang-su is walking in.

181
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,133
Move in as he enters.

182
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,158
Find it.

183
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,769
You need to take a look at this.

184
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll just take that.

185
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,460
Hello.

186
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,671
Can I interest you in some dessert?

187
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,548
Would you like some whiskey?

188
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,757
I'll take it straight.

189
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,716
Yes, sir.

190
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,802
Wow.

191
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,224
Enjoy.

192
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,904
-Oh.
-Oh no.

193
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,574
I'm so sorry.

194
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,534
Min Kang-yun is here. Ringo, standby.

195
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,445
Mond! Hello.

196
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,362
Hello.

197
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,614
It's been so long.

198
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,907
You look amazing.

199
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,951
This is Josh.
He went to school where you grew up.

200
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,078
Yes, in Karlsruhe.

201
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,622
I'm Josh Hong.

202
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,876
Nice watch.

203
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,005
Oh, it was a gift.

204
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,841
She's the CEO of that brand.

205
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,386
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

206
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,639
A gift from a girlfriend?

207
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,933
Ex-girlfriend.

208
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,976
I'm so sorry.

209
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,896
Baby, I told you to move aside.

210
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,814
I'm terribly sorry.

211
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,066
It's all right.

212
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,609
It was just an accident.

213
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,818
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,737
I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

215
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,782
You're

216
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,325
Yo-han, aren't you?

217
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,916
You know Yo-han?

218
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,087
I'll go.

219
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,987
Ro-eum, I'm not the one.

220
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,614
I'm not her type.

221
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,751
I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone I knew.

222
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,798
What's your name?
I haven't seen you before.

223
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,343
You're Korean, right?

224
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,638
Or I can speak other languages too.

225
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,266
I'm Korean.

226
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,892
That's good.

227
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,898
I'm Min Kang-yun, the host of this party.

228
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,116
I'm Bae Ha-na.

229
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,579
Wow, you're all grown up.

230
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,124
No wonder, I saw Professor Shin here.

231
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,002
You look exactly the same.

232
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,212
Mr. Ma.

233
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,797
Oh, Professor Shin.

234
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,466
Wow.

235
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,011
It's been a while, Mr. Ma.

236
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,804
I'm sorry about my appearance.

237
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,515
I meant to come over and say hello.

238
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,018
I've been really busy these days.

239
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,145
Were you?

240
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,065
When did your son get so big?

241
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,193
I remember seeing his picture
when he got into college.

242
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,613
You know me?

243
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,448
You little brat.

244
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,993
I used you give you pocket money
when you were a kid.

245
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,286
Oh.

246
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,039
I didn't know you knew each other.

247
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,665
Is this your girlfriend?

248
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,460
It's nice to meet you.

249
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,711
We're engaged.

250
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,463
I see.

251
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,841
Yo-han is really all grown up now.

252
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,263
I know.

253
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,973
He grew up so fast.

254
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,058
He did.

255
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,477
Send me an invitation. I mean it.

256
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,313
I'll be waiting for one.

257
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,733
I need to do something about my shirt.

258
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,401
I'll be in touch.

259
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,028
Yes.

260
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,279
It was good to see you.

261
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,997
Will I be getting an invitation too?

262
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,919
Get me a shirt from the car.

263
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,213
I have a extra one in white in the trunk.

264
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,132
I'm in the rest room. Make it quick.

265
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,522
It's too bad.
You didn't even get a proper meeting.

266
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,110
I'm not sure if this will be any comfort,

267
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,029
but it looks like the game is over
so don't try too hard.

268
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,948
What are you talking about?

269
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,324
Min Kang-yun.

270
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,411
Last year, I heard she turned down
an investment her father encouraged.

271
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,370
And this time,

272
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,291
she decided to invest in some
unicorn company she's into recently.

273
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,378
Where exactly did you hear that?

274
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,882
You know how unpredictable she is.

275
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,802
There's no such thing

276
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,263
as a sure thing for her.

277
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,600
And who

278
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,602
are you?

279
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,955
CRYPTO INVESTING ADVISOR
CEO BLUE

280
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,420
You looked bored.

281
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,757
I'm sorry for hosting a party like this.

282
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,509
I'm having fun.

283
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,804
And I got to meet you.

284
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,098
Me?

285
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,934
What about me?

286
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,063
You're someone

287
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,858
who can give me what I need.

288
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,030
Do I look nice enough
to give you something?

289
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,866
Nicer than your father.

290
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,579
I don't have a dime

291
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,374
compared to my father.

292
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,628
Ma Kang-su just left the restroom.

293
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,176
We should go for now.

294
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,891
He's entering the lobby.

295
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,019
He's walking in. Get out of there.

296
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,239
Wait.

297
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,241
Don't go that way.

298
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,951
Take the exit on the right of the bar.

299
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,543
Ms. Min.

300
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,586
Mr. Ma.

301
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,715
The party sure is lively.

302
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,051
Because you're here.

303
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,261
Don't mention it.

304
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,930
But where's Ms. Jang?

305
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,016
Excuse me?

306
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,272
Hello.

307
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,026
I'm sorry I didn't send you
an invitation earlier.

308
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,652
Don't worry about it.

309
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,696
I'm here, aren't I?

310
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,658
-Mr. Ma.
-Ms. Jang.

311
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,662
I was just about to ask
for Mr. Ma's understanding.

312
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,082
I see.

313
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,044
I called her urgently last night

314
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,255
to tell her
Navis would be issuing gift cards.

315
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,341
I thought she should know.

316
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,426
Navis gift cards?

317
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,304
The scale of the business is quite large

318
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,973
so it might affect your business plan.

319
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,518
My risk analysis team needs time
to review it. Is that okay?

320
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,649
Of course. That won't be a problem.

321
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,277
I'll be in touch on the 15th then.

322
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,570
I'll be waiting.

323
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,031
Thank you for coming, Mr. Jang.
Mr. Ma, goodbye.

324
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,458
What do you think you're doing?

325
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,504
Excuse me?
Are you forgetting your position?

326
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,089
Why?

327
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,634
Are you scared that Min Kang-yun
will turn you down?

328
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,137
You're out of your mind.

329
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,723
If she turns you down,

330
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,309
I'll let you in on my business.

331
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,937
Feel free to join.

332
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,242
Go and do your worst.

333
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,008
It's not over yet.

334
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,847
I'm going to get Min Kang-yun
no matter what.

335
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,931
I can't just leave.

336
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,185
Guys, pull out.

337
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,480
Da-jeong, find out where Min Kang-yun is.

338
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,050
Go take a cab.

339
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,160
I thought you left with that man.

340
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,247
Is he your boyfriend?

341
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,750
He's a co-worker.

342
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,545
I wasn't lying before.

343
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,714
I have neither money or power.

344
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,091
You do have something.

345
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,844
Everyone here

346
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,013
came to talk to you.

347
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,478
You must want something more
considering that you're here.

348
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,358
How much do you need?

349
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,779
I want to see you again.

350
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,197
You and me.

351
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,242
It's not money you want?

352
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,165
All right.

353
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,585
However,

354
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,379
you only have one chance.

355
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,137
Why are you bringing
unnecessary attention to yourself?

356
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,597
I'm just doing business.

357
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,015
We have to make a profit.

358
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,434
Who asked you to do that?

359
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,896
Don't you think the best course
of action is not doing anything?

360
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,400
Not doing anything
will only put me in danger.

361
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,193
I'll be cast off.

362
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,195
So?

363
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,655
What are you trying to do?

364
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,284
Throwing a fit to be reinstated again?

365
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,203
Money is money, so why not?

366
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,914
My plan could work better.

367
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,291
It's not your decision.

368
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,377
The moment Ma Kang-su came in
you no longer had any say.

369
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,550
You're intentionally
getting in the way of the Closing,

370
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,718
and it's dangerous.

371
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,261
Don't drag it out and end it.

372
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,264
If this goes wrong,
you won't be able to make it out alive.

373
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,604
"We."

374
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,568
It's "we."

375
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,071
You said we should run away together.

376
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,784
Then

377
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,661
trust me and wait.

378
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,664
I'm sure you said the same thing to her.

379
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,460
Tell me.

380
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,129
Tell me everything you're thinking.

381
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,590
I need to know.

382
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,051
So that I can depend on you

383
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,886
instead of the Chairman.

384
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,862
Tell the guys

385
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,740
to grab Na Su-ho
and bring him to my office.

386
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,160
The punk that goes around wearing rags.

387
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,703
Yes, sir.

388
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,221
Shit.

389
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,975
Damn it.

390
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,327
I wonder how Kyung-ja knew

391
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,580
who I was meeting today and where.

392
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,918
I've been doing some serious thinking,

393
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,839
but you're the only one
that touched my cell phone.

394
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,884
You saw the text when you were installing
the CCTV program on my phone, didn't you?

395
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,722
Yes or no?

396
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,274
Yes or no? You piece of shit.

397
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,401
It wasn't me.

398
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,654
I see you're not saying you didn't see it.

399
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:32,896
What did Mr. Min say?

400
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,981
He said he'd get back to us

401
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,025
and not to worry too much.

402
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,820
Sounds like we should be worrying.

403
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,615
You know how
how unpredictable she can be.

404
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,830
There's no such thing as a sure thing
in Min Kang-yun's dictionary.

405
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,249
Keep him locked up in the office.

406
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,253
And look into this guy

407
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,463
and see if he's the real deal.

408
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,300
CRYPTO INVESTING ADVISOR
CEO BLUE

409
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,280
It launched at 9 p.m. tonight.

410
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,825
It's all in large denominations,
even 500,000 won worth.

411
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,869
They're selling the gift cards
at a 20 percent discount to members.

412
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,955
People will be able to use them

413
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,123
at over 30,000 shops and brands.

414
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,834
Would you buy it or not?

415
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,919
They're basically writing bad checks.

416
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,213
The number of new members
is skyrocketing,

417
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:43,550
and members were allocated a minimum
of one million won worth each to sell.

418
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,136
I forgot momentarily
that Jang Kyung-ja was a swindler too.

419
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,641
If the Chairman responds positively,
she'll hand over the money to him,

420
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,435
and if not,
she'll use it as her own slush fund.

421
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,691
However it goes,
she refuses to go down easily.

422
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,985
How can she plan something
so irresponsible?

423
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,945
If they don't make the payments,

424
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,239
it'll be the small business owners
who suffer the loss.

425
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,949
She doesn't think about that.

426
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,742
And doesn't care.

427
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,746
To her, ordinary people are like ants
that we can't see.

428
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,208
Humans don't feel responsible
for the life or death of ants,

429
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,335
and that's how she feels about others.

430
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,880
Navis has an investment
presentation in two weeks.

431
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,383
If Ma Kang-su secures enough shares
with Min Kang-yun's money,

432
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,177
and announces it at the presentation,

433
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,431
their stock prices will soar
at least a couple hundred percent.

434
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,808
and small investors
will buy it up like crazy.

435
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,853
The gift cards will sell like crazy too.

436
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,398
He can't do anything
without Min Kang-yun's money though.

437
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,568
Won't we be able to stop it
just by preventing the investment?

438
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,820
Someone accessed Blue's website.

439
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,114
Ma Kang-su's people
must've checked it out.

440
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,159
He'll be trying to come up with a plan B,

441
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,244
so he'll probably be reaching out soon.

442
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,415
I think we should try to approach him
just to be prepared for anything.

443
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,728
I'm here to see the CEO.

444
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,855
Outsiders are not allowed inside.

445
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,565
Outsiders?

446
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,818
You little weasel, show some respect.

447
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,863
A spy camera was discovered in her office.

448
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,325
Do you happen to know anything about that?

449
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,204
What do you mean?

450
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,123
I was wondering if you had planted it.

451
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,553
Tell Kyung-ja

452
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,764
that what she's doing now is suicide.

453
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,394
If anything goes wrong with the Closing,
we'll end up paying for it,

454
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,896
both her and I.

455
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,329
What is Min Kang-yun thinking?

456
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,499
Isn't she supposed to contact
Ma Kang-su tomorrow?

457
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,668
But she also set up a meeting
with Ro-eum.

458
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,296
Maybe she'll be
making her choice between the two.

459
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,593
If we don't get the call
for Blue, we're doomed.

460
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,408
We did it.

461
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,784
They took the bait.

462
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,454
Let's go and set up the center.

463
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,289
Hey.

464
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,549
Are you worried?

465
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,012
How do you chat up a woman?

466
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,811
I memorized all there is
to know about Min Kang-yun,

467
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,272
but I'm still not sure how.

468
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,692
Have you ever chatted up a woman before?

469
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,072
Be honest.

470
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,699
You're a bad liar anyway.

471
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,659
I'm a totally good liar.

472
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,369
Well, have you?

473
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,246
Chatted up a woman.

474
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,082
Of course.

475
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,501
How?

476
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,336
With money?

477
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,591
I'll let you in on a secret.

478
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,345
Tell me.

479
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,057
Come on, what is it?

480
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,476
Be genuine.

481
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,820
Did you see her necklace and tattoo?

482
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,572
It means honesty and transparency.

483
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,200
People who try to get close to her
mostly have an ulterior motive

484
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,536
because of her father's money and power.

485
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,081
Even we had a motive for approaching her.

486
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,082
So?

487
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,127
You're telling a con artist to be honest?

488
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,004
Honesty is more powerful than you think.

489
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,841
For example?

490
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,760
For example,

491
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,056
the story you told me when you were nine.

492
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,224
If I do this,

493
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,018
our family gets to eat meat.

494
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,605
Back then, you cared about your family,

495
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,817
and knew how to take the hand
of someone who tried to help you.

496
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,281
That memory was so strong

497
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,159
that from the moment
you were released from prison,

498
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,744
all I could see was the nine-year-old girl

499
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,163
who I failed to help.

500
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,793
Thank you for remembering me.

501
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:12,920
The boy I was then,

502
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,047
and for a very long time afterwards,

503
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,841
I couldn't help anyone,

504
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,678
but part of me is still
the 14-year-old boy

505
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,014
who wanted to help you.

506
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,561
Sheesh.

507
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,626
What's up?

508
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,504
I'm going to leave the country.

509
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,257
But I need to buy some time.

510
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,093
And the investment presentation
has to go well too.

511
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,097
Or else, Kyung-ja won't
be able to make it out safely.

512
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,432
Are you

513
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,311
asking me to buy time for you
so that you two can go on the run?

514
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,729
Those were the terms.

515
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,272
No, those were your terms.

516
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,482
Not mine.

517
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,984
Does she even know

518
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,819
that we're talking about this?

519
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,780
No.

520
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,073
Why didn't you tell her?

521
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,576
Because she'll think
I'm doing this for you.

522
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,579
She's a fool.

523
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,918
Doesn't she remember
whose side you took ten years ago?

524
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,971
Once the presentation ends without
a hitch, I'll hand over the revolver.

525
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,848
That wasn't the deal.

526
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,892
I know what that revolver means to you.

527
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,603
And how hard you tried to find it.

528
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,313
Does when you get it back really matter?

529
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,148
You already have another weapon
you can use.

530
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,443
You can trust me on this.

531
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,454
NAVIS INVESTMENT PRESENTATION

532
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,213
SENDING SOS

533
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,091
Da-jeong, we're all set up.

534
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,259
Good job, guys.

535
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,272
Wait.

536
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,164
Su-ho.

537
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,166
Tell your boss

538
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,424
that if I don't get the money
from Min Kang-yun today,

539
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,803
both you and Kyung-ja are dead.

540
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,309
Got that?

541
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,671
You look nice in that style too.

542
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,891
Have a drink.

543
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,309
It's still broad daylight.

544
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,105
I don't think I can listen to
what you have to say in a sober state.

545
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,440
What do you think it is?

546
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,485
Whatever it is,

547
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,531
it's probably not the answer
I'm looking for.

548
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,508
Have you moved recently?

549
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:29,760
No.

550
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,221
Did you bring your business plan?

551
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,977
Before that,
we should introduce ourselves properly.

552
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,398
In order to do business,
there needs to be trust after all.

553
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,126
Drink up.

554
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,129
Even if you can't, drink,
if you want to get what you want.

555
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,840
Just drinking wouldn't be any fun.

556
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:10,926
Let's play a game.

557
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,805
What kind of game?

558
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,517
Truth or Dare.

559
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,106
Have a seat.

560
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,242
I see you're on the impatient side.

561
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,955
We could talk about current affairs.

562
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,416
You looked up my profile, didn't you?

563
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,710
That's why you're here.

564
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,757
Do I look like someone
who has time to chit-chat with you?

565
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,261
Right.

566
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,349
I know that you're an impressive man,

567
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,143
but I have principles too,

568
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,313
and I can only do business
with people whose values I share.

569
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,092
Why did you get divorced?

570
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,136
Shouldn't you be asking why I got married?

571
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,389
Because I know why.

572
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,267
Then tell me.

573
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,148
For a lie.

574
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,209
I'm a con artist.

575
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,546
I have to get revenge,

576
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,798
but I need your help.

577
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,474
Ro-eum, come on, pick up.

578
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,561
Please leave a message…

579
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,355
We'll just go and get him.

580
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,984
It's impossible for us to get inside.

581
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,736
He wouldn't kill him, would he?

582
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:34,862
Yes.

583
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,405
He might.

584
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,620
Have you ever killed anyone before?

585
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,333
You know what the most stressful part
is for me?

586
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,793
They die too easily.

587
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,754
It's always the people who don't have

588
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,298
what it takes who lose everything.

589
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,675
But they still get greedy
and take out loans.

590
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,179
And all they do after that
is write up a will,

591
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:03,265
about how it was the firm's fault
and that they were victims.

592
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,975
Idiots.

593
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,936
If it weren't for them,
I would never have gone to prison.

594
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,149
That's why the value of a business

595
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,859
can't be about people.

596
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,821
So my idea,

597
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,073
if possible,

598
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,826
is to buy expensive lives.

599
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,875
You're asking me

600
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,710
not to invest with Ma Kang-su?

601
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,773
Ro-eum.

602
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,442
Talk.

603
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,820
Are you still with her?

604
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,740
If Ma Kang-su doesn't get
the investment, Na-sa will die.

605
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,158
He threatened to kill him.

606
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,748
Be clear with me.

607
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,753
I'm supposed to transfer the money
on the dot.

608
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,603
What did she say?

609
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,272
What did Ro-eum say?

610
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,497
Oh dear.

611
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,501
Oh. I'm sorry.

612
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,047
Looks like we'll have to do business
another time.

613
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:11,768
We got it!

614
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,106
CONFIRMING TRANSFER
OF 150 BILLION WON TO 35 ACCOUNTS

615
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,859
Transfer the money to the boys.
Time to start.

616
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,584
Ro-eum.

617
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,262
You did good.

618
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:01,568
Good, good…

619
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,570
This is good.

620
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,908
We did it. Yes!

621
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,541
Prices are up several times over.

622
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,422
Su-ho, looks like you'll live after all.

623
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,259
Wow.

624
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,426
Come in.

625
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,514
We need you down in the lobby.

626
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,473
Why?

627
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:36,812
What is it?

628
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,571
Mr. Ma.

629
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,823
Oh, Yo-han.

630
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,408
How have you been?

631
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,286
I just came by because I heard
my probationer was here.

632
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,996
What?

633
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:54,997
Probationer?

634
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,832
Didn't you know?

635
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,293
I'm a probation officer.

636
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,297
Well, that's not the point right now.

637
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,133
The point is, I need to take him with me.

638
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,094
Who is it? This probationer of yours?

639
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,015
The guy in your office right now.

640
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:19,896
Is this how you do your job?
Just show up without any notice?

641
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,608
Oh, didn't you know?

642
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,277
I thought you knew me pretty well.

643
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:26,945
This is the way I roll.

644
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,698
Did you bring a warrant?

645
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,952
Who needs a warrant between us?

646
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,038
I'll be sending you a wedding invitation.

647
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,668
A search warrant, you bastard.

648
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,630
I don't have one, you bastard.

649
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,591
In accordance with
Article 40 of the Probation Act,

650
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,384
I'm taking him into custody.

651
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,513
We'll be entering the premises,

652
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,849
and if you lay a hand on my men,

653
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,851
I'll call the police
for obstruction of justice.

654
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,395
I'll also sprawl down on the floor
and make a huge scene.

655
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,148
I'm willing to give you a great deal
if you wish to avoid all that.

656
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,734
Let us bring out Na Su-ho
quietly and we'll leave.

657
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,914
I'm in a really good mood today.

658
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:19,915
Yeah?

659
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,377
Let him in.

660
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,587
Punk.

661
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,923
You have guts.

662
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,259
Thanks, Mr. Ma!

663
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,097
PATIENT NAME: NA SU-HO

664
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,728
Let's go.

665
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,489
Director Ma Kang-su.

666
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:53,008
I'm delighted to be here today.

667
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,885
I'm Ma Kang-su.

668
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,860
While I was spending time
reflecting on myself,

669
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,529
the world had made
outstanding developments.

670
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,698
Everyone here

671
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,784
no longer invests

672
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,869
in the old and outdated.

673
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:24,915
And I will not suggest that you do.

674
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,875
Together,

675
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,503
we will change the future.

676
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,254
Change what?

677
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,798
The future.

678
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,174
Yes, the future!

679
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,886
I'm here to introduce
Navis Well-being's new brand

680
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:41,056
which will change your future.

681
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,557
Introducing

682
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,142
Navis Bio!

683
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,488
Now, what do you all love?

684
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,989
-Money.
-That's right.

685
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,199
We all love money.

686
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:13,672
When stock manipulation fails,
99.9 percent of the cause is this…

687
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,049
Internal discord.

688
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,512
Ma Kang-su succeeded
in stopping the virus.

689
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,933
However,

690
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:28,812
he failed
to notice the bug already inside.

691
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,662
30 MINUTES BEFORE
THE INVESTMENT PRESENTATION

692
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:03,763
Yes?

693
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,390
Why are you ignoring my call?

694
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:08,018
When we don't have a second to lose?

695
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:10,937
Lee Ro-eum?

696
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,024
I have a bomb
that will blow up the Closing.

697
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,693
I was thinking about
cutting a deal with you.

698
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,362
What?

699
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,197
If you turn me down,

700
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,617
this recording will go over to Ma Kang-su.

701
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,037
He'll be livid if he finds out

702
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,164
you agreed to ruin the Closing.

703
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,082
You know how it is.

704
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,210
Betrayal is more about emotions
than reason.

705
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,047
I guess that's why

706
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,341
I hated you so much

707
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,718
for the past ten years.

708
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,220
But I'm not like you,

709
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,805
so I'm willing to give you a chance.

710
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,517
Tell me who the Chairman is,

711
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,811
and I won't drop the bombshell.

712
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,399
Go ahead.

713
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,904
You stupid, arrogant little girl.

714
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,781
Give it your best shot.

715
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,452
I told you

716
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,412
she wouldn't go for it.

717
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,708
Too bad.

718
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,379
Jay tried so hard to save you.

719
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:27,180
Like the way
Ma Kang-su buys low and sells high,

720
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:30,600
we're going to strike at the high
which'll create the biggest lost.

721
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,104
Failing to get an investment would have
been Ma Kang-su's personal failure,

722
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:37,899
but ruining an official event
is the failure of Navis Well-being.

723
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,614
STARTING

724
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:49,703
WELCOME

725
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,418
We get the business plan
from Ma Kang-su's computer,

726
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:03,174
take over Navis' computer network,

727
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,802
It's always the people who don't have

728
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,971
what it takes who lose everything.

729
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,389
But they still get greedy…

730
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,016
And to add a little fun,

731
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,184
we include a little visual aid,

732
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,602
and lastly,

733
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,397
drop the bomb.

734
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,482
It's always the people who don't have

735
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,901
what it takes who lose everything.

736
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,404
But they still get greedy
and take out loans.

737
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,782
And all they do after that
is write up a will,

738
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,409
Have you ever killed anyone before?

739
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,911
You know what the most stressful part
is for me?

740
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,538
They die too easily.

741
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,332
He's going to turn off
the computer, right?

742
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,835
We planted a rootkit
in the USB drive that Na-sa inserted.

743
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:42,005
You might as well be talking
in a foreign language.

744
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,634
The more they try to defend,
the easier it'll be to attack.

745
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,763
About how it was the firm's fault
and that they were victims.

746
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,431
Idiots.

747
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,976
If it weren't for them,
I would never have gone to prison.

748
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,729
Rebooting and vaccine programs

749
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,981
will only make our attacks
more aggressive.

750
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:18,917
You just asked me not to send the money
but now you do?

751
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,252
We'll find a way.

752
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,421
My team.

753
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:25,840
What about me?

754
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,637
It'll be a loss

755
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,681
if I invest and Navis goes down.

756
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,561
Your father will get it back, won't he?

757
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,272
Even if he has to break
a few arms and legs to do it.

758
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,904
I liked Bae Ha-na because she was tough,

759
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,365
but Lee Ro-eum is tougher.

760
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,283
Okay, fine.

761
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,621
And one last question.

762
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,166
That man,

763
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,962
it's not just business with him, is it?

764
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,382
If you ever

765
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,052
get tired of him, call me, whenever.

766
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,976
So my idea,

767
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,644
if possible,

768
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,273
is to buy expensive lives.

769
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,610
Woah.

770
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,530
Stock prices are going to
plummet tomorrow.

771
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,747
Even Ma Kang-su's men
will start to panic sell.

772
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,303
-Find her.
-Who?

773
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,930
Find Jang Kyung-ja!

774
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,265
Get a move on it.

775
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,768
If you turn me down,

776
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,480
this recording
will go over to Ma Kang-su.

777
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,996
I was thinking about
cutting a deal with you.

778
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,749
Tell me who the Chairman is,

779
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,001
and I won't drop the bombshell.

780
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,186
You b*tch!

781
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:49,400
How dare you get in my way?

782
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,568
Hey.

783
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,362
You think the world is so easy?

784
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,908
Did you mistakenly believe
you were the Queen

785
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,660
because of the way I treated you?

786
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,084
Do you think you've ruined me?

787
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,087
Do you think that's even possible?

788
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,381
If you die here right now,

789
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,550
it's game over.

790
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,801
So die.

791
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,186
Thank you.

792
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,826
I don't have the courage
to stand in Moo-young's way.

793
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,662
I'm sorry.

794
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,653
Surprise 100.

795
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:41,531
The genius girl, Lee Ro-eum.

796
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,382
Lee Ro-eum

797
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,677
has perfect memory.

798
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,388
Ro-eum.

799
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,519
She must be nervous.

800
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:13,521
That's totally understandable.

801
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,231
What the heck?

802
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:18,860
Ro-eum, what can
you tell us about him?

803
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:19,902
It's the Chairman.

804
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,918
SPECIAL THANKS TO MUN KA-YOUNG
FOR HER GUEST APPEARANCE

805
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,105
The comic shop. Was it you?

806
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,357
That was it? That was what
you were after in the notebook?

807
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,610
The lighter?
I think she hid something in there.

808
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:03,362
Don't you want to pay your debt to Ro-eum?

809
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,156
Did you find out who the Chairman is?

810
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,949
The Chairman reacted

811
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,951
and he might make a move himself.

812
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,578
Let's tie up Navis' hand and feet.

813
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,246
The problem is public opinion.

814
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,040
Go and tell them!

815
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,542
What stance they should take!

816
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,211
It feels more like
an invitation than a warning.

817
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,171
As if he'll be stepping up himself soon.
