1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,225
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,244
Can I try?

3
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,179
What was on your mind?

4
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,058
What was on your mind
as you took the shot?

5
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,186
Just that I wanted to hit the target.

6
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,939
You don't have anyone
you want to shoot?

7
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,318
Yet, you still asked to fire a gun?

8
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,364
You must have
a lot of people you want to shoot then.

9
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,282
I…

10
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,454
want to shoot everyone actually.

11
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,293
Same here.

12
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,105
I don't think that was a broadcast clip.

13
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,316
It was filmed with a camera.

14
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,358
By who?

15
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,616
REPORTER WOO

16
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,204
Yes, Mr. Woo.

17
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:37,175
Today, a man fell to his death
from the rooftop of Navis Well-being,

18
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,636
a network marketing company
located in Gangyeon-gu.

19
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,263
The police confirmed that the man was

20
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,724
Director Ma Kang-su who had been holding

21
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,935
an investment presentation
in the building.

22
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,186
Kim Jun-hyeong, reporting.

23
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,356
I'm at Navis Well-being.

24
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,900
This evening, Mr. Ma was hosting
an investment presentation

25
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,278
when he left in a rush due to suspicions
of stock manipulation.

26
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,613
About two hours later,

27
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,865
he fell to his death
from the rooftop of the building.

28
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,533
The police arrested a suspect named Lee

29
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,328
who confessed to the murder
and was arrested on site.

30
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,330
CEO Jang who was also injured

31
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,250
was taken to a nearby hospital
by paramedics.

32
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,592
What do you think?

33
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,221
A lot of the data we got from Navis'
network during the presentation is gone.

34
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,390
We've been exposed, haven't we?
This location.

35
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,307
Yes.

36
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,642
We've been breached.

37
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,398
Pack up.

38
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,317
We can stay with Ringo for a while.

39
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,829
Is she okay?

40
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,290
Of course she isn't.

41
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,000
Her home has been breached.

42
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,084
What about you?

43
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,384
It's not the first time
I received a message like this.

44
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,097
But it feels different this time.

45
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,142
It feels more like an invitation
than a warning.

46
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,520
As if he'll be stepping up himself soon.

47
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,528
Huh?

48
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,908
Hey, I'm back.

49
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,998
Did you smoke again?

50
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:32,999
No.

51
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,257
Have you lost your mind?
Do you want to get kicked out again?

52
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,884
Don't you hear the public announcements

53
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,427
the hospital makes day and night
because of you?

54
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,762
Tell them to kick me out.

55
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,473
It's so stuffy in here.
I want to be discharged.

56
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,224
How infuriating can you get?

57
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,351
Look at yourself!

58
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,519
Did you get me beer?

59
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,563
That won't help your bones heal faster!

60
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,365
Doesn't it even hurt?

61
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:08,993
I'll survive.

62
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,079
-How can you laugh about this?
-Come on.

63
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,789
Smile a little. Did someone die?

64
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,917
Oh, Ma Kang-su died.

65
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,087
-Are you feeling okay?
-About what?

66
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,213
Getting beat up.

67
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,841
What's with the concern?

68
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,677
It's not like it's my first time

69
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,054
getting my ass kicked.

70
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,139
It's just been a while.

71
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,768
And if the guy who beat you up dies?

72
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,562
You don't have anything left to say.

73
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,732
When my dad who always beat me up died,

74
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,235
I had nothing to say.

75
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,778
I didn't even resent him.

76
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,822
I'm kind of cool that way.

77
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,406
I don't hold a grudge.

78
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,952
But why did you go to Ma Kang-su
of all people?

79
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,328
He's super tough.

80
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:56,207
I saw him beat the shit out of one of
Jang Kyung-ja's guys when I went over.

81
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,667
Always join up with the strongest.

82
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,085
What kind of reasoning is that?

83
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,878
He also gave me orders

84
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,257
and I thought I might find the notebook
we were looking for.

85
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,299
The notebook?

86
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,511
How? Jang Kyung-ja burnt it.

87
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,513
She didn't.

88
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,557
I set up a camera in her office

89
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,600
and she had this lighter.

90
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,102
She hid something in there.

91
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,145
After modifying it.

92
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,146
What did she hide?

93
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,607
How should I know? I thought
maybe it was a copy of the notebook.

94
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,067
Did you tell Ro-eum about this?

95
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,026
No, not yet.

96
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,319
Don't tell her yet.

97
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,196
-Why not?
-There was a breach

98
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,116
at the comic store yesterday
so she has a lot on her plate.

99
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,742
The comic store? Who?

100
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,536
The Chairman.

101
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,341
We lost most of the data
Na-sa got with the hacking tool.

102
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,968
It was important evidence

103
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,553
but I failed to keep it safe.

104
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,721
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,805
It's not your fault.

106
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,308
She's right. It's not your fault.

107
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,935
We got to them but why does
it feel like they got to us?

108
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,522
This op was focused on Ma Kang-su
but we lost everything.

109
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,733
We stopped
the stock manipulation at least.

110
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,028
Preventing the Closing
will be a blow to the Chairman,

111
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,280
and ultimately, we reduced
the number of scam victims.

112
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,949
Everyone here helped do that.

113
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,163
I'll start preparing for a class action.

114
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,541
I'm going to set up obstacles
for every action Navis Well-being takes

115
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,626
as a last resort.

116
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,921
But don't lawsuits take a long time?

117
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:29,008
It'll take some time to
gather up people to join the suit,

118
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,303
but once we do,
we can move up the date.

119
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,806
Nothing applies more pressure
than class action suits in fraud cases.

120
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,892
When I submit the complaint,

121
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,311
I'll also be filing for
a seize and search warrant

122
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,772
against the Navis building
and their executives,

123
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,398
as well as a travel ban against them.

124
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,485
They'll already be destroying
evidence and getting ready to run.

125
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,986
You know better than anyone

126
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,615
what scammers do to hide.

127
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,243
If we can stop them
from destroying evidence,

128
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,453
can we get them with the search warrant?

129
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,579
Let's hope so.

130
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,123
For now,

131
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,959
the Chairman has reacted,

132
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,419
and he might make a move himself,

133
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,505
so we should move quickly too.

134
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,763
The situation isn't so dire.

135
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,307
The public has started
to be wary of Navis,

136
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,768
and investigative authorities
are taking notice.

137
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,062
Then we should start
by searching their headquarters.

138
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,647
I'll try to recover the lost data.

139
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,315
We might be able to get something
that could help.

140
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,358
For starters,

141
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,068
let's tie up Navis's hand and feet.

142
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,531
It's unusual in stock manipulation

143
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,409
for information to be shared
with the public first.

144
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,204
An exposé file from a blog
called "Ho-jung" went public

145
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,499
which prevented
the worst possible outcome.

146
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,545
Woo Young-gi, a reporter with Moran Daily,
is here to tell us more.

147
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,462
Hello.

148
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,880
-Hello.
-Yes.

149
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,593
I heard that you foresaw
this stock manipulation early on?

150
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,470
I foresaw Mr. Ma's fraudulent activities
to be exact.

151
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,056
-I see.
-I owe it to the blog "Ho-jung."

152
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,267
The blog was created by Yeon Tae-hun

153
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,186
the father of Yeon Ho-jung
who was a victim of Darusa International,

154
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,397
a pyramid company belonging to Ma Kang-su.

155
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,025
-The blog targeted pyramid schemes.
-I see.

156
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,278
Then, let's take a look
at the interview with Yeon Tae-hun,

157
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,821
and continue with our story.

158
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:19,327
Ma Kang-su may have died

159
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,748
without paying for his crimes
but Navis Well-being is still standing.

160
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,291
And they still have

161
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,295
a lot to explain for to the public.

162
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,591
If the investigation is carried out
transparently and fairly,

163
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,512
then I believe there will

164
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,933
no longer be victims
like my daughter, Ho-jung.

165
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,645
Does he mean Navis

166
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,231
must explain about
the stock manipulation?

167
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,943
That, as well as many other
violations of the law.

168
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,322
Today, on the blog Ho-jung,

169
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,200
the entire archive on Navis Well-being
will be posted.

170
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,702
Examples of damages
will continue to be posted,

171
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,371
and tip-offs are also welcome.

172
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,208
Previous, and current members of Navis,
as well as businesses and consumers,

173
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,251
it doesn't matter what it is about.

174
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,295
We'll be waiting to hear from you.

175
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,651
There's nothing about
you in the stock manipulation file.

176
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,487
And as Mr. Ma has died,
he can't be indicted.

177
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,032
The Financial Supervisory Service
will investigate but…

178
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,577
The posts on the blog are quite serious.

179
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,873
So what's your suggestion?

180
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,459
Is this the best you can do
after what I paid you?

181
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,546
We're doing everything we can to stop it.

182
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,588
The problem is

183
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,715
public opinion.

184
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,469
People want refunds
and the local centers are in chaos.

185
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:05,099
If we provide refunds for everyone,
we'll go bankrupt sooner than expected.

186
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,935
We don't have much time left.

187
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,563
You must work things out
with the higher-ups.

188
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,570
You can't even manage
the members of the local centers?

189
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,906
Are people just that stupid?

190
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,160
If the company is investigated
and the CEO goes to prison,

191
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,122
do they believe they'll get
their advance payments back?

192
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,500
Go and tell them

193
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,503
what'll happen if the company
is at risk!

194
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,006
And what stance they should take!

195
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,801
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,430
Start cleaning up inside.

197
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,273
While people are continuing to demand
refunds from Navis Well-being,

198
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:58,861
Navis claims they will carry out refunds
in order, through their local centers,

199
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,821
and that they will take legal action

200
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,781
against any unconfirmed rumors.

201
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,075
Navis Well-being

202
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,245
has 100,000 members at the local centers.

203
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,166
Any tip-offs will be shared and
we've also secured internal documents.

204
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,503
I'm hoping our law firm
will stand on the side of the victims.

205
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,670
I need your help.

206
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,604
The comic shop.

207
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,105
Was it you?

208
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,774
Does it matter who did it?

209
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,235
It's not like
you didn't know this would happen.

210
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,612
You and I are in
an entirely different game now.

211
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,241
-There's no middle-ground.
-You said you would help this time.

212
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,743
I asked you to help
me get through the presentation.

213
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,912
How could I have known
Jang Kyung-ja would kill someone?

214
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,580
She almost died too.

215
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,624
Because of you.

216
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,167
I gave her a chance.

217
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,835
She turned me down.

218
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,753
What chance?

219
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,547
A chance to give up the Chairman.

220
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,091
She knows who the Chairman is.

221
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,431
That was it? That was
what you were after in the notebook?

222
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,017
Guns only have meaning when
you have someone to shoot, right?

223
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:12,977
No.

224
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,728
You changed your mind.

225
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,731
You're depending on the prosecution
or the press.

226
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,944
Didn't you learn anything from Red Eye?
You can't put your hopes in them.

227
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,279
I didn't realize

228
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,741
that you could never me on my side.

229
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,872
-Ro-eum.
-You better not come after us again

230
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,874
in any way or for any reason.

231
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,919
Like I said, I just didn't have
anyone to shoot so far,

232
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,671
not that I didn't have a gun.

233
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,355
WOO YOUNG-GI

234
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,944
It's your choice. Kill the story or leave.

235
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,947
If you keep acting on your own,
I don't want you on the team.

236
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,285
So, what's your answer?

237
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,872
Is this because of our parent company?

238
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,750
Are you pussyfooting around
because the relationship with Ma Kang-su

239
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,251
during the Darusa incident
might crop up again?

240
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,753
You're nothing but talk,

241
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,881
an attention hog who went on TV
without me signing off on it.

242
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,758
Do you think you're
a freedom fighter or something?

243
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,887
You can leave this job
and go do whatever you want.

244
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,766
Now I get it.

245
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,020
I see why I had such a good feeling
about Han Moo-young.

246
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,147
Both he and I

247
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,359
are nut-jobs who have to make
crazy choices in insane situations.

248
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,485
That was it.

249
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,999
Oh, I've been fired so
I better get my severance pay.

250
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,087
If you try to stiff me,
I'm going to write an exposé on you.

251
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,256
You should be ashamed.

252
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,424
What the heck?

253
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,720
Oh? Mr. Woo.

254
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,430
Oh, hello.

255
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,682
Hello.

256
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,393
Were you fired?

257
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,436
No, I resigned.

258
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,481
The company was too small for
the likes of a great journalist like me.

259
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,650
Oh, I'm sorry.

260
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,943
It's true.

261
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,405
Now that I've been on TV, I think
I'll go into investigative journalism.

262
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,948
Let's go have a drink later.

263
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,533
Yes, it'll be on us.

264
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,286
Thanks. Drinks sound good.

265
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,538
By the way,

266
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,957
is it okay if I crash here for a few days?

267
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,475
The contracts all look bogus

268
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,935
but there's no proof.

269
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,312
Have you been able to recover anything?

270
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,024
I'm trying with the ones
that have a higher security level.

271
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,533
I'll be right back.

272
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,954
She looks so depressed.

273
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,290
You think it's because of the video?

274
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,626
She's been watching them
on her own all this time.

275
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,421
I can't even imagine
how she must've felt.

276
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,633
That's why I'm trying to do
everything I can, so that I can help

277
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,094
and end this as soon as possible.

278
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,054
Yeah.

279
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,306
Okay.

280
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,308
Starting today, all private conversations

281
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,477
and data sharing
is prohibited between departments.

282
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,479
Department heads should
sort out the important documents

283
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,772
and send it up
to the financial department.

284
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,524
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

285
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,859
We'll also be
checking computers for security issues.

286
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,569
Hand in the hard drives.

287
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,451
That's a non-disclosure agreement.

288
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,830
If anyone doesn't comply, the managers
in charge will be held accountable.

289
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,499
When the company is in trouble,

290
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,460
we need to show our solidarity
for public opinion to die down.

291
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,672
People are talking about cancelling
memberships and refunds,

292
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,007
but if this is really a scam as they say,

293
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,469
then you're all accomplices.

294
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,228
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

295
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,813
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

296
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,275
NAME OF THE RECIPIENT

297
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,776
TIP-OFF REPORT

298
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,573
All the tip-offs so far are anonymous.

299
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,659
And none are current salespeople at Navis.

300
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,205
That's how it is with pyramid schemes.
When in trouble, they close ranks.

301
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,416
Looks like it's going to
turn into a long, uphill battle

302
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,102
LIST OF DOCUMENTS

303
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,562
LIST OF INVESTORS

304
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,605
BUDGET REQUEST FORM

305
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,981
INVOICES

306
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,920
Hello?

307
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,298
We threw away something by mistake
and we'd like to retrieve it.

308
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,009
Yes, Da-jeong.

309
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,971
Yes, of course. I saved the list.

310
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,556
I'll send it to you right away.

311
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,029
Instead of Jang Kyung-ja,
Navis is being managed by Kim Yeol,

312
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,948
the CFO, a former prosecutor.

313
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,617
He's keeping the entire company
under lock-down in case of a search.

314
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,912
This is their trash from today but there
are no shredded papers or hard drives.

315
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,957
If they used their employees
to get them out,

316
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,584
it'll be impossible
to track them all down.

317
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,379
Kim Yeol goes
straight home from the work.

318
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,964
Nothing stands out about him.

319
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,967
I found something in the data I recovered.

320
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,345
Some of Navis's funds
are going to an overseas corporation

321
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,430
under the name of Ji Seung-don.

322
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,057
It looks like an ordinary contract,

323
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,684
but I think
they're laundering money through it.

324
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,687
The name seemed familiar, and
I realized I saw it on Mr. Woo's papers.

325
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,438
Here, take a look.

326
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,442
Ever since I started looking in Red Eye,
I've been wondering

327
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,780
who put up the 10 billion won
to start the foundation.

328
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,992
So I made up a list of
who had that amount of capital,

329
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,577
and had ties to Geumseong city
at the time.

330
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,578
On that list

331
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,247
was Ji Seung-don.

332
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,917
The Chairman of Jangsu Paper which
closed after Red Eye was established.

333
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,253
He's almost 90 years old.

334
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,298
We never heard of his name
while we were at Red Eye.

335
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,217
That means we've found something
they've been trying to hide,

336
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,637
and the fact that they're still using it
means that it's worth digging into.

337
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,390
I think we should look into the people
around Ji Seung-don first.

338
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,558
I…

339
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,600
I'll help.

340
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,936
And the lawsuit?

341
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,605
The members of local centers
are reluctant to step up.

342
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,149
-Why?
-The advance payments they made

343
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,400
are tied up in the company,

344
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,944
and they think they won't get it back
if they sue.

345
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,115
Do they think Navis will give it back
if they do nothing?

346
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,950
We can't force them to join the suit

347
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,536
so I'm planning on dropping in
at the local center myself.

348
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,542
Here are some towels

349
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,294
you can use…

350
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,338
There's no space left.

351
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,056
Call Na-sa.

352
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,437
Come on.

353
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,189
Oh.

354
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,909
Na-sa.

355
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,996
Are you out of your mind?
How did you get out?

356
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,416
Call it a determination to escape.

357
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,377
Why did I dig this place so deep?

358
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,171
That ladder almost killed me.

359
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,380
Are you okay?

360
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,132
About 50 percent?

361
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,383
What?

362
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,386
-You need to go back to the hospital.
-Ow, that hurts.

363
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,638
Stop nagging.

364
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,764
Let him be.

365
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,973
He says he's okay.

366
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,683
Ro-eum knows me best

367
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,477
at times like this.

368
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,729
By the way,

369
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,606
did you move in or what?

370
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,276
I guess it's for the better.

371
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,194
Huh?

372
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,656
You really didn't get anything from Navis?

373
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,865
No.

374
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,828
They'll be on edge about it,
but they're just keeping everything there?

375
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,330
Can you think of any place
where they might hide things?

376
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,748
You saw their floor plans.

377
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,708
If they're keeping it in there,
we're screwed.

378
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,837
We don't have anyone on the inside,
their security will be tighter than ever,

379
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,131
and our engineer is out of action.

380
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,507
What about the search and seize?

381
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,551
Won't the place be searched
once the suit begins?

382
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,846
No one is willing to sue in case
they don't get their money back.

383
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,391
That's unbelievable.

384
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,520
Say we'll give them money. Tell them
we'll give them money if they sue.

385
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,356
How does that make any sense?

386
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,610
Hey, come to think of it,

387
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,113
we've never had drinks together before.

388
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,906
What's so good about drinks?

389
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,618
You don't know what you're talking about.
Our friendship is all messed up

390
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,328
because we never drank together.

391
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,205
-What's wrong with it?
-It's super awkward.

392
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,916
Does it feel like we've been roommates
for ten years?

393
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,919
It's so awkward, it's suffocating.

394
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:26,214
Isn't just being sober awkward for you?

395
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,262
Hey.

396
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,307
Look at Ro-eum. Her routine
is just like a prison routine.

397
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,518
Are you trying to pick a fight or what?

398
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,936
Come on, it's true.

399
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,896
Right?

400
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,856
You should go try it out.

401
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,275
It'll cure your alcohol addiction.

402
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,571
I've already been, for three months.
Because of a used car.

403
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,906
Good for you.

404
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,532
It's just a fact.

405
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,077
Besides, once this is over,
we'll all probably end up there.

406
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,413
No big deal.

407
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,539
Hey.

408
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,000
Ro-eum and I are on probation too.

409
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,877
You know what the judge will say?

410
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,170
"You little punks!"

411
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,713
Will you please shut up?

412
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,676
What did you say?

413
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,846
He said, go to sleep.

414
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,809
Next time, talk in Korean.

415
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,744
Well, that was quick.

416
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,708
Why did you make such a mess of things?

417
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,919
What should I have done then?

418
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,255
Should I have let Ma Kang-su kill me?

419
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,882
Should I have let him take my company,

420
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,219
and just be cast off after the Closing?
Is that it?

421
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:58,098
We retrieved Mr. Ma's cell phone.

422
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,059
We heard the call you had with Lee Ro-eum.

423
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,852
Since Mr. Ma is no longer here,

424
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,982
you should take responsibility.

425
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,830
If I die,

426
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,458
or go to prison,

427
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,420
if that happens…

428
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,340
The world will learn a lot.

429
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,593
Is that a threat?

430
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,512
You can call it a threat or a deal.

431
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:41,308
Get me out of the country
safely within a week.

432
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,185
If you do,

433
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,605
I will go back to being a loyal servant.

434
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,696
Are you comfortable
staying at the auto repair shop?

435
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,242
You're not, are you?

436
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,830
Even you can't foresee every situation
and prepare for it.

437
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,583
It must've come as quite a shock.

438
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,586
And you'll be worried
about the comic shop.

439
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,171
Don't you think…

440
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,718
that every time we bring in
a new team member,

441
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,890
or every time we consider
the plights of people

442
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,225
we define as victims,

443
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,229
the more vulnerable we become?

444
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,274
I failed ten years ago
because of one reason only.

445
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,735
It wasn't because I was stupid,

446
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,113
or because Jang Kyung-ja betrayed me,

447
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,073
or because I was unlucky.

448
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,867
It was because I had someone
I wanted to protect.

449
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,625
At the rate we're going,

450
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,919
we'll lose.

451
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:37,715
Because of the people we call friends.
Because we're trying to protect them all.

452
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,384
You're right.

453
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,470
Protecting someone and becoming a team

454
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,431
is hard work.

455
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:48,268
But we got this far
because you are strong.

456
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,061
Not because I asked you to.

457
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,606
Without courage, who could stand
together with all these people,

458
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,066
and fight for each other?

459
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,654
You call this courage?

460
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,531
Grouping up together?

461
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,827
Admitting that you need each other

462
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,412
takes a lot of courage.

463
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,290
I wasn't able to do that before.

464
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,333
When?

465
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,962
When my mother left.

466
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,176
I had a chance to ask her to stay.

467
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,513
I could have asked her
to hang in there and get through it

468
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,639
with me.

469
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,143
But I didn't
because I didn't have the courage.

470
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,269
Actually,

471
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,441
I didn't have the courage
to get through it either.

472
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,197
You chose a way

473
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,575
that was beneficial for you
and for everyone.

474
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,662
And that will make us more solid,

475
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,914
and stronger.

476
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,336
Is that the better ending?

477
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,880
I think so.

478
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,385
Because we'll fight

479
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,221
until we win

480
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,806
for each other.

481
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,837
Su-ho.

482
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:41,881
What the heck?

483
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,258
Where'd he go?

484
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,142
Na-sa.

485
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,813
Do you remember what
Jang Kyung-ja's lighter looks like?

486
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:00,692
It's the one
that Jay used to use a long time ago.

487
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,111
The one from Elden Bridge?

488
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,237
Yeah.

489
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,157
You think we can get the same one?

490
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,075
Why?

491
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,537
What for?

492
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,664
I was thinking we could switch it out
with Jang Kyung-ja's.

493
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,374
Is that what Ro-eum wants to do?

494
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,045
Is that even possible?
She carries it around all the time.

495
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,922
I thought maybe we could ask Jay.

496
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,844
Would he get it for us?

497
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,512
It can't hurt to ask.

498
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,180
Can you get the same one?

499
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,182
It's really old…

500
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,937
But I'll make a few calls.

501
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,439
Thank you.

502
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,151
Let's go. Ro-eum will be waiting.

503
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,446
Damn it.

504
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,076
Wow. Ro-eum always has a plan.

505
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,622
It's the same plan.
Though the outcome might be different.

506
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,333
It'll be a cinch
compared to what I've been doing.

507
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,878
Well? Aren't you going to work?

508
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,088
I've got to start moving.

509
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,093
Where should we put this?

510
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,054
Over there for now.

511
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,392
NAVIS WELL-BEING BRANCHES

512
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,943
ADVANCE PAYMENT CONFIRMATION

513
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,486
Oh, my.

514
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,452
WELCOME TO BLUE MOUSE FINANCE

515
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,874
YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR SPECIAL LOAN RATE

516
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,257
Excuse me…

517
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,343
Hello.

518
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,928
Welcome to Blue Mouse Finance.

519
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,388
Please have a seat.

520
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,182
I see you work at
the pyramid company, Navis Well-being.

521
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,559
Oh, we're not like that. We're different.

522
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:03,398
Even with all the parts,
the production cost is only 7,000 won.

523
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,068
And you're selling it for 700,000 won?

524
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,529
I don't know anything
about the production cost.

525
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,115
I just do what the company tells me to do.

526
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,533
If you want a loan,

527
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,035
you need to submit
the following documents.

528
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,287
Your salary, dividends,

529
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,581
and loans provided by the company,

530
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,792
and all records
regarding advance payments,

531
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,878
In other words, proof that Navis

532
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,256
is extorting your precious money

533
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,425
under the pretext of advance payments,

534
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,844
forcing you to buy goods
worth less than trash,

535
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,555
tying you up with illegal loans.

536
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,224
thereby making your credit rating plunge.

537
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,228
I'm heading out.

538
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,774
Bring the documents on here.

539
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,026
It's a gift.

540
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,110
Thanks.

541
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,614
Hello.

542
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,074
Welcome.

543
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,581
Here.

544
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,335
What is it?

545
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,588
Is there a problem?

546
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,423
No, it's just…

547
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,092
I think you need a legal consult.

548
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,385
Oh…

549
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,304
Mr. Han.

550
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,391
Please, take a seat.

551
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,814
Hello, Park and Cue.

552
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,732
Yes.

553
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,525
Yes, that's right.

554
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,112
We're currently giving free legal counsel

555
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,031
regarding the Navis case.

556
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,199
Yes.

557
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,950
You can come with several people.

558
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,078
Yes.

559
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,331
Hey, an inquiry.

560
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,542
From local center members.

561
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,463
-We're starting to get inquiries now.
-All of a sudden?

562
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,059
Ro-eum.

563
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,186
What?

564
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,356
Can I ask you something
I've been wondering about a long time?

565
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,524
What is it?

566
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,527
When I first joined Red Eye

567
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,613
and got beat up all the time
because I kept trying to escape,

568
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,031
why did you save you?

569
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,201
You looked like a magpie.

570
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,913
And I knew you'd always
repay kindness like one

571
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,289
the moment I saw you.

572
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,542
My first impression
reminds you of a magpie?

573
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,585
I see.

574
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,172
When I first saw you,
I thought you were really pretty.

575
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,766
Nothing shakes you, does it?

576
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,150
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

577
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,370
Mo?

578
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,497
Oh.

579
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,964
They're never around
where they should be.

580
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,966
They're not answering my calls either.

581
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,926
Do you think they're okay?

582
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,597
I wouldn't know
since they're not in touch.

583
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,518
-Here.
-Thanks.

584
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,063
Um…

585
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,608
I wasn't much help that time, was I?

586
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,360
It's been weighing on my mind.

587
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,990
The only thing I can do for them
is provide counseling,

588
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,868
but I think counseling

589
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,538
may seem like something from
an entirely different world to Ro-eum.

590
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,956
Because it is.

591
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,377
But for people like me
and people like you,

592
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,713
we need to hear stories
from different worlds.

593
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,006
Isn't that how it is?

594
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,178
Maybe you weren't much help
during the op that day,

595
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,846
but you've helped me a lot.

596
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,188
Have a drink of soda.

597
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,532
By the way,

598
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,826
why did you go into psychiatry?

599
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,081
What about you?
Why did you become a probation officer?

600
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,626
Do you have a lot of time?
It might take all night to talk about it.

601
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,586
Sum it up.

602
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,047
Professor Shin is a part of it.
Do you still want to know?

603
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,757
Never mind, I'd rather not listen.

604
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,841
No, you have to.

605
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,176
-No.
-Just listen.

606
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,094
No, no.

607
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,180
Are you okay?

608
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,941
We should at least get a consult.

609
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,735
Just listen to what they have to say.

610
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,154
-Hello.
-Hello.

611
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,701
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
PARK JA-YOUNG

612
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,249
What is it?

613
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,167
Will it be difficult?

614
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,133
Are you a member of Navis Well-being?

615
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,552
It's a legal pyramid company.

616
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,346
It's going through a rough patch
these days,

617
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,807
but it's actually a really good company.

618
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,935
Once the CEO's health recovers,
it'll all go back to normal.

619
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,396
My mother left home

620
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,690
because of my father.

621
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,655
Oh,

622
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,533
I know that my salary isn't much,

623
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,786
but that depends
on individual capabilities

624
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,580
and I earned less than others.

625
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,707
The others earn a lot.

626
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,794
But still, I have an advance payment

627
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,838
so I can pay it back with that,

628
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,674
but it's in the company account

629
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,760
which I'll get next month.

630
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,430
Our company doesn't lend money.

631
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,806
Oh, but…

632
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,683
I don't need that much.

633
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,729
Just about two million,
or even 1.5 million won would be enough.

634
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,233
I'll be in a tough spot

635
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,486
if I get behind on my rent.

636
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,202
What I mean to say is,

637
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,413
we're not a money lender.

638
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,292
We just provide legal consult.

639
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,005
Legal consult, for what?

640
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,216
Navis Well-being

641
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,635
is a scam.

642
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,346
We're gathering up victims

643
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,390
to file a class action suit.

644
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,600
You need to sue

645
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,103
in order to get you advance payment back.

646
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,109
Of course, no one is forcing you.

647
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,486
You should talk to a lawyer and decide…

648
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,243
I'm sorry.

649
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,413
Are you a lawyer?

650
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,789
No.

651
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,708
I'm not a lawyer.

652
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,551
Mr. Han.

653
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,682
This is Park Ja-young,

654
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,185
a member of Navis Well-being
who's here for a consult.

655
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,812
I see.

656
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,212
What am I doing here?

657
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,924
I have to finish up my laundry.

658
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,181
Are you living in Seoul?

659
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,141
Yes.

660
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,858
You've really

661
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,195
become a lawyer?

662
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,322
Yes.

663
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,949
Wow.

664
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,243
I'm impressed.

665
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,204
You must've studied so hard.

666
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,832
What about your father?

667
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,840
He's well.

668
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,302
Good.

669
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,680
Yes, I knew

670
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,767
that your father

671
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,437
would take care of you.

672
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,901
What about you?

673
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,152
Have you been well?

674
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,157
What right do I have to be well?

675
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,619
Don't say that. You should be.

676
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,997
I wish you are.

677
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,755
I am

678
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,008
so sorry.

679
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,514
I wish

680
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,560
you didn't have to see me like this.

681
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,187
It's all right.

682
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,564
I must've been insane.

683
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,856
What was I thinking?

684
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,485
I had no idea it was a scam.

685
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,990
I can help you now.

686
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,366
So don't worry.

687
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,036
Your son is a lawyer
so you have nothing to worry about.

688
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,333
I'm so sorry.

689
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,862
GYEONG-HO

690
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,409
Yeah.

691
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,037
It's better this way.

692
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,124
It was for the best.

693
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,461
Damn it.

694
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,608
Han Moo-young.

695
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,533
I'm sorry.

696
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,763
Thanks for coming.

697
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,765
What's this favor you need?

698
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,892
You said before

699
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,103
we all owe Ro-eum.

700
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,148
Remember?

701
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,114
We need Ms. Jang's lighter.

702
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:43,657
Why?

703
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,201
To pay my debt to Ro-eum.

704
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,371
Don't you want to pay your debt

705
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,039
to Ro-eum?

706
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,196
Was this you?

707
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:25,866
Yes.

708
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,079
I think my fever dropped thanks to you.

709
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,084
So, you talked to her?

710
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,545
Yes.

711
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,258
Oh.

712
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,053
We have the people for our lawsuit.

713
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,554
It's time to wrap things up.

714
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:50,891
We are

715
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,143
almost ready too.

716
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,865
You're visiting someone in the hospital.

717
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,784
No flowers?

718
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,327
I'm here

719
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,746
to give you one last chance.

720
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,374
You should confess to everything.

721
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,088
And the terms?

722
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,590
You're taking responsibility
for your crimes,

723
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,133
so what terms do you need?

724
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,011
It wasn't my fault.

725
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,765
I was used, just like Ro-eum.

726
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,185
Then reveal who's behind everything.

727
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,313
Who gave the orders
that led that thousands of victims.

728
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,440
Not confessing

729
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,527
is an act of wrongdoing
that is separate from the Chairman's.

730
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,778
It's not being used.

731
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:47,197
You think
I'm a terrible person, don't you?

732
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,740
I think you're a criminal.

733
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,117
If…

734
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,536
I hadn't been born as myself,

735
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,871
I would've had a different life.

736
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,000
But someone would be here in my place.

737
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,086
I was just doing the best
with the role I was given.

738
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,254
To survive,

739
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,131
I did what I had to.

740
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,633
I was hoping you had
a sense of responsibility,

741
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,302
but I see I'm wasting my time.

742
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,554
For me, survival is what matters.

743
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,889
What's the use of everything if you die?

744
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,768
Don't you think that

745
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,938
putting the Chairman away
is the safest option for you?

746
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,150
There's a world
that you know nothing about.

747
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,694
Whatever you think about me,

748
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,530
I like you.

749
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,782
You have I have something in common.

750
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,867
Is that so?

751
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,410
We're both

752
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,871
in love with someone

753
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,289
who'll never love us back.

754
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,295
I'll see you in court.

755
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,963
If you're lucky.

756
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,140
You're still in it with her?

757
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,017
Ro-eum's revenge.

758
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,021
Could you kill someone

759
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,024
for her?

760
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,610
Is that a good thing in your book?

761
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,529
She didn't need
your help ten years ago,

762
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,865
and she doesn't need it now.

763
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,869
I'm sure you don't even have the time
since you have to save Ms. Jang.

764
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:19,039
Though, I'm not even sure you want to.

765
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,595
I talked to
Ji Seung-don's son in the States,

766
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,766
and he confirmed that Ji Seung-don's
entire assets were donated to Red Eye.

767
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,559
That's why they're no longer
on speaking terms.

768
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,728
He hasn't been in touch
with his family for years.

769
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:46,149
Also, he said someone called
ten years ago looking for Ji Seung-don.

770
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,402
I'm thinking,
it must've been Ahn Chae-hong.

771
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,405
He said he received
a bill from some hospital at the time,

772
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,365
so he gave that name
to Ahn Chae-hong.

773
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,950
Was it Haeseong Hospital?

774
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,411
The one that Hong Chang-gi
took Ahn Chae-hong to.

775
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,328
Yes.

776
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,540
When we looked into it,
it had been closed so we found nothing,

777
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,458
but I found out when I saw the bill.

778
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,503
Ji Seung-don was lying in a coma
at the hospital's VIP room.

779
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,464
Who put him in the hospital?

780
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,383
Apparently, he had a helper.

781
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,845
A young person who was from
the group home Ji Seong-don sponsored.

782
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,389
I don't know anything more than that.

783
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,560
Mr. Woo said he's checking out
the group home

784
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,228
to see what he could find out.

785
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,771
Okay.

786
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,441
Members of the network
marketing group, Navis Well-being

787
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,485
which had been under fire
for stock manipulation and recalls

788
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,697
have filed a class action suit.

789
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,950
They are suspected of investment fraud,
default on obligations,

790
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:40,954
violation of door-to-door sales, as well
as embezzlement and breach of trust.

791
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:44,374
We've requested a travel ban
and a search against the executives.

792
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,169
Park Gyu,
the legal representative of the Plaintiffs

793
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,837
is representing the 150 victims

794
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,506
and has filed a damages claim
in the amount of one billion won

795
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,508
at Seoul Central District Court today.

796
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,595
The financial crimes unit
of the Seoul Metropolitan Police

797
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,097
has stated they could file
for a search warrant

798
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,974
against Navis Well-being's headquarters

799
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,018
and their local centers
without any further delay.

800
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,853
We have a warrant.

801
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,077
This way.

802
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,251
What the hell?

803
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,214
What do you think you're doing?

804
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,883
We received a tip
about a secret room here.

805
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,512
The members from the local centers

806
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,055
all said the same thing.

807
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,808
The center managers
sent all their files to headquarters.

808
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,892
Some by courier too.

809
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:47,229
Some of the members had family
working at headquarters.

810
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,190
They were told to send documents and
hard drives to the finance department.

811
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,358
Oh. Right here.

812
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,985
This is the place that was different
from the floor plans. Here.

813
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,822
A space between the finance
department on the second floor and a beam.

814
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,698
-A secret space.
-Yes.

815
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,908
It's probably a fake wall.

816
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:02,327
They can use a non-destructive device
to see through it.

817
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,503
There's a space here.

818
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,088
Open it.

819
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,631
How do you get in?

820
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:21,930
While police were searching
Navis Well-being yesterday evening,

821
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,224
CFO Kim was arrested.

822
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,271
USB drives, hard disks,
and classified documents

823
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,357
were found in a secret room
at headquarters.

824
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,735
Ledgers regarding lobbying activities
against politicians, businessmen,

825
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,071
and current prosecutors were also found.

826
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,408
It was the moment when a pyramid scam

827
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,118
turned in "Navis-gate."

828
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,121
Damages from Navis Well-being's
pyramid sales

829
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,373
and gift certificates, and memberships

830
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,917
is said to range from billions

831
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,545
to trillions of won.

832
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,089
The prosecution has formed a special team

833
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,757
to investigate Navis Well-being

834
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,011
from an entirely new viewpoint.

835
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:02,971
RYU JAE-HYEOK

836
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,933
Yes, this is Ryu Jae-hyeok.

837
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,269
This is the Chief Prosecutor.

838
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,522
Yes, sir.

839
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:16,151
A notice was sent.
Read it and come back as ASAP.

840
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,571
Yes, sir.

841
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,542
URGENT REASSIGNMENT
RYU JAE-HYEOK

842
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,529
Okay.

843
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,449
I'll be right back.

844
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,660
Hey, where are you going?

845
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,912
To see Jay.
He said he'd get me the lighter.

846
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,455
Do you have the watch?

847
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:11,957
Of course.

848
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,042
Send the signal as soon as you get there
so that we know where you are.

849
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:14,960
Got it.

850
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,670
Who's nagging who now?

851
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,171
See you later.

852
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,659
UNKNOWN SENDER
20 GEOSEO-RO, MABOK-GU

853
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,709
RECENTS

854
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,637
I'll be there as soon as I finish up here.

855
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,267
Jay.

856
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,478
Find Jay.

857
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,063
Excuse me?

858
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,357
Find Jay.

859
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,359
Ping his location right now.

860
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,612
We'll be late. If you miss this flight…

861
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,238
Turn the car around, now!

862
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,288
Where's everyone?

863
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,333
Ringo went to meet Jay.

864
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,251
I don't know about the rest.

865
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,628
Why would Ringo meet Jay?

866
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,588
The lighter.

867
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,757
Jay said he could give him the lighter.

868
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,800
What lighter?

869
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,555
Damn it, I knew it.

870
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,600
LEE RO-EUM

871
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,189
Please leave a message…

872
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,906
Hey.

873
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,325
Moo-young, it's me. It looks like

874
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:55,328
there's going to be
a bigger group filing the suit.

875
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:58,206
We need to bring in another firm
to help out. What do you think?

876
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,332
Oh, really?

877
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,543
Okay, let's do that then.

878
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,753
By the way,
Did Gyeong-ho get in touch with you?

879
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,130
No, not recently.

880
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,590
He asked for your address earlier
so I told him.

881
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,259
You did?

882
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,136
When you talk to him,

883
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,805
he might not be pleased if he finds out

884
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,890
you're working with Lee Ro-eum.

885
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,934
How does he know Ro-eum?

886
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,686
Since you told him about Red Eye,

887
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,813
and the scams and stuff…

888
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,983
I never told him about Ro-eum.

889
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,026
Then where did he hear about Red Eye?

890
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,196
The first time I mentioned her was
when I talked about the damages case.

891
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,534
I'll call you back.

893
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,468
Jay.

894
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,347
The lighter?

895
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,020
Thanks.

896
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,276
Okay.

897
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:36,614
What's that?

898
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,159
I'm giving it back to Ro-eum.

899
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,828
Do you have to?

900
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,185
Don't you have
anything you want to ask me?

901
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,315
My name is…

902
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,152
Hi.

903
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:18,948
Come on in.

904
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,081
It's a little hard, right?

905
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,096
Did you see what was on it?

906
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,014
Not yet.

908
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,640
-Leave a message…
-Why isn't he answering?

909
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,559
REPORTER WOO

910
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,229
What if something happened?

911
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,107
Yes, Mr. Woo.

912
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,191
Yes, Da-jeong.

913
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,110
I sent you a photo just now.

914
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,863
It's the kid that Ji Seung-don
took care of until the end.

915
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,533
Do you recognize him?

916
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:44,617
Hang on.

917
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:50,581
Is it on there?

918
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,711
The identity of the Chairman?

919
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,216
What?

JAY IS THE CHAIRMAN

925
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,139
Take me to the Chairman.

926
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,141
Ro-eum, did you like your present?

927
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,018
What's your game?

928
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:37,021
You killed who and received what money?

929
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,439
Red Eye is my entire world.

930
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,942
It's the toy that I play with.

931
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,528
I did it your way
but I've only become more vulnerable.

932
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,862
Don't go alone.

933
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,657
Ro-eum, please. I'll be responsible.

934
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,659
I promise to end it.

935
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,285
It's time to return
to your rightful place.

936
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,454
I've been waiting for ten years.

937
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,623
I'm going to kill you.
