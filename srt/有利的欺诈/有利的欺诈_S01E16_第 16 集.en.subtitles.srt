1
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,267
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,480
I'LL GO BACK TO MY PLACE.

3
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,447
Do you mean this?

4
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,949
I do.

5
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,160
What brought this on?

6
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,453
I'll tell you when we meet.

7
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,830
Where are you?

8
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,874
I'm on the move, since I'm being chased.

9
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,584
I'll send the car.

10
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,252
You're coming alone, right?

11
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,546
What about you?

12
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,381
Will you be alone?

13
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,259
I'll text you.

14
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,402
Did you make the CCTV footage

15
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,279
delete automatically?

16
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,197
Yes.

17
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,950
Did you give Lee Ro-eum the pass?

18
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:57,909
Yes.

19
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,161
And Na Su-ho

20
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,496
was also part of this?

21
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:02,872
Yes.

22
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,752
Are you aware
you could serve time for this?

23
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,671
Yes.

24
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,798
And Han Moo-young?

25
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,467
He's the one that brought you two here.

26
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,846
No, you're the one who called us here.

27
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,601
Your place of residence and Na Su-ho's

28
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,019
will be searched,

29
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,813
and your phones will be analyzed.

30
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,942
Don't smash up the comic store.

31
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,903
You can get in with this key.

32
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,156
At the end of the hallway
where the bathroom is,

33
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,782
there's a locked circuit breaker.

34
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,200
Open that with this

35
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,370
and pull up the left lever.

36
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,414
It'll open the door to my work office.

37
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,041
You should see what's in there.

38
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,305
The documents you brought are

39
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,057
the complete versions of
the documents we found on Ji Seung-don.

40
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,395
As we suspected, that's how
they laundered money for Navis.

41
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,775
Roman and Bay, a law firm in Panama,
laundered the money for the Chairman.

42
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,361
Their main bank is B Bank
in the Netherlands.

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,038
We also found the banker
who managed the Chairman's money.

44
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,205
His name is Kevin Ju.

45
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,707
He's a Korean American

46
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,960
and in charge of all bank accounts
under Ji Seung-don's name.

47
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,886
Ji Seung-don has a total of five accounts.

48
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,138
Three are corporate, two are personal.

49
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,351
Over 700 billion won passed through
these accounts in the last three years.

50
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,899
As you can see, the money
laundered through these accounts

51
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,610
ends up in an encrypted secret account.

52
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,531
Everything you see now,

53
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,910
the prosecution will see
when they search the comic store.

54
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,653
The gray box contains evidence
on Navis collected from Ms. Jang's phone.

55
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:43,032
The documents on money laundered
by Roman and Bay are in the blue box.

56
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:47,704
The ones on B Bank and the banker Kevin Ju
are in the black box.

57
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,748
Documents on Red Eye are in the red,

58
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,293
and documents on Ji Seung-don
are in the white.

59
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,599
The five accounts used
for money laundering are in Ji's name.

60
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,061
And the money from those accounts ends up

61
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,980
in a secret account called F55.

62
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,983
If it's a secret account,
we can't know the name of account holder.

63
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,194
The person who has access
to those accounts is someone else.

64
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,656
Are you saying that's Lee Jay?

65
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,283
Yes.

66
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,951
And the proof?

67
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,746
Is that at the comic store as well?

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,211
These seem to be the money laundering
documents like she said.

69
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,755
The account records show

70
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,966
that over 200 million dollars
have been deposited this month alone.

71
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,596
We could officially
request info on the account with this.

72
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,974
Then we would only be
able to get Ji Seung-don.

73
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,643
And in the meantime,
the accounts would be closed.

74
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,150
You asked me

75
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,277
to find proof that points to the Chairman

76
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,404
or a weapon you could use
to make a deal with.

77
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,697
I'm sorry this is all I could find.

78
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,825
I won't lie and say
you threatened me into doing this.

79
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,870
I did it because I wanted to.
This is for all of us.

80
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,205
So end it.

81
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,207
And come back, safe and sound.

82
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,000
We'll be waiting for you, Ro-eum.

83
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,063
If it's me the Chairman wants so badly,

84
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,315
we might have a weapon after all.

85
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,444
Things aren't that dire.

86
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,574
I just have to risk my own life.

87
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,744
I thought you'd stop me from going alone.

88
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,215
This is something
you need to end yourself.

89
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,468
Only you can do it.

90
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,188
SENDING LOCATION

91
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,080
Ro-eum will get the proof by meeting Jay.

92
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,583
The proof
that he's the actual account holder.

93
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,876
And if she can't?

94
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,629
She hasn't been cleared
of Jang Kyung-ja's murder yet,

95
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,006
and she ran
after the arrest warrant was issued.

96
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,925
How do you think this will all end?

97
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,844
What can Ro-eum do by meeting him?

98
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,264
The chances that things will go
according to plan are extremely slim.

99
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,768
You pulled something this rash
over the slightest chance of success?

100
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,146
If we had another option,
we'd have taken it.

101
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,482
Like you said, if Ro-eum fails,

102
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,691
we're all going down.

103
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,485
I just hope

104
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,654
that the timing will be on point

105
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,864
and that this will work
no matter how slim the chances.

106
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,076
I hope you get to arrest her,
safe and sound.

107
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,119
So,

108
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,996
when Ro-eum sends the signal,

109
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,831
get to her on time.

110
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,420
Share the location with the police.

111
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,756
Where are you going?

112
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,091
I need to go there myself.

113
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,884
Stay right here and be on standby.

114
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,010
By standby, you mean…

115
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,179
Keep monitoring the situation

116
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,639
and take videos.

117
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,724
But…

118
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,945
How'd you get out?

119
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,781
You can see it on the news in the morning.

120
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,869
I got you tickets,
but I guess we won't be taking a plane.

121
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,205
You would've been out soon.

122
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,707
What was the rush?

123
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,959
By then, you'd have killed all the others.

124
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,088
Since when did you get so close?

125
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,174
At Red Eye, I was the only one

126
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,092
you relied on.

127
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,844
And I paid the price for it.

128
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,098
I just don't get it.

129
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,185
You're still obsessing over your parents.

130
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,104
Blood ties mean nothing, Ro-eum.

131
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,648
You didn't choose them.

132
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,235
But you chose to rely on me
and followed me, not your own family.

133
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,446
Like the way I chose you.

134
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,740
That's what really matters.

135
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,952
What exactly do you want from me?

136
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,579
To be like Jang Kyung-ja?

137
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,415
Not at all.

138
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,043
You'll understand soon enough.

139
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,546
Where are we going?

140
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,673
Hong Kong for now.

141
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,801
When do we leave?

142
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,011
I'm looking into a ship for transport.

143
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,646
Then I guess we have time to settle up.

144
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,357
You settled up for me ten years ago too.

145
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,733
Before I left.

146
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,610
You need money? How much?

147
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,321
How much did you earn
with Navis Well-being?

148
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,616
The news was saying
it was about a trillion won.

149
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,993
What are you going to do with it?

150
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,246
I'm going to return it
to the rightful owners.

151
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,288
Why?

152
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,665
Because I met

153
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,291
the victims.

154
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,962
Is this your sense of justice?

155
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,635
I opened Jang Kyung-ja's safe.

156
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,555
F55.

157
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,390
Documents on your secret account.

158
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,435
Proof that you're the holder.

159
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,645
That

160
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,397
was in her safe?

161
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,232
You don't know

162
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,567
what was in the safe.

163
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,488
She told me. But she didn't mention
anything about a secret account.

164
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,740
That's why you killed her?

165
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,325
Because you believed her?

166
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,411
She's dead now.

167
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,330
I'm the only one who knows
what was in the safe now.

168
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,086
If you had something like that,
why did you come all the way here?

169
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,425
To make a deal with the person
who'd buy it at the highest price.

170
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,929
There's about 300 billion won
deposited in Ji Seung-don's name, right?

171
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,309
Consider it an advance
and transfer it to me.

172
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,648
Those documents
were managed in hard copies only,

173
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,401
so Ms. Jang never had access to them.

174
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,321
You think

175
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,241
she gathered them all by herself?

176
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,494
I guess

177
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,914
you never went through her cell phone.

178
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:14,835
I even remember the final texts
you sent to her.

179
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,006
Why did you ask her to go to Sapporo
when you were going to kill her?

180
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,718
What? You finally

181
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,887
believe me now?

182
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,850
Either transfer the money

183
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,061
or do nothing and get caught with me.

184
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,230
You choose.

185
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,233
Isn't this exciting?

186
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,485
You like choices.

187
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:48,619
Account number, NL78 BANK0910 3131270.

188
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,162
Let's start with that.

189
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,498
There's about 130 billion in it, right?

190
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,209
We'll move on to the second
in five minutes.

191
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,965
I'll get them unfrozen in no time.

192
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,508
That country is so far though.

193
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,468
How are you going to get there
in five minutes?

194
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,472
I guess

195
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,933
you have to actually see it to believe it.

196
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,851
Even now.

197
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,521
But I believe in Da-jeong.

198
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,416
KEVIN JU

199
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,719
I couldn't find anything
with Jay's name on it.

200
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,639
But the important thing is,

201
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:55,060
only one device has been registered
that allows access to the accounts online.

202
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,909
I think it's Jay's phone that's been off
all this time.

203
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,370
If he turns on that phone,

204
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,749
his IP and MAC address will be
collected by the telecom company,

205
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,544
and if it's a match, a notification
will go off at the comic store.

206
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,760
That means it's a match, right?

207
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,597
Yes.

208
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,353
Sir. It's like Jeong Da-jeong said.

209
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,980
The account holder is Lee Jay.

210
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,608
At least,
it's enough to put him under arrest.

211
00:15:59,041 --> 00:15:59,959
Wait,

212
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,046
you needed my access record?

213
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,266
You want me to tell you
why you're so obsessed with me?

214
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,186
It's because you know
what your true nature is.

215
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,605
You think
the world turned its back on you?

216
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,608
There were people who empathized
even with someone like me.

217
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,777
I'm sure you had people like that too.

218
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,780
People who tried to help you
out of the goodness of their heart.

219
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:34,243
But you preyed on their kindness,
took what was theirs, and cast them off.

220
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,870
That's who you are.

221
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,415
You isolated yourself and fell behind,

222
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,001
so all you can do now is buy people
through money or by violence.

223
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,628
All the while being suspicious and afraid

224
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,338
of losing everything you have.

225
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,882
You think I'm like you?

226
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:49,883
Me?

227
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,845
I'm sure that's what you hoped.

228
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,139
You wanted there to be someone like you,

229
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,017
to feel less miserable
about being beyond saving.

230
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,976
So what?

231
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,436
So what?

232
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,647
I'm not like you, you son of a bitch!

233
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,358
So, you're saying I was wrong about you?

234
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,277
Is that it?

235
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,903
For all this time?

236
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,948
It doesn't matter.

237
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,325
Do what you're good at, acting.

238
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,619
Changing your face and smiling.

239
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,538
From now on, do that.

240
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,622
For me.

241
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,085
Jeong Da-jeong, Na-sa, Ringo,
that so-called family of yours,

242
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,338
Han Moo-young, Han Jae-seok,
I'll kill them all if I have to!

243
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,634
Until you know your place,

244
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,889
kneel before me,
and never raise your head again!

245
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,142
I'll bring them to you, one by one.

246
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,063
And if you lose your mind,
I'll lock you up and watch.

247
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,316
And if you die, I'll take your ashes.

248
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,693
You'll never get away from me.

249
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,030
Kill me.

250
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,158
It'll be so much easier that way.

251
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,221
Lee Ro-eum has been apprehended.

252
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,936
That means

253
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,439
she's alive, right?

254
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,608
Yes.

255
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,027
It was Lee Jay who was shot.

256
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,702
He's not dead, is he?

257
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,662
I mean,

258
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,124
Ro-eum… She's not going down
for murder, right?

259
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,795
She is still a suspect

260
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,923
in the murder of Jang Kyung-ja.

261
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,466
And the person who fired the gun

262
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,842
was her lawyer.

263
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,011
What?

264
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,949
You have the poof
that Jay is the Chairman, right?

265
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,617
That's what matters to you now?

266
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,118
How's Ro-eum?

267
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,997
You should worry about yourself.

268
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,583
She's fine.

269
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,849
Is it all over now?

270
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,559
It's just starting.

271
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,478
You're right.

272
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,230
Thanks to you,

273
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,399
I have my work cut out for me.

274
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,402
Sounds like you should be congratulated.

275
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,862
You've hit the jackpot.

276
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,822
Ha.

277
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,825
You're very outcome oriented, aren't you?

278
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,203
I thought you wanted
to change the outcome too.

279
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,498
It's your turn now.

280
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,583
I'm leaving it in your hands.

281
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,546
I'd rather not do
anything like this again.

282
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,092
Let's go.

283
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,302
Yes.

284
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,220
Head out.

285
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:52,436
Prosecutors have seized files
from a hacker who helped a suspect escape.

286
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,565
The files are in regards to cases
that cover 20 years

287
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:01,403
from a scholarship foundation
established in the 90s to Navis Gate.

288
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,488
Your right-hand man,

289
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,450
Kim Seung-hyeon, aka the Messenger,

290
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,869
and banker Kevin Ju are in custody,

291
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,621
and warrants for their arrest
have been issued.

292
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,623
They have both confessed.

293
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,667
I'm sure you know,

294
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,670
but do you admit
that you are the head of Red Eye,

295
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:23,091
and the actual Chairman
of Navis Well-being?

296
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,556
It'll only wear you out
if the interrogation drags on.

297
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,059
In fact, you don't look so good.

298
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,686
Wouldn't you rather confess?

299
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,691
All right, then.

300
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,904
Let's begin
with the murder of Jang Kyung-ja.

301
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,948
Han who fired a gun to subdue Lee

302
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,786
was arrested at the scene and
is now being questioned without detention

303
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,288
for aggravated assault
and possession of a firearm.

304
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,873
You're saying

305
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,249
it was all intentional?

306
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,754
I knew what Jay was capable of
and what he had done.

307
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,006
So I determined a gun was necessary.

308
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,177
How did you know to go to that location?

309
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,597
I'm the one who planned
Lee Ro-eum's escape.

310
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,517
I helped her run too.

311
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,175
These are Prosecutor Tak Kang-hyeon's
decisions in the past.

312
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,593
Thanks.

313
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,805
I asked around,

314
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,142
and he's the type
that looks at the circumstances in detail.

315
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,519
Our case might be complicated,

316
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,148
but I think we should provide
a detailed context and go by the book.

317
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,400
If this goes to trial, Moo-young…

318
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,738
Let's write one hell of a written opinion.

319
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,658
Gyu.

320
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,789
It seems like they're having
a hard time without evidence.

321
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,541
The CCTV footage was deleted too.

322
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,168
Still, he was caught at the scene,

323
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,086
so they'll try to charge him
for helping her escape.

324
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,755
Well, they'll indict him
for colluding with Lee Ro-eum,

325
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,800
but since it'll most likely be
thrown out for insufficient evidence,

326
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,428
I think they'll try to charge him
with anything they can.

327
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,514
Here. The interrogation transcript.

328
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,433
Right. I'll make some copies.

329
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,521
I told you, tell them it wasn't me.

330
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,857
It'll only work against you
if you deny everything.

331
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,613
I heard the Messenger confessed.

332
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,906
Is it true?

333
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,118
Where's the Banker?

334
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,495
After everything I paid him…

335
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,081
They can't help you now.

336
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,626
And you will not be
seeing them in court either.

337
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,546
After everything I've built up
for 20 years,

338
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,673
how can I have no one to call?

339
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,717
You can't plead not guilty.

340
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,804
You need to admit some things
to get a lower sentence at least.

341
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,182
That's how tough things are for you.

342
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,476
I'm paying you to make

343
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,270
this tough situation go away.

344
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,439
It won't be over with just this trial.

345
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,484
I heard you changed lawyers
five times already.

346
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,613
Your charges are so extensive,
you need to prepared for the long-run.

347
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,531
If you've decided to put your trust in us,

348
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,408
then you should have some faith.

349
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:36,910
Trust?

350
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,037
Faith?

351
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,582
In you?

352
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,711
If this goes to trial, I'll lose.

353
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,880
It was self-defense.

354
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,006
And he didn't die.

355
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,384
It's three years just for having a gun.

356
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,011
And I'll lose my license to practice.

357
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,181
You knew that would happen?

358
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,058
Yes.

359
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,559
What were you thinking?

360
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,979
You were in danger,
so there was no time to think.

361
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,984
Tell them I had the gun.

362
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,028
You want me to dump it on you?
When it was me who did it?

363
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,405
That would be cowardly.

364
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,741
Or say Jay had it and dropped it.
Tell them it was his.

365
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,034
It's not entirely false.

366
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,705
Well, I had the gun,

367
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,039
so that would be perjury.

368
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,501
Have you no flexibility at all?

369
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,461
You decided not to use that gun.

370
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,172
And because of that,
Jay will be judged by the law.

371
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,383
How worthy is that?

372
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,677
We worked hard to bring him to trial,

373
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,846
and I don't want to do anything
to undermine it.

374
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,223
So, you're just going to give up?

375
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,019
My lawyer is writing a written opinion.

376
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,772
The prosecutor will read it and decide

377
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,733
whether to prosecute me or not.

378
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,030
Is this lawyer any good?

379
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,912
My firm is prepping for your trial.

380
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,497
You don't have to worry.

381
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,301
Oh, hi.

382
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,680
Pick one. You're working hard.

383
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,349
Thank you.

384
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,645
-Oh, let me.
-It's okay.

385
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,733
Thank you.

386
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,443
It's no big deal.

387
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,820
The case with the lawyer…

388
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,864
The others are all
circumstances precluding wrongfulness,

389
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,367
but I think you can get him
for possession of a firearm.

390
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,452
Yes. I'm reviewing it.

391
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,914
That gun was given to Lee Ro-eum
by Lee Jay when he instigated murder.

392
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,250
And Lee Ro-eum gave it
to her lawyer to hand it in,

393
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,086
but since she was about to die,

394
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,004
I guess he just grabbed it
in that instant.

395
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,090
Oh, right, you were there.

396
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,342
Yes, I was. It gave me the chills.

397
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,512
What would've happened
if not for Han Moo-young?

398
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,972
Lee Jay would've killed Lee Ro-eum
and escaped,

399
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,558
and we would have all been buried too.

400
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,438
The more details come out about this,
the more it looks bad for us.

401
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,900
If you're thinking about prosecuting him,
you should brace yourself.

402
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,819
You could end up coming under fire.

403
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,363
Right. I'll review it thoroughly.

404
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,407
I'm sure you will.

405
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,117
Right. When you wrap that up,

406
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,244
why don't you join our special team?

407
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,996
Lee Jay is a huge case,
and we need good people.

408
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,666
You heard
we're building up the team, right?

409
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,585
Think about it.

410
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,795
Drink up.

411
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,507
But actually…

412
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,550
Yes?

413
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,565
PROSECUTOR RYU JAE-HYEOK
LET'S MEET

414
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,444
Are you insane?

415
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,114
You know better than anyone

416
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,743
that your helping her escape
is almost impossible to prove.

417
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,079
But you just gave yourself up
to the prosecutor?

418
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,581
Tell me.

419
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,332
That illness of yours.

420
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,001
It's back, right?

421
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,961
That's the only explanation.

422
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,505
So, will I be prosecuted
for helping her escape?

423
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,008
You'll get a suspension of prosecution.

424
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,134
A suspension?

425
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,345
They think you're making
a false confession to protect your client.

426
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,264
It's not a false confession.

427
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,391
Exactly. But that's what they think

428
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,685
because you just confessed out of nowhere.

429
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,980
I can't just let those two take the fall…

430
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,277
Your clients have more crimes
to worry about, not just the escape.

431
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,696
This trial is going to be a tough one.

432
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,908
Because of Ro-eum's priors,
the press is going to have a field day,

433
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,452
and the same goes for Da-jeong or Su-ho.

434
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,078
They have records too.

435
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,830
The wise thing to do here

436
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,833
is to represent them,
not end up in prison with them.

437
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,545
And to do that,
you already have one obstacle to overcome,

438
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,422
so don't add to that.

439
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,524
ESCAPE FROM PROSECUTION
POSSIBLY TO BE PREPLANNED BY EX-CONS

440
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,031
HACKING, BLACKOUT…
WHO ARE THE ONES BEHIND THE ESCAPE

441
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:02,462
YOU HAVE BEEN CLEARED OF ALL CHARGES

442
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,636
On March 18, 2023,

443
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,597
after the Central Prosecutors' Office
decided to make an arrest,

444
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,474
the defendant escaped
during a power outage

445
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,768
just prior to being transferred
to a detention center,

446
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,937
causing a huge setback
in the investigation.

447
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,898
Therefore, in accordance
with Article 145 of the Criminal Act,

448
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,067
we charge Defendant Lee Ro-eum for flight.

449
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,778
The prosecution charges
Defendant Jeong Da-jeong

450
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,573
for violating Act 147 of the Criminal Act
on Escape and Promotion of Information

451
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,326
and Communications Network Utilization
and Information Protection.

452
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:37,121
In accordance with the facts, we charge
Defendant Na Su-ho for violating Act 147

453
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,291
of the Criminal Act on Escape
and Telecommunications Business.

454
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,336
How do you know the defendants?

455
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,881
When I was in medical school,

456
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,883
I did a study on them.

457
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,593
What kind of study was it?

458
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,930
It was about the educational environment
for gifted children.

459
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,766
Education at alternative schools
instead of at homes.

460
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:00,353
I didn't know then, but the foundation
turned out to be Red Eye.

461
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:04,399
Have you ever met the defendants
after they became adults?

462
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:08,319
When I belatedly learned about Red Eye,
I went to see them to apologize.

463
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,530
Why did you want to apologize?

464
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,535
Because no child should have been
raised by an organization like that.

465
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:19,414
I felt guilty about the fact
that my research played a part

466
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,542
in creating the Red Eye Kids.

467
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,253
As a psychiatrist,

468
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,382
do you have any opinions
on the defendants' actions?

469
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,719
At Red Eye, the defendants

470
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,429
did not have a guardian.

471
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,056
Instead of guidance,
they were given orders

472
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,058
which they had to follow
in order to survive.

473
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,185
Values were distorted,

474
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,897
which would've made it difficult for them
to lead ordinary lives as adults.

475
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,151
Even so, the defendants seem to have been

476
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,404
each other's guardians.

477
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,865
In order to protect each other,

478
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,701
they used methods
that they learned as children.

479
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,996
It was the only way they knew.

480
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,831
Are you trying to say

481
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,333
that they are not criminals?

482
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,211
I'm not saying what they did isn't wrong.

483
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:12,633
I'm saying that if it weren't for Red Eye,
they could've made other choices.

484
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,678
But you can't know that for sure,
even if you are a doctor.

485
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,638
Who knows?

486
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,391
You and I haven't experienced
what they have been through.

487
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,852
I am just stating my opinion

488
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:27,106
on why the defendants resorted to crime
in order to achieve their goal.

489
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,734
The lives people have led

490
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,903
affect the choices they make.

491
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,155
It may not be the right choice,

492
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:38,034
but no one can always make
the right choice.

493
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,746
Your opinion is a terrifying one
that justifies crime.

494
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,415
I have no intention of justifying crime.

495
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,168
That is up to the judge to decide.

496
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,462
However,

497
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,881
the lives they led

498
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,549
provided me

499
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,427
with a key to understanding them.

500
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,096
That's all I want to say.

501
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,190
Are you nervous?

502
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,733
About what?

503
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,151
The sentence.

504
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,363
I'll do what I can,
but you will have to serve some time.

505
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,282
Not really.

506
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,452
I was on trial before
for a crime I didn't commit.

507
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,665
And this time, it's a crime I did commit.

508
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,917
But more than that,

509
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,586
I trust my lawyer.

510
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,593
Make your closing arguments.

511
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,512
In an attempt

512
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,640
to fight back against
the threat against their lives,

513
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,184
the defendants planned an escape
from the prosecutors' office

514
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,604
and in the process
caused damage to a government organization

515
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,898
and a private company…

516
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,709
I'd like to substitute
the details of the event

517
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,378
with the opinion
that was submitted in advance.

518
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,480
Despite the many suspicions

519
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,150
regarding the defendants,

520
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,360
what doesn't change

521
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,739
is the fact that before they met Red Eye,

522
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,658
they were ordinary children.

523
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,744
Before being a gifted child,

524
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,331
she was an 8-year-old girl
who wished for her parents' happiness

525
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,498
rather than her own.

526
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,793
She was a girl who found

527
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,588
an entire world in a computer
while her family was absent.

528
00:36:56,422 --> 00:37:00,176
And he was an ordinary 14-year-old boy
whose dream was to work at NASA.

529
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,511
And Park Hae-dong, who is still in a coma,

530
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,097
went to the Red Eye Foundation himself
for the sake of his parents

531
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,350
who were mired in debt
due to his hospital bills.

532
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,061
These young, ordinary children

533
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,438
were entrapped by a criminal
organization called Red Eye

534
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,733
and forced to receive training
they didn't even want.

535
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,986
They were trained to commit crimes
for the perpetrators

536
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,280
who were their leaders and adults.

537
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,915
People who have been saved
by the law trust in the law.

538
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,419
People who have received help
from society,

539
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,879
trust in society.

540
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,592
While going through those terrible times,

541
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,594
they received help from no one,

542
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,680
but they endured

543
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,976
with the hope that the law and society
would punish evil,

544
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,269
and in the end,

545
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:56,524
they themselves brought to light
the people who should really be punished.

546
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,194
The only thing I can do as a lawyer

547
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,240
is make the truth known.

548
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,617
Your honor,

549
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,744
if you give the defendants

550
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,622
the chance to choose their own futures,

551
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,292
a choice that was taken from them
20 years ago,

552
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,254
they will live the rest of their lives
atoning for their crimes.

553
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,380
Also,

554
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,550
if you take into consideration
the good intentions they had,

555
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,468
the defendants…

556
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,889
will remember that the law reached out

557
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,435
a hand to them.

558
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,230
That is all.

559
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,991
Defendants,

560
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,576
do you have anything to say?

561
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,292
I am here as a perpetrator,

562
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,712
but I am also a victim in another case.

563
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,714
And,

564
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,841
as a victim,

565
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,970
I would like the perpetrator
to receive their punishment in full.

566
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,848
So, as a perpetrator
I can't ask for leniency.

567
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,225
Because the law is sacred.

568
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,854
I do not

569
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,023
need leniency.

570
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,151
But I do regret my actions.

571
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,237
Yup.

572
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,489
She's definitely crazy.

573
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,576
Prosecution, what do you seek?

574
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,663
The defendant has violated 12 laws
including murder,

575
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,042
conspiracy to commit murder,
forgery of documents,

576
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,835
and violation of the Capital Market Act.

577
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,296
He has caused immense economic damage

578
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,216
to society
that amounts to two trillion won.

579
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,803
Despite clear evidence
and witness statements,

580
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,679
the defendant shows no remorse

581
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,515
and continues to deny his crimes,

582
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,392
evading responsibility.

583
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,895
The victims of his crime organization
are countless,

584
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:01,524
and as he has contributed to corruption
that pollutes our society,

585
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,484
he must be isolated permanently.

586
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,986
Therefore, we ask

587
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,115
that the defendant receive
a life sentence.

588
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:13,953
Order.

589
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,539
Lee Ro-eum, the principal offender.

590
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,960
The previous sentence
of one year on probation is revoked.

591
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,753
Adding up her previous sentence,

592
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,798
she is hereby sentenced
to a year and six months in prison.

593
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,092
Jeong Da-jeong

594
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,386
is sentenced to one year.

595
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,471
Na Su-ho's previous sentence

596
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,891
of four months on probation is revoked.

597
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,645
Adding up his previous sentence,
he is sentenced to ten months.

598
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,370
What a relief.

599
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,789
It's pretty amazing.

600
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,000
It's the best
we could've hoped for, right?

601
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,042
Yes.

602
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,962
I'm glad. I really am.

603
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,966
Which way are you going?

604
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,718
To the bus stop.

605
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,681
How many siblings do you have?

606
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,851
I have sisters.

607
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,603
Two older sisters.

608
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,770
I'm an only son.

609
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,689
Yes, I know.

610
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,192
Are you okay with someone
from a divorced family?

611
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,277
Yes, what's not to be okay about it?

612
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,321
Who are you texting with?

613
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,449
I have to send hearts to my nieces
and nephews, or all hell breaks loose.

614
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,417
Are they the only ones…

615
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,129
you send hearts to?

616
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,440
Can I join you?

617
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,860
I thought you hated me.

618
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,363
Why would I hate you?

619
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,906
I know you helped me.

620
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,033
And I wasn't prosecuted.

621
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,286
What… It's not like
I had any pull with that.

622
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,455
Lawyer Han here

623
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,958
wrote one hell of an opinion.

624
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,836
Prosecutor Tak told me he had never gotten
such a textbook opinion before.

625
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,588
Still,

626
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,550
I have a lot to thank you for.

627
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,093
And I'm sorry.

628
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:39,682
This is exactly why I'm always so lonely.

629
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,725
That's why I'm here.

630
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,105
Can we get another glass over here?

631
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,106
Sure.

632
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,607
Anyway,

633
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,568
it's not a big deal,

634
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,153
but the first issue of Big News is out.

635
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,738
Right. He's a CEO now.

636
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,240
CEO Woo.

637
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,117
I'll send you the link.

638
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,160
Wow.

639
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,330
We haven't talked in our group chat
in ages.

640
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,796
"Dreaming of a world

641
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,340
that doesn't need
delightfully deceitful scams."

642
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,508
Such fine writing,

643
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,051
if I say so myself.

644
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,889
You should let others say that for you.

645
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,350
But no one does.

646
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,334
The trial for the Red Eye Kids
that garnered unprecedented attention

647
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,460
ended today.

648
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,254
As their unfortunate upbringing
came to light,

649
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,758
their escape and hacking crimes

650
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,552
were interpreted as a righteous revenge

651
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,889
against evil such as Navis.

652
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,724
Because of the evidence they found,

653
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,393
the Chairman, Lee Jay,
was brought to justice,

654
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:10,856
and the victims who lost their money
and suffered at the hands of Navis

655
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,192
will be able to get their money back.

656
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,695
Despite public opinion
defending their actions,

657
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,280
they accepted

658
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,783
the first trial sentence
without appealing.

659
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,701
In their closing argument,

660
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,080
they asked for the chance to atone
rather than leniency.

661
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,458
Their attitude
has been food for thought to the public

662
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,544
who has been describing them
as Robin Hood figures.

663
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,424
I can't believe how quickly time went by.

664
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:45,099
Su-ho was in the shortest,
but he said it felt like ages.

665
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,141
Hi.

666
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,071
Hey, Da-jeong.

667
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,407
You look good.

668
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,617
The food must've agreed with you. Yeah?

669
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,994
All right.

670
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,288
He came to pick me up when I got out.

671
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,499
-Here.
-I think he's grown up.

672
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,084
Dig in. You have to eat this.

673
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,962
Good.

674
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:19,383
I was only in there two months longer
than Na-sa, but it felt like a long time.

675
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,763
I wondered how it must've been for you
for ten years.

676
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,849
You were much younger than we are now.

677
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,645
-Ro-eum…
-I heard about the damages suit.

678
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:34,356
-Without me?
-Mr. Han tells me about you.

679
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,693
-I'll go see you soon.
-Is this him?

680
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,614
I'm writing because
I wanted to tell you this news myself.

681
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,825
Hae-dong woke up.

682
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,286
See you at the hearing for damages.

683
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,897
How well do I know Attorney Han?

684
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,942
Of all the lawyers I know,

685
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,112
he's the best.

686
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,699
Sir, this isn't a video.
I'm just taking photos.

687
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:26,617
Oh.

688
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,160
-Photos?
-Yes.

689
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,370
Let's keep it simple.

690
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,707
First of all,

691
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,000
the damages suit.

692
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:38,962
Next month, the confiscated money
will be returned to the country.

693
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,757
And we'll be in charge of returning

694
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,426
the money to our clients
and the other victims

695
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,595
of Navis Well-being.

696
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,598
It was made possible by securing
the evidence to the Ponzi scheme.

697
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,683
Yes. What do you think will happen

698
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,186
with Lee Ro-eum's damages suit today?

699
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,021
I have faith.

700
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,065
Han Moo-young…

701
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,900
He's my conscience as a lawyer.

702
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,193
Wow.

703
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,111
I like that.

704
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,739
When I was in my mid-20s,

705
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,909
it's a little embarrassing

706
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,954
to say so myself,

707
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,665
but my family had a lot of money,

708
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,375
so I went to the US.

709
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,628
I told my parents I was studying,
that I was studying English.

710
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,129
But actually,
I was just having a good time.

711
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,047
Oh, okay.

712
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,966
When I got sick of that,

713
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,759
I came back to Korea
and returned to school,

714
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,219
and that's where I met Moo-young.

715
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,721
The defendant, Republic of Korea,

716
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,890
will pay the plaintiff Lee Ro-eum

717
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,977
an amount of a billion won

718
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,104
with an interest of 12%

719
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,313
per annum.

720
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,400
Litigation costs
will be borne by the defendant.

721
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:58,000
I thought to myself,
I had to hire him for my firm.

722
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,044
So, my plan was to

723
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,087
bring him up…

724
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,258
Hey.

725
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,384
How did it go?

726
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,637
It went well, thanks to you guys.

727
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,763
Okay.

728
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,850
Moo-young,
someone's waiting in your office.

729
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,770
Okay.

730
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,191
-So…
-Okay.

731
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,192
But…

732
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,035
You'll be able to get the money
you lost by next month.

733
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,125
I met with Attorney Kang.

734
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,461
I…

735
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,798
heard about everything that happened.

736
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,759
I thought about coming here

737
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,553
a million times before I came.

738
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,724
When I'm alone in my room,

739
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,310
all I can think about

740
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,856
is what a terrible thing I did to you,

741
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,651
and nothing else.

742
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,654
I feel like what happened to your father

743
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,947
is my fault too.

744
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,532
No, it's not.

745
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,118
I've only given you pain.

746
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,329
No good memories at all.

747
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,000
You give me the strength to live.

748
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,463
I want you to be happy.

749
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,550
And I have good memories too.

750
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,015
Remember how we used to go fishing?

751
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,934
You'd make instant noodles,

752
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,479
and it was one of the few days
Dad didn't get drunk.

753
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,277
I still have the fishing rod

754
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,446
he used to use back then.

755
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,032
I didn't know why I kept it,

756
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:00,539
but someone told me
that even the smallest memory

757
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,041
could help you forgive.

758
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,254
If there are any challenges going forward,

759
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,133
let's solve them together.

760
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,762
I'd like that.

761
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,778
Thank you.

762
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,009
I got a new car.

763
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,678
What? Were you hiding back there?

764
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,472
Why would I hide?

765
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,767
I was talking on the phone in the car.
You came out earlier than expected.

766
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,812
That's a lot of stuff.

767
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,193
It's heavy.

768
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,926
I want to drive.

769
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,886
You don't even have a license.

770
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,596
I got it while I was in prison.

771
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:43,600
They provide training to model inmates
as a part of a social adjustment program.

772
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,976
You were a model inmate?

773
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,686
Just let me drive.

774
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,313
I'll pay your fee.

775
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,650
My fee has nothing to do with this.

776
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,154
I'm proud of you.

777
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,405
That you were a model inmate.

778
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:31,857
Who are you?

779
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,072
I told you, that's not funny.

780
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,742
You're such an ass.

781
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,215
That's enough. I'm getting butterflies.

782
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,393
Take it easy. Slowly. A little more.

783
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,605
-Okay, not bad.
-Okay, okay.

784
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,273
Now, slowly…

785
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,276
Slowly, gent…

786
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,320
…ly.

787
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,404
Reverse.

788
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,363
Reverse.

789
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:21,948
-Got it.
-Okay.

790
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,409
Slowly, slowly.

791
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,036
Woah.

792
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:30,248
-Go straight, go straight.
-Wow.

793
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,627
I think I did it.

794
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,462
Okay.

795
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,130
Let's try that again, slowly.

796
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,341
Which way is left?

797
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,426
Left, this hand.

798
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,427
Left.

799
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,470
Left.

800
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,597
Now try that with the steering wheel.

801
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,765
Left.

802
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,434
-Left.
-Now, right.

803
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,561
Right.

804
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,687
Left hand, I mean.

805
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,689
Right, right.

806
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,816
Your response is too late.

807
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,320
What kind of road makes you turn left,
then right immediately after?

808
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,322
I'm not saying
there's an actual road like that.

809
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,700
If you drive like this,
you'll get into an accident.

810
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,036
Then you can be my lawyer.

811
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,040
How can you say something so scary
with a straight face?

812
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,751
Let's try that again.

813
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:15,877
-Let's not.
-I can do this.

814
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,087
-No…
-I'll give it a go.

815
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,381
-Let's take a break.
-Left, left…

816
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,218
Your probation officer…

817
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,261
Ro-eum.

818
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:28,807
Hi.

819
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,273
Lee Ro-eum…

820
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,374
We're in love.

821
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,670
I thought you had a lot of free time.
Looks like you've been busy.

822
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:04,384
The recovery team
for Navis Well-being's criminal proceeds

823
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,094
are continuing to expand.

824
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:09,764
They are working on laws
to back up legal procedures

825
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,933
and hiring digital and financial experts…

826
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,436
Me?

827
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,395
Yes.

828
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,731
We need your help.

829
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,983
We're bringing in people

830
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,736
from the cybercrimes unit
and the criminal proceeds recovery team,

831
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,990
but no one knows as much as you do
about the mechanism of Red Eye.

832
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,242
Your joining the team won't be disclosed,

833
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,244
and you'll receive protection too.

834
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,288
You'll be part of a special task force.

835
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,959
After all, con artists know best

836
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,545
about scams.

837
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,184
You should do it if you want to.

838
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:56,978
What do you think?

839
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,897
I guess you want to.

840
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,650
I never told you
why I joined Red Eye, did I?

841
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:13,745
It was the first place
that had acknowledged me.

842
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,122
So-dam was sick,

843
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,666
my parents were busy working,

844
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,086
and I was always alone,
at home and at school.

845
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,296
They were the first to praise what I did.

846
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,967
How simple-minded and stupid of me.

847
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,678
I often thought about whether

848
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:34,265
things would've been different if it
hadn't been Red Eye but somewhere else.

849
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,811
Just do it if you want to.
Don't think too much about it.

850
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:39,521
It just feels like

851
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,649
I'm the only one who can't let go

852
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,650
of the past.

853
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,027
It sounds like responsibility to me.

854
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,696
If you have the skills
and a good sense of responsibility,

855
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,534
do what's good for society.
And receive the recognition you deserve.

856
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,160
What about you?

857
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,203
What about me?

858
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,664
I think Mr. Ryu has you in mind too.

859
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,545
I'm going to live a nice, boring life.

860
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,046
I don't want to be bothered.

861
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,122
I've been wondering,

862
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,875
what's always so funny?

863
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,626
Bring Ro-eum to me.

864
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,921
As long as you're alive,
that'll never happen.

865
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,799
I'll be out in a few years.

866
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,260
That won't happen either.

867
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,596
Try to appeal all you want.

868
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,975
Even without the cases
where the statute of limitations ran out,

869
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,394
you'll be on one tedious trial
after another.

870
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,520
Even in your dreams,

871
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,730
and even after you die.

872
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,982
You came to tell me that?

873
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,400
One more thing.

874
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,736
Whatever cheap, dirty way

875
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,989
you're thinking of using,

876
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,741
you better not come near us.

877
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,867
Or what?

878
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,244
Unlike Ro-eum,

879
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,580
I don't care if you live or die.

880
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,335
Letting you live wasn't a mistake.

881
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:40,975
I'm sorry.

882
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,689
I didn't really think about
how you were a living, breathing person

883
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,567
like me.

884
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,029
So back then…

885
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,115
I had no sense of guilt.

886
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,869
If it weren't
for the statute of limitations,

887
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,373
I'd be in prison too for scamming you.

888
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,918
It's not your fault.

889
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,922
It's the people who made you
do it that are the monsters.

890
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,640
I'm sorry.

891
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,978
Every single day for ten years,

892
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,271
I had the same dream.

893
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,358
About that night.

894
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,863
So I know how horrible that feels.

895
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:41,661
I wanted…

896
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,040
to tell you that you should
sleep more easily now.

897
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,587
I can sleep…

898
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,215
easily now too.

899
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,010
Thanks to Attorney Han.

900
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,316
Now for our next news.

901
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:14,902
A year since the arrest of Lee Jay,
the mastermind of Navis,

902
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:19,032
a total of 42 people have been indicted
for their crimes related to

903
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,992
Red Eye and Navis,

904
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,578
and nine have been sentenced.

905
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:27,290
Lee Jay is still embroiled
in over 30 suits,

906
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:30,627
with more time being added
to his sentence with each trial.

907
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,607
Thank you.

908
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,487
For having

909
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,782
a daughter like me.

910
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,544
This is all we have.

911
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,671
Is it okay?

912
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,890
Zero?

913
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,059
Not bad.

914
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:29,977
Here.

915
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,649
Check the revisions and sign.

916
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:52,083
SIGN: LEE RO-EUM

917
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,835
Here too.

918
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,174
Once I send the money,

919
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:01,759
that'll be it?

920
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,054
Yes, that's it. For you and me.

921
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,062
For this contract.

922
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,026
You better not need a lawyer again.

923
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,076
Na-sa.

924
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,536
Where are the cable ties?

925
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,288
Over here.

926
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:32,707
Hey, Ro-eum.

927
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,584
I think you've been scammed.

928
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,378
The lights may look nice,
but have you seen the second floor?

929
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:40,089
All the bathroom tiles are broken,
and the doors don't close properly.

930
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,507
Stop talking and work.

931
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,470
Ask the owner to fix it up.

932
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,221
Can't you just fix it now?

933
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,474
I am. What does it look like I'm doing?

934
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:53,102
I'm saying she should charge
for the repairs and not be a pushover.

935
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,688
Is Moo-young coming?

936
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,106
No.

937
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,318
You didn't tell him you were moving?

938
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,028
No.

939
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,446
Do I need to?

940
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,705
Okay, okay, okay.

941
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,523
YEONGJIN BANK

942
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:39,774
LEE RO-EUM

943
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:41,484
Huh?

944
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:47,156
LEE RO-EUM: DEPOSIT 100,000 WON

945
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,409
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

946
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,620
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

947
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,288
Okay, okay.

948
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,834
Be honest with me, you set me up.

949
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,252
Right?

950
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,795
Ro-eum, you set me up, right?

951
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:01,879
Look at me…

952
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,507
I can't tell.

953
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,758
Geez.

954
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,134
I mean,

955
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,637
why do I always lose?

956
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,638
This

957
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,306
-makes no sense.
-Geez.

958
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,560
Unless you're setting me up,
I can't lose every time…

959
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,477
Also,

960
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,646
I'm the oldest.

961
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,356
Don't forget that.

962
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,441
I'm doing this for you,

963
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,695
not because I lost.

964
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:26,654
Hello?

965
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,447
Ro-eum, it's me.

966
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,868
I got the fee you sent.

967
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,036
Okay, good.

968
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,706
But I think you left out a few zeros.

969
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,249
Who did?

970
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:39,959
You.

971
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,460
That's not possible.

972
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,337
Can you check?

973
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,714
Fine.

974
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,799
Can you check now?

975
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,135
Well… I'll check when I'm not so busy.

976
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,136
You're busy?

977
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,804
Doing what?

978
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,306
Moving.

979
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,724
Oh, you're moving.

980
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:55,850
Good for you.

981
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,226
Are you moving alone?

982
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,519
Do you have help?

983
01:04:58,603 --> 01:04:59,687
I do.

984
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,448
Wow.

985
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,117
Nice place.

986
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,078
How did you know my address?

987
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,790
Well… Someone told me.

988
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,260
So, you came all the way here
for your money?

989
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:32,929
No.

990
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,808
I came to tell you something.
