1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,267
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,728
I'll do it.

3
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,781
Just because I told you to?

4
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,701
It was the anniversary
of Ahn Yun-sik's death that day.

5
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,038
The day we drank beer
at the convenience store.

6
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,791
I opened up about my story,

7
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,502
but you didn't.

8
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,254
Other than what you jokingly said
in passing.

9
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,547
Don't you have any friends?

10
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,841
I had one friend, but he died.

11
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,222
That friend

12
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,225
was the reason why
you became a probation officer.

13
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,733
What does that have anything
to do with this right now?

14
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,277
It has everything to do with it.

15
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,029
Because you and I

16
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,825
both wanted to save people

17
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,202
who were desperately unlucky in life.

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,287
If you tell me the rest of your story,

19
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,499
I'll tell you too

20
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,629
about the connection you need to know
before going after Ro-eum.

21
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,445
He was on government welfare,
his mother worked at a karaoke,

22
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,949
and his father abused her every day
then eventually died.

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,535
Running away from home
in elementary school,

24
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,288
he went to juvie in middle school,
and in high school…

25
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,916
he was labeled a juvenile delinquent.

26
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,129
When he got out at 20, he started
working at construction sites.

27
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,923
He had to work three jobs
to pay off his parents' debt.

28
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,760
Eventually, he injured his back
while dozing off at a construction site.

29
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,306
Of course he didn't have the money
to get treated, and got deeper into debt,

30
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,350
so he ended up in an insurance fraud gang.

31
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,854
You know,

32
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:13,067
the kind where people throw themselves
in front of a car to shake them down.

33
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,071
He flew ten meters and broke every bone
in his body crashing into a guard rail.

34
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,242
The only number he had on his outgoing
calls was me.

35
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,120
See, he had come to me
a week before he died.

36
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,373
Not knowing he was there to borrow money,

37
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,209
I took him out for drinks
with college buddies,

38
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,881
where all they talked about
were vacations and women.

39
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,348
I had a tough childhood
having a famous mother,

40
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,561
and Yun-sik was my only friend.

41
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,606
I had been a straight-A student,

42
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,234
and always did what I was told

43
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,611
up until the point he died.

44
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,157
But learning how he had lived,
I go to school like nothing had happened.

45
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,161
So I enlisted to get away from it all
and that's where I decided

46
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,829
to watch and see

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,708
how things could change

48
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,046
if a person without any luck
gets a chance,

49
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,424
or if a criminal reforms.

50
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,053
That's it for my story.

51
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,889
It's your turn now.

52
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,848
What is it?

53
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,976
The connection.

54
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,193
Can't you guess?

55
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,032
Tell me everything.

56
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,618
I'm ready for it.

57
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,705
I'll decide after I hear you out.

58
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,624
And whether you make a good case.

59
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,748
No, come on. I really

60
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,083
don't get it.

61
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,878
This is a huge opportunity.

62
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,089
Do you think this makes sense?

63
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,175
We're breaking into

64
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,927
a vault that only the hotel's VVIPs

65
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,512
have access to.

66
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,972
But all we're going to take

67
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,059
is one measly little notebook?
How does that make any sense?

68
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,435
Huh?

69
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,104
Am I the only one who finds it strange?
Am I the only hog here?

70
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,022
Na Su-ho.

71
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:56,939
Yeah.

72
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,900
I told you to focus.

73
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,194
Geez.

74
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,361
Fine.

75
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,781
I should listen to the boss.

76
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,996
Yoo-il, Yoo-neung.

77
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,706
Remember what I told you?

78
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,044
If you sense any danger at all,
just get the hell out of there.

79
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,670
Don't try to save me.

80
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,714
I'll save Ro-eum,

81
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,217
and I'll save myself too.

82
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,722
Only one hour to go.

83
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,724
Can you run through the timeline?

84
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,561
Her appointment is at five.

85
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,358
The concierge desk will check her ID.

86
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,870
When the private elevator
reaches the vault,

87
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,171
she'll scan her veins and a bar code.

88
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,892
When she's at her safe,
she'll receive an OTP on her phone.

89
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,936
That's when we'll turn her phone
into a brick,

90
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,188
and take over the OTP authentication.

91
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,776
When she can't open the safe,
she'll leave.

92
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,070
But she can't go back without her phone.

93
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,614
Ringo will have cut
the emergency phone line

94
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,158
to the concierge desk.

95
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,660
Her only option is the elevator.

96
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,287
But the moment she gets on,

97
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,872
we'll stop that too.

98
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,624
We have 30 minutes
until the next appointment.

99
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,835
We have to finish up before that.

100
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,173
Da-jeong.

101
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,928
They concluded the contract.

102
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,854
She should be leaving by now.

103
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,443
She's headed toward her office.
What is she doing?

104
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,529
Turn on the audio.

105
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,530
Hang on.

106
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,591
She turned her phone off.

107
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,220
I'll try to access her wi-fi.

108
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,810
I got hold of a clock. Hang on.

109
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,941
Preparing promotional materials

110
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,069
would be good for both our companies.

111
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,780
We need to see how our investors react.

112
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,200
Getting celebrities
on our commercials was more effective.

113
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,160
-Ringo.
-Yes?

114
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,830
How can I help you?

115
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,332
-One sec.
-One sec.

116
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,708
I need you to interpret.

117
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,794
Feel free to ask me anything.

118
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,965
Well?

119
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,466
I'll keep it in mind.

120
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,386
Why don't we wrap up
the second contract at the hotel?

121
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,263
As requested, I sought legal advice

122
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,181
for the dual contract.

123
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,561
You're agreeing to our terms?

124
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,730
There's a second contact.

125
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,191
They're doing a backdoor deal
at Jang Kyung-ja's hotel room.

126
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,777
They were talking about a 12 kg gold bar.

127
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,571
That must be why she's going to the vault.

128
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,156
What? 12 kg, that's…

129
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,449
That's 900 million won?

130
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,537
The problem is she'll have
a ton of security.

131
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,331
And Mr. Yoon will be going
to the vault with her.

132
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,834
Only one person can enter the vault
because of the sensor.

133
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,836
He can still wait by the entrance.

134
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,422
And he'll have a phone.

135
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,007
What if he makes a call to the hotel?

136
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,513
Once the phone lines are down,
he'll have to get on the elevator.

137
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,849
What if he calls security?

138
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,685
Whoever gets on,
we'll to shut down the elevator, right?

139
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,563
You want Ringo to linger around
the switchboard?

140
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,025
-What difference does it make?
-It puts him in more danger.

141
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,694
It's okay, it's okay.

142
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,195
I can do it.

143
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,196
I'll do it.

144
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,407
No matter how many guards there are,

145
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,867
it's not like they know me.

146
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,910
Besides, it won't take long.

147
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,580
I'm sure Ro-eum and Na-sa
will get the job done.

148
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,627
Don't worry, okay?

149
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,212
Are you really going to go through this?

150
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,756
Don't make a fuss.

151
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,593
It'll be fine as long as you get access
and Na-sa unlocks the safe on time.

152
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,431
I'm at the hotel.

153
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,183
Is everything okay on your end?

154
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,150
Can you hear me?

155
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,902
How did it go with Yo-han?

156
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,320
We had a good talk.

157
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,448
I'll head to the van.

158
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,327
Hang on.

159
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,582
Her phone is updating automatically.

160
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,379
Once it's done, we won't be able to use
what we installed. It'll be bricked.

161
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,547
What? We can't stop it?

162
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,550
It takes some time
to get control after rebooting.

163
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,761
The update is almost complete.

164
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,096
Just get to the point.

165
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,099
We have to start all over.

166
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,518
What Mr. Han did.

167
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,561
We have to do it again.

168
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,438
On Jang Kyung-ja's phone.

169
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,774
Are you kidding me?

170
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,069
We can't go ahead with this.
We have to try again some other day.

171
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,740
How much time
before Jang Kyung-ja arrives?

172
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,059
Please leave.

173
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,313
Leave, please!

174
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,358
Who are you?

175
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,861
Do you know me?

176
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,946
Please, leave. Right now.

177
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,241
Yo-han.

178
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,710
Yo-han…

179
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,296
You're her son.

180
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,298
Now that you know, please leave.

181
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,135
I need to talk to my mother in private.

182
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,428
If it's not urgent…

183
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,598
Have you seen me step foot in this house
during the past ten years?

184
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,141
If it's not urgent,

185
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,227
should I make an appointment
at your clinic then?

186
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,047
This way.

187
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,893
This way, please.

188
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,151
Ms. Jang.

189
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,533
Mr. Han?

190
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,202
Hello.

191
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,249
What are you doing here?

192
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,792
I have some business.

193
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,670
What a coincidence.

194
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,757
Are you here because of Ro-eum too?

195
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,183
I won't be able
to stall as long as last time.

196
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,893
Is there a quicker way?

197
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,353
We could do it over a text.

198
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,398
But she has to open the link.

199
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,447
What do you mean?

200
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,034
What does she have to do
with you being here?

201
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,036
She said

202
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,373
she'd tell me about the murder
ten years ago.

203
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,420
And that I'd be able to find
the criminal here.

204
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,384
The criminal behind a murder…

205
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,390
You mean the one where
her parents were killed?

206
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,684
No.

207
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,687
Director Ahn Chae-hong.

208
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,822
She just texted me.

209
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,116
Did you get a text too?

210
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,075
It won't open.

211
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,494
Do you see anything?

212
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,205
The murderer?

213
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,179
Mr. Han.

214
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,141
DA-JEONG: DONE

215
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,270
Mine won't open either.

216
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,156
You should go about your business.
I'll be in touch when I know something.

217
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,130
Get him out of here.

218
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,215
Make sure he doesn't come back.

219
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,759
Is it true?

220
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,678
What?

221
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,849
I heard you selected
the scholarship students for Red Eye.

222
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,145
You were their therapist and analyzing
their criminal tendencies was your job.

223
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,563
Is that true?

224
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,735
It's true I did some consulting.

225
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,279
I heard you were assigned to Lee Ro-eum.

226
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,864
Where did you hear that?

227
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,699
Ever since she was a child,

228
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,660
she was dark and indifferent.

229
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,203
How do you know?

230
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,831
She was on my show once.

231
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,876
When she was garnering attention
for having a photographic memory.

232
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,918
But then,

233
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,212
you never watched any of my shows.

234
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,548
Based on my judgment,

235
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,675
she was dangerous.

236
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,095
And eventually, she killed her parents.

237
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,806
She was found innocent.

238
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,518
Your probationers

239
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,021
are all criminals.

240
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,648
Just be careful.

241
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,358
And don't get too close to them.

242
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,362
You always had too much interest
in low-lives.

243
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,741
How can you be so shameless?

244
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,534
Watch your language.

245
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,080
Hanging around with criminals
has made you rude.

246
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,165
Because of your judgment,

247
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,210
children were raised under Red Eye.

248
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,421
Because of your consultation,
they were abused with violence,

249
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,508
and they were trained as criminals.

250
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,135
You still don't feel any guilt?

251
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,139
I told you not to get close,

252
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,391
but it seems you did.

253
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,353
Why?

254
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,230
Do you feel sorry for them?

255
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,582
I don't think I can get back in the hotel.
I'll go to the van.

256
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,751
No, go home.

257
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:48,710
Home?

258
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,629
You wanted a better ending, didn't you?

259
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,590
There's where the ending will be.

260
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,221
Da-jeong, cut off Moo-young's link.

261
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,609
What's going on?

262
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,944
What?

263
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,029
How long did you expect
him to be a part of this?

264
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,920
I need to use the bathroom.

265
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,062
Your ID has been confirmed.

266
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,486
Let's go.

267
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,130
The two just walked by the concierge desk.

268
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,882
They'll be on the elevator soon.

269
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,564
She's entering the vault now.

270
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:26,952
She got the code.

271
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,912
Five minutes.

272
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,589
AN ERROR OCCURRED

273
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,428
AN ERROR OCCURRED

274
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,760
She's out. You can go in now.

275
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,917
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

276
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,343
I'm at the switchboard.

277
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,113
Be careful.

278
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,036
Call the hotel.

279
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,962
The concierge office, please.

280
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:46,967
Hello?

281
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,931
CONCIERGE OFFICE

282
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,658
Not yet?

283
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,743
She's in the elevator.

284
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,085
OTP! OTP!

285
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,139
It's done.

286
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,105
VIP ELEVATOR

287
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,155
How's it going?

288
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,867
Shh, everyone, quiet.

289
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,745
They were gifted children.

290
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,622
Born in the sewers.

291
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,543
Having an overly high IQ
meant that they were different,

292
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,671
and being different meant

293
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,298
they couldn't live
under normal circumstances.

294
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,676
And if they were from broken families,

295
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,470
it would make them even more unstable.

296
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,431
All I did for them was read the signs.

297
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,768
They were already kids
that didn't think normally.

298
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,271
I didn't make them that way.

299
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,690
They were already like that
and all I did was analyze them.

300
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,320
No.

301
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,950
Huh? Ringo.

302
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,372
Jay.

303
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,172
Jay.

304
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,510
P-please don't kill me.

305
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,557
Jay. Come on.

306
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,026
Don't kill me.

307
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,527
Please.

308
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,737
Jay.

309
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,706
Jay.

310
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,835
Jay, let me go.

311
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,004
Jay, come on.

312
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,425
Let me out, Jay.

313
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:16,968
Let me out.

314
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,386
Jay.

315
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,514
Jay, let me out.

316
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,599
Jay.

317
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,823
Hae-dong.

318
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,742
Hae-dong, do you hear me?

319
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:03,973
No.

320
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,193
Ringo.

321
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,905
They were a group of ticking time bombs,

322
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,533
so things would inevitably go wrong.

323
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,785
Jay is here.

324
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,831
Hae-dong is trapped inside. Do something.

325
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,418
Na-sa, you still haven't cracked it?

326
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,009
Did something happen to Ringo?

327
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,722
Can I…

328
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,473
Can I go and get him?

329
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,641
Na Su-ho!

330
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,809
Report!

331
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,616
Na Su-ho!

332
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,076
Geez.

333
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,553
They are rash,
and overly obsess over the endgame.

334
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,849
Whatever they do,
they'll end up messing it up.

335
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,017
Ro-eum!

336
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,477
Su-ho, answer me!

337
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,604
Did you find the notebook?

338
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,317
VIP ELEVATOR

339
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,197
Yeah.

340
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,741
Got it right here.

341
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,706
What are you doing?

342
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,709
Ro-eum.

343
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,420
I did a little research,

344
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,507
and you can't put me away
with that revolver.

345
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,134
What are you going to prove with that?

346
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,681
Damn it.

347
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,768
What? A servile attitude?

348
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,977
Na Su-ho.

349
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,687
Say that again.

350
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,523
Huh?

351
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,650
Say that again, Ro-eum.

352
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,652
Do I still look like a loser to you?

353
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,656
Get the notebook
and get out of there, quick.

354
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,700
If you stay any longer,
you'll be in danger too.

355
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,371
Hey.

356
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,290
Whether I side with Jang Kyung-ja here,

357
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,543
or get treated like dirt by you,

358
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,836
it's all the same to me.

359
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,963
So,

360
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,131
if you want the notebook,

361
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,511
stop ordering me around,
and just shut up and wait.

362
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,054
Got that? Damn it.

363
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,808
I don't take orders from you.

364
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,771
Or,

365
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,483
why don't you just
come and get it yourself?

366
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,824
Yoo-il.

367
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,911
Get out of there and bring the car around.

368
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,747
Damn it.

369
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,315
You actually came?

370
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,066
Where's the notebook?

371
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,110
Damn it.

372
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,161
The notebook!

373
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,580
Give it to me.

374
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,586
What the hell is this?

375
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:06,925
Take it out

376
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,635
yourself.

377
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,388
What, you're going to shoot me?

378
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,223
Do it then!

379
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,141
Do it!

380
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,810
Do you even have the bullets for that?

381
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,069
What's going on?

382
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,614
I heard a gunshot.

383
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:30,990
Ro-eum!

384
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,825
That was a gunshot, right?

385
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,245
What happened?

386
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,872
Our lines are all down.

387
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,499
How would I know?

388
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,669
Darn it, it's not like
I can go back inside and check.

389
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,672
But what about Ringo?

390
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,383
I think we have to pull out.

391
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,259
Da-jeong!

392
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,512
You have to make the call, quick.

393
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,263
We can't delay any longer.

394
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,766
Yoo-il,

395
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,893
wrap things up and get the van.

396
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,103
Okay, got it.

397
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,815
-Yoo-neung, go get Ringo.
-Got it.

398
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,775
Take the stairs in Complex B.
It's the fastest.

399
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:06,693
Okay.

400
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,322
The hotel has a lot of guests.

401
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,701
If we bring him out to a crowded place,
they won't be able to do anything.

402
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,536
I'll go with Yoo-il.

403
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,954
I'll be in touch.

404
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,889
You think you're the only
one I can go to for bullets?

405
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,395
Damn it. Are you insane?

406
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,813
Have you really gone nuts?

407
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,360
Damn it.

408
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,946
You heartless bitch.

409
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,323
Damn it.

410
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,172
We have Ringo.

411
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,132
We'll head for a nearby hospital.

412
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,677
Okay, I'll head out too.
Text me the address.

413
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,304
And stick to Ringo, no matter what.

414
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,782
Are you here for this?

415
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,831
Too bad.

416
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,083
After coming all this way.

417
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,964
It's been ten years.

418
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,800
Aren't you glad to see me?

419
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,637
Actually, I've seen your face
all over the place.

420
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,352
You saw me recently too, didn't you?

421
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,232
Didn't Jay say anything?

422
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,736
Are you two it?

423
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,363
Where's the rest of your gang?

424
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,157
The parking lot.

425
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,366
And outside the hotel.

426
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,871
The parking lot is clear.

427
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,499
Looks like everyone ran off.

428
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,752
And I kicked the lawyer out earlier.

429
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,047
Please don't kill me.
Please let me go this once.

430
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,885
Call security.

431
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,387
And the police.

432
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,687
MOYANG FOODS FACTORY CASE

433
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,174
Do you find this funny?

434
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,094
I do.

435
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,058
The first thing I did

436
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,061
after getting out of prison
is break into this place

437
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,938
and the Chairman will know.

438
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,609
Don't you get it?

439
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,487
From now on,

440
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,490
the Chairman will start to wonder

441
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,785
what you've been hiding.

442
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,047
Wait.

443
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,590
Hang up.

444
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,516
You know what?

445
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,440
I think
you need to suffer a little more.

446
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,492
MOYANG FOODS FACTORY CASE REPORT

447
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,910
LEE RO-EUM

448
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,184
Mom.

449
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,671
That's your theory?

450
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,384
They were born in the sewers

451
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,428
so living like that is a given?

452
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,849
You must've felt so justified
when Ro-eum was charged for murder.

453
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,684
And when Yun-sik died,

454
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,561
you must've believed
your theory was right.

455
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,563
He was my only friend,

456
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,778
but you were so busy trying to get
him out of my life.

457
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,030
I resented him.

458
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,160
Because of what happened,
I lost my only son.

459
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,915
In this world,

460
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,879
there are people
who really have lost their families.

461
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,591
You have no right to say that, mother.

462
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,012
And unlike you, there are people
who wish to help people like them.

463
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,226
I'm sure there are.

464
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,228
People

465
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,856
like you.

466
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,616
LEE RO-EUM

467
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,086
Please leave a message after the beep.

468
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,971
Yes, hello?

469
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:35,558
Doctor, you remember you have appointment
with Han Moo-young this evening, right?

470
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,726
Oh, at 7:30 p.m. was it?

471
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,897
But do you think he'll come today?

472
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,067
Right, I'm his doctor.

473
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,318
Sorry.

474
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,736
That was a stupid question.

475
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,363
I'll be there as soon as possible.

476
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,781
Okay.

477
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,333
You're still here?

478
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,793
Yes, I was just about to leave.

479
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,597
Why is he standing there?

480
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,015
Excuse me.

481
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,311
Uh… Can you…

482
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,273
This makes no sense.

483
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,611
Excuse me, but could you
get out of the way?

484
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,030
I never liked it in the first place.

485
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,490
Does she think she's Dracula?

486
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,783
Who lives in a mansion like this
in the 21st century?

487
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,660
Excuse me…

488
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,538
I mean,
there's no public transportation here.

489
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,499
It's so maddening every time I come over.

490
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,167
The cab fare alone is 45,000 won.

491
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,419
Excuse me,

492
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,129
I'm really sorry,

493
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,673
but I'm in a rush
so could you please move aside?

494
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,635
Okay. You can give me a ride.

495
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,094
What?

496
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,556
Oh my, it wasn't locked?

497
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,935
You really shouldn't be…

498
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,603
How do you know Professor Shin?

499
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,897
She was my teacher.

500
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,107
-Are you close?
-Not that much…

501
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,693
I just… From time to time…

502
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,071
I'm her son. You saw me earlier, right?

503
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:18,869
Yes. I did, and she told me about you too.
But if you suddenly just get in my car…

504
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,121
Drop me off at the main road.

505
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,918
Professor Shin
really hurt me deeply today,

506
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,504
so I need a ride
from her student at least.

507
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,189
Do you believe it?

508
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,524
What your mother did?

509
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,608
Not that.

510
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,194
I believe it and I'm sure
the entire country does.

511
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,113
She's more than capable of doing it.

512
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,033
I'm asking if you believe
this is the right thing to do.

513
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,952
Ro-eum's revenge.

514
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,291
If we all try to solve things this way,
it'll never end.

515
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,418
And strictly speaking,

516
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,963
she's also a perpetrator who has a victim.

517
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,216
You're right.

518
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,218
If you're someone

519
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,389
who stops her from
going anywhere near the mud,

520
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,518
I'm someone who stands by her
and fights for her

521
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,813
when she has fallen into the mud.

522
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,985
Is it better to stop someone
from going into the mud,

523
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,695
or going in there with them?

524
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,449
Do you stop them?

525
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,992
Or go in with them?

526
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,785
If you had to choose.

527
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,706
Uh… What kind of mud?

528
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,126
If it's mineral mud,

529
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,295
I'd go in.

530
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:26,914
Mr. Han.

531
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,832
What happened to everyone?

532
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,960
Where's Ro-eum?

533
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,464
I heard a gunshot.

534
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,426
Then Na-sa screamed.

535
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,013
I don't know what happened after that.
Ringo was badly hurt.

536
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,890
Then did Ro-eum…

537
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,141
Did she shoot Na-sa?

538
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,102
It looks that way.

539
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,106
She ruthlessly gets rid of
anything she doesn't need.

540
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,733
I found a USB drive.

541
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,528
I read

542
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,406
the files on it.

543
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,495
You should go home.

544
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,497
Da-jeong.

545
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,004
You still don't get it.

546
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,801
Ro-eum has every right to betray us.

547
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,886
Because we betrayed her first.

548
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,222
We deserve to be used.

549
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,851
But you're different.

550
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,855
Ro-eum isn't conning people
for some great cause.

551
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,898
You need to know that.

552
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,693
Ro-eum is very much like the Chairman.

553
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,612
That's why the Chairman
is so obsessed with her too.

554
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,699
To achieve her objective,

555
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,034
she will use anyone.

556
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,454
How much do you know?

557
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,710
How much of it was planned?

558
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,547
Since when?

559
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,676
Were you all a part of it?

560
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,388
The con behind Moyang Foods Factory
in 2007.

561
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:07,973
Were you all

562
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,600
behind it?

563
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,398
Yes, we were.

564
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,153
It wasn't even one of our major cons.

565
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,197
I knew that

566
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,782
your family fell apart
after what happened.

567
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,075
Ro-eum and I both knew.

568
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,411
So,

569
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,415
you should stop getting involved
in our business and leave.

570
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,934
-Ro-eum?
-Ro-eum.

571
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,652
Hold her down!

572
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,096
Didn't you have a photographic memory?

573
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,349
It seems like you keep forgetting

574
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,518
why you fail.

575
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,065
What do I have to do

576
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,610
to get you out of my life?

577
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,572
I gave you a chance.

578
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,244
You should've let me go when I wanted out.

579
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,791
Why does everything have to go your way?

580
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,169
Why? Who do you think you are?

581
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,130
If you blackmail me,

582
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,925
do I have to bring you the bag
like you wanted?

583
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,511
Do you think the world is that easy?

584
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,223
Do you honestly think everything goes

585
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,934
the way you planned things
with that tiny brain of yours?

586
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,729
Are we all just puppets in your hand?

587
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,279
That's why you always fail.

588
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,700
Because of your arrogance.

589
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,078
You were barely 19

590
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:20,874
but you rashly believed
that you could control three adults.

591
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,210
And now, ten years later,

592
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:27,089
because you stupidly believed
everything would go

593
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,924
according to your plan again,

594
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,425
this is your reality.

595
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,595
Your team left you and ran
because you couldn't even control them,

596
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,222
and now, you're all alone.

597
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,896
Still, you managed to find yourself
a good lawyer.

598
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,982
Or should I say a loyal one?

599
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,364
You want to give him a call?

600
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,908
He might come to save you.

601
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,875
You and your pride.

602
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,753
Didn't you learn anything ten years ago?

603
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,548
You can't do anything alone.

604
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,926
You just wait.

605
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,639
I'll rip you into pieces,

606
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,935
and chew up the Chairman afterwards.

607
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:27,649
I'll make you realize
that you're only a pawn too.

608
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,946
Like we were.

609
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,824
"We"?

610
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,287
Who's here

611
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,581
besides you?

612
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,763
You know,

613
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,932
you're right.

614
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,393
He will be suspicious of me.

615
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,646
But,

616
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,482
what can he do?

617
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,082
He has no evidence.

618
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,728
Welcome back.

619
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,730
Ro-eum.

620
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,251
Mr. Han.

621
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,099
Mr. Han.

622
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,321
Please leave a message…

623
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,074
Damn.

624
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,434
And strictly speaking,

625
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:58,021
she's also a perpetrator who has a victim.

626
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:01,649
I knew that your family
fell apart after what happened.

627
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,692
Ro-eum and I both knew.

628
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,778
I don't want to be forgiven

629
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,404
as a perpetrator.

630
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,489
Use me.

631
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,449
What's wrong with that?

632
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,828
I'm using you.

633
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,872
You wanted a better ending, didn't you?

634
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,583
There's where the ending will be.

635
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,737
I'm sorry I'm late.

636
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,870
Let's go.

637
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:37,829
Let's go home.

638
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,523
Why are you doing this to me?

639
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,982
She probably just needs some time.

640
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,068
She would come back, wouldn't she?

641
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,152
Why are you here?

642
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,363
Can't we just be a team?

643
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,864
Ro-eum would kill me first.

644
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,616
That you've been looking after Ro-eum.

645
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,784
Looking after her?

646
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,077
She's not a child.

647
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:02,956
I think I've found
the connection you were talking about.

648
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,000
I'm going to start where you left off.

649
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,043
Han Moo-young.

650
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,336
Do you believe in me?

651
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,754
I'll be waiting.

652
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:10,838
Come back.
