1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,309
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,272
Why don't we talk about your father?
If that's all right with you.

3
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,149
Such as?

4
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,485
Such as something
you remember the most about him.

5
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:25,919
What?

6
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,434
Soju.

7
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,896
The soju he used to pour.

8
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,922
Do I just need to
believe in your illness again this time?

9
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,591
Just believe in me.

10
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,469
This is my revenge too now.

11
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,064
Towels are in the bathroom.

12
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,359
You'll find everything you need
if you poke around.

13
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,862
I'll just go to the…

14
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,863
Just stay.

15
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,115
We've lived together for ten years.

16
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,035
Do you feel awkward?

17
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,747
No, not really…

18
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,959
It'll be easier to eat out.

19
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,961
I have instant noodles,

20
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,380
but since you don't eat that…

21
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,799
And you can take the bed.

22
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,134
I'll sleep over there.

23
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,385
I'll sleep on the sofa.

24
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,429
Okay then.

25
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,392
Let me know if you need anything.

26
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,272
Um… Can I borrow a laptop?

27
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,400
Sure.

28
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,790
For the room.

29
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:30,960
It's fine.

30
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,497
Ahn Chae-hong's ledgers…
Do you remember what was on it?

31
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,290
Mostly?

32
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,584
We need to know the content
even if we don't have the original copy.

33
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,419
From Red Eye to Navis Well-being,

34
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,463
we need to map out everything

35
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,007
so that the team knows the entire picture.

36
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,219
You mean, Ringo and Da-jeong too?

37
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,471
Yes.

38
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,863
I STARTED WORKING AS RED EYE'S DIRECTOR

39
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,787
RED EYE WILL MAKE MY DREAM COME TRUE

40
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,783
The scholarship kids are delinquents,

41
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,286
abandoned by their parents.

42
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:32,707
Giving them a home
and raising them is meaningful work.

43
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,418
We are their salvation.

44
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,546
Imagine the hope and future these kids

45
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,673
could bring to the foundation.

46
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,331
Hey. Here you go.

47
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,557
Hello. I'm Yoo-il. This is Yoo-neung.

48
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,933
I'm Woo Young-gi.

49
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,771
It's Red Eye's ledgers
that Ro-eum typed up.

50
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,232
Ten years worth of records
that Ahn Chae-hong kept.

51
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,276
Mr. Woo told me about it.

52
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,695
I was wondering why I didn't get a copy.

53
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,034
I thought that maybe you and Mr. Woo

54
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,370
might have different positions on this.

55
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,290
What do you mean?

56
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,376
Red Eye was able to exist this long

57
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,044
in part due to the prosecution.

58
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,505
You've been on our side so far,

59
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,634
but things might not go
as you expected from now on.

60
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,220
No one knows how things will go.

61
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,057
If you want out, this is the time.

62
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,768
I wanted to give you a choice.

63
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,740
I know

64
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,533
I can be self-centered.

65
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,827
I'm just a government employee

66
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,830
who gets transferred somewhere new
every two years,

67
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,375
but I kept talking about a big play
because I couldn't see

68
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,504
the line I knew existed.

69
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,341
Just when I thought I'd formed
a connection, I'd be cast off,

70
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,717
or suddenly get lost.

71
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,969
It's like trying to catch minnows
with your bare hands.

72
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,305
They're hard to see,
and slip through my fingers.

73
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,556
It's very frustrating.

74
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,853
Will they still slip through my fingers
even if I turn the country inside out?

75
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,315
You're trying to warn me off.

76
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,068
Does that mean this is big enough
to do that?

77
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,945
It's the same for me.

78
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,990
I have to draw up a plan
for a play that I can't see myself.

79
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:54,992
And after that?

80
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,869
Then we'll be able to see

81
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,289
what you wish to see.

82
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,754
Then hand it over.

83
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,130
I'll take a look.

84
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,804
This is my card.

85
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,516
Nice to meet you.

86
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,017
-Thanks.
-Nice to meet you again.

87
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,352
-Thanks.
-Yes.

88
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,774
Everyone, say hello.

89
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,359
We'll be working as a team now.

90
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,280
It's an honor to meet everyone.
I'm Woo Young-gi of Moran Ilbo.

91
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,657
I'm Ryu Jae-hyeok.

92
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,951
I'm in the Criminal Division at
the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

93
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,244
I've heard a lot about you.

94
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,705
I was the prosecutor
at Ye Chung-sik's trial.

95
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,835
Looks like our team has grown.

96
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,882
I don't mind having a big team,
but I'm not so sure about a prosecutor.

97
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,555
Well, don't worry about that.

98
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,682
You've been excused of everything.

99
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,602
How can we not worry?

100
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,687
We all have a rap sheet.

101
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,022
Yes, exactly.

102
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,233
I'm letting the small things go
for the greater good.

103
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,277
Let's just leave it at that.

104
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,282
They'll be helping us from now on.

105
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,784
I've shared all the intel
we've gathered so far,

106
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,162
and we'll keep you updated going forward.

107
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,204
Let's begin.

108
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,041
We're up against Red Eye.

109
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,669
They're a criminal organization that has
transformed themselves for 20 years.

110
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,714
The head is someone called the Chairman
but his identity is veiled in secrecy.

111
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,717
Only two people have direct
contact with him.

112
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,511
The Messenger who is his contact
and the Banker in charge of his finances.

113
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,224
Like Ahn Chae-hong's ledger said,

114
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,061
the Chairman has been growing his wealth
through a pyramid scheme,

115
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,313
and he has formed connections with
people in political and business circles.

116
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,607
Just like Navis Well-being is doing now.

117
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,401
Then what's his goal? To go into politics?

118
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,403
To control Korea.

119
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,823
The purpose of Red Eye
was to train elite criminals,

120
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,825
Darusa to create seed money for Navis,

121
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,036
and Navis is a front.

122
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,414
They have succeeded
in laundering their image,

123
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,084
while colluding with politicians
and businessmen.

124
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,883
Then Navis Well-being
has been a successful project for them.

125
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,844
They still have to close.

126
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,971
Navis is almost at the ends of its rope.

127
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,681
What do you mean?

128
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,225
They're on the brink of bankruptcy.

129
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,645
Like all Ponzi schemes where money
is taken from one and given to another,

130
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,313
they may look fine on the outside,

131
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,524
but they're practically
a ticking time bomb.

132
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,361
When we were at Red Eye, we drew up
a business plan for pyramid schemes.

133
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,113
Based on that,

134
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,031
Navis is currently in the last stage.

135
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,950
The Closing.

136
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,034
The Closing?

137
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,747
They're going to try and eke out

138
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,499
as much money

139
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,668
as they can before making a run for it.

140
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,254
So, they're going to close up and bounce?

141
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,891
The Chairman always puts up a nominal head
and private company at the front,

142
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,102
while hiding himself completely.

143
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,605
As of now, the only way to find
the Chairman is to prevent

144
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,858
the closing of Navis Well-being
and exposing them.

145
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,110
Since they've always come out
unscathed due to corruption

146
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,736
and media manipulation,

147
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,031
we need your help.

148
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,582
A crack has formed
at Navis Well-being now.

149
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,169
Ma Kang-su is the only link

150
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,088
who connects Red Eye,
Gyeongjae Industrial, and Darusa.

151
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,841
And the Chairman has brought him into
the fold of Navis Well-being.

152
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,302
It's a decision that openly humiliates

153
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,305
Jang Kyung-ja who has been leading
the business for five years.

154
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,849
It means that she has lost control
of the company.

155
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,769
The Closing which we must prevent,

156
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,354
and is Navis's last project

157
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,773
will be carried out by Ma Kang-su.

158
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,400
Yeah.

159
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,653
Yeah.

160
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,786
What can they do without me?

161
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,956
So, how do they do the Closing?

162
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,583
Stock manipulation.

163
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
Oh.

164
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,505
Ma Kang-su's crew
is already making their move.

165
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,964
That's why we need a spy.

166
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,841
Do we have someone on the inside?

167
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,468
We're going to send someone in.

168
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,512
The problem is

169
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,473
none of us here can remain

170
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,225
anonymous at Navis.

171
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,519
We need a new face.

172
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,270
Someone

173
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,813
we can trust.

174
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,941
How can we trust someone we don't know?

175
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,735
It's possible if we have the same goal.

176
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,991
This is a blogger who Mr. Woo found.

177
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,285
He has been targeting Darusa and Navis

178
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,412
and is an expert on pyramid schemes.

179
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,664
Yes, I'll explain.

180
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,959
The blogger is most likely
the father of Yeon Ho-jung

181
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,086
who committed suicide because of Darusa.

182
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,171
His name…

183
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,298
Hang on.

184
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,177
Yeon Tae-hun.

185
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,429
Born in 1963,

186
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,640
his current address is in Gyeonggi-do.

187
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,560
We also have his phone number
so we can ping his location.

188
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,561
Wow.

189
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,104
Hackers are so cool.

190
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,859
Da-jeong hacked the blog,

191
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,069
and read
all the undisclosed material as well.

192
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,072
We think he'll make a good spy for us.

193
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,032
That's right.

194
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,118
He knows everything there is
about Ma Kang-su.

195
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,037
He's been looking into his activities
almost obsessively.

196
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,957
He has a clear goal and is well informed.

197
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,334
Before Mr. Yeon joins our team,

198
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,628
Jae-hyeok, you look into whether
any prosecutors

199
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,630
are currently in Red Eye's pocket.

200
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,843
Um…

201
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,471
I've been looking into something
about Red Eye personally,

202
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,556
and…

203
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,183
I was wondering if I could get your help.

204
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,605
Sure, give me a call.

205
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,732
Wow, you're so cool.

206
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,883
Don't you know my number?

207
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,134
Ms. Jang?

208
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,653
JANG KYUNG-JA

209
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,223
It's the Chairman.

210
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,867
I'll be heading out then.

211
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,328
-Take care.
-Take care.

212
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,999
-Can you grab that line?
-Oh.

213
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,251
Yeon Tae-hun.

214
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,589
Do you think he'll cooperate?

215
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,052
Of course, it won't be easy for him
to work with Ma Kang-su,

216
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,014
but he's taken a risk
the last few years for his daughter.

217
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,599
I'm sure he'll want to help.

218
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,812
Should I go with you tomorrow?

219
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,442
If you want to.

220
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,247
Wow.

221
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,665
Mr. Kang.

222
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,083
Look at you.

223
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,005
You look great.

224
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,131
Wow.

225
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,257
How have you been?

226
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,135
I've been good, as always.

227
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,180
You still like pork rind.

228
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,516
Pork rind is good for you.

229
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,893
It's full of nutrition.

230
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,023
Gyu told me

231
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,819
that you've been suspended
because of some girl who's bad news.

232
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,613
What's going on?

233
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,782
Oh…

234
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,908
He has it all wrong.

235
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,329
I just wanted to stop running.

236
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,124
You don't have to worry.

237
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,584
I'm fine.

238
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,419
You're like the son I never had.

239
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,754
You're all I've got.

240
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,548
Three months will fly by in no time.

241
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,967
Or you can always help me out.

242
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,594
I'm busy too.

243
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:17,971
Brat.

244
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,099
When are you leaving?

245
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,228
I'm not.
I have some business to take care of.

246
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,854
Here?

247
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:30,025
I thought I had lived my entire life
struggling with other people's lives,

248
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,444
but it turns out, it was mine.

249
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,535
Moo-young.

250
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,539
I found your father.

251
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,961
He really wants to see you.

252
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,346
Can you make some time
this weekend in the evening?

253
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,460
No.

254
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,884
May I ask why not?

255
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,719
Why should I?

256
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,722
Like we said, Navis Well-being…

257
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,892
What do they have to do with me?

258
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,144
If we don't do anything,

259
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,438
there'll be more victims than Darusa.

260
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,900
Didn't you run the blog
to stop that from happening?

261
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,321
Yes, I did.

262
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,282
For years.

263
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,618
I kept going to the police,

264
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,995
and protested days on end,

265
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,080
but no one listened.

266
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,124
They just had my posts deleted

267
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,251
and sued if I protested.

268
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,669
Everyone ignored me

269
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,922
and no one heard a word I said.

270
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,299
And now, he's out on parole?

271
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,266
The world has no intention of punishing

272
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,477
bastards like Ma Kang-su.

273
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,730
I don't need this anymore.

274
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,816
I found another way.

275
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,739
What way is that?

276
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,577
A single sacrifice I'll make

277
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,332
for Ho-jung.

278
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,628
Not like your little child's play.

279
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,216
So, you want to go back
to being a bad father?

280
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,761
What did you say?

281
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,054
Ho-jung

282
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,098
worked since high school, didn't she?

283
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,767
Because you never held down a proper job,

284
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,519
and lived off state welfare.

285
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,980
And you even blew that money on alcohol.

286
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,066
Your wife was the bread winner
but then she got ill.

287
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,277
There was no money to go to the hospital,

288
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,862
so all the responsibility
probably fell on Ho-jung.

289
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,283
Because you couldn't be bothered.

290
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,451
You little punk.

291
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,203
All you did was drink all day,

292
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,456
but sometimes felt sorry that
Ho-jung had to take care of you,

293
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,917
so you brought some tangerines home
from time to time.

294
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,878
And with that, you probably told yourself

295
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,715
that you were a pretty good father.

296
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,343
You bastard. Shut up.

297
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,430
Ho-jung got into the pyramid scheme
trying to do something

298
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,683
because she was the head
of the family, instead of you.

299
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,893
You want to do something for her?

300
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,772
Do you even know anything
about your daughter?

301
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,817
You bastard!

302
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,727
I thought you liked appealing to emotions.

303
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,773
No, never. If I did, I'd never
have been ill in the first place.

304
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,626
It's your speech
for the upcoming investment presentation.

305
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,295
It's a first draft
so feel free to share any input.

306
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,299
The executives put a lot of work into it,

307
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,718
so we'd appreciate it
if you learn it by heart.

308
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,308
It's more of an apology than a speech.

309
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,604
It's your first official
event out in public.

310
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,190
Don't you think you should
reflect on past mistakes

311
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,900
and start with a clean slate?

312
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,238
Navis Well-being
is a public friendly enterprise

313
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,658
so having someone with a record
on the board is a risk.

314
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,743
Come in.

315
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,246
Hey.

316
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,455
This is Byeong-do.

317
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,041
He'll be your personal assistant.

318
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,086
Hmm.

319
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,514
D-director.

320
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,515
Director.

321
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,753
A risk, you say?

322
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,089
Oh.

323
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,967
Didn't I tell you?

324
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,305
I already have my own team.

325
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,142
I'll tell them to write up a speech.

326
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,351
So,

327
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,895
where's my office?

328
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,817
You must be quite shocked.

329
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,903
I'll find my office on my own.

330
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,078
Stop trying to fight me.

331
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,713
I'll be in charge
of the investment presentation too.

332
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,050
And I'll be the one
getting in touch with you,

333
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,968
so keep your phone nearby.

334
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,639
My team will also be moving in,

335
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,141
so tell your boyfriend
to keep the doors wide open.

336
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,448
Byeong-do.

337
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,699
Byeong-do.

338
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,588
You want me to tell you why
you're still under Red Eye's thumb?

339
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,011
It's because of your servility.

340
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,520
Oh, hello.

341
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:04,813
Hi.

342
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,238
You're such a pain.

343
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,824
Sitting in the corner,

344
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,161
looking like a loser.

345
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,372
Do you want to run away, like your mom?

346
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,333
This stupid house!

347
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,053
Does your father
still make you uncomfortable?

348
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,398
SOMETHING FEELS OFF
WHEN SHOULD WE GET A SPY?

349
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,904
BIOENGINEER LEE JUNG-BAE

350
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,783
Once we get a spy inside,
we'll hack into their network.

351
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,869
Ma Kang-su's people
have started work at Navis.

352
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,913
He's suspicious by nature,

353
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,499
so he's only using people he knows.

354
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,418
His only new hire is a bio researcher.

355
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,171
I think they're going to manipulate
the stocks of a biotech company.

356
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:56,091
So I'm writing up a profile
with the related experience.

357
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,842
When can I meet Mr. Yeon?

358
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,260
Yes.

359
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,847
Okay, got it.

360
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,269
What?

361
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,107
Mr. Han says Mr. Yeon probably
won't be joining the team.

362
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,532
Explain this to me
so that I can understand.

363
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,909
Or there's no way I'm letting you
plan this con.

364
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,678
I thought you liked helpless people.

365
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,889
I guess he wasn't so helpless.

366
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,517
Even though he lost his family

367
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,561
and is burning for revenge?

368
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,898
He and I aren't that different.

369
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:01,114
Remember I told you about the only adult
who stood by me when I was a kid?

370
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,658
I met him for the first time in a while.

371
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,162
He told me he found my father
who left home when I was 19.

372
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:12,083
Apparently, my father wants to see me,
and he said I should meet him.

373
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,503
And?

374
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,258
When I first started therapy,
I was asked about

375
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,303
the memories I had of my father.

376
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,222
It was soju.

377
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,559
He drank it all the time.

378
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,687
Every time he had it tough,

379
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,815
he poured drinks for my mom and me.

380
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,573
Soju that had pesticide in it.

381
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,463
Hey.

382
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,509
You little punk.

383
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,596
What are you staring at?

384
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,521
PESTICIDE

385
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,317
I hated my father.

386
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,694
I hated him with all my heart.

387
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,740
The con you pulled

388
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,536
was just the wind that blew
over a house built with matchsticks.

389
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,914
It was also his fault

390
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,917
that my mother left.

391
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,586
Mr. Yeon isn't like you.

392
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,755
He's like my father.

393
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,424
An alcoholic,

394
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,969
emotional, and rude.

395
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,181
He may say he cared about his family
but he's self-centered,

396
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,142
and someone I can't have any sympathy for.

397
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,521
You said you forgave your parents
when they came back.

398
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,400
But I can't forgive my father

399
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,862
or Yeon Tae-hun.

400
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,537
I didn't care either

401
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,205
whether they had died or not.

402
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,750
Even when they showed up after
ten years, and cried holding my hand,

403
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,168
I didn't feel a thing.

404
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,214
I wondered
what the fuss was after all that time.

405
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,008
But then, they mentioned ramyeon.

406
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,344
They asked whether I still liked it.

407
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,346
To their daughter
whom they met after ten years.

408
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,766
We were poor,

409
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,811
so while other families
ate out on weekends,

410
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,938
we ate ramyeon all weekend long.

411
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:44,485
They pretended it was special,
like we only had it on special occasions.

412
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,406
But they couldn't even lie properly.

413
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,242
They kept looking at me warily
even as we ate.

414
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,495
I felt awkward seeing them make

415
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,123
a big deal over instant noodles,

416
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,376
so I just pretended to like it.

417
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,631
And they really believed that I did.

418
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,301
That day,

419
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,388
they told me they'd make it for me.

420
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:15,934
118-3 PANDO-RI

421
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,226
WE STILL LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE
SINCE YOU LEFT…

422
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,148
WE'VE GOT RAMYEON WAITING FOR YOU
COME JOIN US

423
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,279
Isn't that so ridiculous?

424
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,867
Noodles get soggy really quickly
and who knew if I'd even show up?

425
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,078
But she said she'd make it
and wait for me.

426
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,165
And because it was so ridiculous,

427
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:41,876
sometimes…

428
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,381
I think about it.

429
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,343
I wonder if she really made it that day.

430
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,889
How soggy would it have gotten?

431
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,266
Would someone have found it?

432
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,268
The police?

433
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,564
Would someone have thrown it away
along with everything else?

434
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,156
I've never gone home for 20 years,

435
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,075
but strangely,

436
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,788
it feels like a steaming bowl of ramyeon

437
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,791
will be there if I go.

438
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,295
Humans are funny.

439
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,049
We want to punish some people
over the smallest things,

440
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,218
and want to forgive others

441
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,763
over the most trivial matters.

442
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,503
Please leave a message…

443
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,326
We should go.

444
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,161
It's been an hour already.

445
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,373
I think it'll be difficult to meet
the Messenger for the time being.

446
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,125
He'll probably move the location.

447
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,921
There were no instructions

448
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,465
regarding you.

449
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,338
You want some water?

450
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:35,967
Whiskey.

451
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,685
Where are you always off to these days?

452
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,399
Are you looking for Ro-eum?

453
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,239
What about ice?

454
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,242
I asked you a question.

455
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,120
Are you looking for her?

456
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,330
Why would I do that?

457
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,711
That day…

458
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,504
What did you talk about?

459
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,549
During the talk show.

460
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,010
Why did you lie to me?

461
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,847
Why can't you answer me?

462
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,394
What did you two talk about?

463
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,206
What did Ro-eum try to steal?

464
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,127
Did Ahn Chae-hong really have ledgers?

465
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,259
There's no such thing.

466
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,137
That day…

467
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm right by your side,

468
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,191
just like that day.

469
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,573
I added too much.

470
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,617
He's not getting up.

471
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,661
Okay.

472
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,455
I just…

473
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,582
I just…

474
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,918
He was yelling,

475
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,670
trying to hit me again,

476
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,506
and kept telling me to pack.

477
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,386
I told you I didn't want to leave.
I can't leave right now!

478
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,930
How can I leave you?

479
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,849
How can I leave Korea?
I don't even know where I'm going.

480
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,187
I told him I couldn't go
but he just kept yelling.

481
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,248
Did you buy the ticket?

482
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,585
For this morning?

483
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,172
The 6 a.m. flight.

484
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,218
Get your bags and wait at the airport.

485
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,806
Buy the ticket like the Director told you,
and wait for him.

486
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,391
Spend the night at the airport.

487
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,936
And keep calling his cell phone.

488
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,405
What about you?

489
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,324
Can't we just

490
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,910
leave the country on the same flight?

491
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,584
Come with me.

492
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,963
We can go right now.

493
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,844
Do you want to be hunted
for the rest of your life?

494
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,474
It's because of her, isn't it?

495
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,604
Because of Lee Ro-eum.

496
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,607
It's because of her!

497
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,281
Who do you think I'm doing this for?

498
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,494
Look clearly.

499
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,247
Watch how far I can go for you.

500
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,147
Dry your hair.

501
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,735
You'll catch a cold.

502
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,203
As soon as this is over,

503
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,499
we'll go where you want.

504
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,378
Wherever that is.

505
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,824
Hello?

506
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:54,910
Coming.

507
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,790
Hello.

508
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,750
The fees are over there.

509
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,387
Lee Ro-eum…

510
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,348
Are you Lee Ro-eum?

511
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,854
I'm Mo Jae-in, a psychiatrist.

512
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,940
I know about you.

513
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,448
What bullshit
are you here to talk about now?

514
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,662
I'm warning you,

515
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,374
you won't be able to convince me.

516
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,087
You said you've been
digging into the pyramid scheme

517
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,257
for five years and fought alone,

518
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,469
all for Ho-jung's sake.

519
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,263
I told you. It was all pointless.

520
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,184
Think about whether killing Ma Kang-su
is to get revenge for your daughter

521
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,521
or whether it's to let out your rage.

522
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,233
Killing him won't change a thing.

523
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,487
If you really want revenge for her,

524
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,949
we have to make everyone involved
in her death pay for their crimes.

525
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,952
We need your help

526
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,372
so you should use us too.

527
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,958
We'll help you

528
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,169
so that everyone
who drove her to her death

529
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,712
can be punished accordingly.

530
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,346
An apology?

531
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,393
Now that I know
what happened after the study,

532
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,604
I can't justify my actions
saying I didn't know about it.

533
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,732
Whatever the reason,
I was part of the process.

534
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,444
You don't have to accept my apology.

535
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,364
But,

536
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,909
I would like to apologize to the others
as well if I get the opportunity.

537
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,078
Seems like apologizes are going around.

538
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,831
All right.

539
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,128
That means you can go.

540
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,341
I may not be a very good doctor,

541
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,886
but I'd like to offer my help if you like.

542
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,521
Give me a call.

543
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,571
I hope that the therapy
you received back then at the foundation

544
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,157
is not your only experience with therapy.

545
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,330
Do you think we need therapy?

546
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,540
You can just come and swear at me
if you want to.

547
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,849
PSYCHIATRIST MO JAE-IN

548
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,566
Hey, Su-ho. Over here.

549
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,660
How have you been?

550
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,289
You showed up just as I was about to
put out a BOLO for you.

551
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,834
Did you hear about the heartwarming story

552
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,296
where I rushed over to the hotel

553
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,799
trying to save you and…

554
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,801
Now that you've seen me, can I go now?

555
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,513
I know everything.

556
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,139
About your life story.

557
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,184
Have a seat.

558
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,066
I'm on the same side with Ro-eum now.

559
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,487
Well, I'm not anymore.

560
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,530
Not with Ro-eum.

561
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,827
And why do you think that?

562
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,623
The longer your absence becomes,
the less they'll need you.

563
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,959
Hesitating will only make things
more awkward.

564
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,225
Come on in.

565
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:29,977
Hello.

566
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:31,728
This way.

567
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,570
Have a seat over here.

568
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,496
I'll get you some tea.

569
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,833
How did you persuade him?

570
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,835
Intimidation.

571
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,886
Stock manipulation requires a large team

572
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,388
of brokers, planners, and buyers,

573
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:10,142
which Ma Kang-su has plenty of
but he needs one more thing.

574
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,853
A new researcher to bring up stock prices.

575
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:16,690
Biotech is a new field
for Ma Kang-su as well,

576
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,569
and he'll want someone
who is moderately corrupt, and vain.

577
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,572
In a word, someone who has done everything

578
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,949
and is willing to do anything for money.

579
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:30,454
Someone who has plausible tech
and a degree worth touting.

580
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,708
Meet bioengineer, Lee Jung-bae.

581
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,002
As you know…

582
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,837
NAVIS WELL-BEING BALANCE SHEET

583
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:45,010
If you take a look at the graph,
it's the typical MO of stock manipulators.

584
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,647
Yes, this is Dr. Lee Jung-bae's phone.

585
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,651
Yes, I'll give him the message.
Send the details by e-mail.

586
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,946
They want to meet?

587
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,740
Yes, they'll set the date.

588
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,450
Okay.

589
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,661
Okay, okay.

590
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,835
Our coaching ends here.

591
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,838
Don't get nervous
and just follow the plan.

592
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,263
And don't talk casually.

593
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,222
Okay?

594
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,901
I'm Lee Jung-bae.

595
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,445
Wow.

596
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,991
Doctor, you have expensive taste.

597
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,993
I tend to buy clothes
even if it means going hungry.

598
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,203
I prefer to look polished the older I get.

599
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,832
Okay.

600
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,792
I'm Ma Kang-su.

601
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,336
I'm sorry I haven't made
a business card yet.

602
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,512
Doctor,

603
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,180
Han Moo-young is here.

604
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,021
How have you been?

605
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,064
Good.

606
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,441
Do you have time?

607
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,444
Should we go for some coffee?

608
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,282
I heard you met Ro-eum.

609
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,242
It must've been sudden for her.

610
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,870
I was just about to regret

611
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,538
suddenly showing up like that.

612
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,708
Her reaction wasn't that bad, considering.

613
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,835
Oh, really?

614
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:42,919
Yes.

615
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,884
I'm sorry for missing all our sessions.

616
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,010
Well,

617
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,763
that's entirely up to you.

618
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,473
I was a little worried,

619
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,225
but you look more at ease now

620
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,269
than during our sessions.

621
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,771
I have you to thank for that.

622
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,066
Thank you for saying that.

623
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,863
I believed

624
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,116
that you would find a way forward
no matter what.

625
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,452
Because you're brave

626
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:16,912
and strong.

627
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,624
I just wanted to

628
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,793
help lessen your pain.

629
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,088
My treatment method may have seemed

630
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,131
a little drastic from your perspective.

631
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,593
I know you did the best you could for me.

632
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,973
Now I just…

633
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,936
want to become a better doctor.

634
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,562
I have you to thank for that.

635
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,899
Thank you for saying that.

636
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,863
I'm still a terrible lawyer,

637
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,992
but I'm with people I want to help.

638
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,203
Then that makes you a pretty good lawyer.

639
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,246
Actually…

640
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,623
I was suspended though.

641
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,920
I'll be rooting for you.

642
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,506
As for our sessions…

643
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,384
I bought you coffee today
with my own money.

644
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,596
That means we're no longer
doctor and patient.

645
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,307
Our sessions

646
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,518
end as of today.

647
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,479
You did well

648
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,857
for the past three years,

649
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,899
Han Moo-young.

650
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,069
Thank you.

651
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:38,910
Where is he?

652
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,912
He's waiting inside.

653
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,378
Su-ho.

654
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,550
ATTORNEY HAN MOO-YOUNG

655
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,850
Wait, hang on.

656
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,571
Hey.

657
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,241
Come on in.

658
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,879
Come on. Don't just stand there.

659
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,969
What do you think you're doing?

660
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:39,888
Ro-eum.

661
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,641
Just hear him out first.

662
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,562
I thought you were dead somewhere

663
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,855
but here you are, alive.

664
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,440
Why would I be dead?

665
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,609
No one shot at me other than you!

666
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:54,528
Su-ho!

667
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:57,864
So?

668
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,783
You want me to shoot you again?

669
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,701
Why, you little…

670
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,037
What did I ever to do you? Huh?

671
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,456
What did I do? Tell me!

672
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:07,958
Na-sa.

673
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,960
Don't try to stop me.

674
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,003
Are you seriously taking her side?

675
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,256
There's no such thing as sides right now.

676
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,884
I told you to wait, didn't I?

677
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,679
I told you to wait,
but you're the one who came anyway.

678
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,806
Everything would've been fine
if you had stayed where you were.

679
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,307
You're the one who ruined everything!

680
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,142
How dumb can you get?

681
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,060
What?

682
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:30,021
Why would I wait
on someone I don't even trust?

683
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,482
Ringo got hurt because of you.

684
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,484
While you were acting like a petty thief.

685
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,615
Wow, you're talking as if
you were really worried.

686
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,908
People might think

687
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,912
you actually care about Ringo.

688
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,247
But we all know

689
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,165
you have no feelings.

690
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,125
Na-sa.

691
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,044
Stop looking at me like I'm trash.

692
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:56,840
Don't you guys have any pride?
Why are you helping someone like her?

693
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:00,135
Is she treating you like a pet
instead of just street dogs now?

694
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:04,639
Or is she going to erase all the threats
and insults from your brain?

695
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,475
Or is she paying you a lot?

696
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,481
Get him out of here,
or I'll be the one who walks out.

697
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,734
I'll be the one leaving
to avoid your shit.

698
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,826
Na-sa.

699
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,412
I must've been crazy to come here.

700
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,496
Darn it!

701
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,665
Come back inside.

702
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,125
Hey.

703
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,753
You just saw what happened
and you want me to go back in?

704
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,504
Did your brain get fried or what?

705
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,548
Just try to talk it out.
Don't be like this.

706
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,176
Damn it!

707
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,678
Shit.

708
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,265
She thinks she's above us all.

709
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,850
She always has to be right.

710
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,103
It's going to take time
for her to get over it.

711
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,229
But if you talk--

712
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,147
Hey.

713
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,233
How do you expect me to trust her?

714
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,194
Would you? Huh?

715
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,071
Do you trust her?

716
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,240
Do you trust her
because you have a clear conscience?

717
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,662
I'm more afraid of her than Red Eye.

718
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,248
I didn't do anything to Red Eye,
but I did to Ro-eum.

719
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,541
Twice at that.

720
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,460
Then apologize to her for that.

721
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,965
You shouldn't trust her too much either.

722
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,425
Don't end up crying
after she stabs you in the back.

723
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,930
I'm going back to them.

724
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,306
Na-sa.

725
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,684
I won't tell them about your meetings,

726
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,727
so be careful.

727
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,313
And don't call me again.

728
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,816
It only puts me in more danger.

729
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:47,993
Da-jeong.

730
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,453
Where's Na-sa?

731
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,290
Why does it always have to be so obvious?

732
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,711
Why can't people who were hurt in the past

733
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,880
or did the hurting

734
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,466
just let it go

735
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:05,802
and live their lives

736
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,513
and just move on?

737
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,600
Why does it have to still show

738
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,272
making everyone's lives hell?

739
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,405
I'm not sure if this will work.

740
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:29,117
I feel so helpless.

741
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,663
Nothing has gotten better.

742
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,876
And I don't think it will.

743
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,486
Yeon Tae-hun got in.

744
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,904
He's starting work in two days.

745
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,410
What are you doing?

746
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,451
What are you looking at? Don't look.

747
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,912
You finally stopped talking so formally.

748
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,379
Aren't you going to make up with Su-ho?

749
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:08,299
You want me to tell you
what he's up to these days?

750
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,260
I mean,

751
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,846
we're all on the same side now.

752
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,390
But Su-ho's auto repair shop
is still closed,

753
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,600
Mr. Han seems too busy to call,

754
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,562
and you didn't even report in
when you got back.

755
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:21,479
I did.

756
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,606
Just now.

757
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,484
That's because I was about
to show up on your doorstep.

758
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,195
I want us to be in closer contact.

759
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,781
I might report something else you know.

760
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,409
You know that's not what I meant.

761
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:48,131
By the way,
did you get a visit from a psychiatrist?

762
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,303
How did you know about that?

763
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,263
Don't get me started.

764
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,932
Talk about six degrees of separation.

765
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:58,892
Oh.

766
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,437
Right.

767
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,190
Professor Shin's son and student.

768
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,359
Still, she wanted to apologize

769
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,278
and take responsibility.

770
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,947
You didn't punch her, did you?

771
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,076
She offered to provide therapy.

772
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,538
Did you know
that as your probation officer,

773
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,458
I could advise you to get therapy?

774
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,467
Anyway, just think about it.

775
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,387
It'd be nice for broken people

776
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,681
to support each other.

777
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,662
Your father

778
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,664
waited for two whole hours.

779
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,042
Is it that hard for you
to see your father?

780
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:08,753
I'm sorry.

781
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,838
Let's set another date.

782
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,216
I'll be in touch.

783
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,093
Wait, Moo-young.

784
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,136
I'm sorry.

785
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,455
DIRECTOR OF NAVIS WELL-BEING
JANG KYUNG-JA

786
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:18,865
What are you doing?

787
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,371
It'd be nice for broken people

788
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,832
to support each other.

789
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,196
Oh, I remember.

790
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,407
What was your name again?

791
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,453
It's Su-ho.

792
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,246
Na Su-ho.

793
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,415
Right, Su-ho.

794
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,294
If you take me in,
I'll work really hard for you.

795
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,296
Good.

796
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,298
But first,

797
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,884
I need you tell me.

798
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,806
What was Lee Ro-eum
trying to steal from Kyung-ja?

799
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,361
Ro-eum.

800
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,488
Hey.

801
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,119
What's going on?

802
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,620
I have someone I want you to meet.

803
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,705
Who?

804
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,748
Someone who'll be helping us.

805
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,668
Say hello.

806
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:56,295
This is Jay.

807
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,179
We meet again.

808
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,049
From now on,

809
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,760
you won't be the one talking to that man.

810
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,094
Why don't you like me?

811
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,471
Do I have to like you?

812
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:49,348
I don't want you to see her.
There's no knowing what I'll do to her.

813
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,808
I wish you'd bring him in.

814
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,643
Not Jay. Na-sa.

815
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,563
You're not that kid anymore.
If they beat you, bite them back at least.

816
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,566
Don't you realize that people are willing
to be in this together with you?

817
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,151
It's fantasy, not empathy.

818
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:01,986
And it's delusion, not feelings.

819
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,404
No wonder it's an illness.

820
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,449
But the person who will
help you until the very end is me,

821
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:07,492
not Jay.
