1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,517
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,770
SURPRISE 100

3
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,691
Yes, Lee Ro-eum

4
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,568
has perfectly memorized

5
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,654
the information
of nine random participants

6
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,281
among the 100.

7
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,616
-That's right.
-Yes.

8
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,034
Now, for the last one.

9
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,036
What is the last number?

10
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,496
What is it?

11
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,166
It's number 25.

12
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,168
Will you please stand up?

13
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,964
The last number is 25.

14
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:34,219
Ro-eum, can you tell us about
number 25?

15
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,615
She must be nervous.

16
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,700
It's perfectly understandable.

17
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,244
Number 25, the young man

18
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,995
is very handsome.

19
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,413
You're right.

20
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,417
But you can always
meet up with him afterward.

21
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,627
Yes.

22
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,589
Ro-eum, please
recite his information.

23
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,423
Let's take a short break.

24
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,049
Stop rolling.

25
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,687
Come over here a sec.

26
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,274
Here, have some water.

27
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,984
What's wrong?

28
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,527
Pull it together, okay?

29
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,364
She must be nervous.

30
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,657
I feel sorry for her.

31
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,868
I'm sure it's all rigged.

32
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,120
It's not.

33
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,331
Whether it is or not,

34
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,125
her parents have all the luck.

35
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,628
Think about all the money
they'll be raking in.

36
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,838
Life is so unfair…

37
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,468
They just got a kid like that
by pure chance.

38
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,888
I wonder what our son will be
when he grows up?

39
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,433
Moo-young, drink this.

40
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,813
-You can do it, right?
-Look at me. Look.

41
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,318
I'm Lee Ro-eum's lawyer,
Han Moo-young.

42
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,612
Return the bag to her.

43
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,113
Then,

44
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,283
here are your precious client's
precious personal effects.

45
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,871
Then, see you tomorrow,
same time.

46
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,789
Oh,

47
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,582
and that caddy job.

48
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,126
Don't forget to sign
an employment contract,

49
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,336
and report back to me.

50
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,182
You can use a kiosk now?

51
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,350
Hmm.

52
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,852
It's not that hard.

53
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,855
Where did you
get the money from?

54
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,106
I earned it.

55
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,108
-When?
-Today.

56
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,527
If you committed a crime,

57
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,113
you have to tell me so that I can help.

58
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,284
I earned it legally.

59
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,747
Okay then.

60
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,749
Let's talk about the lawsuit.

61
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,626
That's it?

62
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,796
If an attorney doesn't believe
in his client, who will?

63
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,216
I should at least believe in you
more than the probation officer does.

64
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,637
Take a look.

65
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,390
If everything is in order, I'll file it.

66
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,358
COMPLAINT

67
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,327
PREPARATORY DOCUMENT

68
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,097
February 14 2012,

69
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,390
an out-of-use camping site in Geumseong.

70
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,144
At the site, two burnt bodies
were discovered,

71
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,190
along with a 19-year-old girl
with traces of arson all over her.

72
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,944
The girl confessed,
saying she killed her parents

73
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,905
and burned the place down
to destroy evidence.

74
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,408
However, while bullets
were found on the bodies,

75
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,410
the firearm was never found.

76
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,374
A local newspaper in Moran reported that

77
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,917
the girl was

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,586
the genius Lee Ro-eum
from the early 2000s

79
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,421
so on the day of the on-site inspection,

80
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,174
there was public outcry
against the girl.

81
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,968
GASOLINE

82
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,430
The girl who once garnered attention
for her gifted talent of memorizing

83
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,975
gained attention
once more after 10 years

84
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,978
for murdering her parents.

85
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,646
She committed arson…

86
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,189
But the fact that victims had

87
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,650
no connection
to the scene of the crime,

88
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,069
and that there was no sign

89
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,739
at their home of a daughter
living there remained as a question.

90
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,284
However, no one bothered
to dig any deeper.

91
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,078
After being educated
at an alternative middle school

92
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,831
run by a foundation
that is now long gone,

93
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,501
no one knows where she lived
or where she was educated,

94
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,920
or why she committed the murders.

95
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,548
Lee Ro-eun made no excuses
or bothered to defend herself,

96
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,008
and refused to say a single word.

97
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,512
And so she received the maximum sentence
as a juvenile,

98
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,014
and went to prison.

99
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,817
For ten years until

100
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,195
the real killer showed up.

101
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,549
Hello?

102
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,929
I'm out.

103
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,350
Oh, how do you feel?

104
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,367
Why do you insist on coming
to the probation office?

105
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,993
I could go to you.

106
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,706
What about the employment contract?

107
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,832
You didn't bring it?

108
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,918
I quit

109
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:04,835
the caddy job.

110
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,255
Yeah.

111
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,131
There are lot of rude jerks
on the field.

112
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,717
Some hit on you
and some are just ass…

113
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,177
Where are you going?

114
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,096
It's lunch time.

115
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,098
Have a meal before you go.

116
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,642
Don't worry.

117
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,103
I won't ask you to pay with the money
you earned folding boxes in prison.

118
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,688
I know you're in a tough spot.

119
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,484
Are you interested in me?

120
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,238
No.

121
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,990
You're not my type.

122
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,533
I like woman who are cute.

123
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,372
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings…

124
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,331
Sorry!

125
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,500
See you tomorrow!

126
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,712
Humph.

127
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,132
Geez.

128
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,551
Kang Byeong-tae is late.

129
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,763
If he doesn't come to me,
I'll just go to him.

130
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,182
Oof.

131
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,392
Ugh.

132
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,061
Can you clean this up for me?
Sorry.

133
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,229
Sure.

134
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,201
Thank you.

135
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,714
You were right.Z

136
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:33,883
About what?

137
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,259
About Ye Chung-sik.

138
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,053
Someone sent him the maximum
amount of commissary money.

139
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,262
But he was homeless.

140
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,349
Do you believe

141
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,601
we really put the right person in prison

142
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,561
and got the right person out?

143
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,147
Have you thought about that?

144
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,150
Yes.

145
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,531
Yes, you've thought about it
or yes, we got the right guy?

146
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,204
SEOYOUNG STUDY ROOM

147
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,960
I have something I want to say to you.

148
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,630
About what?

149
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,884
First of all, let's put your legally
earned money in the bank.

150
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,481
If you deposit more than
100,000 dollars in cash all at once,

151
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,858
it could be flagged by the KoFIU.

152
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,070
If it doesn't matter to you,
you can deposit it all.

153
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,367
What are you trying to say?

154
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,621
We'd like to deposit this.

155
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,539
Of course.

156
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,542
I just wanted to say
that I had something to say to you.

157
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,839
You need a cell phone so that I can
get in touch when I need to.

158
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,467
Getting a phone is a pain.

159
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,762
My probation officer.

160
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,601
Then let's make sure
he doesn't find out.

161
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,438
We'd like to take a look
at this one and this one.

162
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,655
That's really all you want?

163
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,323
It's 3 p.m. and it's your first meal.

164
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,492
Thank you.

165
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,619
You're eating a lot.

166
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,497
Who said you could start
talking casually?

167
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,543
Here.

168
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,425
Who's the real killer?

169
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,725
Why can't you answer me?

170
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,936
I gave up on Ye Chung-sik's defense

171
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,855
believing that you were just a witness,

172
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,315
not a murderer.

173
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,276
You said you believed me.
Why are you asking?

174
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,528
You never actually told me.

175
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,786
I do believe that you were
lonely and scared.

176
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,085
Eat up.

177
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,022
LEE RO-EUM
HAN MOO-YOUNG

178
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,884
Boo!

179
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,598
Oops.

180
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,267
My bad.

181
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,935
I shouldn't have scared

182
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,895
someone who stabs people
in the neck with chopsticks.

183
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,441
I've heard a few stories.

184
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,743
Cell phone.

185
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,161
Did you get one?

186
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,079
No.

187
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,289
Good.

188
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,957
Let's go buy one right now.

189
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,751
Do you have a lot of time on your hands?

190
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,796
Don't probation officers
in our country have to oversee

191
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,423
120 criminals each?

192
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,134
How do you know that?

193
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,677
Did you look that up too?

194
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,929
What did you
look it up with?

195
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,222
A smart phone?

196
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,393
You have to tell me if you have one.

197
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,234
-Number.
-010-849-9252.

198
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,574
Yes, this is Go Yo-han.

199
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,951
Now that you've seen my face, scram.

200
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,413
That's verbal abuse.

201
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm your probation officer!

202
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,125
Lee Ro-eum!

203
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,501
See you tomorrow!

204
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,723
Yeah.

205
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,516
I have a number for you.

206
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,476
Track it.

207
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,515
GO YO-HAN

208
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,059
A probation officer.

209
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,593
THE PROBATION OFFICERS' APP
HAS BEEN UPDATED

210
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,804
SOUTH KOREA
PROBATION

211
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,849
ENABLE LOCATION TRACKING?

212
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,769
ALLOW

213
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,119
What is it that you want?

214
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,537
Put a tail on him.

215
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,665
I want dirt on his private life,
his weaknesses, legal trouble,

216
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,167
anything you can get.

217
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,461
What exactly did he do to you?

218
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,380
Is he someone
we can mess with?

219
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,050
He's just…

220
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,885
Someone.

221
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,518
So you're saying

222
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,938
it was suspicious from the beginning.

223
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,941
There was time to check the wallet,

224
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,443
and you looked through his pockets
and cell phone,

225
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,487
but he didn't have any money
to pay after eating all the food?

226
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,073
Yup, I get
what you're saying. I'm with you,

227
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,993
but here's the thing.
You basically just dined and dashed.

228
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:58,952
So,

229
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,413
the spot where you fell over
after being pushed,

230
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,706
was it inside the store?

231
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,792
Or outside?

232
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,794
Do you remember who pushed you?

233
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,089
Like I said before,

234
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,048
-I was pushed…
-It was intentional.

235
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,257
I think he's crazy.

236
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,301
-Why am I even here?
-He ate three dishes!

237
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,260
He nodded!

238
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,012
Ringo, come on out.

239
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,055
But I need him too.

240
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,348
It's an easy one this time.

241
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,265
Chinese.

242
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,482
Shut up!

243
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,236
Ha…

244
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,659
Anyone, anywhere, anything you want.

245
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,577
This is To-Do Call Center, Ring…

246
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,079
Oh, Da-jeong.

247
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,914
I'm on my way now.

248
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,877
I'll text you on what they said.
She's injured so take her to the hospital.

249
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,171
And you need to check the CCTV
for the store.

250
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,353
SELL YOUR USED ITEM

251
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,952
Hello.

252
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,621
I'll kneel if you want me to.

253
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,956
Ow.

254
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,082
That hurts.

255
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,126
You just got out of prison.

256
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,046
Do you want to go back?

257
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,465
Oh, Kang Byeong-tae?

258
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,804
He's staying out of trouble
and going straight.

259
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,015
I've seen it with my own two eyes.

260
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,725
Yes.

261
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,229
-Byeong-tae.
-Yes?

262
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,606
Hurry up.

263
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,982
What's taking so long?

264
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,108
Got it.

265
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,209
What's troubling you?

266
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,586
It's either one or the other.

267
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,714
Either Ye Chung-sik killed them
or Lee Ro-eum killed them.

268
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,258
Why are there only two options?
There could be a third party.

269
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,928
That would be really bad.

270
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,054
You're right.

271
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,725
I warned you

272
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,518
that I play dirty.

273
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,811
You're the one

274
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,939
who forced me into this.

275
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,273
And you told everyone

276
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,360
about your deal with me
over drinks with your team.

277
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,364
And you dragged that reporter
Woo Young-gi into it as well.

278
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,575
So don't try to get out of this.

279
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,286
It was the kind
they serve at the Blue House!

280
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,706
Oh yeah.

281
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,209
I just learned something interesting

282
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,086
called the Red Eye kid.

283
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,088
Red Eye Kid?

284
00:20:56,171 --> 00:21:00,175
You said Lee Ro-eum went to
an alternative school.

285
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,552
The school's foundation
was called Red Eye.

286
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,554
It was founded during the IMF

287
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,140
and one of their scholarship students

288
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,892
was Lee Ro-eum.

289
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,187
They provided the full package,
housing and tuition.

290
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,482
So that's why there was no sign
of her living at home.

291
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,109
She was taken by the foundation.

292
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,569
What do you mean, "taken."

293
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,113
She got a scholarship.

294
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,950
What on earth
did the investigation team do?

295
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,494
A teenage girl was accused
of murdering her parents,

296
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,163
and no one cared where she lived
or went to school?

297
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,960
Looks like you'll make
a good case this time.

298
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,420
And not betray your client.

299
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,631
So, uh,

300
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,841
let's go over this.

301
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:44,094
If Ye Chung-sik is the real killer,
we did the right thing.

302
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,680
-But if Lee Ro-eum is the killer…
-She's not.

303
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,309
Geez, you're siding with your client?

304
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,060
How can you be sure?

305
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,980
The problem is if there's a third party.

306
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,900
Then dig into Ro-eum.

307
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,070
If she knows who did it
why wouldn't she say anything?

308
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,990
She's a free woman now
so won't she make a move?

309
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,079
You only got one tuna mayo?

310
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,457
Geez.

311
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,921
RED EYE KID

312
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,425
NO RESULT.

00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,285

HAN MOO-YOUNG

322
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,909
Hello, Attorney Han who'll soon be
on the front page.

323
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,250
Yes, that's our paper.

324
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,167
WOO YOUNG-GI

325
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,711
LEE RO-EUM, THE 'IQ 180' GENIUS GIRL
FROM SURPRISE 100,

326
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,463
IS SPONSORED BY RED EYE FOUNDATION

327
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,469
LEE RO-EUM IS SELECTED AS 'RED EYE KID'
FOR THE TALENT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

328
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,732
I was almost murdered by the person
in the room next to mine.

329
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,234
Because the bell rang.

330
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,111
Shall we walk a little?

331
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,864
Walk at 11:30 p.m. in this cold?

332
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,995
I've been going to bed at 9:30 p.m.
for ten years now.

333
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,997
Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,498
Do you want to wear this at least?

335
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,585
Are you wearing something underneath?

336
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,502
Yes.

337
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,546
Never mind then.

338
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,602
I said I wasn't hungry.

339
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,979
You're really not going to eat anything?

340
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,106
Like I said, I've been going to bed
at 9:30 p.m.

341
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,232
for ten years.

342
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,489
What?

343
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,159
Anything more you want to know?

344
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,204
I just wanted to see you.

345
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,625
I didn't expect to say this twice

346
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,543
in a single week.

347
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,004
Are you interested in me?

348
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,673
Yes.

349
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,133
That's why I'm here.

350
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,638
Ro-eum.

351
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,058
Did you kill them?

352
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,313
No.

353
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,940
Then why did you confess?

354
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,733
Instead of turning Ye Chung-sik in?

355
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,319
Is this about your fee?

356
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,488
It's about the truth.

357
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,950
You're hiding the truth

358
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,952
and I want to know what it is.

359
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,371
Truth?

360
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,166
Ten years ago,
you gave up on your life

361
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,334
for a reason,

362
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,045
and I want to know why.

363
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,382
You said it was an illness.

364
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,592
When you brought me new clothes.

365
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,928
What kind of illness is it?

366
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,723
Hyper-empathy syndrome.

367
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,768
Hyper-empathy syndrome?

368
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,981
It's being
excessively empathetic.

369
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,983
What does that mean?

370
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,278
When I empathize
with someone's pain or sadness,

371
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,072
I hurt with them, a little too much.

372
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,034
I'm getting treated for it,
and taking medication.

373
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,329
Oh… Okay.

374
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,581
But you knew that.

375
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,916
I didn't.

376
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,921
You may not have known
what it was called exactly,

377
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,924
but you knew that I was excessively
immersed in your case

378
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,426
and felt too much sympathy for you.

379
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,054
That's why you hired me
to be your attorney,

380
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,515
and regardless of the fee, or the truth,

381
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,477
you believed that I would
stand on your side until the end.

382
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,650
A court date has been set.

383
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,945
Ro-eum,

384
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,574
do you trust me?

385
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,166
Then count on my illness at least.

386
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,793
Because of it, I'll be on your side
no matter what.

387
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,690
How have you been?

388
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,275
Just great, thanks to you.

389
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,363
What are you doing here?

390
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,157
What?

391
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,200
You haven't screwed me over enough yet?

392
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,827
Ye Chung-sik.

393
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,245
What?

394
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,539
Did you really murder the couple?

395
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,334
Are you messing with me?

396
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,045
At the scene, there was Ro-eum, you,

397
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,882
and the two victims.

398
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,008
That was all?

399
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,676
You bastard.

400
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,470
Where did you get
the commissary money?

401
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,805
From what I know,
you owe a hefty sum to loan sharks.

402
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,141
What is it to you?

403
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,646
Did you work this hard
when you were supposed to defend me?

404
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,191
No, you recorded me like a rat.

405
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,443
You're the one that put me in here!

406
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,531
I'm not here for you.

407
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,494
I'm Lee Ro-eum's attorney now.

408
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,413
She's suing the state for compensation.

409
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,708
She wrongfully spent time in prison,

410
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,544
and it was a huge case that was even
reported by the foreign press,

411
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,006
so she'll win the case now
that the real killer has been caught.

412
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,054
Do you know how much
the amount of compensation will be?

413
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,184
Let's calculate her time served
with minimum wage.

414
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,478
She served ten years,

415
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,065
so that would roughly be about
229,732 dollars.

416
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,901
That's the minimum.

417
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,904
She's making a claim of one million.

418
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,783
Lee Ro-eum

419
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,244
will get a mill-million dollars?

420
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,122
Do you think it's worth it?

421
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,001
How much time
will you serve?

422
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,129
Currently, you are 53.

423
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,882
The average life expectancy
of males is 79.3.

424
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,220
You have at least 30 years left
on your sentence.

425
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,137
Damn it.

426
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,057
You have to spend your life
depending on money someone sends you

427
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,560
and who knows when the money
will dry up?

428
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,646
Besides, you can only buy snacks
or underwear with that

429
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,939
trapped inside these walls.

430
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,358
Do you think you'll get out on appeal?

431
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,862
The entire country heard the recording

432
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,239
where you showed no regret or guilt.

433
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,576
If a killer who used a weapon

434
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,536
wants a reduced sentence in an appeal,

435
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,206
they must come clean
about any accomplices, if any.

436
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,130
If that's not the case, I'll be able to
sleep in peace from now on.

437
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,300
Since the person who deserves to be
in prison is behind bars.

438
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,554
People don't care about
forgotten cases

439
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,973
unless there is something
sensational about it.

440
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,977
This is your last chance

441
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,813
if you want to get any attention.

442
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,690
And if there was someone else?

443
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,652
She'll kill them anyway.

444
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,291
You know the story about the man
who traded up a paperclip for a house?

445
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,211
He traded the paperclip for a pen,
the pen for doorknob,

446
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,380
and later a house.

447
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,714
This is my paperclip.

448
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,094
-Park Ji-su.
-Excuse me?

449
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,137
Consultant, Park Ji-su.

450
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,224
I'm here to meet Professor Lee Jin-ho.

451
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,184
Professor Lee Jin-ho?

452
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,103
What is this about?

453
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,565
He asked for a consult

454
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,360
for the hospice seminar in October.

455
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,153
You didn't get the message?

456
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,489
I'm sorry, I didn't.

457
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,741
I'll give him a call…

458
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,284
Wow…

459
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:19,080
The communication here so inefficient.

460
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,458
I flew in from Illinois at 3 a.m.

461
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:26,379
broke a heel because
of the awful floor tiles here,

462
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,632
and now you want me to wait in the lobby

463
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,011
because a receptionist failed
to get a message?

464
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,930
Do you know how many consults
I canceled

465
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,307
just to come all the way here?

466
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,351
I'm sorry.

467
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,269
But…

468
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,689
How can this happen at a hospice
that received an award

469
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,275
from the Ministry of Health and Welfare?

470
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,487
I'm terribly sorry.

471
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,282
Why don't I help you?

472
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,616
Hmm…

473
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,079
First, go after the low level staff.

474
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,081
Not only is it easy,

475
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:06,085
but you can use their dynamics
with the boss you'll eventually face.

476
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,295
She's scared.

477
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,337
She's calm.

478
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,882
She'll try to regain her composure

479
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,926
while she tries to maintain it.

480
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,596
There's a difference in their rank

481
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,556
so they'll be wary of each other,

482
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,392
clouding the actual issue.

483
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,520
What's your position here?

484
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,730
I'm a manager.

485
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,034
Park Su-yeon, Lee Ji-su.

486
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,495
GO YO-HAN - WHY DID YOU CALL ME?
RIGHT, THE NUMBER EXCHANGE

487
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,207
Let me

488
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,375
say this one more time.

489
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,338
I have a meeting
with Professor Lee Jin-ho.

490
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,850
VIP ACCESS CARD

491
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,268
Are you looking at it?

492
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,311
Yes.

493
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,231
This Shin Gi-ho…
Before he was fired as professor,

494
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,733
he worked at Red Eye Foundation.

495
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,569
He was one of the directors.

496
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,490
Right now, he's being cared for

497
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,491
at a hospice.

498
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,284
I don't think he has much time to live.

499
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,870
He was the easiest person to track

500
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,413
among the Red Eye directors.

501
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,998
As for the rest,

502
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,918
I'll have to do some serious digging.

503
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,879
There are a lot of gaps.

504
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,548
I smell something fishy.

505
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,258
Thank you.

506
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,551
I'll be in touch.

507
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,765
If she knows who did it
why wouldn't she say anything?

508
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,892
Fraudulent, impulsive, hostile,

509
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,687
aggressive, reckless, no conscious.

510
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,729
Clean your plate.

511
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,025
She'll kill them anyway.

The phone has been turned off.
Please leave a message…

520
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,287
Hello?

521
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,830
Mr. Go Yo-han?

522
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,166
Yes, this is he.

523
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,751
I'm Han Moo-young.

524
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,961
Lee Ro-eum's attorney.

525
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,754
Yes, so?

526
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,465
Have you been in touch with her today?

527
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,052
Ha… I know you sense some sort
of chemistry between us,

528
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,138
but our relationship
is purely professional.

529
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,475
When is the last time
you talked to her?

530
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,643
Yesterday.

531
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,563
We're supposed to meet this afternoon
but she's ignoring me and my texts.

532

OUR LOCATION

533

Do I

534
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,409
have to be worried right now?

535
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,369
-No.
-Yeah, right.

537
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,540
I'm getting the feeling
that you and I

538
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,376
have to go save her.

539
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,297
Okay, let's do it then.

540
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,301
Like the Goblin and the Grim Reaper.
We'll go and free Ro-eum

541
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,011
from the grips of evil.

542
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,887
I get dibs on the Goblin.

543
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,984
MEDICAL CHART

544
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,492
HIGH-RISK MEDICATION SAFE PASSWORD

545
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,873
After administering the medicine,

546
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,125
make sure to put it on the chart.

547
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,460
I will.

548
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,800
HIGH-RISK MEDICATION SAFE PASSWORD

549
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,615
Hi,

550
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,867
among the visitors today…

551
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,039
I'll be sending you a photo.

552
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,793
If you don't mind, can you just check
if that person visited today or not?

553
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,587
Yes, she did.

554
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,632
I'm not at liberty to say anything else,

555
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,593
but all visitors must pass through
the lobby to exit the building,

556
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,345
so she'll still be on the premises.

557
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,763
Okay, thank you.

558
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,814
Hi, I sent you the photo.

559
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,149
The woman is still here, right?

560
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,359
Oh, yes…

561
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,445
She's definitely here.

562
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,531
She left quite an impression.

563
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,410
She went to the VIP ward, didn't she?
Would it be all right if I go and check?

564
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,329
I'm sorry,
but visiting hours are over and…

565
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,050
Excuse me! Excuse me!

566
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,099
You should thank Ye Chung-sik.

567
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,686
I got to him before you.

568
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,730
Where's the photo?

569
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,192
Ro-eum.

570
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,822
The photo.

571
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,329
It's

572
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,123
out of my hands.

573
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,629
Hmm…
You have no one left now.

574
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:55,471
The fact that you sent Ye Chung-sik
commissary money

575
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,933
means that you'd rather die
than go to prison.

576
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,228
It's not so bad though.

577
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,981
There's no way you'd get
the death penalty anyway.

578
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,572
You don't need to do this.

579
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:18,369
I'm already dying.

580
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,507
But you're not dead.

581
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,425
Yet.

582
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,149
What do you think you're doing?

583
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,985
What are you doing here?

584
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,611
This is what you came to do?

585
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,949
You think this is the smart thing to do?

586
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,081
Even if something happens to
a patient at a hospice,

587
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,499
it won't be odd.

588
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,876
So, you're going to kill him?

589
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,595
I'd appreciate it if you leave
before I do.

590
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,722
Put that down.

591
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,407
I thought it was strange

592
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,535
that you didn't even wonder why

593
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,245
Ye Chung-sik killed your parents.

594
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,582
It was because you already knew

595
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,752
why your parents died.

596
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,381
That's why you didn't ask,

597
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,591
or take any interest in it.

598
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,638
Knowing why means you also know
who the real killer is.

599
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,599
If Ye Chung-sik
was the only person involved,

600
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,853
you wouldn't be here
attempting to murder someone.

601
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,317
Is Shin Gi-ho the real killer?

602
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,402
Or,

603
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,362
is he an accomplice?

604
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,616
Tell me.

605
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,994
If what you did here causes a problem,

606
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,622
I will represent you.

607
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:14,128
I hired you to represent my civil case,

608
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,712
not a criminal case.

609
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,092
Sounds like you're telling me to shut up
and just get you your compensation.

610
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,635
Is that what it sounded like?

611
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,971
You're right.

612
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,556
That's exactly what I meant.

613
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,145
I heard what happened
during your time in prison.

614
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,149
What exactly did Red Eye to do you?

615
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,735
What turned you into this?

616
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,291
I've

617
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,295
always been this way.

618
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,048
Red Eye didn't
turn me into anything.

619
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,762
Whatever I did,
you're an accomplice now.

620
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,516
If you don't want to
stand trial as a defendant,

621
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,185
just do your job.

622
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,521
Instead of sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong.

623
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,712
COMPLETED

624
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,604
What about Mr. Han?

625
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,939
No idea.

626
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,649
He's been shut in his office all day.

627
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,943
Leave him alone. He doesn't
have much time before the hearing.

628
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,861
Wow, a million dollars
in compensation.

629
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,321
Haha.

630
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,614
I'm so jealous.

631
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,917
COMPLAINT
ACCUSER - LEE RO-EUM

632
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,216
Boo!

633
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,095
Don't worry.

634
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,097
No chopsticks.

635
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,432
Wow, Ro-eum…

636
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,309
What's going on?

637
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,645
How'd you know where I live?

638
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,105
Hacking.

639
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,232
Being a criminal, I have no scruples.

640
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,817
What is this?

641
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,985
A grudge?

642
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,030
I thought you were the type
that didn't hold grudges.

643
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:51,243
So, what are you
trying to do here?

644
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,122
Actually, I was bored
so I'm glad you came.

645
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,915
Plus, I get to see your face.

646
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:01,336
-Do you want to watch me drink some beer?
-Oh, beer isn't my thing.

647
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,796
I see.

648
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,551
You really do hold a grudge.

649
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,970
You'd be really good
at getting revenge.

650
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,265
Probation officer Go Yo-han

651
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,267
whose job is your entire life.

652
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,685
Yes? What?

653
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,062
Ta-da.

654
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,905
Oh, this?

655
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,909
Wow.

656
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,248
Woah.

657
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,418
If you can look away from

658
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,503
a crime by one of your parolees,

659
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,089
then I'm sure what I do
won't bother you that much.

660
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,841
Wow.

661
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,051
Unbelievable.

662
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,263
The quality is amazing.
Did you use a telephoto lens?

663
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,270
What is it that you want?

664
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,109
Stop bothering me.

665
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:11,657
Don't follow me around,
and don't contact me for no reason.

666
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,408
Don't even ask me to contact you.

667
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,372
I'll report you if you do.

668
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,290
Okay?

669
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,591
I'm still
your probation officer, got that?

670
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,095
Have a little fun and see me
every couple of days.

671
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,097
Okay?

672
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,652
Nervous?

673
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,238
No.

674
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,700
I'm nervous.

675
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,663
It's a case we can't lose.

676
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:02,916
I know.

677
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,294
That's why I'm nervous.

678
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:15,345
Case 2002-Gap-2345
Plaintiff, Lee Ro-eum.

679
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,014
Legal representative, Park&Cue.

680
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,808
Attorney Han Moo-young.

681
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,184
Yes, your honor.

682
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:26,565
Prosecutor Min Seon-min
for the Defendant, ROK.

683
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,524
Yes, your honor.

684
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,777
Plaintiff may state
their complaint.

685
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:35,615
On February 14, 2012,
the plaintiff

686
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,909
was charged for the murder
of her parents

687
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:41,455
and arson that occurred in Geumseong.

688
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:45,250
She received 15 years,
the maximum sentence for a juvenile,

689
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,961
and served her sentence
until September 1 of this year.

690
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,090
The victims of this murder
were her parents,

691
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,509
and the plaintiff was wrongfully accused
of their murders

692
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,220
and served the sentence.

693
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,557
On June 5, 2022,

694
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,643
the real killer Ye,
confessed to the murders

695
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,354
and she was found not guilty
on August 15th.

696
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,691
At the retrial, the plaintiff
was found not guilty…

697
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,946
Quiet down.

698
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,281
Counsellor,

699
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,158
what are you saying?

700
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,037
Are you stating
what is in the complaint?

701
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,289
No.

702
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,542
There's a slight difference
with the complaint.

703
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,085
In the retrial,

704
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,672
it was acknowledged that the plaintiff
was a victim forced to commit arson,

705
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,300
and that she was a witness
to the crime.

706
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,719
However, just because
it was acknowledged

707
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,180
does not mean it is entirely true.

708
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,723
What?

709
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,060
The perpetrator's appeal
regarding the Geuseong murders

710
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,728
is still ongoing.

711
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,231
If there is still more to the truth
that needs to be clarified,

712
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,233
I believe it will soon come to light.

713
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:53,318
That is not for you to judge

714
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,321
in this current trial.

715
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,032
Without the retrial,
there would be no suit for damages.

716
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,159
The perpetrator's appeal

717
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,411
is ongoing as part of the retrial,

718
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,205
and therefore,

719
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,333
until the plaintiff's acquittal
is confirmed,

720
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,378
or until the plaintiff's
original sentence expires,

721
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,130
we ask that you postpone this hearing.

722
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,883
Is he insane?

723
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,476
Wow, he's a wacko.

724
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,104
Order in the court.

725
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,148
Counselor.

726
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,609
You could have consulted
with your client,

727
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,863
and filed the complaint
at a later time.

728
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,198
I apologize.

729
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:44,202
The hearing at this court today
has been transcribed,

730
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,873
and may weigh against you
in future proceedings.

731
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,833
Do you understand?

732
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,251
Yes.

733
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,920
Then,

734
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,881
this hearing will be postponed.

735
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,340
Attorney Han.

736
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,508
Prosecutor Min.

737
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,260
Come see me in my chambers.

738
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,775
You told me to count on
your illness.

739
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,111
You said you'd be on my side.

740
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,198
This is my way of being on your side.

741
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,208
They are pros

742
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,752
at manipulating kind people.

743
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,671
Someone like you
who is highly empathetic

744
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,424
would be the perfect target

745
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,093
for people like them.

746
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,724
Ro-eum!

747
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,684
Ro-eum!

748
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,647
Do you know how many people
are waiting for you right now?

749
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,732
You shouldn't make grownups wait!

750
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:56,900
I'm sorry.

751
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,195
Ro-eum!

752
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,993
Ro-eum!

753
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,038
I told you to stick close to her.

754
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:10,956
Sheesh.

755
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,457
You check the restroom.

756
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,084
I'll check the parking lot.

757
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,838
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

758
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,717
Earlier…

759
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,927
You were just exhausted, right?

760
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,762
Not because you hadn't memorized it.

761
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,974
How do you know?

762
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,312
Tell them.

763
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,647
Your parents.

764
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,607
Tell them you're having a hard time.

765
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,401
And if I do?

766
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,987
They'll listen to you.

767
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,156
Does your mom and dad

768
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,158
let you do whatever you want?

769
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,828
No.

770
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,415
Still,

771
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,667
if you don't say anything,
no one will know.

772
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,753
And being alone

773
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,880
is scary.

774
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,631
And lonely.

775
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,384
But if I do this,

776
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,928
my family gets to eat meat.

777
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,557
It's not so bad.

778
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,812
Let's get out of here.

779
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,231
I know a place where we can hide.

780
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,533
Father.

781
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,952
The girl was in here?

782
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,996
Do you know all the grownups
are looking for you?

783
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,583
-Get out of there.
-Ro-eum.

784
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,001
Geez.

785
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,795
Let's go.

786
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:27,967
You found her?

787
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,469
Hurry.

788
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,720
Quickly.

789
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,146
It's definitely rigged.

790
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,273
There's nothing more to see.
Let's go.

791
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,488
Moo-young, let's go.

792
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,579
I won't let her manipulate me
so easily.

793
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,916
I won't run,

794
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,585
or turn away from her either.

795
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,813
HAN MOO-YOUNG

796
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,156
Whatever it is you're hiding,

797
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,366
I'm going to find out.

798
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,123
I'd rather you bug out of my life now.

799
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,041
You can't get rid of me that easily.

800
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,211
I can't turn away from you now,

801
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,256
and you can't
turn away from me either.

802
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,593
Because I'm the only one
who can empathize with you

803
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,345
even after seeing
the murderous side of you.

804
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,975
Whatever it is you're trying to do,
I'll help you.

805
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,059
On one condition.

806
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,062
You have to learn how to empathize
with others too.

807
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,899
Before hurting someone,

808
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,734
you should at least
be able to hesitate,

809
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:12,238
and think about how to do it differently
instead of repaying evil with evil.

810
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,910
I will help you
so that you can do that.

811
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:22,999
You're

812
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,585
fired.

813
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,830
UNKNOWN USER

814
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,407
Ro-eum.

815
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,909
How long are you going to watch?

816
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,327
What the?

817
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,746
What do you mean
the case is closed?

818
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,166
It was ruled
as an accidental death.

819
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,752
I'll do everything I can
as an attorney.

820
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,172
You can't uncover truths
through trials.

821
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,301
But getting revenge
isn't justice either.

822
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,928
We have
a very important guest today.

823
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:02,056
I'm child psychologist, Courtney Kwon.
