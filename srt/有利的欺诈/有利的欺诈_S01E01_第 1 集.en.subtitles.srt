ESTABLISHMENT OF LAW AND ORDER

14
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,071
Get up.

15
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,825
Get up.

16
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,081
I said, get up.

17
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,297
Get up, you bitch!

18
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,139
Shit, are you ignoring me?

19
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,517
Are you deaf?

20
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,354
Do you have toilet paper stuffed
in your ears?

21
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,193
What are you staring at?

22
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,904
Get up and clean.

23
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,405
What's going on in there?

24
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,242
Oh, well,

25
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,285
everyone is cleaning up,

26
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,829
but that bitch is acting like
she's too good to help out.

27
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,830
Who?

28
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,749
That bitch, over there…

29
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,920
Who do you mean?

30
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,053
You just got transferred here
two hours ago.

31
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,597
If you cause a disturbance,

32
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,599
we'll have to send you to solitary,

33
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,395
and it'll be even more shitty there.

34
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,230
Don't get into trouble.

35
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,572
That bitch.

36
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,408
Just take it easy.

37
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,493
She's in here for killing her parents.

38
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,925
Do I know Attorney Han Moo-young?

39
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,012
Of all the attorneys I know,

40
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,347
he's the best of the best.

41
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,104
Why do you think people keep
hiring him as their lawyer?

42
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,607
Well…

43
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,151
"To defend."

44
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,194
Sounds cool, doesn't it?

45
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,073
Helping others through words.

46
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,744
A slicker who won a million dollars
after betting his own hand in Go-Stop.

47
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,039
A fraudulent gambler and
criminal with 16 previous convictions.

48
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,875
Someone like that would be definitely
headed to the big house.

49
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,418
But…

50
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,419
However…

51
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,257
But if his attorney

52
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,343
is Han Moo-young,
that's a different story.

53
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,016
Defendant.

54
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,061
-Yes.
-Are you a slicker?

55
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,314
I am.

56
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,649
What exactly is a slicker?

57
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,611
Someone who uses

58
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,239
the sleight of hand
when gambling to cheat.

59
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,407
Hmm…

60
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,202
Then on April 11th,

61
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,871
did you use your skill as a slicker

62
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,207
against the victim?

63
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,504
Yes.

64
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,466
You were aware
that that was fraud?

65
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,636
Yes.

66
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,140
I rest my case.

67
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,768
Defendant.

68
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,269
Yes.

69
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,147
Did you use your skill
in the first half?

70
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,982
No, the second half.

71
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,653
I'd like to show you a video

72
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,656
comparing the first half
and second half of the game at the time.

73
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,159
Please focus on the pinky finger

74
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,078
of Ms. Jeong and the defendant.

75
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,997
The ring that
Ms. Jeong was wearing in the first half

76
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,334
is now on the defendant
in the second half.

77
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,419
Did you use that ring

78
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,296
to cheat in the game?

79
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,965
No.

80
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,134
Of course not.

81
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,053
Because the ring

82
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,513
was not a tool

83
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,390
but a token.

84
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,726
What we really should be
asking the defendant

85
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,563
who is being charged
of a million dollar card scam

86
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,107
is not "how" but "why."

87
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,568
And for who?

88
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,530
As you've just seen in the video clip,
in the first half, Ms. Jeong

89
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,407
owed a million dollars.

90
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,576
And we've also clearly seen

91
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,287
that the victim threatened Ms. Jeong

92
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,082
with talk of a physical rights waiver.

93
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,375
Defendant.

94
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,879
Did Ms. Jeong give you the ring
during the break time?

95
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,089
-Yes.
-And why is that?

96
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,551
She said it might be the last time
we saw each other

97
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,386
and asked me to remember her.

98
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,306
Did you not think
that you'd be the one in danger

99
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,933
if they found out you cheated
in the second half?

100
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,685
I just wanted to win the money

101
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,354
and pay back his debt for her.

102
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,364
Although he had played
a clean game for ten years,

103
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,826
this is the exact moment
the defendant decided to use

104
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,620
his skill as a professional gambler.

105
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,456
It was not
for his personal financial gain,

106
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,209
or the rash action of an addict.

107
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,710
It was because

108
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,338
he wanted to protect
someone he cared about.

109
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,923
This

110
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,010
is why the defendant used
his skill to cheat.

111
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,063
On the charge of fraud,
we find the defendant guilty

112
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,524
and thereby sentence him
to two years in prison.

113
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,944
However, on the charge of gambling,

114
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,820
it cannot be deemed
that he had a motive

115
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,365
to intentionally commit fraud.

116
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,742
Therefore, the sentence
will be suspended for three years

117
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,912
starting on the date this ruling
becomes final and conclusive.

118
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,394
Attorney Han.

119
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,021
I'm Woo Young-gi.

120
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,401
You just turned a work of crime
into a melodramatic narrative.

121
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,027
How ever did you come up with that?

122
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,321
Is there someplace where you can
learn how you make your case?

123
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,365
I said, no interviews.

124
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,409
We may be
a small local newspaper,

125
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,202
but I guarantee you'll make it
on the front page.

126
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,662
My name is Woo Young-gi.

127
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,414
I have that much sway at least.

128
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,878
Not being in the news with a face
like yours would be a national loss.

129
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,132
All right.

130
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,093
Then, I promise not to use
sensational nicknames like "vampire."

131
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,345
Seems like you didn't understand.

132
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,599
What can you write about
when there won't be an interview?

133
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,184
But…

134
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,895
I heard he was a rude prick.

135
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,773
Excuse me? A rude… What?

136
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,234
I heard all about it.

137
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,152
The vampire.

138
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,197
Oops.

139
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,533
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,076
It's okay.

141
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,245
Don't you need to use the restroom?
Hurry along.

142
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,461
Byeol has grown up a lot, hasn't he?

143
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,591
It's his dad's appeal today.

144
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,885
That's good to know.

145
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,470
Good?

146
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,139
Do you know how I've spent
the past three years?

147
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,644
You said you'd help us
in this uphill battle,

148
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,729
but you bailed on Byeol's dad.

149
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,905
I heard he's really cold and heartless,

150
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,116
and he's picky about his clients.

151
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,961
Would he even take my case?

152
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,630
Oh,

153
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,923
well…

154
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,051
Ms. Park,

155
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,095
what does this mean?

156
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,305
I'll look it up for you.

157
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,854
Attorney Han.

158
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,272
Hi.

159
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,068
Did your court case go well?

160
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,945
Yes, he got off on probation.

161
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,113
As expected.

162
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,825
This is the second son of Helo Chem's
Chairman Jeong, who I told you about.

163
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,956
So, have you heard about my case?

164
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,582
With the cab driver.

165
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,626
Isn't that the wrong arm?

166
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,627
Excuse me?

167
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,004
According to your initial statement,
you injured

168
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,381
your right arm.

169
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,800
That cast should be on your right.

170
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,889
Come with me.

171
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,608
Is he really taking my case?

172
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,527
I thought he was choosy about his cases.

173
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,737
Yes, he only chooses to take on

174
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,781
clients like you.

175
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,757
How long

176
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,593
do you think it'll take?

177
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,054
You'll be able to see
on the news soon.

178
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:55,399
PSYCHIATRIST
Mo Jae In

179
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,867
Are you still called
by that nickname these days?

180
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,285
"The vampire"?

181
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,786
Yes.

182
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,371
How does it make you feel?

183
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,335
Working on rotation

184
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,962
means that a job can fall
on any employee.

185
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,131
The company has the right
to assign personnel

186
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,341
depending on the situation.

187
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,552
You forced the deceased
who was an office worker

188
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,222
to do fieldwork and treated him unfairly
for four years!

189
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,681
Counsel for the plaintiff,

190
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,099
what do you think you're doing?

191
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,893
Treated him unfairly?

192
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,562
He's the abnormal one for not being able
to do what everybody else does.

193
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,813
What? Abnormal?

194
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,273
How dare you!

195
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,527
You're the one that used him,
and when you got backed into a corner,

196
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,446
you threatened to fire an innocent man!

197
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,783
The plaintiff's counsel
is defaming the witness

198
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,618
with reckless and abstract statements.

199
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,246
Who is defaming who?

200
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,540
Counsel for the plaintiff,
please calm down.

201
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,208
We're in the middle of
a direct examination.

202
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,168
He was a responsible man.

203
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,045
Do you not know how hard

204
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,131
he had worked for the past ten years?

205
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,467
All the hardships he went through

206
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,055
working for unscrupulous people

207
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,431
like you…

208
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,985
How many times
have you passed out

209
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,904
in the past six months?

210
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,616
Are you going to quit being an attorney
after this case?

211
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,535
You've done all you could.

212
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,580
Against the conglomerate's
team of top-notch lawyers at that.

213
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,499
Gyu.

214
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,545
Do conglomerates just get a pass for
using and killing people like that?

215
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,299
I'm going to fight this until the end.

216
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,758
Byeol's mother…

217
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,843
No, you can't.

218
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,844
Moo-young.

219
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,346
This is exactly why
you can't go on.

220
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,389
And stop

221
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,142
calling the client like that.

222
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,436
Sympathizing with a client is great.
I commend you for that.

223
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,730
But you have to live first.

224
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,733
That's the only way you can help.

225
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,571
I'm not saying you're not helping now,
but being a real attorney

226
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,533
doesn't necessarily mean
helping only people in need.

227
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,537
I know someone
who can take over their case.

228
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,790
Also,

229
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,084
I'm looking into a hospital for you.

230
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,128
Please, get treated first.

231
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,884
I just accept it.

232
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,849
Oof.

233
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,104
Oof.

234
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,501
Oh my goodness.

235
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,421
You know who
I hate the most?

236
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,256
People who don't respect
their parents.

237
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,759
I may have murdered my husband,

238
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,096
but I still sent my parents on
a nice trip, you know?

239
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,932
You ungrateful little bitch.

240
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:43,085
COURT

241
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,431
MY SON DIED A YEAR AFTER HIS ADOPTION
INTO ANOTHER FAMILY

242
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,566
Are you looking for Seo Gye-suk?

243
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,071
The adoptive parents
are suing for libel.

244
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,157
They hired the law firm ChoandSom.

245
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,869
The prosecution says
there's no evidence,

246
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,038
and once the investigation is closed,

247
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,249
there will be nothing more
she can do.

248
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,586
Some people wonder,

249
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,796
why she would put her own kid up
for adoption when he's almost grown up?

250
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,466
The world is such a scary place.
How could she be so trusting?

251
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,509
I heard his adoptive parents

252
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,763
paid 2,000 dollars a month in insurance
under Myeong-hun's name.

253
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,431
Last year alone, they took out

254
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,976
13 or was it 15 policies?

255
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,896
They even took out the same policies
for some, to get double the amount.

256
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,397
Super shady, right?

257
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,486
Oh well. What's the point?
It's all circumstantial evidence, anyway.

258
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:55,741
They raised him with their biological kids
who all look well-fed and nourished,

259
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,743
but Myeong-hun was nothing
but skin and bone.

260
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,411
Why are you telling me this?

261
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,996
Excuse me?

262
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,123
Why are you telling me all this?

263
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,669
Oh, I just thought
you might want to know…

264
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,923
After all, you were staring at the place

265
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,884
where she used to be
for over five minutes…

266
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,845
You're leaving? I…

267
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,867
Oh, wow.

268
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,621
Ms. Park, you know about this, right?
The Geumseong-si murder.

269
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,914
What?

270
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,791
This is just in.

271
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,503
Ye who was arrested last month
for possession of illegal weapons

272
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,839
has turned out to be the real killer

273
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,008
behind the Geumseong-si murder
a high-profile case ten years ago.

274
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,718
However, there is someone

275
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,264
who has been serving ten years
for this very crime.

276
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,641
The teenage girl who also had to endure

277
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,852
the court of public opinion
for parricide

278
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,478
was in fact falsely charged

279
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,856
and ended up in prison
for the past ten years.

280
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,649
The investigation of the case,
the following arrest,

281
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,484
and the ten-year imprisonment

282
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,986
was all for nothing.

283
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,320
Kim Eun-yeong, reporting.

284
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,653
It feels fake.

285
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,990
What does? Your actions?

286
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,034
The fact that I'm an attorney.

287
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,745
It's been three years already

288
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,789
since I've prolonged my life with drugs,
living a life of no value.

289
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,000
I think that providing a legal service

290
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,586
to your clients as an attorney

291
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,297
has a lot of value.

292
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,090
Service?

293
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,551
Why do you think you feel that

294
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,220
your current situation has no value?

295
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,013
There must be a reason.

296
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,848
My clients

297
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,227
don't really need me.

298
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,938
They're not the type
of people who really need help.

299
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,650
February 2012,

300
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,736
a bungalow at a campsite in Geumseong
was found burned to the ground.

301
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,155
Inside the bungalow

302
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,531
were the burnt bodies of a couple

303
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,284
with gunshot wounds in their heads.

304
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,288
The suspect was their only daughter,
Lee Ro-eum

305
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,499
who was at the site,

306
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,335
and arrested immediately
for murder and arson.

307
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,628
After all,

308
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,714
you were staring at the place where
she used to be for over five minutes…

309
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,311
For murdering her parents,

310
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,315
she was sentenced to 15 years.

311
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,818
Ten years have now gone by

312
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,361
and the real killer of this murder

313
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,862
has turned up.

314
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,741
Ye was arrested last month
for possession of illegal weapons.

315
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,703
Forensics confirmed that
the gun Ye had in possession

316
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,581
was a match for the bullets discovered

317
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,709
at the site of the murders 11 years ago.

318
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,545
Lee who was once called
a girl genius

319
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,714
has been serving time for ten years

320
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,717
falsely accused of killing her parents.

321
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,449
MOTHER, SUSPICIOUS OF HER SON'S DEATH
AFTER ADOPTION, STAGES A PROTEST

322
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,413
THE ACCUSED FALSELY DEFAMED THE ACCUSER…

323
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,336
Then who really needs your help?

324
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,839
There's someone who has been
protesting for over a month.

325
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,674
She's a mother who lost her son.

326
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,428
Why do you think she's on your mind?

327
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,680
Do you sympathize with her?

328
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,017
Do you want to help her?

329
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,519
You'll probably tell me
to look the other way.

330
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,064
Like I said before,

331
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,440
whether you look away

332
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,524
or suppress it,

333
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,196
however you define it is not the result
of treatment, it's only the process,

334
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,114
And right now,

335
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,366
you are in the middle of the process.

336
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,787
So you should focus more on treatment
rather than helping others.

337
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,293
What you're seeing on screen

338
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:01,922
is a summary of what led up
to Ye's arrest.

339
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,882
Last July, the police received a tip

340
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,842
on a man possessing illegal weapons.

341
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,594
You're watching that again?

342
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,137
Yeah.

343
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,138
Hmm,

344
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,975
I wonder who'll get that case?

345
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,019
This is just great.

346
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,273
It'll probably be
a public defender, right?

347
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,193
Do you want me
to give you some work?

348
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,236
No.

349
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,322
He admitted to the crime
he committed ten years ago.

350
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,784
Come on.

351
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,204
Why me?

352
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,164
Why me of all people?

353
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,126
Then who else is there
at this tiny office?

354
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,920
But a teenage girl rotted
in prison for ten years!

355
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,213
For killing her parents!

356
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,507
The real killer

357
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,300
is a total scumbag!

358
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,679
How insane can you be
to defend someone like that?

359
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,889
Did you just call your boss insane?

360
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,641
Look.

361
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,477
I have my reasons for taking the case.

362
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,522
And everyone else is busy
except for you.

363
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,982
There's Han Moo-young.

364
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,233
Why do I have to take on the case?

365
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,401
He's busy too.

366
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,986
You're playing favorites!

367
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,824
Is he your son or what?

368
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:18,373
If you don't want me to play favorites,
then do your job.

369
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,791
What?

370
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,710
What do you think you're doing?

371
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,836
-Ha.
-Huh?

372
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,255
-Wow, get over here.
-Ha.

373
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,256
Come on.

374
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,382
You're so…

375
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,009
-What? What?
-Hey.

376
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,636
What? You want to punch me?
Then punch me. Come on, punch me.

377
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,139
Aren't you cute.

378
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,227
Geez, if you weren't older…

379
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,353
You little brat.

380
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,479
Just punch me.

381
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,148
Just give me five seconds…

382
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,358
I'll take the case.

383
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,447
You can't.

384
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,573
Hey!

385
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,451
You said he was too busy!

386
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,161
Cho.

387
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,038
Can you do me a favor instead?

388
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,789
Sure thing.

389
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,672
Boot it up.

390
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,438
Ms. Seo Gye-suk.

391
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,484
Oh.

392
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,111
I'm an attorney at Park&Cue.

393
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,322
My name is Cho Jae-hun.

394
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,117
I'm Attorney Han Moo-young.

395
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,205
I heard you were arrested for possession
of an illegally modified firearm,

396
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,457
and when prosecution questioned you,

397
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,167
you confessed.

398
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,211
In this true?

399
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,170
Yes.

400
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,381
Can you tell me about the case?

401
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,259
I killed them.

402
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,429
Why?

403
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,182
Because I just wanted to.

404
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,814
Don't you have anyone
you just want to kill?

405
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,317
Only a very few actually carry it out.

406
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,988
Doesn't confessing…
get you a lighter sentence?

407
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,492
If you tell me to cry in court,

408
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,994
I will.

409
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,246
I'll write an apology too.

410
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,678
-Why did you do it?
-What?

411
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,767
Why did you bring
the victims' daughter into this?

412
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,853
What do you mean?

413
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,439
If you set the fire to destroy evidence,

414
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,274
why did you have to use

415
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,776
the victims' daughter?

416
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,362
So she could cremate them.

417
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,698
And do her duty as their child.

418
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,005
How many years
do you think I'll get?

419
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,675
Will under ten years be too much to ask?

420
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,721
What?

421
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,389
It won't be possible?

422
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,016
Damn it.

423
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,352
Are you some kind of cheap lawyer?

424
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,276
How long
are you going to ask for?

425
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,113
Are you talking to me?

426
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,698
The case against Ye Chung-sik.

427
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,950
How many years are you
going to demand he get?

428
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,660
Let's see,

429
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,872
Ye Chung-sik…

430
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,415
What was that about?

431
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,209
The murder of a couple in Geumseong.

432
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,961
The daughter was falsely charged
for their murder.

433
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,254
So how many years?

434
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,214
What is this?

435
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,965
I'm the prosecutor here.

436
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,009
How long? Just tell me.

437
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,387
Wow, are you seeking
the death penalty?

438
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,931
You totally look
like a judge right now.

439
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,766
Is the death penalty not possible?

440
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,311
The daughter
got the maximum sentence

441
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,271
and already served ten years.

442
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:16,152
What a great sense of justice.
You should be the Minister of Justice.

443
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,487
Sir.

444
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,073
That's enough, Attorney Han.

445
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,700
I know about you.

446
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,911
I've heard quite a lot.

447
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,413
You're well known

448
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,498
for being excessively sensitive.

449
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,666
Yeah, I heard.

450
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:34,129
Actually, I'm excessively empathetic,
not sensitive.

451
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,219
Has it started up again? Your inability to
keep your personal life and work separate?

452
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,888
I'm warning you.

453
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,306
I'm sure you've heard

454
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,351
that I don't care what gets in my way.
I get my job done.

455
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,438
Let's head out.

456
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,486
You want to do what?

457
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,990
I can't let you do that.

458
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,702
No.

459
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,916
CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION REPORT

460
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:22,135
You're letting your symptoms
get in the way of your work.

461
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,512
It's not a rational decision.

462
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,017
What you're trying to do

463
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,644
will be career suicide.

464
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,106
It's too late.

465
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,319
A teenage girl rotted
in prison for ten years!

466
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,695
For killing her parents!

467
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,955
Then who really needs your help?

468
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,013
We've obtained a recording.

469
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,725
Yes, I killed them.

470
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:15,396
If you tell me to cry in court, I will.

471
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,649
I'll write an apology too.

472
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,943
Why did you bring
the victims' daughter into this?

473
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,861
So she could cremate them.

474
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,405
And do her duty as their child.

475
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,120
This recording
was disclosed by his attorney.

476
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,623
People are enraged
due to this recording…

477
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,917
Did you not realize
it would hurt your career?

478
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,460
Were you on bad terms?

479
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,046
The true killer, Ye
who killed the couple in Geumseong

480
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,006
was sentenced to life.

481
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,302
His attorney is also
the focus of attention.

482
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,264
The press believe that
the recording he leaked

483
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,058
affected the outcome of the trial.

484
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,143
According to the recording,
Ye was cruel and intentionally…

485
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,311
He's crazy.

486
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,941
And made the daughter
who was barely over 18

487
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,443
set fire to the crime scene.

488
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,405
As a result, Lee was falsely charged
for murder

489
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,365
as well as arson.

490
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,701
Here is Kim Seok-pil reporting.

491
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,372
Lee will turn 28 in October.

492
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,584
However, the ten years behind bars
was not without any incident.

493
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,712
During her time, more years
were added to her sentence,

494
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,297
but it seems as if she will get off

495
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,924
on probation for the additional charges.

496
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,432
What was the additional charge for?

497
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,810
I'm not Google, you know.

498
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,646
Get off my back.

499
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,201
What the…

500
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,372
I will now deliver the sentence

501
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,999
regarding the defendant, Lee Ro-eum.

502
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:02,128
During the investigation
in 2012, the defendant, Lee Ro-eum

503
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,464
was coerced into a confession

504
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,300
by the detectives in charge.

505
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,010
Her confession

506
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,595
along with objective evidence

507
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,139
from the crime scene and the bodies…

508
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,183
Set fire to the crime scene

509
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,645
burning the bodies.

510
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,981
In light of the facts of this case,

511
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:26,069
and the method of crime,
the crime is deemed to be heinous

512
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,197
and therefore, it is determined that

513
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,533
the defendant must receive
a severe sentence.

514
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,578
Thus, the bench passes

515
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,873
the following sentence
against the defendant.

516
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,834
The sentence is as follows.

517
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,462
Defendant, Lee Ro-eum

518
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,883
is sentenced to 15 years in prison.

519
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,930
The defendant Lee Ro-eum
is declared not guilty.

520
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,863
It's from your lawyer.

521
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,682
You're not my lawyer.

522
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,688
I just thought

523
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,274
you wouldn't want to wear
your clothes from that day.

524
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,068
Whoever thinks of something like that?

525
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,362
Someone like me.

526
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,240
Don't mind me.
It's an illness.

527
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,411
Congratulations for finally
clearing your name.

528
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,122
I know you've been through a lot.

529
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,137
Excuse me.

530
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,598
Can I get some ramyeon?

531
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,849
Sure.

532
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,982
Here I am

533
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,860
running around like crazy

534
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,322
doing everything I can to stop
the disciplinary committee,

535
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,575
but you had the time
to go meet that girl?

536
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,161
What exactly did you do?

537
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,541
Nothing much.

538
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,834
That girl

539
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,502
hired you.

540
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,046
What?

541
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,132
She's filing for compensation
against the state.

542
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,717
She wants you to take the case.

543
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,635
Me?

544
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:39,762
Why me?

545
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,681
Because the way she sees it,

546
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:45,059
you're a pushover who betrayed
your own client to save her.

547
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,859
What's happened has happened,

548
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,986
so let's try to frame this
as seeking justice.

549
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,615
I'll stop the disciplinary committee,
you get this done.

550
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,581
LEE RO-EUM

551
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,516
I'm Han Moo-young.

552
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,602
Hello.

553
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,362
Are you cold?

554
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,990
A little…

555
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,367
I don't have anything else to wear.

556
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,079
You're the one
who got me this outfit too.

557
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,664
Oh.

558
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,666
Then for now…

559
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,216
Wear this.

560
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,927
Thank you.

561
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,268
Have you ordered?

562
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,480
Oh… the order…

563
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,946
I'll do it.

564
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,745
Have whatever you like.

565
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,832
Thank you.

566
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,470
I'm sorry.

567
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,391
It's been so long

568
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,602
since I've been treated so nicely…

569
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,067
No one has ever helped me before.

570
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,285
No one believed in me.

571
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,207
I spent the last ten years in prison

572
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,253
for a crime I didn't even commit,

573
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,757
and I was so scared,

574
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,218
and lonely.

575
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,808
Just surviving in there
every single day

576
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,061
was tough.

577
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:02,965
Thank you.

578
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,385
You can do this.

579
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,597
Not me.

580
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,060
You can win this case,
even if you do it on your own.

581
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,068
You know what people call me?

582
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,653
Witch.

583
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,280
Demon.

584
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,036
I heard people call you

585
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,039
heartless or a vampire.

586
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,337
But you chose justice
over your own reputation,

587
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,592
and even gave me something to wear

588
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,469
when I have no friends or family.

589
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,809
Talk is easy,

590
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,191
but I

591
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,404
believe in actions more than words.

592
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,077
How was she?

593
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,748
You put your career on the line for her.

594
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,668
Was she worth it?

595
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,254
Doctor.

596
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,422
Yes?

597
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,716
You said there were

598
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,762
a certain type of people
that I should avoid.

599
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,556
Yes.

600
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,525
People who are unable to relate

601
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,445
to other people's feelings,
and whose actions are always a lie.

602
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,239
And use any means necessary

603
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,491
for their own benefit.

604
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,455
People with
an antisocial personality disorder.

605
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,249
Also called sociopaths, or psychopaths.

606
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,419
They are pros

607
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:06,172
at manipulating kind people.

608
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,434
Someone like you
who is highly empathetic

609
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,145
would be the perfect target

610
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,315
for people like them.

611
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,992
A FEW QUESTIONS TO THE GUARD…

612
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,332
LEE RO-EUM
- PERSON-OF-INTEREST

613
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,087
Hello?
Is this Ms. No Shin-ji?

614
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,549
You'd like to know about her?

615
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,011
I didn't even know
her name was Lee Ro-eun.

616
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,430
It's Lee Ro-eum.

617
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,892
Whatever. I didn't even want to know.

618
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,979
You know there are
a lot of psychopaths these days.

619
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,982
Now that I think about it,
I think she's one too.

620
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,608
Really?

621
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,904
The first thing she did
was stab an officer in the neck.

622
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,870
Finish it.

623
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,167
Asses should be curvy.

624
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,186
Eat up.

625
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,688
Clean your plates.

626
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,525
Eat up.

627
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,903
Don't leave a single grain of rice.

628
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,036
Eat it all up!

629
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,329
Clean your…

630
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,550
Why did she do it?

631
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,427
What do you mean, why?

632
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,138
He just told her to finish her food
and she stabbed him for it.

633
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,183
You don't believe me?

634
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,645
Well, she was really pretty,

635
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,272
so I think she was a favorite
among the correctional officers.

636
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,567
But she was still a kid back then.

637
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,944
People can change.

638
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,990
Look at me. Who'd have thought
I'd get married and have a kid?

639
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,789
SEOWON PRISON

640
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,998
Hello.

641
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,417
I'm Han Moo-young.

642
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,504
A panic attack?

643
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,632
Don't get me started.

644
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,017
If you move,

645
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,310
it'll drop.

646
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,232
If you scream,

647
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,526
it'll also drop.

648
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,947
It's methanol, a toxic liquid

649
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,409
that is light, colorless,
and flammable.

650
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,202
When absorbed into your body,

651
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:08,455
it'll turn into formaldehyde
in your liver,

652
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,625
which could make you blind
or even kill you.

653
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,462
Maeil Encyclopedia, Book 3, page 259,

654
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,256
2nd paragraph, line 3.

655
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,591
Wait, wait…

656
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,552
Wait.

657
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,930
I

658
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,517
memorized the entire encyclopedia
when I was five.

659
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,480
The book you tore apart?

660
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,316
I could've memorized that too.

661
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,155
Do you know why I'm doing this?

662
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,371
Because,
I haven't memorized that book yet.

663
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:55,127
Please don't kill me.

664
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,839
Please, please.

665
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,466
I'll never do anything like that again.

666
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,009
I'm… I'm sorry.

667
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,012
Please don't kill me.

668
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,265
I'll treat you with respect.

669
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:09,725
I'll do anything.

670
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,560
I'll do all your laundry for you too.

671
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,228
Please… Please…

672
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,981
Please…

673
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,508
The new inmate
made her husband go blind

674
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,842
to get the insurance money.

675
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,845
She almost ended up the same way
as her husband

676
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,847
so it must have been terrifying.

677
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,974
But how did Ro-eum get methanol?

678
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,935
It was water.

679
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,103
We can't keep

680
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,481
ethanol or methanol in a prison.

681
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,566
But

682
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,319
her fear made her believe it was.

683
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:06,114
She swears she could
smell the alcohol.

684
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,076
Even after Lee Ro-eum got out,

685
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,246
that woman couldn't sleep
and had to take pills for insomnia.

686
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,166
But

687
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,502
even if that woman had torn her book,

688
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,879
what kind of psycho
pulls that kind of prank?

689
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,842
Everyone says
she wasn't the real killer.

690
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,554
You should know better than anyone.

691
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,389
Since you were the real killer's lawyer.

692
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,393
If you ask me, she's the one
who killed her parents.

693
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,271
You heard, didn't you?

694
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,315
She was arrested because she confessed.
If she didn't do it,

695
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,025
why would a girl with an IQ of 180

696
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,486
voluntarily go to prison?

697
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,029
What was in it for her?

698
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,489
That's what I think.

699
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,741
But who knows?

700
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,868
Maybe she bribed someone
to be the fake killer.

701
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,455
You expect to see

702
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,249
a lot of people in prison

703
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,793
who are fraudulent, impulsive, hostile,

704
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,212
aggressive, reckless,

705
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,340
with a lack of conscious.

706
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,593
There's less than you think though.

707
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,512
But one thing is for sure,
Lee Ro-eum was definitely like that.

708
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,350
She always had the yellow name tag
the entire time she was behind bars.

709
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,436
She's dangerous.

710
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:24,109
Well, she's the probation officer's
problem now, not mine.

711
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,862
Lee Ro-eum, 941017.

712
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,492
Your probation officer is…

713
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,204
Oh, Officer Go Yo-han.

714
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,748
Hang on a sec.

715
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:38,915
Ms. Lee Ro-eum?

716
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,960
That's him.

717
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,089
Lee Ro-eum has reported in
as of September 8th.

718
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,722
What are you doing?

719
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,933
-Excuse me?
-Why are you scanning me up and down?

720
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,393
Are you trying to read me?

721
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,814
I'm the probation officer here, not you.

722
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,029
So… Lee Ro-eum.

723
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,491
You live in a tiny study room?

724
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,409
Yes.

725
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,329
Okay.

726
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,164
Go.

727
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,750
I'll meet you in front of your place
at 8 p.m. today.

728
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,293
Excuse me?

729
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,254
What?

730
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,257
Do you have other plans other than
meeting your probation officer?

731
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,258
Today

732
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,095
at 8 p.m.

733
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:37,432
Buy a phone and meet me
in front of your place.

734
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,642
Okay?

735
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,050
SURPRISE 100 - PARRENTICIDE, ARSON
- BELIEVES IN ACTION

736
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:19,599
ACTION

737
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,485
SEOYOUNG STUDY ROOM

738
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,747
Yes, I'd like to talk to Lee Ro-eum
in room 309.

739
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,250
She went out?

740
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,336
When was this?

741
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,515
I know what you're gonna say.

742
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,144
I rotted in prison for ten years
and got out on probation,

743
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,937
so why am I gambling?

744
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,275
Just shut up and watch.

745
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,818
This isn't gambling.

746
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,947
Hey, got it.

747
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,115
Let's go.

748
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,619
Ta-da.

749
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,330
For you.

750
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,166
And you.

751
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,129
-Thank you.
-Sure thing.

752
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,507
Your bags.

753
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:34,925
Huh?

754
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:50,899
Hello?

755
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,777
Hi, how can I help you?

756
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,363
Your name?

757
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,906
I'm Shin Bo-seong.

758
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,118
Hmm…

759
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,084
I'm Lieutenant, Ku Sae-rom
from South Toseong Police Station.

760
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,752
From the White Collar Crime Team.

761
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,672
Stolen goods are being sold
at vintage shops in this area,

762
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,382
so I'm here to find evidence.

763
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,676
Have you ever dealt goods

764
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,845
that you suspected were stolen?

765
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:20,929
What…?

766
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,931
No, never.

767
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,725
We only sell goods
that have a clear provenance.

768
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,978
Apply pressure.

769
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,980
Until he breaks.

770
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,526
You don't know Kim Wu-young,
Cha Yo-han, or Park Jae-hyeok?

771
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,655
They stabbed a pedestrian in Busan.

772
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:39,573
What?

773
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,367
I don't know them.

774
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,702
I've never heard their names before.

775
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,037
I really don't know them.

776
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,250
Can I check your ID first?

777
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,168
I just need to see your ID.

778
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,753
Oh, of course.

779
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,215
Here you go.

780
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,474
I'd like to cross-check
your list of goods.

781
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,977
Can I see your books for the first half?

782
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,604
The list of goods for the first half?

783
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,588
You could be a victim yourself,

784
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,048
Do you mind helping out?

785
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,966
Just highlight anything

786
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,134
if you see any matches.

787
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,510
Sure, I'll be right back.

788
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,189
May 30th, A Gustaf bag,
number zero in black.

789
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,193
May 15th, an Ibai two-piece and fur.

790
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,948
May 27th, A Nectare Theodore scarf.

791
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,659
Not that one, the one behind it.

792
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,826
Yes.

793
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,708
You got a jewelry set
on May 15th, right?

794
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,304
For shoes… Hmm…

795
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,139
Let's see.

796
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,808
I have to check the size first.

797
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,579
I told you.

798
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,540
I'm not gambling.

799
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,625
I'm running a scam.

800
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,839
Hang on, then…

801
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:05,135
The fourth line in the third paragraph
on the right.

802
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,515
"A homeless man was apprehended

803
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,767
"on the 11th for theft in Busan.

804
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,353
An arrest warrant has been applied for."

805
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,939
-She's right, again.
-Oh my god!

806
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,108
-This is crazy.
-So cool.

807
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,526
There really are
people like this?

808
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,528
You won a million dollars
doing this?

809
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,489
A long time ago, in the States.

810
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,827
The funny thing is,

811
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,622
Royal Casino still doesn't have
precautions regarding card counting.

812
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,710
So, I just came here to have some fun
before going back to the States.

813
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,677
So, tell me.

814
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,345
How much did you win today?

815
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,307
Oh… We…

816
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,808
We just donated a lot.

817
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,436
Oh, dear. So sorry to hear that.

818
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,648
I should get going.

819
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:02,776
Oh.

820
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:06,237
Don't tell anyone what I just told you.

821
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,447
I'll give you a gift.

822
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:08,907
Wait.

823
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,076
Is it possible

824
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,537
to back your game?

825
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,540
-Come on. This could be fate.
-Yeah.

826
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,876
Let's have some fun too.

827
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,503
Excuse me?

828
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,092
Blackjack is a game

829
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,719
where the first game
affects the next round.

830
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,597
When using the same deck,
the longer the game goes on,

831
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,599
and the more cards are dealt,

832
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,185
the more data you get,
making it easier to calculate the odds.

833
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,896
Eventually, you can tell
which card will be dealt.

834
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,899
But of course, you have to memorize
all the cards that were dealt first.

835
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,651
And calculate.

836
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,321
Correction.

837
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,698
This is no longer a scam.

838
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,014
Wow!

839
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,350
Ma'am, please come with us.

840
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,144
Why? I'm on a roll here.

841
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,979
Come with us.

842
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,359
Wait.

843
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,362
This isn't my money.

844
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,782
Tell them.

845
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,075
Now.

846
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,121
No, I've never seen her before
in my life.

847
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,330
What is she talking about?

848
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,832
What's going on?

849
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,169
The way she was acting,
I think she's a con artist.

850
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,920
-She's a swindler.
-Yeah.

851
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,465
Would you like to go quietly?

852
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,680
We'll be taking the chips you used
for the game. Come with us.

853
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:57,682
Let go.

854
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,100
Let go of me!

855
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,687
Let go of me!

856
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,189
Do you know who I am?

857
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,902
Like I said, it's not a scam.

858
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,198
So the casino can't charge me.

859
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,075
I just have to strike a deal

860
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,911
and leave.

861
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,789
Will this be enough?

862
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,628
We'll exchange it for cash,

863
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,296
so you should finish things up today.

864
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,006
Will that be all right with you?

865
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,812
I wrote the address
on each envelope.

866
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,689
Tell them Toseon Nambu Police Station

867
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,566
appreciates their help.

868
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:55,592
SEOYOUNG STUDY ROOM

869
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,093
You took a cab?

870
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,888
Were you playing in the rough?

871
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,392
It was a part-time job, as a caddy.

872
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,728
They called the cab for me.

873
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,105
Don't caddies usually
room and board there?

874
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,274
-Like a said, it's part-time.
-What's the daily pay?

875
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,275
100 dollars.

876
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:16,571
That's a strange amount.

877
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,240
Strange, strange.

878
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:23,995
Open it.

879
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,334
Open your bag.

880
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,379
It's just your caddie equipment,
isn't it?

881
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:35,882
Open

882
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,134
your bag.

883
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:40,887
Why?

884
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:46,934
That's enough.

885
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,854
You're invading her privacy.

886
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,783
I'm Lee Ro-eum's lawyer,
Han Moo-young.

887
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,660
Return the bag to her.

888
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,288
I'm Go Yo-han, her probation officer.

889
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,249
You have no right to order me around.

890
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,920
Then do you have the legal authority

891
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,589
to search your probationer's
personal effects?

892
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,593
When there is a risk of a violation
of the probationary rules…

893
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,595
Then tell me
what the risk factor is.

894
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:26,933
To be frank, I have no idea
how Lee Ro-eum got out.

895
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:30,520
Well, I guess she was released
because of the public outcry,

896
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,772
whatever she did
living inside the prison.

897
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:34,315
But

898
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,734
she's on probation,
which is not the same

899
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,486
as being found not guilty.

900
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,279
She's still a criminal.

901
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,117
To me, Lee Ro-eum herself
is a risk factor.

902
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,661
Keep an eye on her.

903
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,955
Your job is not just to win cases,

904
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,291
but to guide your client
so that she doesn't break the law again.

905
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,169
That's your job and duty
as someone in the legal profession

906
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,713
not just as a lawyer.

907
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,214
I will.

908
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:00,299
Okay.

909
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:02,927
Then,

910
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,139
here are your precious client's
precious personal effects.

911
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,062
Make sure to call me after you buy
a cell phone tomorrow, okay?

912
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,230
She will.

913
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,400
I wasn't talking to you.

914
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,281
I will.

915
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,741
Good.

916
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,744
Then, see you tomorrow,
same time.

917
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,954
Oh, and that caddy job.

918
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,957
Don't forget to sign
an employment contract,

919
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,167
and report back to me.

920
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,379
You asked me
if she was worth it.

921
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,142
I think she might be.

922
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:36,854
I know

923
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:38,439
that girl.

924
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,832
Did you kill them?

925
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,834
You said you believed me.
Why are you asking?

926
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,003
Did you buy a cell phone?

927
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,547
Stop bothering me.

928
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,758
I just learned something interesting

929
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,552
called the Red Eye kid.

930
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,679
The guy, Shin Gi-ho,

931
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:54,140
worked for Red Eye Foundation.

932
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,893
Do you think
this is the smart thing to do?

933
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,437
Even if something happens
to a patient at a hospice,

934
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,063
it won't be odd.
