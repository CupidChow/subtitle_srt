1
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,517
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,604
The police confirmed the identity
of a woman in her 40s

3
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:06,441
who was found dead at an employment
agency in Busan this evening.

4
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,902
The victim was Jang Kyung-ja,
CEO of Navis Well-being,

5
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,404
who was wanted for fraud
and conspiracy for murder.

6
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,656
Jang was found to be in the country,

7
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,785
The police have found evidence
that Jang was murdered,

8
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,538
and have specified a suspect
based on evidence found at the site

9
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,207
and a testimony from an informant.

10
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,876
Lee Ro-eum, you're under arrest
for the murder of Jang Kyung-ja.

11
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,049
Did you kill her?

12
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,969
Answer me.

13
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,221
Jang Kyung-ja.

14
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,264
Did you really kill her?

15
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,272
24 HOURS EARLIER

16
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,108
We received a tip

17
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,610
that the suspect showed up at
Sangjin University Hospital an hour ago,

18
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,820
so we made an emergency arrest.

19
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,697
She had no belongings with her,
and her clothes were sent to forensics.

20
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,075
I don't believe this.

21
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,369
What about the autopsy report?

22
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,412
We'll get it by tomorrow morning.

23
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,708
This is the postmortem report.

24
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,970
We should leak to the press
that the suspect is Lee Ro-eum.

25
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,806
Why would we do that when we
don't even have an arrest warrant?

26
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,475
It'd be impossible
not to get a warrant with this.

27
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,393
Mr. Kim.

28
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,854
We need to use the press
to earn some time at least

29
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,480
so that we can have an excuse.

30
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,024
Keep all details under wraps.

31
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,318
This is no time for tricks.

32
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,987
What's our priority right now?

33
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,365
Did we find any criminal proceeds
or catch the CEO of Navis?

34
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:41,369
We should least announce to the press
that we caught Jang Kyung-ja's killer.

35
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,414
First, we get the proof
and witness statements,

36
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,124
then we'll file for a warrant.

37
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,835
Whatever situation we're in
and whoever the suspect is,

38
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,461
it changes nothing.

39
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,802
Lee Ro-eum has agreed
to be questioned at night.

40
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,305
She'll be in interrogation room 1
in 30 minutes.

41
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,764
I'll be questioning her myself.

42
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,694
The special investigation team
investigates murders too?

43
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,322
Since it was the CEO
of Navis Well-being who was murdered.

44
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,369
You really don't need a lawyer?

45
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,795
That's you, isn't it?

46
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,964
And that's a gun in your hand.

47
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,093
The time you went to meet the victim
with an illegal weapon

48
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,471
matches the estimated time of her death.

49
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,391
And at the scene,
your fingerprints were found.

50
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,564
Did you go to see the victim with a gun?

51
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,150
Was Jang Kyung-ja shot?

52
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,527
Where did you get the gun?
Where is it now?

53
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,946
What was her cause of death?

54
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,364
Why did you go to see her?

55
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,367
If she wasn't shot dead,
was it something I could've done?

56
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,410
Arson?

57
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,038
If it wasn't a gun or arson,

58
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,958
how could I have overpowered her
in a struggle?

59
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,043
When she was 10cm taller than me?

60
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,712
Were you in a struggle with the victim?

61
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,091
You took my clothes.
Did you get anything from them?

62
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,926
It's being processed.

63
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,803
Do you admit to seeing her?

64
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,766
Was I really the only one
caught on camera?

65
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,312
Yes.

66
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,064
You want to put me away,

67
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,024
don't you?

68
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,193
What did you talk about with the victim?

69
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,362
Why did you take a gun?

70
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,241
Seeing how you're not answering,
it is something self-incriminating?

71
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,123
You agreed to being questioned at night.

72
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,293
I thought you were ready to cooperate.

73
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,216
I can only help you

74
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,928
before the arrest warrant is issued.

75
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,056
You should know how this works

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,850
since you've been through it once.

77
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,437
Tomorrow,

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,440
I'd like you to start by admitting
that you met the victim.

79
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,027
Put her in lockup.

80
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,862
Got it.

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,973
I don't need it anymore.

82
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,330
She didn't ask for a lawyer.

83
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,748
I know.

84
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,046
She's not cooperating.

85
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,256
At this rate, she'll be arrested.

86
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,217
From what I understand,
there's only circumstantial evidence.

87
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,510
That may be true,

88
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,805
but if it meets the arrest requirements,
she will be, you know that.

89
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,557
The biggest problem is that she doesn't
have a permanent address, and…

90
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,101
Because she's a criminal.

91
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,602
As you've seen.

92
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,190
I'm not so unprofessional
to use things that I saw in private.

93
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,358
Don't get me wrong.

94
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,360
But having her arrested
is not the only way.

95
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,530
Unless you have a reason
to make any kind of arrest.

96
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,949
Are you really going to keep this up?
Taking her side?

97
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,367
Why did you quit?

98
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,868
Quit what?

99
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,288
Do I have to explain

100
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,084
and make you understand
how powerless and incompetent I felt

101
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,545
and how hard I've been working on this
despite that?

102
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,630
You have no right to criticize me.

103
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,632
And what? Make any kind of arrest?

104
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,093
There must be grounds to make an arrest.

105
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,345
This person Jay you mentioned?

106
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,056
All we found were his pay slips.

107
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,810
The only person
that I'm most likely to find evidence on

108
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,104
and bring charges against

109
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,106
is Lee Ro-eum, not Lee Jay.

110
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,818
Is there proof she's not the killer?
Then bring it to me.

111
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:25,987
I will.

112
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,615
I'll get you the proof.

113
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,085
Yes?

114
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,587
I heard from Da-jeong

115
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,921
that Ro-eum was taken in.

116
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,006
Yes.

117
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,842
If you mean to be her lawyer,
I was thinking

118
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,719
maybe you should pass this time.

119
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,597
What is this about?

120
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,391
An article is coming out tomorrow.

121
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,854
My former employer found out
that Han Jae-seok is your father.

122
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,607
I tried to stop it,

123
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,775
but I have no pull. I'm sorry.

124
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,154
I understand.

125
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,865
-Thank you for telling me.
-Sure.

126
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,054
You regret it, don't you?

127
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,472
What?

128
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,224
Bringing me in to the firm.

129
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,645
That was ages ago.

130
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,064
It's not like

131
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,190
I didn't know you.

132
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,609
How long has it been already?

133
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,948
I had just returned to school,
and this freshman

134
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,075
was single-handedly taking up a fight

135
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,786
in a sexual harassment case
of a female student. Wow.

136
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,789
I knew we were in law school,
but I wondered

137
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,999
how you could fight
as if it were your own problem.

138
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,544
Crying at that. You were one crazy dude.

139
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,922
You know,

140
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,676
I was born in a well-to-do family,
but I didn't have a sense of vocation.

141
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,929
I just asked my parents to send me to
the US so that I could go to law school.

142
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,724
All I did there was have a good time,
and the first thing I saw when I got back

143
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,852
was pretty cool.

144
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,396
The power you had

145
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:28,818
was like a special limited edition.

146
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,238
Something you couldn't get
with money or connections.

147
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,948
So,

148
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,701
since I was going to start my own firm
once I passed the bar,

149
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,868
I believed you could

150
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,204
be the conscience of the firm.

151
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,540
That's why

152
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,586
I hired you myself, so why would I
regret it? I care about you.

153
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,216
But you weren't happy here,
so it bothered me

154
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,884
that I might be the cause.

155
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,680
You're the one who helped me
stick through it this far.

156
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,057
Thank you.

157
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,436
That's true.

158
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,774
An article is coming out tomorrow
about my father.

159
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,109
Along with my name.

160
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,820
Once it comes out,

161
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,406
the Ye Chung-sik case
will come under scrutiny.

162
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,577
It'll seem like I betrayed my client
to cover for my father.

163
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,371
The firm will come under fire too.

164
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,547
I told you in advance this time,
so I hope you forgive me.

165
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,466
RESIGNATION LETTER

166
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,343
What's the truth?

167
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,473
Did you turn Ye Chung-sik in
knowing about your father?

168
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,974
Is that the truth?

169
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,976
I'm also a lawyer who seeks the truth.

170
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,145
I have a duty to defend

171
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,148
the truth too. It's not just you.

172
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,403
I can't turn away from my conscience
just to avoid rumors and fake news…

173
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,446
Gyu.

174
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,114
I have too much money for that.

175
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,741
You'll regret it.

176
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,910
I know. I don't care if I do.

177
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,287
Hey.

178
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,498
I'm rich, you know.

179
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,214
Moo-young, if someone
tries to bring you down,

180
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,842
fight back until the end,
like you always do.

181
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,808
It's taken me this long to tell you that.

182
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,895
So, it's settled then.

183
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,149
We're good enough friends
for me to do this for you, right?

184
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,781
We are.

185
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,576
Here, take this back.

186
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,994
It's giving me heartburn.

187
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,044
It's the list of Navis' earnings
including the gift certificates.

188
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,380
Since you want to
divert everything overseas,

189
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,923
that's how I'll proceed.

190
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,508
What about the search
into domestic accounts?

191
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,094
There'll be some loss,
but it's within the estimated range.

192
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,929
The trail will go dead with CEO Jang.

193
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,306
They won't be able to track anything
further than that.

194
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,852
I prepared two tickets.

195
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,687
The departure date is next week.

196
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,816
You think you can meet the deadline?

197
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,862
When Han Jae-seok turned himself in,

198
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,406
a sketch of my face was circulated.

199
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,366
-I don't have much room to--
-I know.

200
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,119
I'm asking…

201
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,331
if you can handle the kids
before you get caught.

202
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,627
If we want to get Ro-eum out,
you have to go in instead of her.

203
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,715
You should hurry.

204
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,051
And what if it gets traced back to us
while hurrying?

205
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,305
When Ro-eum gets out,

206
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,557
I don't want her to have

207
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,018
any options.

208
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,795
And so,

209
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,300
we rule as follows against the defendant.

210
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,054
Defendant Lee Ro-eum

211
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,724
is sentenced to 15 years in prison.

212
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,837
You're early.

213
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,797
-Well…
-Would you like some coffee?

214
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,549
It's okay. I'll get it myself.

215
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,092
In-young.

216
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,012
Can you forward all calls to me?

217
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,931
And for the time being,
set up online appointments only.

218
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,809
Okay, I'll do that.

219
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,865
Gyu.

220
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,502
Hello?

221
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,504
This morning, the police arrested Han

222
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,840
who turned himself in

223
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,800
for the Geumseong murders.

224
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,302
The police are suspected of

225
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,722
trying to close the case
through an internal investigation.

226
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,643
Questions are being raised
regarding his son, a lawyer,

227
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,771
therefore whether the total truth will
come out about the Geumseong murders

228
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,648
will be watched with keen interest.

229
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,770
Hello?

230
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,107
Da-jeong, it's me.

231
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,443
Are you at the comic book store?

232
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,863
Why do you ask?

233
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,991
I wanted to ask you something.

234
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,827
Which hospital is Ringo in?

235
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,831
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,958
I don't want to hurt you,

237
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,504
but it seems like Ro-eum can't focus
because of you guys.

238
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,513
Da-jeong.

239
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,265
I think Jay

240
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,226
really is going to take Ro-eum this time.

241
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,563
That's why he had her arrested.

242
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,607
Once he gets rid of us,

243
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,359
everything will go his way.

244
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,572
What are we going to do?

245
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,949
We don't have time.

246
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,118
And I'm out of options to save Ro-eum.

247
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,328
I have a way.

248
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,789
I'm going to save her

249
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,916
and keep you all safe too.

250
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,917
I will.

251
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,719
Yes, Mr. Han.

252
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,846
Are you at the repair shop?

253
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,682
Yes, I'm about to go see Ringo
at the hospital.

254
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,100
I was just picking up some stuff.

255
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,519
I need you to come to the comic store.
As soon as you can.

256
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,729
What? Why?

257
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,357
Be careful.

258
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,317
Okay.

259
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,485
Got it.

260
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,211
Hello?

261
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,921
Doctor, this is Han Moo-young.

262
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,422
Yes, hello.

263
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,007
I'm sorry for suddenly calling you.

264
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,842
It's all right.

265
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,719
I saw the article.

266
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,138
It couldn't be more wrong. Are you okay?

267
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,556
I'm fine.

268
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,350
I wanted to ask you for a favor.

269
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,354
Can you find a new hospital for me?
Ringo's safety is on the line.

270
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,107
Do you know a place
where we could get some help?

271
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,735
I know a place. My cousin runs a hospice.

272
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,586
-Su-ho!
-Help!

273
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,838
Move!

274
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,063
Get in!

275
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,032
-What the hell?
-What?

276
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,128
I'm so dizzy.

277
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,340
What about Lee Ro-eum's clothes?

278
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,427
It was black, so it wasn't
noticed at first, but blood was found.

279
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,970
It's being analyzed for DNA.

280
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,139
These are the forensic results.

281
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,439
Let's listen to a recording.

282
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,068
I have a bomb
that will blow up the Closing.

283
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,614
I was thinking about
cutting a deal with you.

284
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,619
Navis Well-being's network was hacked,

285
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,706
and at the presentation, Ma Kang-su's
stock manipulation was exposed.

286
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,834
This is the conversation you had
with the victim that day.

287
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,003
Since you have an exceptional memory,

288
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,006
I'm sure you remember.
The exposure of stock manipulation…

289
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,091
Were you behind it?

290
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,720
Did you do it alone or did you have help?

291
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,391
Let's say I did. But because of it,
Navis Well-being's fraud was exposed,

292
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,770
and you became the head
of the special investigation team.

293
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:32,856
Is that so?

294
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,525
You made me the team leader?

295
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,279
Putting aside the fact
that it's a violation of the law,

296
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,323
this recording tells me a few things.

297
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,368
You and Jang Kyung-ja
were not on good terms.

298
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,744
It could be your motive.

299
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,413
And you

300
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,500
have the ability
to hack into Navis's network.

301
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,127
Like the way you got your hands
on an illegal gun,

302
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,505
it suggests that you are capable
of committing a crime.

303
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,589
Also,

304
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,509
you asked about
the Chairman in the recording.

305
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,885
Who is this Chairman?

306
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,846
Why are you asking
like you never heard of him?

307
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,600
Because I haven't.

308
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,644
So tell me.

309
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,897
I heard you received a tip

310
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,109
on who the real owner
of Navis Well-being is.

311
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,819
That the Chairman is Lee Jay.

312
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,282
We questioned 36 people involved,

313
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,075
out of which three were arrested.

314
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:29,121
They all claim that the main culprit
is Jang Kyung-ja, and evidence shows

315
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,000
that she is the final beneficiary
of Navis Well-being as well.

316
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,668
And so, this investigation

317
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,006
depended on capturing Jang Kyung-ja.

318
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,800
Until someone killed her.

319
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,891
If that's your claim, then all right.

320
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,021
Why are you looking for this Chairman?

321
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,401
The Chairman was the head of Red Eye,
the scholarship foundation I was part of,

322
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,528
and he's the one who made me like this.

323
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,364
Though I'm sure
it's your first time hearing of this.

324
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,242
Then you must've gone
to see the victim that day

325
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,660
to ask about the Chairman.

326
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,461
This is your phone we found at the scene.

327
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:21,173
You looked up drugs with it, didn't you?
The kind you gave to the victim.

328
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,633
You have both a motive
and the capabilities,

329
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,179
and you met with the victim, with a gun
at the time of her presumed death.

330
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,639
She was strangled to death,
unable to fight back

331
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,099
because of the drugs you looked up.

332
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,602
Even if she was considerably bigger
than you, you could've killed her.

333
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,936
What happened that day?

334
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,483
Can you still lock up people these days

335
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,902
based on circumstantial evidence?

336
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,362
You think this is all we have?

337
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,742
Lawyer.

338
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,703
I want my lawyer.

339
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,289
And who is that?

340
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,290
Han Moo-young.

341
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,003
Haven't you heard?

342
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,506
His father is
part of the Geumseong murders.

343
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,425
Where did you hear that?

344
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,638
The news broke this morning.

345
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,223
That Han Moo-young is

346
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,892
the son of one of the killers
in the Geumseong murders.

347
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,856
Despite knowing that,
you still wanted him as your lawyer?

348
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,403
People are saying

349
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,283
that he leaked the recording
with Ye Chung-sik to cover for his father.

350
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,576
Of course,

351
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,954
I know that's not true.

352
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,081
However,

353
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,416
I'm doing everything I can

354
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,919
so word doesn't get out of your arrest.

355
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,004
We're trying to protect you.

356
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,589
I'm telling you

357
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,384
that reporters' eyes are on this case.

358
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,728
There were three in total,

359
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,147
and they had knives.

360
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,024
Are you okay?

361
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,193
Yes, I'm fine.

362
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,404
Su-ho got a nasty shock though.

363
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,283
I'll be requesting police protection, but…

364
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,993
He may have gotten away from them today,

365
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,745
but will this be enough
to keep him safe? What do you think?

366
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,123
It probably won't be.

367
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,332
Then what?

368
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,251
For starters, watch over Ringo.

369
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,128
Doctor Mo will be here too.

370
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,631
Okay, I'll be in touch.

371
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,263
Stay safe.

372
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,110
No, you can't.

373
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,029
This is not what we wanted.

374
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,072
You'll be in trouble for this too.

375
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,824
I need your help.

376
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,036
I know that this is
a difficult decision for you both.

377
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,206
We're fine with it.

378
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,000
It's not like we weren't prepared
for this and we're used to it too.

379
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,668
But you're different.

380
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,629
If you get caught,
there's no coming back from it.

381
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,756
You won't be able to be a lawyer anymore.

382
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,591
It's just a job.

383
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,092
I don't care.

384
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,473
To the Chairman, this is just a game.

385
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,893
And I'm going to change the rules.

386
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,315
EMPATHY DILEMMA
HOW THE LAWYER FACED THE TRUTH

387
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,025
Wow, look at the views.

388
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,027
People these days don't read the news.

389
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,658
LAWYER HAN MOO-YOUNG

390
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,746
Yes, Mr. Han.

391
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,414
Mr. Woo, do you still have the pass

392
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,792
to the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office?

393
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,043
Yes. Hold on.

394
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,836
I meant to return it.

395
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,797
Can I ask you for a favor?

396
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,090
Yes, of course.

397
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,640
It's me.

398
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,809
I borrowed a phone.

399
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,727
I need a lawyer.

400
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,979
Good thinking.

401
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,855
I don't think I can do this on my own.

402
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,816
Can you come?

403
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,527
Okay, I'll be right there.

404
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,501
-Attorney Han?
-Attorney Han?

405
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:30,338
What are you here for?
Why did you release the recording?

406
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,845
Did you know
your father was one of the killers?

407
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,846
Please comment.

408
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,682
A judge will review
the warrant at 8 p.m. tomorrow.

409
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,394
It's harsher on suspects
who don't have permanent addresses,

410
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,689
but you're denying the allegations
and suspected of owning a gun,

411
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,442
so you'll probably be taken into custody.

412
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,987
I'm really being taken into custody?

413
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,988
Yes.

414
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,906
It's most likely.

415
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,826
I told Da-jeong that I would end this.

416
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,498
But I lose again?

417
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,710
Ro-eum.

418
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,172
I heard about the article.

419
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,216
I'm sorry

420
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,761
about how things ended.

421
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,972
I don't think I can keep my promise

422
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,099
to be your lawyer.

423
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,144
It might be better this way.

424
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,481
You'll need
someone objective and practical,

425
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,776
not someone like me
who's tangled up in this case.

426
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,322
Are things so bad for me

427
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,531
that you're giving up?

428
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,492
It's not the worst.

429
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,369
I'm going to get you out of here.

430
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,625
So tell him what you know.

431
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,132
Did you kill her?

432
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,676
Answer me.

433
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,178
Jang Kyung-ja.

434
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,680
Did you kill her?

435
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,936
I want you to bring in

436
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,604
my accomplices.

437
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,980
What?

438
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,607
I had help.

439
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,110
Are you admitting to your crime?

440
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:19,114
The accomplices. We're asking you
to question Na Su-ho and Jeong Da-jeong.

441
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,491
My client won't be saying another word
until you do.

442
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,451
What do you think you're doing?

443
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,869
Is this a joke to you?

444
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,830
No. What about you?

445
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,000
Bring in the accomplices.

446
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,585
Have them confront each other.

447
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,796
That won't be possible.

448
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,383
Who knows what they'll be planning?

449
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,392
Yes, Mr. Han.

450
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:48,893
Da-jeong.

451
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,520
Did you get there okay?

452
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,438
Yes.

453
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,691
Mr. Go and I brought everything we needed.

454
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,861
You'll be summoned first thing tomorrow.

455
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,696
Come as soon as you get the call.

456
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,532
I will.

457
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,005
Lee Ro-eum has to be arrested

458
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,466
to write a huge story
on her and Han Moo-young.

459
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,551
The warrant will go through, right?

460
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,803
When does the news embargo lift?

461
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,013
Soon, I guess.

462
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,806
But don't you think it's odd?

463
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,435
If Han Moo-young's father killed
her parents, why doesn't she fire him?

464
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,021
Why does she still have him as her lawyer?

465
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,482
This is supposed to be a news embargo,

466
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,527
so watch what you're saying.

467
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,071
Why is everyone
talking about classified details?

468
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,116
And did none of you read my piece?
It has everything you need to know.

469
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,327
Han Moo-young didn't know about it
during the Ye Chung-sik case

470
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,912
or the damages…

471
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:52,081
Who reads articles by freelancers?
It wasn't even exclusive.

472
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,583
Weren't you fired?

473
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,294
Why haven't you returned your pass yet?

474
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,755
I'm here to do that now.

475
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,510
You came to return your pass
with all your gear?

476
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,846
A journalist should always be prepared.

477
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,256
Where am I being questioned today?

478
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,842
Interrogation rooms are inside.

479
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,593
What's the room number?

480
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:50,014
Last time I was here, it was so freezing
that my face almost got paralyzed.

481
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,182
I'm not kidding.

482
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,476
You'll be in 712 on the 7th floor.

483
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,019
Thanks.

484
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,563
What do you have in your bag?

485
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,481
Just my laptop.

486
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,317
The prosecutor gave us
specific instructions…

487
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,820
We'll hold on to your laptop
until you get back.

488
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:05,905
All right.

489
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,869
Thank you.

490
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,830
Thank you.

491
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,999
Name.

492
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,209
Jeong Da-jeong.

493
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:20,920
Occupation?

494
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,297
I run an auto repair shop.

495
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,716
And address?

496
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,593
It's the same as my comic store.

497
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,761
I see you have a record.

498
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,263
Yes, I do.

499
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,223
How do you know Lee Ro-eum?

500
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,727
We grew up together
at the same foundation.

501
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,895
Red Eye, you mean?

502
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,979
Yes.

503
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,564
And what did you learn to do there?

504
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,065
Hacking.

505
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,693
Did they also teach you how to shoot?

506
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,487
Do I have to answer that?

507
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,366
Were you part of exposing
Navis Well-being's stock manipulation?

508
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,618
Yes.

509
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,494
You helped Lee Ro-eum?

510
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,913
We did it together.

511
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,166
Did you kill Jang Kyung-ja

512
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,793
together too?

513
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,796
Did Ro-eum say she killed her?

514
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,008
If she named you as an accomplice,

515
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,052
it's good as admitting to it.

516
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,555
If that's what she said, it must be true.

517
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,390
Then do you admit it?

518
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,309
If she is the real killer.

519
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,604
Do you have proof that Ro-eum killed her?

520
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,651
Did you help Ro-eum kill her or not?

521
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,028
If you don't have any proof,

522
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,947
why should I confess to anything?

523
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,955
Lee Ro-eum says she'll confess if they do,

524
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,166
and they say they'll confess
if Lee Ro-eum does…

525
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,086
They're running us around in circles.

526
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,588
And they're not demanding to leave.

527
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,758
Still no word on the warrant?

528
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,892
Sir.

529
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,060
I just confirmed

530
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,438
that Na Su-ho's probation officer
is the same as Lee Ro-eum's.

531
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,608
Call him in.

532
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,734
Yes, sir.

533
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,330
I thought you'd question me
in the kind of room

534
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,666
you see in dramas with a two-way mirror.

535
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,172
You're in charge of Lee Ro-eum
and Na Su-ho, aren't you?

536
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,382
Yes, I am.

537
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,634
And you must know she's been arrested.

538
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,677
I do.

539
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,304
Na Su-ho is being questioned as a witness.

540
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,390
He could be complicit in a murder.

541
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,975
As their probation officer,

542
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,352
were you aware of their conspiracy
to commit murder?

543
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,312
I'm so insulted.

544
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,566
Do I look like someone
who wouldn't have reported it

545
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,317
if I had known anything about it?

546
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,781
So, you had no problems with them?
With either Lee Ro-eum or Na Su-ho?

547
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,785
What was so urgent
that you put out a BOLO on her?

548
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,871
It was all done by the book.

549
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,207
Lee Ro-eum and her accomplices

550
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,793
hacked into Navis Well-being…

551
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,004
If you're investigating Navis Well-being,

552
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,465
shouldn't you be investigating
their fraud?

553
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,677
And not the people who exposed it?

554
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,845
On what authority?

555
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,307
What authority did they have
to dig into Navis Well-being?

556
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,268
Are they prosecutors? Or the police?

557
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,895
Who gave them the authority?

558
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,897
Whose side are you on?

559
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,816
Not on the side of a murderer,
that's for sure.

560
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,151
Ha…

561
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,945
Shouldn't they be presumed innocent
until found guilty?

562
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,826
If you didn't know about it,
that makes you incompetent.

563
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,205
But if you did know and ignored it,
that makes you an accomplice.

564
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,582
Considering your job,

565
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,918
just having overlooked it
could be a problem.

566
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,462
If you tell me

567
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,925
what you know right here and now,
I'll make sure you don't get penalized.

568
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,802
This is your last chance.

569
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,221
I don't find that acceptable.

570
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,848
As long as I'm my mother's son,

571
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,520
I also need to be accountable
for the crimes those people committed.

572
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,357
What are you talking about?

573
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,112
My mother was one of the people at Red Eye

574
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,697
who turned Lee Ro-eum and the others
into criminals.

575
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,616
Her name is Professor Shin Seo-ra.

576
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,620
You probably know her if you had a TV
in your home in the 90s. That's my mother.

577
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,581
It's hard to explain
who Lee Ro-eum and Na Su-ho are

578
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,208
without getting into Red Eye.

579
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,337
Including the crimes they've committed
and the ones you're suspecting them of.

580
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,588
So,

581
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,633
Professor Shin is an important witness.

582
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,389
She won't come of her own accord.

583
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,101
But if you tell her
her son is being questioned

584
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,769
for helping the Red Eye Kids,

585
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,730
she'll come running.

586
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,242
Professor Shin, right?

587
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,036
Is it true you were a consultant
for Red Eye Foundation?

588
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,247
Are you being questioned
in regards to Red Eye?

589
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,250
Is it true you kept
the kids locked up and brainwashed them?

590
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,668
Please comment.

591
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,472
How deeply

592
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,266
is Yo-han involved?

593
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,852
Is it serious?

594
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,158
How could you make me
come to the prosecutors' office?

595
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,827
Is this your way of acting out?

596
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,497
Did it inconvenience you that much?

597
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,709
Some people spent ten years
behind bars because of you.

598
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,545
You came here because of me.

599
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,548
Because your own child is precious.

600
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,385
Now when people talk about Red Eye,

601
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,764
your name will always come up as well.

602
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,851
You're the one who called them?

603
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,436
The reporters?

604
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,746
Once the warrant is issued,
you'll be taken to a detention center.

605
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,676
Counselor.

606
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,843
Anything more to say?

607
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,512
No, your honor.

608
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,348
Are you sure?

609
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,600
Yes.

610
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,690
Do you feel that you've been wronged,
or do you have anything to say?

611
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,779
Please wait until a decision is made.

612
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,408
Even after a warrant is issued,
you may file an objection.

613
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,411
Put the cuffs on her.

614
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,572
Excuse me. I need to use the rest room…

615
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,537
The transport vehicle is here?

616
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,455
Yes.

617
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,041
Did you hear that?

618
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:59,420
The warrant has been issued,
and you'll be taken to a detention center.

619
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,214
Come on out.

620
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,765
You're walking me to the car yourself?

621
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,769
I had hoped
you would cooperate a little more.

622
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,524
All day, I asked people if they helped you

623
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,485
and why they did,

624
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,820
but I got nothing.

625
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,450
That's their way of helping me.

626
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,495
Aren't you curious

627
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,414
about why people help others?

628
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,749
To pay back a debt?

629
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,918
Because their interests align?

630
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,504
Because they don't
want to be a bad person?

631
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,671
Or…

632
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,549
is it really because of empathy?

633
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,722
What about you?

634
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,599
Why did you help me?

635
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,603
I'm Ryu Jae-hyeok.

636
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,688
I'm with the criminal division at SCDPO.

637
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,026
I hoped that with my help,
the outcome would change.

638
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,364
Instead of the outcome changing me.

639
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,245
That day,

640
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,123
I went to kill Jang Kyung-ja.

641
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,925
I'm only doing this…

642
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,972
to protect the people I care about.

643
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,117
I never wanted you to die. I just…

644
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,703
I just…

645
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,583
wanted you to help me. Was that so hard?

646
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,210
It was the same with me.

647
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,673
Actually,

648
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,884
I don't know.

649
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,678
Maybe I didn't want to.

650
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,182
I was glad to hear
that you wanted to leave,

651
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,144
but it was insulting too.

652
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,648
While you were in prison, I was

653
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,943
trapped in that night as well.

654
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,945
How was it for you?

655
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,032
I've never regretted it.

656
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,368
I killed my husband that day
because I wanted to

657
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,705
and because I wanted
to truly own everything I had,

658
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:40,915
so I kept it.

659
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,752
Was it worth it?

660
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,088
Was that bastard worth it?

661
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,381
I made

662
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,592
him worthy.

663
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,221
I gave him everything.

664
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,729
Do you know why I hated you so much?

665
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,899
Because you're like Jay.

666
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,611
You understand him naturally,

667
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,448
and you easily found a way
into his impenetrable mind,

668
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,450
but not me.

669
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,952
I had to work hard at it,

670
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,496
and it came with a price.

671
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,958
If threats were what it took to have him,

672
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,961
then that's what I had to do.

673
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,509
You crazy bitch, that was your reason?

674
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,679
What about my parents?

675
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,306
What about the kids?

676
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,726
While you were protecting the bastard
who only you found worthy,

677
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,771
do you know how many people died?

678
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,317
You may not have killed them yourself,

679
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,069
but didn't you feel guilty at all?

680
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,241
My parents were innocent,
but they were killed.

681
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,120
At least,

682
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,833
you should've given them time

683
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,085
to live with regret.

684
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,513
It was regretful.

685
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,395
Do you want an apology?

686
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,531
No.

687
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,036
If I want to meet the Chairman again,

688
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,705
I have to kill you.

689
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,625
Those are the rules now.

690
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,670
It's the only way.

691
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,633
So, if you want to live,

692
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,551
think well and hard.

693
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,807
Think of a way for me to get to him
without killing you.

694
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,810
We won't be leaving this place
until we do.

695
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,733
Is it true?

696
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,153
You have no reason

697
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,365
to lie to me anymore.

698
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,327
Did Jay really tell you to kill me?

699
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,371
You?

700
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,201
I'm sending someone over.

701
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,619
I'm sending her with my phone

702
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,247
and my business card
with my signature on it,

703
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,456
so when she arrives,

704
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,333
open my safe for her.

705
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,710
Give her everything

706
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,421
that's in there.

707
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,048
Yes.

708
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,092
Everything, no strings attached.

709
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,721
Make sure she gets it,
especially if I die.

710
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,688
That was the general manager
at Haemyeong Hotel.

711
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,399
Use this to open the safe.

712
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,775
Take everything inside.

713
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,697
With it, you can prove one thing.

714
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,491
That I answered to Ji Seung-don.

715
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,535
The fact that Jay was the one
using that name

716
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,162
is something you'll have to prove.

717
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,873
Whether you investigate
or hack information with it,

718
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,334
do what you have to do.

719
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:01,884
I'm not doing this for you.

720
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,386
And I'm not doing this
because I don't trust Jay.

721
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,263
I just need to hear it

722
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,224
from him for myself.

723
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,351
I deserve that much at least.

724
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,397
I'm curious…

725
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,401
You had no reason to let me live, and yet…

726
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,990
Let's not see each other ever again,

727
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,533
Ro-eum.

728
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,706
Is this true?

729
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,044
Why didn't you tell me when I asked?

730
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:40,380
If I had, would you have believed me?

731
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:46,178
Besides, I still have some work to do
before I hand over that evidence.

732
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,013
You'll get it soon.

733
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,807
In the way you want it.

734
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,936
Also, considering my bad experience
with them in the past,

735
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,979
I couldn't fully trust the prosecutors.

736
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,233
Even ten years ago, you people arrested me

737
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,860
based on circumstantial evidence
and suspicions alone.

738
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,116
I never expected to feel this way,

739
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,619
but I had hoped a little

740
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,955
that you would know the truth

741
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,582
without me having to pull a con.

742
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,003
So this is

743
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,005
somewhat

744
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,174
on you people too.

745
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,343
What?

746
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,708
Once the warrant is issued,
you'll be taken to a detention center.

747
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,962
It's locked from the other side.

748
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,847
Lee Ro-eum is taking the emergency stairs
from the fifth floor.

749
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,974
Stop her from getting out.

750
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,269
Seal off the stairs and all exits!

751
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,024
3 HOURS BEFORE THE ARREST

752
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,808
So, you took it?

753
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,101
Kyung-ja's cell phone.

754
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,646
What are you going to do with it?

755
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,522
What did you do…

756
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:05,942
to her?

757
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,321
What do you think?

758
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,200
What do you think will happen now?

759
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,161
Ro-eum.

760
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,246
I meant it

761
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,375
when I said I'd get you back.

762
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,182
Jang Kyung-ja is dead.

763
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,684
I might get arrested.

764
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,354
Why would you?

765
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,730
He'll make it that way.

766
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,148
He's done it before.

767
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,275
No. We have Mr. Han now…

768
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,944
I don't have an alibi,

769
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,905
and I have a record,
so it's likely I'll be arrested.

770
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,366
In the meantime,

771
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,369
there's something you need to do.

772
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:05,377
This is everything Jang Kyung-ja
gathered on Ji Seung-don.

773
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,255
Find proof that Jay is connected…

774
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,132
No, it doesn't even have to be that.

775
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,175
Just find as much as you can

776
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,469
so that we can make a deal
with the Chairman.

777
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,847
This is the only option

778
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,391
we have left.

779
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,852
I'm asking you for one last favor.

780
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,021
Help me…

781
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,943
so that I can end this, Da-jeong.

782
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,037
How far along are you
with what Ro-eum asked you to do?

783
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,040
It'll be ready by tonight.

784
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,918
Is Ro-eum really going to be arrested?

785
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,754
The warrant will be issued?

786
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,965
We're going to get Ro-eum out.

787
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,676
And by that, you mean…

788
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,470
I'm going to break her out

789
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,804
from the prosecutors' office.

790
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,348
So tell him what you know.

791
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,641
Tell him

792
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,311
that your accomplices are
Da-jeong and Su-ho

793
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,272
so that they'll be summoned
tomorrow morning.

794
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,026
They'll come and prepare your escape.

795
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:14,654
The way from holding to the basement
parking lot is the best route.

796
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,491
Once the warrant is issued,
you'll get taken out that way.

797
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:21,787
Once you escape,
those two will be detained on the spot.

798
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,080
They'll be protected.
So that they're safe.

799
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,459
I'll prepare what you asked.

800
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,421
So go and end this.

801
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,968
I thought you'd stop me from going alone.

802
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:40,263
This is something
you need to end yourself.

803
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,433
Only you can do it.

804
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,561
Thanks.

805
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,646
For your support.

806
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,067
Tell them I'm the one who made you

807
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:53,860
do it.

808
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,321
Okay.

809
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,533
Mr. Woo, do you still have the pass

810
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,952
to the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office?

811
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,131
INFORMATION ON FLOORS, ACCESS

812
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,509
LAWYER HAN

813
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,721
A WARRANT FOR LEE RO-EUM'S ARREST
HAS BEEN ISSUED

814
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,560
I need to use the restroom…

815
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:21,948
Hello?

816
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,012
What do you mean, you can't find her?

817
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,476
Check the CCTV footage.

818
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:35,397
Find out where Jeong Da-jeong
and Na Su-ho were in this building today.

819
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,459
Police!

820
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,678
Ringo will stay where he is
but in a different room.

821
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,431
Da-jeong and Su-ho, go to the hospice.

822
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,725
Take Yoo-il and Yoo-neung
instead of Ringo.

823
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,770
Get admitted under Ringo's name.
Once you do, I'll call the police.

824
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,697
By the way,

825
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,742
you might be getting some calls

826
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,827
about the research you did.

827
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,499
I got so mad and called the reporters…

828
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,668
I'm sorry about that.

829
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,628
Because of my foul temper…

830
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,756
Don't worry about it.

831
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,551
If you feel any guilt

832
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,721
about the professor
over what you did today,

833
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,264
give me a call.

834
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,599
I'll provide counseling.

835
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,315
Wow, it's late. Don't you have to go?

836
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,025
Yes, I should be going.

837
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,738
I hope that everyone is safe.

838
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,749
It's true.

839
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,335
I have important documents

840
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,089
which will be released if I die.

841
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,216
I'm not lying.

842
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,470
Everything that has
Ji Seung-dong's name on it.

843
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,057
Navis' earnings were
laundered under his name.

844
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,102
They'll soon realize
that the name is a front,

845
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:41,106
and once they investigate who's behind it,

846
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,233
the net will close down

847
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:44,943
on you.

848
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:53,952
Come with me.

849
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,704
I'm giving you a chance.

850
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,416
Are you threatening me?

851
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,294
I'm not doing this to attack you.

852
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,464
I wanted to protect you and me.

853
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,260
It was the same with the notebook.
I just held on to it.

854
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:13,638
I may have hidden it from you,
but I didn't show it to anyone.

855
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,515
It was the only way to protect us.

856
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,269
Kyung-ae.

857
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,606
Do you even believe what you're saying?

858
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,444
Why won't you believe me? Why?

859
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,654
If you don't trust me, who will?

860
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:30,864
Then,

861
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,115
what about you?

862
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,283
Do you trust me?

863
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,953
I do.

864
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,664
So you can trust me too.

865
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,125
Drink this.

866
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,087
If you trust me,

867
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,839
prove it.

868
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,657
Did you really

869
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,078
send Ro-eum to kill me?

870
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,456
You couldn't even bother
to kill me yourself?

871
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,751
Do I mean so little to you?

872
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,670
You had to send Ro-eum? How could you?

873
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:45,230
Do you think anyone else
will love you as much as I do?

874
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,944
Can you really…

875
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,157
live without me?

876
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,287
Will you really…

877
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,707
be fine without me?

878
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,336
You bastard.

879
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:37,717
Jeong Da-jeong.

880
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,678
You're under arrest
for helping Lee Ro-eum escape.

881
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,805
-Cuff her.
-Yes, sir.

882
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:55,902
Na Su-ho.

883
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,655
You're under arrest
for helping Lee Ro-eum escape.

884
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,636
There's no answer from the Messenger.

885
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,605
I'LL GO BACK TO MY PLACE.

886
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,668
Can you also install a GPS

887
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,503
on Ro-eum's phone?

888
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:56,921
Not an app, a device.

889
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,215
And what's next?

890
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,510
I'm going where she goes.

891
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,514
I'm not going to make her
fight on her down.

892
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,267
You said

893
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:13,771
you'd be there once I ended all of this.

894
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,902
If it's me the Chairman wants so badly,

895
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,653
there is a weapon I could use.

896
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,030
Meet Lee Jay.

897
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,115
And see the proof that it's him.

898
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,116
Are you insane?

899
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,869
You pulled something this rash
over that tiny possibility?

900
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,413
Once Ro-eum sends the signal,
get to her on time.

901
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,623
Unlike Ro-eum,

902
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,083
I don't care if you live or die.

903
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,418
You think I'm like you?

904
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,377
Me?

905
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,921
I'm sure that's what you hoped.

906
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,464
You'll never get away from me.

907
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,758
Doesn't it excite you?

908
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,343
You like choices.
