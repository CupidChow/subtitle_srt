1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,267
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,321
Didn't you find the USB drive?

3
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,031
I did.

4
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,157
And the files on it?

5
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,242
I read them.

6
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,829
And you still came for me?

7
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,332
What would you like me to do?

8
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,503
Why did you give that to me?

9
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,923
I felt sorry for you.

10
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,968
You were trying to help me
and work with me,

11
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,679
having no idea I was the one
who conned your family,

12
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,265
so I felt bad for you.

13
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,517
Same here.

14
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,645
I'm here because I feel sorry for you too.

15
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,399
Go wash up.

16
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,319
Can you forgive anything
if you feel sorry for them?

17
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,572
Do you want to talk?

18
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,615
Fine, let's talk.

19
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,951
You don't have to get angry.

20
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,205
What did you do with the gun?

21
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,875
Did you really shoot Na-sa?

22
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,920
Yes.

23
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,505
Is that why you took it?

24
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,216
I took it to take out anyone
who got in the way,

25
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,677
and he got in the way.

26
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,430
Mr. Go is looking for Na-sa as we speak.

27
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,641
He's combing through the entire hotel.

28
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,726
Did you kill him?

29
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,019
Then tell me

30
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,980
so that I can call the police,
not your probation officer.

31
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,128
Yes?

32
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,922
I brought Ro-eum back.

33
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,759
Thank you, Da-jeong.

34
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,534
Come and sit.

35
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,079
You refused to go to the hospital.

36
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,331
I can't let you go to bed
like that, so sit.

37
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,467
Who did this to you?

38
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,179
I don't know his name.

39
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,068
What are you looking at?

40
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,907
You haven't answered my question.

41
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,201
Why are you doing this?

42
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,494
For me?

43
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,290
I've always answered your questions.

44
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,806
Did you think
if you showed me the files,

45
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,350
that I would let all of this go?

46
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,315
Did you believe I would give up

47
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,984
if I knew the full story behind a con

48
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,612
where the statute of limitations
has expired?

49
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,532
I don't want to be forgiven

50
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,784
as a perpetrator.

51
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,205
Isn't owning up to past wrongs
basically the same as an apology?

52
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,334
Honestly, I was angry and felt betrayed,

53
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,628
so I was conflicted,

54
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,089
but you were only 14 then,

55
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,759
so I don't think I can fault you
for what you did.

56
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,722
It's actually given me a clear reason

57
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,101
to see this through until the end.

58
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,436
That's why I'm sorry

59
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,522
for being so late.

60
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,854
Please leave a message after the beep…

61
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,504
You were all fired up when
you were writing up those warrants.

62
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,214
What happened?

63
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,176
Someone's here to see you.

64
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,707
I know everything about you now.

65
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,917
I doubt it.

66
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,170
And you know everything about me.

67
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,087
Not really.

68
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,674
Doesn't this make us
kind of like co-workers now?

69
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,261
I don't think so.

70
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,014
-Honestly, as your guardian…
-Probation officer.

71
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,644
This is really awkward.

72
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,814
Professor Seo told me
she had only consulted briefly.

73
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,984
Based on what I know about her,

74
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,444
she's not a liar.

75
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,072
She's just really shamelessly bad.

76
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,992
Did she…

77
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,911
hurt you?

78
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,121
My mother.

79
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,839
I only had a few therapy sessions
with her before joining the foundation.

80
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,050
I didn't have much contact
with her after that.

81
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,765
On behalf of my mother,

82
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,518
I would like to apologize.

83
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,983
I would like to say

84
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,819
that my mother has changed, but…

85
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,198
I'll just

86
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,159
try to upset her even more than
I do now.

87
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,664
Why is everyone apologizing to me?

88
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,002
Especially people who have no reason to.

89
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,629
Well, I think

90
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,173
it's because of your attitude.

91
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,636
You know what you did was wrong.

92
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,682
And you're trying not to drag others
into the mud with you.

93
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,227
You know what Mr. Han said?

94
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,273
He said someone had to help get you out.

95
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,483
And I

96
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,028
agree with him.

97
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,868
You know you only have a month, right?

98
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,377
I'll be expecting you to return.

99
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,341
Okay.

100
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,196
She didn't care about the destination.

101
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,239
She just wanted the earliest train out.

102
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,538
Why aren't you saying anything?

103
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,831
Did you two have a fight?

104
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,874
Of course not.

105
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,668
She probably just needs some time.

106
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,798
She'll probably be back within
a month due to regulations,

107
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,218
but it's actually not that hard to move
addresses if you report it.

108
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,179
She wouldn't

109
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,223
not come back, would she?

110
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,017
Have you found Su-ho?

111
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,396
No, he's disappeared.

112
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,024
I'm searching so don't worry.

113
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,071
I think I'm way too nice.

114
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,490
I searched that huge hotel

115
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,867
just because you asked,

116
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,496
ignoring requests
to see a warrant for two whole hours.

117
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,582
Some people filed complaints
to the station,

118
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,292
so I had to write up an apology.

119
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,837
Ow, my hand.

120
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,883
I didn't think you'd search
from door to door.

121
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,431
But thank you. And I'm sorry.

122
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,640
Sure.

123
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,685
I wanted to ask you something.

124
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:09,979
What is it?

125
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,358
I've been

126
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,527
having trouble sleeping lately.

127
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,696
Do you know why?

128
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,656
Is that because of me too?

129
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,949
Come on.

130
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,742
Do you have an over-inflated ego?

131
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,411
It's because of Professor Shin.

132
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,122
-Oh.
-Anyway,

133
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,459
if the hospital you go to is any good,

134
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,795
I wanted to ask you
to introduce me to your doctor.

135
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,797
Is your insomnia that bad?

136
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,092
Don't get me started.
You haven't met Professor Shin, have you?

137
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,596
If you ever have to work late,
let me know.

138
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,806
I'll set up a meeting.

139
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,183
LEE RO-EUM

140
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,420
And the alcohol?

141
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,385
Thanks.

142
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,845
Did you

143
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,889
think about what I said?

144
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,642
I'm sure the deadline is coming up.

145
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,311
Don't you need more hands?

146
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,190
I mean, I know how the business runs.

147
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,067
It's obvious.

148
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,736
What was the next step of the plan?

149
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,156
I don't know.

150
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,075
My job was to steal the notebook.

151
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,954
What was on it?

152
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,915
Didn't Jang Kyung-ja… I mean,

153
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,459
Ms. Jang say anything?

154
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,714
Wait.

155
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,090
Put in a good word for me

156
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,259
with Ms. Jang.

157
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,388
Tell her I'm good with everything,
and that I'll be loyal to her.

158
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,937
Aren't you going back to Ro-eum?

159
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,773
If I go back,

160
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,152
Ro-eum would kill me.

161
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,460
Miss, this is the last bus.

162
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,342
Ma'am.

163
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,928
This gets warm if you shake it.

164
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,929
Shake it like this.

165
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,349
And you should set up over there.
It's too windy here.

166
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,101
Drink the coffee before it gets cold.

167
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,521
Thank you.

168
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,712
Don't you get it?

169
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:50,843
From now on, the Chairman

170
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,929
will start to wonder
what you've been hiding.

171
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,711
What was Lee Ro-eum trying to steal?

172
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,713
How should I know?

173
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,466
All I had was a few gold bars,

174
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,843
and some jewelry.

175
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,138
It was a family safe that my parents had.

176
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,432
Nothing much was in it.

177
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,810
You should provide an answer
that the Chairman finds acceptable.

178
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,313
You shouldn't be asking me then.

179
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,565
Ask Ro-eum.

180
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,277
Don't you think this needless contention

181
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,072
is exactly what she wants?

182
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,618
Is that what you want me to tell him?

183
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,333
I think

184
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,337
she believed that the ledger I handed
over ten years ago was in there.

185
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,757
Other than that, I have no clue
what she was after.

186
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,055
And yes, that's my final answer.

187
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,601
I can't make something up
just because you grill me.

188
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,271
Director Ma will be out soon.

189
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,775
You need to bring him into your company.

190
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,822
Why should I

191
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,325
do that?

192
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,955
The deadline is coming up soon, isn't it?

193
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,418
I'll take care of it.

194
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,796
I don't need Director Ma.

195
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,508
It's not your decision to make.

196
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,761
The next instructions

197
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,097
will be texted to you.

198
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,202
It's you. The former student.

199
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,374
Wow, fancy seeing you here.

200
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,668
Going somewhere? The hair salon?

201
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,628
Or church?

202
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,589
Or do you live in this neighborhood?

203
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,048
It is a good neighborhood.

204
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,646
Good morning, Doctor.

205
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,064
Why are you…

206
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,399
Do you work here?

207
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,819
So, you're a doctor here.

208
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,113
I'm sorry,
but I don't think this will work.

209
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,573
Excuse me?

210
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,909
I'll recommend another doctor.

211
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,952
Tell me what kind of therapy you need.

212
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,580
I'd rather not get a recommendation

213
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,790
from someone who had
Professor Seo as a teacher.

214
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,877
Then there's no reason for me
to be your therapist either.

215
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,128
Well,

216
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:18,425
I was actually here to talk about
why I have so little trust in my mother.

217
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,135
There are a lot of good doctors.

218
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,387
I don't really
expect much from psychiatrists,

219
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,722
as long as they have ears.

220
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,848
Don't worry.

221
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,350
They all have ears.

222
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,062
Why won't you take me on?

223
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,023
I don't do counseling for acquaintances.

224
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,775
Are we acquaintances?

225
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,195
Should we get something to eat?

226
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,571
I know a place.

227
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,281
How about it?

228
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,408
Business or pleasure?

229
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,248
You're straight as an arrow, aren't you?

230
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,125
It's making me even more determined.

231
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,628
Why are you so protective
of Professor Shin?

232
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,338
I'm not being protective.

233
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,217
I just don't want to talk about her
with her son.

234
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,468
It's inappropriate.

235
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,765
Have you ever heard of the Red Eye Kids?

236
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,394
Professor Shin was a consultant
for the Red Eye Foundation.

237
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:14,189
She selected scholarship students
who were then trained as criminals.

238
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,151
It was something that went on there.

239
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,363
Anyway…

240
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,991
I'm not trying to talk behind
her back or anything,

241
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,618
but is it okay for a doctor
to do something like that?

242
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,577
Answer me that.

243
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:35,210
She said they were gifted children,
but unstable because of poor upbringing.

244
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,338
I don't understand.

245
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,300
What exactly did you learn from her
in school?

246
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,884
Was she even a good teacher?

247
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,101
Thank you.

248
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,979
You should take your lab coat off.

249
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,815
This is so red.

250
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,197
Excuse me, can we get an apron here?

251
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,282
Sure.

252
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,329
Try some healthy
arrowroot juice and this massager.

253
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,458
Would you like to try this massager?

254
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,084
Would you…

255
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,378
Would you like to try…

256
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,344
You're working so hard.

257
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,556
It's only been a month, but you're good.

258
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,099
Thank you.

259
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,517
Oh, by the way.

260
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,436
You live with your parents, right?

261
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,562
When you go home,

262
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,023
take this with you.

263
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,317
Thank you.

264
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,986
You gave me too much though.

265
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,364
It's because you're such a hard worker.

266
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:50,202
You know how you want to give
something nice to good people.

267
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,914
And I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

268
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,084
but I heard you asking the manager
for an advance.

269
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,003
Oh…

270
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,173
Something was going on at home.

271
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,177
It's okay, don't worry about it.

272
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,638
I know how it's like.

273
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,559
That's why I wanted to ask…
What are you doing tomorrow?

274
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,644
Tomorrow?

275
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,979
It's my day off.

276
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,315
Oh, then,

277
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,943
there's a good lecture
at our local center.

278
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,236
You should come.

279
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,530
A lecture?

280
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,572
Yes.

281
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,992
It's not that long and they even
give you a gift certificate.

282
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,577
For a department store.

283
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,371
Oh.

284
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,456
It'll help with your job too.

285
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,457
And you never know.

286
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,793
The company is hiring full-time staff.

287
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,004
It'll be much better than working
as a contract worker.

288
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,217
-Oh, okay then…
-Good.

289
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,552
I'll be there.

290
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,179
-Okay.
-Thank you.

291
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,180
Of course.

292
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,185
Yes, Mr. Han.

293
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,020
Do you have some time?

294
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,314
I need you.

295
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,191
You sound so dramatic.

296
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,569
Being single, I have some free time.

297
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,112
Lucky for you.

298
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,989
I actually need some investigators too.

299
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,908
I was thinking
about asking Prosecutor Ryu.

300
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,118
Ryu Jae-hyeok?

301
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,208
I'm not sure if he's capable.

302
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,337
I can look into it.

303
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,631
I just need to find out
if there are any illegalities,

304
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,134
legal issues,
or outstanding warrants, right?

305
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,596
Says who?

306
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,891
Mr. Woo?

307
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,893
Are you with him right now?

308
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,688
Oh.

309
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,983
You came all this way?

310
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,067
You must be so busy.

311
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,235
Yes well,

312
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,237
I have

313
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,115
some unresolved trauma
about being left out.

314
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,491
Hey.

315
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,827
What's all that?

316
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,622
I put together

317
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,790
what I had and what Mr. Woo found out.

318
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,959
Just read them here.

319
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,003
Don't take them outside.

320
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,298
I'm finally getting to see
what I only ever heard about.

321
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,299
Oh, and…

322
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,342
It's not a lot

323
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,929
but I printed out what I could find
on Navis Well-being.

324
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,389
Wow. In this digital age…

325
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,558
What era are you two from?

326
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,061
Now, this is called a projector.

327
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,355
It's totally new.
This is what I'll be using.

328
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,273
I prepared a presentation all night.

329
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,277
So, Red Eye and Navis Well-being
are one and the same?

330
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,529
And the head is someone
called the Chairman?

331
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,697
That's right.

332
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,115
There's one more.

333
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,327
-Darusa International.
-What?

334
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,038
The head of Darusa International
went to prison.

335
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,498
Yes, Ma Kang-su.

336
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,541
He was basically a salesman for Red Eye.

337
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,795
In 2007, he was the head
of Gyeongjae Industrial.

338
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:52,092
And the leader of a con
where the Red Eye Kids were first used.

339
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,137
Moyang Foods Factory Scam.

340
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,474
Yes, it involved Darusa ten years ago.

341
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,560
The manager took the fall?

342
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,229
And the company went bankrupt.

343
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,065
Yes, Han Jae-seok the factory manager

344
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,859
was my father.

345
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,618
Ma Kang-su is the only man
who was involved

346
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,538
in all of Red Eye's projects
other than Navis Well-being.

347
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,958
When he gets out of prison,
and he joins Navis,

348
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,168
all we have to do is track his activities

349
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,212
to bring Red Eye down.

350
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,549
He got ten years.

351
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,719
He still has a few years left
before he gets out.

352
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,721
He was released on parole a while ago.

353
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,014
I quit.

354
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,855
I didn't want you to be uncomfortable,
so I got you a separate car.

355
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,860
I'm not uncomfortable at all.

356
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,667
I heard you were robbed.

357
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,837
By Lee Ro-eum.

358
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,548
She's something else.

359
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,177
Was it 15 years ago?

360
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,889
I was surprised by how smart she was
for someone so young.

361
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,853
Can't we bring her back in?

362
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,189
To Navis Well-being.

363
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,277
By the way,

364
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,989
you look very different from
when I saw you last.

365
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,456
What a beautiful day.

366
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,296
Gentlemen,

367
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,590
what do you know about Navis Well-being?

368
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,053
They run a pyramid business,
Red Eye's main area of expertise.

369
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,262
That's right.

370
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,307
But what's interesting

371
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,852
is that they run an individual pyramid
and a business pyramid scheme.

372
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,480
The lowest level members have access

373
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,565
to the least amount of brands.

374
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,859
Once an individual member
reaches the top level,

375
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,444
they have access to all the brands

376
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,530
in the company's pyramid
at a membership price.

377
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,698
This is just the basic background.

378
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,036
No one knows how much money
you need to level up,

379
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,205
or how much money members actually earn,

380
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,332
or what the dividends are.

381
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,501
But it's a legal business.

382
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,253
Let's try to be objective.

383
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:38,425
If we didn't know anything about Red Eye,
would this company have seemed dangerous?

384
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,551
I don't think so.

385
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,386
They're an extremely successful company,

386
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,888
and everything they do is legal.

387
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,725
I mean,
there are a few suits against them,

388
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,227
but all companies have those.

389
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,271
And most have

390
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,064
either been settled, or dropped.

391
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,357
Okay.

392
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,111
According to a friend
who works for an internet company,

393
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,029
Navis Well-beings spends a fortune

394
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,449
in marketing regarding searches
and posts about them.

395
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,325
They thoroughly manage the comments.

396
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,620
But some of their products advertised
by celebrities and influencers

397
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,913
had mold in them,

398
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,331
and the cosmetic devices

399
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,460
turned out to be faulty
or had foreign substances in them.

400
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,919
They caused a fuss for a while,

401
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,589
but none of them actually led to a lawsuit
as he said.

402
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,716
So…

403
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,051
Since Red Eye has been around
for a long time,

404
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,013
they must have connections
in the political and business circles.

405
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,974
What would we need for the prosecution

406
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,018
or the press to move in?

407
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,937
A whistle blower, at the least.

408
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,939
When something happens,

409
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,442
we'll move in with a warrant.

410
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,448
Did you enjoy the lecture, Ho-jung?

411
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,533
Did it motivate you?

412
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,493
Yes.

413
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,953
You're still very young.

414
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,413
Have you graduated from college?

415
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,249
Yes, I went to a two-year college.

416
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,794
Your parents must've
retired by now. Right?

417
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,254
And you're the eldest?

418
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,255
An only child?

419
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,549
Oh… Yes.

420
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,551
You must feel a lot of responsibility.

421
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,261
I'm the eldest too.

422
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,222
I didn't go a fancy school either,

423
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,475
and before I joined this company,
I was basically a loser at home.

424
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,935
But now,

425
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,312
my parents brag about me all the time.

426
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,274
-Relax, and eat something.
-Thank you.

427
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,780
If Navis is so thorough about their image,

428
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,491
how did you find these cases?

429
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,993
As expected, you are very sharp.

430
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,664
There's a mysterious blogger
who hates on Navis Well-being

431
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,499
and goes by the name of Ho-jung.

432
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,876
It's a private blog,
but this is me you're talking too.

433
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,711
I got lucky and managed to scrape it.

434
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,464
The blog summarizes
the cases regarding damages?

435
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,549
It does.

436
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,260
This person is the most famous
regarding pyramid schemes.

437
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,011
If we look at the dates on the data,

438
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:51,266
they attack Navis Well-being from
its early days as if they know something.

439
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,518
Then we need to find that blogger first.

440
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,437
I'll try to find a way
to access that blog.

441
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,480
Hang on.

442
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,358
If this person is so secretive,
how are we supposed to find them?

443
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,874
Looking for Ro-eum?

444
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,046
You know her?

445
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,965
I'm her lawyer.

446
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,176
Where can I find her?

447
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,598
What is this about?

448
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,393
I think she needs my help.

449
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,769
And you are?

450
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,397
Tell her Jay is looking for her
and she'll know.

451
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,484
If you see her before I do, that is.

452
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,739
Will you give her the message?

453
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,658
Yes, I will.

454
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,536
You're Attorney Han Moo-young.

455
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,915
You know me?

456
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,291
Su-ho told me about you.

457
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,710
That you've been looking after Ro-eum.

458
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,128
Looking after her?

459
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,463
She's not a child.

460
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,885
Right, I keep forgetting.

461
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,262
She's not a child anymore.

462
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,014
No.

463
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,644
So I don't think she'll need
your help either.

464
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,942
It sounds like you won't be
giving her my message.

465
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,863
I'll find her myself later.

466
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,322
MISSED CALL FROM ATTORNEY HAN MOO-YOUNG

467
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,118
RECENTS

468
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,001
INCOMING CALL
ATTORNEY HAN MOO-YOUNG

469
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,046
Ro-eum?

470
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,215
Hello?

471
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,141
Ro-eum.

472
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:46,774
What?

473
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,360
When are you coming back?

474
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,154
Why do you want to know?

475
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,489
It's not like you have anywhere to go.

476
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,825
You know it isn't over, right?

477
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,702
The perpetrator is still out there.

478
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,912
And the victim.

479
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:04,167
Unlike the Chairman, you're capable
of thinking about the victim.

480
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,044
The con you'll be running now

481
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,337
will be different from before.

482
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,049
Different how?

483
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,051
Like I said,

484
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,094
there's a better ending.

485
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,688
Moo-young.

486
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,149
Do you believe in me?

487
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,360
Do you believe I'm someone worthy

488
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,906
of having a better ending?

489
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,365
I…

490
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,249
I don't have any strength left.

491
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,545
I'm so tired.

492
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,590
My heart feels so heavy.

493
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,176
I know.

494
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,470
I moved out of my room.

495
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,482
When my family lost everything and we
couldn't even afford a semi-basement,

496
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,151
a man I knew

497
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,196
let me stay in his studio apartment
and told me something.

498
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,159
A home is not a building
but where someone is waiting for you.

499
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,830
The comic book store has been closed
for a while now,

500
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,501
and there's no one at the call center
or the auto repair shop,

501
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,338
but I'll be waiting.

502
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,215
So come back.

503
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,633
Come back,

504
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,553
and let's end this together.

505
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,972
Since you and I are both victims.

506
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,715
MOM, LET'S GO SEE A DOCTOR TOMORROW

507
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,762
I GOT A JOB

508
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,495
GUARANTEED HIGH INCOME
NAVIS WELL-BEING

509
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,710
GUARANTEED HIGH INCOME
NAVIS WELL-BEING

510
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,215
There's no such thing as a con artist
who thinks about the victim.

511
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,219
If they did,
they wouldn't be able to con them.

512
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,096
Conning is

513
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,391
not about how much damage
you can inflict on a victim,

514
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,770
but about how much profit you can gain.

515
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,900
Have you ever thought about this?

516
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,154
What kind of people

517
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,657
fall victim to cons?

518
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,805
They get into the game themselves.

519
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,724
Because they're sure they know
what game they're playing.

520
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,354
Even when the game begins,

521
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,065
they never imagine
that everyone else is cheating.

522
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,986
So at first, they do what they learned,

523
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,904
and follow the rules.

524
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,615
They use their own money, take out a loan,

525
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,453
and struggle, blaming themselves
for their own lack of skills.

526
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,082
In the end, they run out of money,

527
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,709
lose their friends,

528
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,296
and lose their credit.

529
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,922
That won't be possible.

530
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,757
Didn't you read the contract?

531
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,678
My mother is getting surgery…

532
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,888
Everyone has a story.

533
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,349
We all start with our own money.

534
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,562
Sir.

535
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,564
Geez.

536
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,775
I need to take a break
from work due to a family situation.

537
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,156
I was told that I still have
some payments left on the advance.

538
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,331
But

539
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,833
I paid it all back on time,

540
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,461
and when I didn't have enough,

541
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,920
I got loans.

542
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,716
I don't have any money left now
after paying for the products too.

543
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,509
Ho-jung.

544
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,804
Creditors have started
to show up this week.

545
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,640
Please.

546
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,101
What do you expect me to do?

547
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,228
You invade my privacy

548
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,440
chasing me to the restroom,

549
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,109
telling me about your advances and loans.

550
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,111
Why are you telling me this?

551
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,698
Do you expect me to
repay your loans for you, or what?

552
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,742
No, of course not.

553
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,077
Geez.

554
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,578
I just want to leave.

555
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,373
Cancel my membership.

556
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,167
Who took out

557
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,336
the advance?

558
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,797
You did.

559
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,673
And the loan.

560
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,925
Who took it out?

561
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,177
You did.

562
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,805
You took the products

563
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,183
and brought them back
after you failed to sell them.

564
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,646
If you want out,
you have to pay for that first.

565
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,607
Why are you complaining to me?

566
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,900
But,

567
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,568
like I said,

568
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,780
the interest rate on the private loan
you got me was so high

569
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,573
it's more than the principal now.

570
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,952
And the products…

571
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,413
The shelf life is so short
that I couldn't sell.

572
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,875
Please, help me.

573
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,295
Then,

574
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,632
I'll pay off the advance later.

575
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,593
At least let me cancel the membership.

576
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,264
I'll be getting new products again
next month,

577
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,683
and I'll have to pay for that too.

578
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,395
I want to stop.

579
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,524
Please, let me stop.

580
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,485
Aren't you an adult?

581
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,281
You should be responsible
for your own life.

582
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,201
This is so annoying.

583
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,180
That's when they realize

584
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,682
that something is

585
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,977
very wrong.

586
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,524
SODAMHAE GIMBAP

587
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,200
Welcome.

588
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,036
One ramyeon, please.

589
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,079
Sure.

590
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,956
One ramyeon.

591
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,474
Enjoy.

592
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,814
What are you doing here?

593
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,774
I just ordered.

594
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,110
Let's talk after I eat.

595
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,198
When I was counseling teenagers,

596
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,576
I handed out cards

597
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,745
that said "Love yourself."

598
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:07,084
But one day, after a session,
one of them came up to me and said,

599
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,711
"You're so full of it."

600
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,675
"I've never felt loved by my parents

601
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,094
so how can I love myself?"

602
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,389
If you hadn't said anything,
they wouldn't have known.

603
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,310
Why don't we practice expressing

604
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,271
the way you feel in words?

605
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,694
The kids have so much energy, don't they?

606
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,656
When you see them playing,
they're just kids.

607
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,199
That's why I like them.

608
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,701
Our kids are fortunate.

609
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,494
They have you.

610
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,496
It's harder for kids in the suburbs.

611
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,458
Kids there might actually need more help.

612
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,793
Where?

613
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,962
We should go to that center next time.

614
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,505
Where is it?

615
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,800
Many of the kids there are neglected.

616
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,095
Their parents don't want them coming,
or they have to work…

617
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,431
They have different reasons
for not coming.

618
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,433
Strange, isn't it?

619
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,352
Even if there's a system in place,

620
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,562
the people who really need it
can't use it.

621
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,482
Then who looks out for them?

622
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,985
The kids like Ro-eum.

623
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,196
She was so smart
but look how she ended up.

624
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,323
Who knew her life
would turn out like this

625
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,408
when we were doing
the case study on her?

626
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,661
Case study?

627
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:24,953
What case study?

628
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:28,415
The case study we did
with Professor Shin on gifted children.

629
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,502
Don't you remember Lee Ro-eum?

630
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,420
What?

631
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,714
The case study was anonymous.

632
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,634
She's the only one who was on a TV show

633
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,386
for having a photographic memory.

634
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,179
Everyone assumed it was her.

635
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,350
She was on Professor Shin's show too.

636
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,519
The hacker too.

637
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,145
And the multilingual kid.

638
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,480
Those kids.

639
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,649
What was the title of the case study?

640
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,818
When gifted children…

641
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,279
The correlation between

642
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,156
the mental and material experiences

643
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,366
of gifted children

644
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,451
born in disadvantaged backgrounds.

645
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,373
-Right?
-Right.

646
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,798
Are you going to live here now?

647
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,096
Why are you here?

648
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,973
Do you need me now?

649
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,686
I've always needed you.

650
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,982
What happened that day? With Na-sa?

651
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,360
Are you worried that I killed him?

652
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,278
Yes.

653
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,697
I am.

654
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,031
I didn't.

655
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,909
And I don't know where he is.

656
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,163
What did he do so wrong
that he deserved to be shot?

657
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,586
Do Ringo and I have to be your hostages
and do whatever you tell us to do?

658
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,503
Do we?

659
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,297
I never held you hostage.

660
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,923
We didn't know.

661
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,847
You know better than anyone

662
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,432
how that organization works.

663
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,562
Maybe if we had refused to follow
their orders even if we were shot,

664
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:14,688
then yes,

665
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,025
at least our lives wouldn't
have turned out like this.

666
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:21,862
But,

667
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,574
we were barely teenagers back then.

668
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,119
We were just kids.

669
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,081
We were scared,

670
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,126
and we just wanted to go back
to our families.

671
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,091
I did too.

672
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,178
Ten years ago,

673
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,138
and at the hotel,

674
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,101
I just wanted to get what I came for,

675
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,648
and end it all.

676
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,399
That's why I did it.

677
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,863
Why do you think we helped you?

678
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,077
For the money you promised us?

679
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,037
No.

680
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,207
We've all struggled with our guilt.

681
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,835
That's why we did everything we could
to help you.

682
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,844
Even it wasn't about the money,

683
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,724
wasn't Red Eye worth getting revenge at?

684
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,852
You don't know us at all.

685
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,941
We may hate them,

686
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,112
but we're not stupid enough
to fight with them.

687
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,781
We did it for you.

688
00:47:58,875 --> 00:47:59,835
Then,

689
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:05,007
what do I have to do
to work with you again?

690
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,390
It's been ten years,

691
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,065
but it feels like we're stuck in the past.

692
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,405
I don't want to be anymore.

693
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:36,163
I don't want to go back to that time
when we frantically tried to survive.

694
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,290
Can't we just be a team?

695
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,344
Your mom and dad…

696
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,559
We found them
and held a small funeral for them.

697
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,273
Ringo took care of Yeo-seo
during that time.

698
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:05,776
I…

699
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,573
I hope you understand

700
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,743
how we feel.

701
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,667
And I'm sorry.

702
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,169
I realized I never said I was sorry.

703
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,422
The subject has an exceptional memory

704
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,882
and has an IQ of 180.

705
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,219
The parents had the subject
when they were both teenagers,

706
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:17,013
and used the subject's ability
for TV appearances

707
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,849
in order to make a living.

708
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,227
The subject is result-oriented,
focusing on solving problems

709
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,312
and its rewards.

710
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,524
The next subject.

711
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,819
The subject gained fame at a young age

712
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,654
due to their superior hacking skills.

713
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,283
The subject won
many national competitions,

714
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,161
and has a deep understanding
of mechanical engineering.

715
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,372
The subject has outstanding
language abilities

716
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,125
and can speak several languages
fluently learned on his own.

717
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,209
Then…

718
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,796
do you think the signs of depression
found in each of them

719
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,840
derives from their family background?

720
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:56,011
Yes. Many studies show that
young children who are mentally insecure,

721
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,972
also perform poorly in academics.

722
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:02,225
Gifted children
may have exceptionally high IQs,

723
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,895
but that could make them more sensitive
to external stimulus.

724
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:08,356
That's why I think a controlled
educational environment

725
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,650
that also treats them mentally
would help.

726
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,613
Professor Shin was a consultant
for the Red Eye Foundation.

727
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:18,200
She selected scholarship students
who were trained as criminals.

728
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,121
Is it okay for a doctor
to do something like that?

729
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,372
Answer me that.

730
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,722
DAESEO GENERAL HOSPITAL

731
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,979
Oh, Ro-eum.

732
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,732
How are you feeling?

733
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,317
I'm all better.

734
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,276
You?

735
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,737
Me too.

736
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,533
We almost got into a lot of trouble
this time, right?

737
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,381
Didn't I give you
my business card that time?

738
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,802
Why did you have to tell Professor Shin

739
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,929
I left my wallet in your car?

740
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,474
I got an earful thanks to you.

741
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,269
About hitching a ride from
her former student whom I just met.

742
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:28,937
Sheesh.

743
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,856
She's in no position

744
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,608
to be yelling at me right now.

745
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,653
I didn't know how else
to get in touch. I'm sorry.

746
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:38,947
Okay, fine.

747
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,658
So what made you so desperate?

748
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,912
What you told me about…

749
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,999
One of the gifted children

750
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,208
was Lee Ro-eum, right?

751
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,003
Famous for having a photographic memory.

752
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,048
Yes.

753
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,893
STUDY NOTE

754
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,437
I just realized…

755
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,773
During Professor Shin's class in college,

756
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,526
we did a case study on gifted children.

757
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,363
The subjects were all anonymous,

758
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,782
and we only heard from them
through recordings,

759
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,578
so I failed to make the connection
when you first told me about it.

760
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,289
But I happened to check my files,

761
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,544
and I realized they were the same kids
you were talking about.

762
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,341
What kind of study was it?

763
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:43,094
To help gifted children adjust
to a new educational environment.

764
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,722
They were from
less fortunate family backgrounds

765
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,766
and were under a lot of stress. So…

766
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,396
I thought providing them
with a different environment would help.

767
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,650
And that's how the study
was concluded as well.

768
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,736
I didn't know what happened
to them after that.

769
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,030
I know it sounds like an excuse.

770
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,576
I called you

771
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:11,206
because I wanted to know

772
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,999
exactly what happened to them.

773
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,418
Why do you want to know?

774
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,837
For me, it was just a class I took,

775
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,549
but for them, their entire lives changed.

776
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,763
I know it's late but I don't
want to pretend like nothing happened.

777
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,723
It'll make you very uncomfortable.

778
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,517
If it's that bad,

779
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,103
I deserve to hear everything

780
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,897
and toss and turn in my sleep.

781
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:38,858
Okay.

782
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,318
I'll tell you.

783
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,571
But everything I heard
came from Moo-young.

784
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,366
Han Moo-young?

785
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,118
Oh, didn't I tell you?

786
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,413
Moo-young's buddy.

787
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,957
Introduced by Moo-young.

788
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,504
You were within six degrees as well.

789
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,726
REPORTER WOO

790
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,563
Hello?

791
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,023
About that blog…

792
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,859
I finally found the ID
and I'm checking it out.

793
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,153
The last post was a year ago.

794
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,196
Nothing is left on the archives either.

795
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:26,906
But,

796
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,451
that doesn't matter.

797
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,661
I found an article.

798
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,787
Hang on.

799
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,217
PYRAMID SCHEME LEADS
TO DEATH OF WOMAN IN HER 20S

800
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,355
What kind of people fall victim to cons?

801
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,235
People who want to make it rich?

802
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,823
People who are grasping at straws
at the edge of a cliff?

803
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:12,202
BLACK LOAN

804
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,706
People who just slipped
while trying to do their best to live,

805
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,166
or if not that,

806
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,877
people who were just unlucky?

807
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,298
If I'm being honest as a con artist,

808
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,093
victims of cons are just

809
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,888
people who the con artist
targeted to shake down.

810
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,995
MOM, DAD, I LOVE YOU

811
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,581
EMPLOYEE CARD: YEON HO-JUNG

812
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,755
Ho-jung.

813
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,093
I bought some tangerines.

814
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:13,930
Ho-jung.

815
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,691
Ho-jung!

816
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,234
Ho-jung!

817
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,487
This Ho-jung wasn't
a victim of Navis Well-being.

818
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,156
It goes way back.

819
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,408
To Darusa International.

820
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,368
Ma Kang-su.

821
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,912
You know how he extorted
300 billion won five years ago?

822
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:41,458
There was a victim in her 20s
who killed herself over it by the end.

823
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,501
The victim's name was Yeon Ho-jung.

824
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,211
The blogger, Ho-jung.

825
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,006
It can't be a ghost so I think
it's her only surviving family,

826
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:50,133
Yeon Tae-hun.

827
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,051
Also,

828
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,222
Ma Kang-su was released
from prison, like you said.

829
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,392
And he went to work at Navis
as soon as he got out.

830
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,354
I think we've found the connection

831
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,773
you were talking about.

832
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,337
Come in.

833
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,464
Glad you came.

834
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,094
Say hello.
I was talking to a new client.

835
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,639
It was a tragic story

836
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,016
you'll never hear anywhere else.

837
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,145
I'll show her out.

838
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:31,859
Bye.

839
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,661
She's still so young…

840
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,839
What a mess.

841
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,217
I just have a lot of papers, that's all.

842
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,348
What did you say to make him cry?

843
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,354
It's been a long time.

844
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:10,898
Has it?

845
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,067
Or maybe I just waited a long time.

846
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,657
If you're planning

847
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,576
to start over again with me,

848
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:25,204
I have some terms
to reach a better ending.

849
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:30,043
From now on, I decide
the direction of the con.

850
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,469
Hey.

851
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,305
Where is he today?

852
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,349
Your boyfriend.

853
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,022
Looks like you're playing it cool
because of me,

854
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,524
but don't mind me and feel free to date.

855
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,777
The good times are almost over.

856
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,534
Kyung-ja.

857
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,873
I understand that you need
someone to talk to,

858
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,837
but do I look like your friend?

859
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:19,967
I've been thinking,

860
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,846
and I thought I should remind you.

861
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,393
Where do you think you got

862
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,061
the clothes you're wearing,

863
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,438
and your rings and necklaces?

864
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,775
Your family lost everything.

865
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,949
And also,

866
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,160
Navis Well-being.

867
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:49,580
Who do you think created it?

868
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:55,211
Do you believe it's all yours
because you've been out in the sun

869
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,963
while I was rotting in prison?

870
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,509
Kyung-ja.

871
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,595
I think

872
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,098
it's time we switch up

873
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,307
our positions.

874
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,309
Now,

875
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:15,565
it's your turn to be dragged down.

876
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,693
There's no such thing as fashion there.

877
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,405
And it'll be cold
so make sure to wear something warm.

878
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:30,788
Oh.

879
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,666
It's the Chairman.

880
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,628
I'm going to start where you left off.

881
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,258
You've already set it up.

882
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,469
The cracks

883
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,845
in Red Eye.

884
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:19,545
They will be helping us from now on.

885
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,005
We'll be working as a team.

886
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:23,299
Do I just need to believe in your illness?

887
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,801
Just believe in me.

888
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,969
This is my revenge too now.

889
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,222
Aren't you going to make up with Su-ho?

890
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:33,142
I thought you were dead
but here you are, alive.

891
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,394
I'm going back to them.

892
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,230
Nothing has gotten better.

893
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,398
I have someone I want you to meet.

894
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,316
Who?

895
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,902
Someone who'll be helping us.
