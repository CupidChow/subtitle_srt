1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,517
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,187
You

3
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,564
are fired.

4
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,744
How can you be sure
that that child

5
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,497
and the Lee Ro-eum now
are the same?

6
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,498
What do you mean?

7
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,626
The Lee Ro-eum you met back then

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,544
was a child.

9
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,963
How do you know
what kind of person she is now?

10
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,965
What kind of an adult she is?

11
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,051
You can't tell based on what you saw
long ago.

12
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,472
You felt it too, didn't you?

13
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,474
The unfamiliar side

14
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,559
of her?

15
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,730
In my opinion,
you need to figure that out first.

16
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,942
Is the Lee Ro-eum now

17
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,528
the same person as the child
you wanted to help

18
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,987
all those years ago?

19
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,879
What?

20
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,464
What are you looking at?

21
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,258
Anything interesting?

22
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,886
Don't you have
anything to do?

23
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,721
Of course I do.

24
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,140
That's why I'm here.

25
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,935
Don't worry. I'll just be keeping watch
for another ten minutes.

26
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,645
Then I have to pick up a lady.

27
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,149
Oh, don't worry about that either.

28
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,775
She's just family.

29
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,321
You don't have to be jealous either.

30
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,198
She's family but she's not my wife…

31
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,661
Watch it.

32
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,433
Come on,

33
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,977
have you been lied to all your life?

34
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,147
It's a class A video clip.

35
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,774
She's totally famous.

36
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,703
Hey.

37
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,372
Hey!

38
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,666
Damn it.

39
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,921
It's the perfect day
to kick your ass.

40
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,883
You just let go of a million dollar case
as if it was nothing.

41
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:40,386
How are you going to cover the loss?

42
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:41,930
My god,

43
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,307
we didn't even get a fee upfront.

44
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:45,808
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,853
There must be something
about that woman,

46
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,521
whatever her name is.

47
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,399
Ever since you got involved with her
nothing is going the way it should.

48
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,400
Am I wrong?

49
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,985
Promise me.

50
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,404
That you won't be seeing her again,

51
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,324
and that everything will be fine.

52
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,995
I even stopped
the disciplinary committee for you.

53
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,957
GO YO-HAN

54
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,376
Attorney Han.

55
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,128
Moo-young.

56
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,508
-I'll be right back.
-Yeah.

57
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,386
What?

58
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,101
Did he just walk out on me?

59
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,435
Hello?

60
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,230
Mr. Han. It's me.

61
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,316
Go Yo-han, the probation officer.

62
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,859
I know who you are.

63
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,069
What can I do for you?

64
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,029
I'm at Dolma Park right now.

65
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,032
Ro-eum needs an attorney.

66
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,493
Did something happen to her?

67
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,245
Come and see for yourself.

68
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,999
I have to go pick a lady up
who's family,

69
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,917
but not my wife, so--

70
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,130
-Hello?
-Let go of me, damn it!

71
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,008
Get out here!
Who the heck do you think you are?

72
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,509
Come out!

73
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,719
Damn it.

74
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,679
-Calm down.
-Let go of me!

75
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,222
-I'll have to call the cops.
-Come out!

76
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,682
Hey!

77
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,310
Come out!

78
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,853
Settle down now.

79
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:13,938
Ro-eum.

80
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,732
This is Yo-han.

81
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,693
I called Mr. Han, so hang in there.

82
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,654
Who?

83
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,740
I have to go now
because of a prior engagement.

84
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,659
I called the cops

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,619
so they'll be here soon.

86
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,170
He called who?

87
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,174
He called the cops!

88
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,474
You don't have to stand there.

89
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,309
Have a seat.
There's a chair over there.

90
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,020
I told you.

91
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,521
He's not my lawyer.

92
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,107
Then should I be his lawyer?

93
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,526
I'm Han Moo-young.

94
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,407
So,

95
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,159
for no reason at all,

96
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,037
you took a mop

97
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,665
and beat you on the back.

98
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,750
All over.

99
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,585
All over.

100
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,380
And I also stole your cell phone.

101
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,843
What?

102
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,637
What a load of bullshit.

103
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,390
You just

104
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,309
beat me up.

105
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,353
What's this now?

106
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,564
Why did she steal… wait.

107
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,984
Did she steal your cell phone?

108
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,362
Of course not.

109
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,781
Then… why did you call the police?

110
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,908
I didn't.

111
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,663
This woman's probation officer
or whatever did.

112
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,581
Go Yo-han called the police?

113
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,543
Oh, okay…
Then for now,

114
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,837
as the assailant is claiming,

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,047
do you admit to assault… I mean…

116
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,591
You're not admitting to assault…

117
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,051
The victim…

118
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,887
I really stole it.

119
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,389
You can search me.

120
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,307
My back…

121
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,395
It doesn't hurt anymore
so I think I'll just go home.

122
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,439
Fine, you do that.

123
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,608
What are you doing?

124
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,695
How am I supposed
to write up a report?

125
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,364
My lawyer.

126
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,623
I don't think there's much
I can do here.

127
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,543
You are so useless.

128
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,128
Okay, so,

129
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,255
you claim that you were assaulted,

130
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,424
but deny being robbed,

131
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,092
and you acknowledge
that you stole from him,

132
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,887
but deny the assault,
and he just said he has fully recovered.

133
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,846
Yes.

134
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,639
I'd like to go home now.

135
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,183
We'd like to get going too.

136
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,569
-Hey.
-Ow.

137
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,653
-Give it back.
-Ow.

138
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,571
Damn it.

139
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,161
What do you think you're doing?

140
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,290
I want my phone back.

141
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,251
How much do you want for it?

142
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,170
You crazy bitch.

143
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,132
Why are you doing this to me?

144
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,467
What did I do to you?

145
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,260
That's enough.

146
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,181
I'll give it back to you.

147
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,683
Call me on this number.

148
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,443
Damn it.

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,164
So you really did
steal his phone?

150
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,376
Why?

151
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,919
He was annoying me.

152
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,296
Doing what?

153
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,133
Some people are annoying
just by existing.

154
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,762
I'm meeting a lot of them these days.

155
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,808
It's in the park's restroom, isn't it?

156
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,686
You said you'd give it back.

157
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,521
You must've hidden it then.

158
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,274
Buckle up.

159
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,928
How much are you going to get?

160
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,849
-You expect me to sell this?
-Too bad for you if you don't want to.

161
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,185
He'd probably sell his own organs
to get back what's on there.

162
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,188
What's on it?

163
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,357
I unlocked it
so take a look for yourself.

164
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,661
Ro-eum.

165
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,707
You saw what was on here?

166
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,125
Yeah.

167
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,127
But you just want to give it back?

168
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,089
I thought he had a photo of me,
and I checked, but he didn't, so yeah.

169
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,425
As long as
you're not in the photos,

170
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,218
you're okay with giving it back?

171
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,512
Take it to the cops if you want then.

172
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,725
If I take this to the cops,

173
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,685
he'll have you arrested.

174
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,355
Theft is a separate charge.

175
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,987
So what do you want me to do?

176
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,241
You don't want to just give it back,

177
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,620
so I'm asking you what
we can actually do then.

178
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,455
We have to get
the originals and get him

179
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,082
for possessing
illegally filmed material.

180
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,460
And leave the phone at a blind spot
where there are no security cameras.

181
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,879
His texts show more
than proof of possession.

182
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,048
There's evidence that he filmed
and sold it too.

183
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,842
He has a deal with an online storage
service company.

184
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,428
I planted a malware so I can find out

185
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,263
everything about him.

186
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,848
You did what?

187
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,811
You didn't understand that?

188
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,612
He's making me explain
something so simple.

189
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,697
First, give him his phone back,

190
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,324
with the malware I installed.

191
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,909
The malware will leak

192
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,453
all the data he has on his phone.

193
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,248
It's basically copying his entire phone.

194
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,594
The dirtbag will backup
his data as soon as he gets home.

195
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,765
He almost lost it
so he'll be anxious.

196
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,935
The moment he links his phone
to his computer or the cloud,

197
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,438
the malware will be installed there too.

198
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,606
Considering what he does,

199
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,942
he'll have other phones too,

200
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,324
and we'll be able to take control
of all the hacked devices.

201
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,716
From that moment on,
anything is possible.

202
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,177
We could tell his family
what he's up to,

203
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,727
or we could tip off his partners
that he's a rat who's about to

204
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,187
turn them in to the police.

205
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,816
LEE JIN-SEOK
WHY AREN'T YOU SENDING? WHERE ARE YOU?

206
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,735
Damn it.

207
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,195
Or we do
something more classic

208
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,239
and make him transfer all the money
he earned by doing this.

209
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,492
Of all these options…

210
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,409
Ro-eum.

211
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,662
What are you saying?

212
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,789
That's all illegal.

213
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,127
You really want to talk about
the law right now?

214
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,879
Of course, I'm an attorney.

215
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,674
The same law that gave a probation
to a guy who uses the money he earns

216
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,885
by blackmailing women to order in food?

217
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,346
Is that your weapon?

218
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,265
Sounds like your weapon
is violence and breaking the law.

219
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,851
I use everything I can.

220
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,561
Even attorneys.

221
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,232
I have an attorney right here
who's willing to help me

222
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,858
without being paid a single cent.

223
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,029
Although, I have no idea
what he wants from me.

224
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,617
There are people in this world who want
to help without any strings attached,

225
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,119
and look out for others
whatever the reason.

226
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,916
If people like that really do exist,
they must be total pushovers.

227
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,210
They're usually called "friends."

228
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,254
They become tools because

229
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,339
they don't realize they are.

230
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,715
You can be a friend

231
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,925
all you want.

232
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,607
He's been like that
since he got back from Cho&Son.

233
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,037
Hey, Ms. Park.
You try it too.

234
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,625
Try what?

235
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,793
Just talk to us.

236
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,421
Instead of putting
everyone on edge.

237
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,964
Yoo Myeong-hun's case

238
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,674
was closed as an accidental death.

239
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,594
It was concluded as a drowning
at the valley where his parents took him.

240
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,429
They'll be getting an insurance payout
worth millions.

241
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,472
They're even filing an injunction to ban

242
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,310
the investigative report from airing.
They are raising hell.

243
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,313
Cho&Son, that is.

244
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,565
They want a settlement
of 50,000 dollars.

245
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,192
We'll have to negotiate.

246
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,654
The problem is,
my client won't cooperate.

247
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,031
Seo Gye-suk

248
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:11,076
is even more enraged
now that the case is closed.

249
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,245
Of course she is.

250
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,166
I understand how she's feeling,

251
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,126
but this is hard on me too.

252
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,211
Here I am trying hard

253
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,047
to get the charges for libel dropped,

254
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,133
but she keeps on slandering
them at the same time!

255
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,011
Non-stop, all the time.

256
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,640
Watch what you say
in front of Moo-young,

257
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,184
and just take care of it.

258
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,228
Negotiate the settlement
as low as you can. You can do this.

259
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,565
Hock.

260
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,780
If you'd had been younger,
I would've spit on you.

261
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,156
If you do, I'll sue.

262
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,837
How's work?

263
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,714
Nothing new.

264
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,050
And the probationers?

265
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,260
Are you still friendly with them?

266
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,973
Would you like me to write
a report for you?

267
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,892
That would be nice.

268
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,521
If it makes you realize your duty.

269
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,400
Check your account.
I transferred some money.

270
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,453
His texts show more
than proof of possession.

271
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,914
There's evidence that he filmed
and sold it too.

272
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,175
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU ASK.
PLEASE ERASE THEM

273
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,456
Have a seat.

274
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,168
I thought I was here for my phone.

275
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,507
Just sit.

276
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,676
Damn it.

277
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,725
Come on,

278
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,268
just give it back to me today.

279
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,397
I really need it.
Let's not wear each other out over this.

280
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,858
I'd like to record our conversation.

281
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,859
Do you agree?

282
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,783
Do you mind me asking why
you need it back by today?

283
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,242
Come on, damn it!

284
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,914
Why are you doing this to me?

285
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,047
You people took my phone and you're
asking me why I need it back?

286
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,925
What does it matter
when I need it by?

287
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,761
You're the ones in the wrong
for stealing it in the first place.

288
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,180
No one stole it.

289
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,973
We found it.

290
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,476
I see.

291
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,273
Okay, fine.

292
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,903
I guess I lost it
and you found it.

293
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,196
And?

294
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,324
I fell over all on my own.

295
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,201
I tripped and fell on my own, okay?

296
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,495
I get it.

297
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,038
So just hand over my phone.

298
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,749
When you're being questioned,

299
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,711
if you state anything
differently from what you said today,

300
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,381
my client will testify

301
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,217
to what she saw on your phone.

302
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,972
So, you saw everything?

303
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,891
Anything that interested you?

304
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,812
-Excuse me?
-Did you see anything you want to buy?

305
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,730
If not, then never mind.

306
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,735
Tell her I hope
we never run into each other again.

307
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,388
Hello?

308
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,432
Yes, I happened to find a phone,

309
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,976
and found
some illegally filmed material.

310
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,353
UNKNOWN USER

311
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,285
SEOGYEONG STATION 1-39

312
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,967
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

313
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,095
Please confirm and dial again.

314
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,695
Tell me,

315
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,989
why are you refusing to see
your lawyer?

316
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,158
Idiot, he's not my lawyer.

317
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244
He's the bastard who
stabbed me in the back.

318
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,955
I have

319
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,249
a lot of exclusive information

320
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,834
and that's why people keep
coming to see me.

321
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,880
I knew you were a big shot.

322
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,173
I respect you, sir.

323
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,509
Hey, let go a sec.

324
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,593
Must be snack time.

325
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,844
Oh.

326
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,224
Oof.

327
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,982
What's this for?

328
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,611
APPLICATION FOR USE OF INMATE FUNDS

329
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,904
Where are my sausages?

330
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,781
Not enough money.

331
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,204
Hang on a sec.

332
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,209
Damn it.

333
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,670
SEOYOUNG STUDY ROOM

334
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,012
Introduce me to that hacker.

335
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,597
You're asking a lot
just for a coffee.

336
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,350
I'm asking a lot?

337
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,020
I'm your attorney
who's working for free.

338
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,980
Should we run the numbers?

339
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,233
I'm a client that you fucked over.

340
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,235
I could call up
the disciplinary committee.

341
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,154
Then write up the complaint first.

342
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,241
Just start with the threats.

343
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,035
Don't act like
you're asking for a favor.

344
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,494
You asked if the law was my weapon.

345
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,872
It's not. It's my weakness.

346
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,498
That's why I need your help.

347
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,506
Welcome.

348
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,014
I'm here
on Lee Ro-eum's introduction.

349
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,061
DAJEONG COMIC BOOK

350
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,812
Scrub data?

351
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,439
Yes.

352
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,358
Uh…

353
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,944
You heard what I do, didn't you?

354
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,489
I just know that you're a hacker.

355
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,616
I see…

356
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,953
It's not what I usually do,

357
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,456
but since Ro-eum sent you,
I'll do it.

358
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,541
It's your data you want scrubbed, right?

359
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,668
No.

360
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,671
Remember the data that Ro-eum
sent you from that phone last time?

361
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,508
There were girls
who were being blackmailed.

362
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,593
Videos of them are all over the internet

363
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,386
and I'd like you to delete all of that.

364
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,514
Why?

365
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:13,975
I mean,

366
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,603
I was wondering why you're doing this.

367
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,896
There were a ton of girls.

368
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,400
I'll pay you for your service.

369
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,238
Oh…

370
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,325
All I can do is find and delete
identical videos,

371
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,829
request that personal info be deleted,
and monitor the internet for a while.

372
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,247
That's about it.

373
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,457
I can't do anything about
personal cloud accounts.

374
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,960
Well, it's a lot more than I can do.

375
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,295
Please do that.

376
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,172
The police can do the rest.

377
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,175
What?

378
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,469
Oh, it's nothing.

379
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,389
I'll look into it and be in touch.

380
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,392
How do you know Ro-eum anyway?

381
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,729
Oh… We were cellmates.

382
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,898
I see.

383
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,860
You're helping Ro-eum?

384
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,153
Yes, that's right.,

385
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:07,821
Ro-eum…

386
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,366
wouldn't have told you about me.

387
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,201
She's not interested in me at all.

388
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,456
You must have a lot of interest

389
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,375
in Ro-eum.

390
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,400
Why? You can't do it?

391
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,485
Stay awake.

392
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,237
I'll always be watching.

393
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,521
Moo-young.

394
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,564
What?

395
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,318
I negotiated the settlement money
down from 50,000

396
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,944
to 5,000.

397
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,282
You should acknowledge me
for my effort, don't you think?

398
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,075
Are you talking about Seo Gye-suk?

399
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,162
What happened to Myeong-hun's case?

400
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,793
Your head

401
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,588
really is

402
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,508
totally somewhere else, isn't it?

403
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,386
The case was closed.

404
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,680
And the insurance money?

405
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,849
It was paid out a long time ago.

406
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,643
What do you mean, the case is closed?

407
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,441
It was

408
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,027
ruled as an accidental death.

409
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,988
An accidental death?

410
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,365
What about the insurance?

411
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:42,160
They paid 2,000 dollars a month
for an 18-year-old.

412
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,329
And they were all
life insurance policies.

413
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,541
I did everything I could.

414
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,338
I worked my ass off trying
to stop Ms. Seo from protesting

415
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,216
and acting out unpredictably
after the case was closed.

416
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,511
And like I said before, I managed to
bring down the settlement to 10%

417
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,054
of what they originally asked for.

418
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,557
What more do you expect me to do?
Should I reinvestigate the case on my own?

419
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,268
You have to admit

420
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,561
that I did everything I could.

421
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,107
I did everything I could for her
within the law as an attorney.

422
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,608
She doesn't want to settle

423
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,403
saying she'd rather
go to prison instead.

424
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,155
I'm handing her off to you now.

425
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,086
What's going on?

426
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,341
Come quick.
Everyone's in panic.

427
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,801
What are we going to do?

428
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,227
Everything is a mess.

429
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,044
'VALLEY DEATH CASE' REPORT

430
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,007
A LARGE LIFE INSURANCE ON YOO MYEONG-HUN

431
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,390
Yes, this is Han Moo-young.

432
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,934
I finished what you asked.

433
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,186
Oh, Da-jeong.

434
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,812
Thanks for that.

435
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,606
I'll send you the rest of the fee.

436
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,982
You're at home, right?

437
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:36,983
Yes.

438
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,279
Is my location being tracked?

439
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,282
Yes, something like that.

440
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,671
Ro-eum?

441
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,926
For a room.

442
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,848
Did something happen?

443
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,350
Did you go somewhere?

444
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,436
The water pipes at my place burst.

445
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,729
Take it.

446
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,608
Just take it.

447
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,695
Why? This isn't a hotel.

448
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,739
-Humph.
-Come in.

449
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,276
It's so comfy

450
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,111
I could sleep on it.

451
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,237
Yes, that's right.

452
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,656
This was actually altered.

453
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,074
It wasn't like this to begin with?

454
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,242
No, it wasn't.

455
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,994
How long are you going to watch?

456
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,728
What are you looking at?

457
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,313
Stop looking.

458
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,245
What is that?

459
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,666
Insurance fraud.

460
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,168
Although it's just a hunch.

461
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,339
The accidental death
of the adopted kid?

462
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,299
It was all over the news.

463
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,718
The mother gave up her practically
grown-up son for adoption.

464
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,846
She sent him to a trusted friend.

465
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,891
Why do you think it's fraud?

466
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,396
He couldn't even swim but he was found
in deep waters without protective gear.

467
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,232
He also had 15 life insurance policies.

468
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,069
Did his adoptive parents
work in insurance?

469
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,446
The woman's younger sibling
worked in insurance from what I heard.

470
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,447
How did you know?

471
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,033
Insurance fraud requires someone
who knows the business.

472
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,035
Did they get caught?

473
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,079
No.

474
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,581
His death was ruled an accident.

475
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,833
And the insurance money
has been paid out.

476
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,335
It's over then.

477
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,711
It's not over yet.

478
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,798
The biological mother is refusing
to settle so I'm trying to help.

479
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,887
You're going to help her
refuse to settle?

480
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,847
No, I'm going to help her settle.

481
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,809
It'll be harder
if she's charged for libel.

482
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,727
Why is she refusing to settle?

483
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,562
Because she doesn't have any money?

484
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,773
Because of her son.

485
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,527
If she settles, she'd be admitting
that the adoptive parents are right.

486
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,363
And the truth will be buried for good.

487
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,782
Then lower the settlement.

488
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,410
It's not about the money.

489
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,911
She wants to fight this.

490
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,956
Fight?

491
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,668
All she's doing is whining around town.

492
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,837
If they killed her son,

493
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,006
she should be clawing her heart out

494
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,882
and front of that family.

495
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,136
That's what a real parent would do.

496
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,429
Besides,

497
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,390
if she believed someone else
could raise her kid better,

498
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,559
then whether it ended in abuse
or murder,

499
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,978
she should deal with the consequences.

500
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,647
Her kid died because
of the choice she made.

501
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,359
Making someone else pay
for her mistake

502
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,903
is just cowardly.

503
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,407
Go tell her.

504
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,076
If she has a conscience,
she should be able to accept

505
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,162
the result of her actions.

506
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,497
Even if it is hell.

507
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,124
Ro-eum,

508
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,255
no one can take on full responsibility
for what happens in the end.

509
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,383
That's why we need others.

510
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,015
And what can others do?

511
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,144
No matter how hard it gets,

512
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,980
you can stay by them until the end.

513
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,876
Come back

514
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,836
with us.

515
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,672
Let's go home.

516
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,259
Ro-eum, is that you?

517
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,385
Ro-eum.

518
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,828
What a joke.

519
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,359
For the room.

520
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,153
I told you, I don't need it.

521
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,155
Where did you get this?

522
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,615
The package next door.

523
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,632
It's Sunday.

524
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,219
I'm going to meet
the client I told you about yesterday.

525
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,723
You're living your life
so inefficiently.

526
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,188
Don't you understand how she feels?

527
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,690
You filed for damages too.

528
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,568
Didn't you want to get to the truth?

529
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,033
You can't uncover truths
through trials.

530
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,618
You can,

531
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,203
through trials.

532
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:31,457
Only weak people believe that.
That the law will bring them justice.

533
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,542
Well, getting revenge
isn't justice either.

534
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,879
Getting revenge
has always been justice.

535
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,424
Long before the law you hold
so sacred was formed,

536
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,970
from the moment that we realized
humans were evil.

537
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,224
Why do you think
laws were formed in the first place?

538
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,227
Because personal vengeance
only led to tragic consequences.

539
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,562
And it was immoral.

540
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,730
And unfair.

541
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,732
Are you sure about that?

542
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,861
In my opinion, it's the only
solution in this situation.

543
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,365
If she can't do it herself,
tell her to hire someone to do it.

544
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,825
You need a number?

545
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,370
Do you like magic?

546
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,206
I'll show you the magic

547
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,042
of how your suspended sentence
can be enforced.

548
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,714
You can stay here
until your place gets cleaned up.

549
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,133
If you want,
I can stay someplace else.

550
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,468
What about you?

551
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,971
Magic.

552
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:27,930
Do you like it?

553
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,433
No, not really.

554
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,060
Magic is just tricks in the end.

555
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,323
I'm sure you'll come to like it.

556
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,078
I'll show you some magic too.

557
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,378
Hey.

558
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,674
Yes?

559
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,259
Another lawyer is here.

560
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,267
I…

561
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,977
I'm not going to settle.

562
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,356
If you don't…

563
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,649
I know
I'll go to prison if I don't.

564
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,735
Mr. Cho told me.

565
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,490
I don't know why he sent
another attorney

566
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,534
if you're only going to repeat
the same thing like a parrot.

567
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,289
You should go.

568
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,375
Don't waste your time.

569
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,344
Not being the party involved,

570
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,764
showing tears

571
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,059
or being outraged

572
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,565
was not only rude to the actual people
involved, but nothing but cheap pity.

573
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,279
I couldn't say that I knew

574
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,991
or understood
what they were going through.

575
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,293
I couldn't tell them

576
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,295
I felt the same exact pain.

577
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,727
Back then

578
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,022
you were

579
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,066
also a party involved.

580
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,898
Don't worry about me and go.

581
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,401
I don't want you

582
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,280
to be in pain any longer.

583
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,396
Welcome.

584
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,829
Do you…

585
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,331
have anything that you can just
read mindlessly?

586
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,045
How long are you going to keep
coming around?

587
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,339
What you're feeling right now…

588
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,798
You have no idea how I feel.

589
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,551
How could you know?

590
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,179
I know you find me frustrating.

591
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,556
You think a stupid woman like me

592
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,184
who doesn't know the law
is being stubborn.

593
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,437
To you,

594
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,190
this is probably just
one case among many,

595
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,608
but to me,

596
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,403
it's a case where my only son died,

597
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,198
and will eat me up alive
for the rest of my life.

598
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,992
A thousand times, every single day,

599
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,369
my heart

600
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:27,706
feels like it's burning in hell.

601
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,836
You don't have to settle.

602
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,508
I'm here to represent you.

603
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,511
Feel free
to tell me anything you want.

604
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,887
I'll listen,

605
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,015
and do everything I can
as an attorney.

606
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,106
Hello.

607
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,653
Where's your room?

608
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,824
You mean, the computer room?

609
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,120
Back there.

610
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,373
I need you to do something.

611
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,918
Come on in.

612
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:23,720
DONGSAN KINDERGARTEN

613
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,972
Be good.

614
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,057
And if there's anything you want to eat,
tell me.

615
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,642
I want to have barbecue today.

616
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,395
Okay, let's go to your favorite
restaurant later.

617
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,230
And I want game console.

618
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,815
We have lots of money, don't we?

619
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,194
Don't say that out loud.

620
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,529
Say what?

621
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:46,827
Okay, I'll buy you a game console.
So don't talk about the insurance money.

622
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,954
I want the games
to go with it too.

623
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,540
-Okay.
-And barbecue.

624
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,666
Okay.

625
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,294
Tell dad
he can't have any.

626
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,920
He ate it all last time

627
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,839
and didn't leave any for me.

628
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,633
If he doesn't that again…

629
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,054
I told you not to hit me.

630
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,514
You can't have any either.

631
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,057
Okay!

632
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,436
-Hello.
-Hello.

633
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,272
Shin-wu must have
quite the appetite.

634
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,648
Yeah.

635
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,817
Still, you should share
with your parents.

636
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,528
He does.

637
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,863
He's just saying that.

638
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,490
Let's go.

639
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,120
Hope he's not in the same class.

640
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,958
We have
a very important guest today.

641
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:39,505
She studied child psychology
at Brown University in the States,

642
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,382
and together with the
state of San Francisco,

643
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:46,845
she has been successfully running
"Kids Heart"

644
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,641
a center that works with young children.

645
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,519
Let's welcome Dr. Courtney Kwon.

646
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,945
I'm child psychologist, Courtney Kwon.

647
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,197
It's nice to meet you all.

648
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,162
I was observing

649
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,082
the children and parents this morning,

650
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,919
and I noticed something
quite interesting.

651
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,425
Could you introduce yourself, please?

652
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,385
Me?

653
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,761
Yes.

654
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,305
What is your son's name?

655
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,850
Choi Shin-wu.

656
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:34,977
Ah.

657
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,189
He was very noticeable.

658
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,860
An increased appetite, self-centered,

659
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,530
limited vocabulary, violence…

660
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,408
He's not that bad…

661
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,243
That's what he may look like

662
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,495
to most people.

663
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,416
But to me,

664
00:47:57,499 --> 00:48:00,419
he is super stimulated, super sensitive.

665
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,546
both introverted and extroverted,

666
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,384
all signs of a child who has
the "Einstein cell."

667
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,510
In other words,

668
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,553
the genius cell.

669
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,058
Parents want their kids to be special.

670
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,603
The moment their child is acknowledged
to be better,

671
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,564
more superior and extraordinary
than anyone else,

672
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,899
the child become their trophy.

673
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,320
It may be utterly ridiculous
but you'll soon see.

674
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,779
The more foolish the parent,

675
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,866
the more willing they are
to do anything they can

676
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,784
to buy into that fantasy.

677
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,625
DR. COURTNEY KWON

678
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,754
Has your son

679
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,881
recently experienced a death
in his life?

680
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,967
Then it's now or never.

681
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,013
This is a turning point in his life.

682
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,601
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

683
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,816
We raise

684
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,069
our kids with love.

685
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,743
You only have two kids?

686
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,037
-Yes.
-Yes.

687
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,416
Go to your room.
Stop taking pictures.

688
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,879
Seems like you're keeping
something from me.

689
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,341
I'd like to talk to everyone
in your family separately

690
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,009
by this weekend.

691
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,554
I need to know what goes on here,
what has been going on,

692
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,933
and what will go on going forward.

693
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,644
Like I said, your son's future

694
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,854
depends on this period in his life.

695
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,402
UPDATE FAILURE

696
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,197
What are you staring at?

697
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,867
Oh, this won't update.

698
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,494
Let me take a look.

699
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,168
Oh, see here?

700
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,379
It's because a prior version
is already installed.

701
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,507
Just delete these two…

702
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,633
Wait.

703
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:25,105
Can you take a look at this?

704
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,816
Later, I'm late for a meeting.

705
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,238
I'd like you to take
under consideration

706
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,949
the fact that my client was in severe
mental anguish

707
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,076
due to the tragedy of losing her son.

708
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,537
Her protesting was a way
to relieve her emotions

709
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,955
and regain mental stability.

710
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,465
It wasn't meant to hurt anyone.

711
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,552
Does that mean
she'll continue with her protests?

712
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:56,845
I'll talk to her.

713
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:00,140
Just give her some time.

714
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:04,311
Since your injunction to ban
the broadcast has been granted…

715
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,444
Our client
has also suffered psychological damage.

716
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,822
Being suspected of murder
is not an easy thing to handle.

717
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,907
Moreover,

718
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,493
Seo Gye-suk is the one who asked her
to adopt Myeong-hun.

719
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,120
It was an accident that happened
while taking care of him.

720
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:25,165
You can't ignore the fact
that she was doing a good deed.

721
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,458
I'm well aware.

722
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,227
SEO GYE-SUK
I APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

723
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,268
Seo Gye-suk.

724
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,397
Don't do this.

725
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,692
Don't do this, for Myeong-hun's sake.

726
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,406
How can I not?

727
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,450
I sent my son away to a friend's house

728
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,079
so that I could have an easier life.

729
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,833
I didn't take any interest
in what he was eating or wearing,

730
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,919
or how he was sleeping.

731
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,974
My child

732
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,769
was telling me

733
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,563
he didn't want to go,

734
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:16,026
but I ignored him and turned away.

735
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:19,738
I deserve to die for that.

736
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,949
My Myeong-hun.

737
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,703
Who else will soothe his soul

738
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,788
for his wrongful death, if I don't?

739
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:38,214
MY SON PASSED AWAY AT THE AGE OF 18
IN A VALLEY. MY FRIEND PROMISED TO TAKE…

740
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:41,718
…BUT SHE HAD EVERYTHING PLANNED
TO KILL MY SON FOR FINANCIAL GAIN…

741
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,558
The case can be reopened
if we find physical evidence.

742
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,729
To do that,

743
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,314
you have to stay strong.

744
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,988
I miss him so much.

745
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,495
If I could just turn back time

746
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,165
to the day I last I saw him…

747
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,542
Then…

748
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,461
Then…

749
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:22,384
Eat your veggies too.

750
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,890
I sent money
asking her to buy you a new t-shirt.

751
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,309
She didn't buy you one?

752
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,563
I should call her.

753
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,190
No, don't.

754
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,655
Are you going on holiday?

755
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:44,990
Yes.

756
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,282
Where to?

757
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,576
Some valley.

758
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,996
It'll cost a lot of money

759
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,957
for a family of five.

760
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,253
I'll send some more money next week.

761
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,839
No, wait. Hang on.

762
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,303
Not next week…

763
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,139
-Mom.
-Yes?

764
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,310
Why… did you have me?

765
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,316
What do you mean?

766
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,486
Nothing, I was just curious.

767
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,201
I keep having this dream.

768
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:36,374
He's sinking in the cold water,

769
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,878
and he

770
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,548
keeps asking me

771
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,345
why I ever had him.

772
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:25,715
Woah.

773
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,928
What am I doing here?

774
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,430
Heard you collapsed
in the street.

775
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,599
What are you doing here?

776
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,893
I just happened

777
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,313
to call you, right at that moment.

778
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,024
-Humph.
-Hold on a sec.

779
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,610
Who was the nurse that I talked to?

780
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,862
She had a nice voice.

781
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,532
Could that be her?

782
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,201
Why did you call me?

783
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,661
Oh.

784
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,330
I heard the pipes burst
at Ro-eum's place,

785
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:00,125
but I don't know where she is.

786
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,298
Have you been stressed out lately?

787
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,968
Do you also see a therapist?

788
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:11,970
THERAPY SESSION

789
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,644
Shouldn't you

790
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,021
fire your doctor
if your condition is this bad?

791
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,399
Why are you wasting your money
on someone who's not any help?

792
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,234
My doctor is just fine.

793
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,694
Woah.

794
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,279
Talk about loyalty.

795
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,908
Get a new doctor.
Someone good.

796
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,036
Mind your own business.

797
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,580
Humph.

798
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,542
I came here all the way for you.

799
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,754
Thank you.

800
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,798
You're welcome.

801
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,263
You can go now.

802
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,771
Okay, I will.

803
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,445
I mean it.

804
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,948
I called a cab, so you can go.

805
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,160
Our ancestors always used to say
don't take no for a no.

806
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,498
You're looking all weak

807
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,833
and pale, about to fall on your feet.

808
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,836
If I let you stagger home on your own,

809
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,713
how do you think I'll feel?

810
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,258
What are you talking about?

811
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,552
I said I'm fine. I called a cab.

812
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,513
Our ancestors used to say,

813
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:39,349
a firm no is a firm yes.

814
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,352
What kind of ancestors said that…

815
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,605
I can't believe I'm here
looking out for an attorney too.

816
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,983
I really am

817
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,444
such an awesome probation officer.

818
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,157
Please, just go.

819
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:57,784
Come on.

820
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:07,794
Fine, then take me home.

821
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:25,395
You can go now.

822
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,021
Hmm.

823
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,566
Don't be so cold.

824
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,943
I'll leave after I see you go in.

825
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,381
Promise me a few things.

826
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,635
Things you must do to protect yourself

827
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,471
when dealing with Lee Ro-eum.

828
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,769
One, do not sell out

829
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,188
on your principles as an attorney.

830
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,403
Ro-eum?

831
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,613
Two,

832
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,782
keep your private life private.

833
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,118
What is all this?

834
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,453
Three.

835
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,832
Do not overlook her illegal activities.

836
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,751
Yoo Myeong-hun's death benefit.

837
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,920
And lastly,

838
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,673
Never

839
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,301
let your guard down.

840
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,720
A total of 430,000 dollars.

841
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,353
What?

842
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,604
We're in love.

843
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,524
Don't get too close.

844
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,901
We have to give it back.

845
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,861
Just admit it.

846
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,863
Then I did something you couldn't.

847
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,699
Mr. Han.

848
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:43,908
I need your help.

849
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,703
A friend that works at an errand center
was kidnapped.

850
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:50,957
You asked someone you met once
to save Ringo?

851
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,958
Ro-eum.

852
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,752
What exactly can you do?
