1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,557
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,517
CHILD ACTORS FILMED
UNDER GUARDIAN SUPERVISION

3
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,609
Tell them you'll do it.

4
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,236
Do what?

5
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,779
Whether it's a bomb or a gun,

6
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,280
tell them you'll make it.

7
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,034
Haven't you learned anything
while being beat up for ten days?

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,455
You were in therapy
before you came here, right?

9
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,790
With a psychiatrist.

10
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,835
I'm sure the doctor told these people

11
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,045
that you grew up
being physically abused.

12
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,965
That's why they're doing this to you.

13
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,219
They're using the weakest
part of you to break you.

14
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,059
Next time,
just do what they say.

15
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,353
Even if someone dies by the bomb
you make,

16
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,021
block it out.

17
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,816
Don't blame yourself for the outcome.

18
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,443
Just worry about yourself.

19
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,242
How old

20
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,161
are you?

21
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,791
Are you giving me advice
as someone older?

22
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,878
Things like that don't matter
in this place.

23
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,755
We're all on our own.

24
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,413
Ro-eum.

25
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,623
Han Moo-young.

26
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,750
Turn yourself in.

27
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,959
Two.

28
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,504
One.

29
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,300
We're coming in.

30
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,304
Damn it.

31
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,598
Na-sa, shut it down.

32
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,141
My life is so fucked up.

33
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,939
The basement has a separate power source
from this office, right?

34
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,523
You set up a generator there.

35
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,234
Yes… I did.

36
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,318
Then shut it all down.

37
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,819
The repair shop's system.

38
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,113
What?

39
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,406
Cut the power.

40
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,951
But all the devices will go down…

41
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,161
Cut it, now.

42
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,095
Na-sa.

43
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,096
Yes?

44
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,682
From this moment on, I'm your lawyer.

45
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,475
What's your real name?

46
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,143
Na Su-ho.

47
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,271
You will only talk
with your lawyer.

48
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,148
And you'll plead the right
to remain silent, got that?

49
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,275
Yes.

50
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:38,987
Stay calm.

51
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,822
Count to ten out loud.

52
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,408
One.

53
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,326
Two.

54
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,161
Three.

55
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,885
Ro-eum.

56
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,054
What's going on? Na-sa went offline.

57
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,183
Did you get the feed?

58
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,643
Are you outside right now?

59
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,645
Make a copy and wait for me.

60
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,318
Remember Shim Gyeong-hwa?

61
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,489
Oh, of course.

62
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,576
Yes, her.

63
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,162
You thought
she was an extra, didn't you?

64
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,130
If it's money you're after,

65
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,216
you should be blackmailing him,
not me.

66
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,596
You're in the waste disposal business.

67
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,806
Why aren't you disposing
of your husband?

68
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,728
I don't want to get my hands dirty.

69
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,147
What do you know
about Park Jong-gu?

70
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,190
Or,

71
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,859
do you know about me?

72
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,873
I married him with nothing,

73
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,543
His family
started this business,

74
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,172
but I'm the one who worked like a dog
to grow it into what it is now,

75
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,925
but my ass of a husband
spends the money I earned

76
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,343
like water.

77
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,470
And to his family,

78
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,388
he's always the king,

79
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,225
and I'm always

80
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,393
the slave.

81
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,939
I put up with it thinking of it as
paying off a debt.

82
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,608
I never imagined I'd still be here
20 years later.

83
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,528
I've seen a lot of crap.

84
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,572
His affairs?

85
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,869
I'm just relieved if he doesn't
molest anyone.

86
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,956
Do you know how many employees
I had to settle with

87
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,499
when we were newlyweds?

88
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,293
He was always getting himself
into trouble at the office,

89
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,422
so I gave him an allowance to stay away,
but then he got into gambling.

90
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,176
But it's been so long now
I don't know anymore.

91
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,053
He's a pathetic loser

92
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,764
but I still stay with him,

93
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,516
so doesn't that make us the same?

94
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,269
Do you get what I'm trying to say?

95
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,107
Screwing him over

96
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,401
would only harm myself.

97
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,905
Isn't that a risk you should be
willing to take?

98
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,490
For the sake of your own life?

99
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,200
What would I even use
against him?

100
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,493
Park Jong-gu.

101
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,663
I'll help you put him behind bars.

102
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,543
You won't be able to do that
with just a gambling charge.

103
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,712
That's just how the law is.

104
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,800
There has
to be an embezzlement

105
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,094
and setting up a gambling house charge

106
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,513
for it to be worthwhile enough
to go to trial.

107
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,933
All you need to do
is cut off his source

108
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,560
to funds when the stakes are high

109
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,687
so that he dips his hands
into company funds.

110
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,022
A few weeks later,

111
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,982
he'll be charged for opening

112
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,443
a gambling house with an acquaintance.

113
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,696
He'll be arrested on site.

114
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,539
She'll agree.

115
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,168
She's been playing a minor role
all her life,

116
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,545
but I'm going to make her the star.

117
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,147
Yeah.

118
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,441
I made him get the wrong idea.

119
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,444
Moo-young played a trick on me,

120
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,154
so why shouldn't I do the same?

121
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,950
I'll be honest with you now

122
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,369
about what I'm really after,

123
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,413
and it's not Park Jong-gu.

124
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,670
Both Na-sa and Mr. Han aren't answering.

125
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,341
She made sure we wouldn't
be anywhere the auto repair shop.

126
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,802
There's gotta be
something else going on.

127
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,470
You didn't hear anything?

128
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,098
Don't worry too much.

129
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,641
My guys are still there too.

130
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,101
What's the use?

131
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,354
The devices are down
so we can't read the cards anymore.

132
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,732
Geez.

133
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,985
Thanks.

134
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,447
Should we play a different game?

135
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,074
Sure.

136
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,867
How about Seotda?

137
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,119
Fine with me.

138
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,918
Mr. Han?

139
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,837
Mr. Go?

140
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,714
Mr. Go.

141
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,881
What are you doing here?

142
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,218
I could ask you the same thing.

143
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,138
What is a lawyer

144
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,723
doing here?

145
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,892
Edit the video so we get
a clear shot of Park Jong-gu' s face.

146
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,519
What's going on?

147
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,313
Where's Mr. Han?

148
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,693
Tell me.

149
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,700
The cops came.

150
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,535
Then how did you…

151
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,373
You called them?

152
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,668
Why on earth

153
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,504
are you always the one

154
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,798
hanging around local ex-cons?

155
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,717
Mr. Go, uh…

156
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,265
Why are you here?

157
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,350
On private property.

158
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,602
We received a tip
about illegal gambling.

159
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,936
Happening where?

160
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,521
The basement.

161
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,648
Who reported it?

162
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,899
Are you the owner here?

163
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,443
I'm his lawyer.

164
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,154
I think you must be mistaken.

165
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,906
This place doesn't have a basement.

166
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,115
We'll find out

167
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,867
soon enough once we search the place.

168
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,953
May I check your IDs please?

169
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,210
No, she wouldn't have.

170
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,836
My guys are in there too.

171
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,296
And what about Na-sa?

172
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,221
-We're back.
-We're back.

173
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,807
You guys…

174
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,018
Oh, we're late because
we stopped to grab a bite to eat.

175
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,105
So, you guys left after
setting everything up,

176
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,691
but what are you doing here?

177
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,527
We heard someone else
was standing in for him to play.

178
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,278
That's why we went for a meal together.

179
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,571
Huh?
Who told you that?

180
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,158
Uh… Mr. Han.

181
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,410
Huh?

182
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,168
What the heck is going on?

183
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,296
Then…

184
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,048
Who is that?

185
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,258
I don't know.

186
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,015
Hey, hang on.

187
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,934
I'll deal.

188
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,894
All right.

189
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,194
Aren't you hot in that mask?

190
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,946
What are you doing here?

191
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,284
I thought you were a lawyer.

192
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,827
Don't you know?

193
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,079
I'm Su-ho's probation officer.

194
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,667
You do know he has a record, right?

195
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,793
Your client.

196
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,422
I think it was
about this time last year.

197
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,591
Yes, it was about a year ago.

198
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,343
He was arrested for compulsive gambling

199
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,846
based on Article 264
of the Criminal Act.

200
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,224
And got two years on probation.

201
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,226
But,

202
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,148
he hasn't reported in
for nearly a month,

203
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,609
and didn't respond to my calls or texts.

204
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,195
I noticed that loan sharks
were hanging around the shop,

205
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,822
while the shutters have been down
for a long time.

206
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,116
And in the middle of all that,

207
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,534
I heard about the tip

208
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,245
regarding
an illegal gambling house here,

209
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,538
so just like that,

210
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,999
I decided to come check it out
with the police.

211
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,300
This place really doesn't
have a basement?

212
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,343
No, it doesn't.

213
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,221
And you didn't gamble?

214
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,972
I didn't.

215
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,766
Then why do you have a lawyer?

216
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,310
I was giving legal advice.

217
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,313
In the dark?

218
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,232
Without any lights on?

219
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,192
You were consulting?

220
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,947
There's no basement here.

221
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,408
Do you mind
if we look around a little more?

222
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,493
Go ahead.

223
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,831
Su-ho.

224
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,042
Have you forgotten how to talk?

225
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,335
Oh…

226
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,542
Hey.

227
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,130
Huh?

228
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,258
He's winning.

229
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,843
He keeps winning.

230
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,600
You're right.

231
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,476
He wasn't before.

232
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,587
I'm sorry about this.

233
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,925
I finally won.

234
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,217
Hang on.

235
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,978
I'm the one who's sorry.

236
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,731
Wait.

237
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,149
Stop right there.

238
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,985
You must be cheating.

239
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,423
Who is that?

240
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,803
Who the hell is that?

241
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,472
You didn't find
a gambling den.

242
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,683
so you have no grounds
to make an arrest.

243
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,435
You've damaged property and searched

244
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,270
the place for over ten minutes.

245
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,606
Do you need more time?

246
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,858
Not time, evidence.

247
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,987
What's that?

248
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,081
What is that?

249
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,632
I'll tell you

250
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,300
why you got that tip.

251
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,429
You know something?

252
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,807
I'll tell you where the actual
gambling den is.

253
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,350
Where is it?

254
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,062
Na Su-ho has nothing to do with it.

255
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,232
Catching gamblers in the act
is a priority.

256
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,943
If arrests are made
based on your information,

257
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,737
you'll be considered an informant.

258
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,573
If we can make the arrest right now.

259
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,784
If you go to the convenience
store at Janggubeol Intersection,

260
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,369
you'll find a passageway
in their storage

261
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,956
that leads to Hansiso Village
Apartment A.

262
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,792
Na Su-ho discovered it.

263
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,419
And he told me.

264
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,465
I don't know who called in the tip
but it must've been to get back at him.

265
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,887
This is unit 12 of Dolma Patrol,

266
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,514
We just got a tip that
that there's a gambling den

267
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,141
in an illegally remodeled apartment.

268
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,060
The entrance is by
Janggubeol Intersection.

269
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,437
It must be quite big
if they dug a passageway.

270
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,065
We need you to come to
the station for a statement.

271
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,776
The basement floor
of Hansiso Village Apartment A.

272
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,528
Go through the basement,

273
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,364
Calling for backup.

274
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,825
Damn it.

275
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,579
Is it over?

276
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,582
Hello?

277
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,709
It's over.

278
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,628
He won all the money.

279
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,466
I'll call you back.

280
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,521
They found
the secret passageway.

281
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,440
You might be asked to come in
for questioning as a witness.

282
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,900
You can either come alone,

283
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,276
or come with your lawyer.

284
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,825
Unit 12 moving out.

285
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,295
Is there anything else?

286
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,632
It seems like a strange coincidence,

287
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,927
but we both know

288
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,222
another probationer, other than Su-ho.

289
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,349
Oh,

290
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,893
she's also your client.

291
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,940
I could write it off as a small world,
but because of my job,

292
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,234
I can't help wonder…

293
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:17,573
Does Na Su-ho also know Lee Ro-eum?

294
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,450
It's just a thought.

295
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,495
I'll see you around then.

296
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,955
Somewhere unexpected.

297
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,898
We need to talk.

298
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,193
I'll meet you at your place
in the morning.

299
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,579
Thank you.

300
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,539
For you, anything.

301
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,887
SEOYOUNG STUDY ROOM

302
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,779
I thought about it all night.

303
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,407
What was it
that you were really after?

304
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,034
To get rid of an annoying lawyer?

305
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,244
Or,

306
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,912
to test him?

307
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:34,334
Did I pass the test
since I handled the situation?

308
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,713
Or did I fail to take the hint?

309
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,383
Maybe you just wanted me out of the way.

310
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,639
You like the truth so much.

311
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,267
I was just trying to show you

312
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,936
that this was no place for a lawyer.

313
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,937
I told you,

314
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,022
I have an illness.

315
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,607
I'm not just any lawyer.

316
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,609
I'm a really bad lawyer.

317
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,893
Are you Lee Ro-eum?

318
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,770
Yes?

319
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,937
What is this about?

320
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,982
You're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

321
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,067
Wait.

322
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,653
What do you mean,
conspiracy to commit murder?

323
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,907
Ye Chung-sik was murdered
in his cell last night.

324
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:50,535
The suspect confessed you hired him.

325
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,870
Please step aside.

326
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,413
Ye Chung-sik is dead?

327
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,249
You can talk at the station.

328
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,837
What other grounds do you have
other than a confession?

329
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,048
Who are you?

330
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,966
I'm her lawyer.

331
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,512
I'm sure you're familiar
with obstruction of justice then.

332
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,807
For conspiracy to commit murder,

333
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,726
as stated in Article 200-4
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

334
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,062
you may be held for
for a maximum of 48 hours,

335
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,147
-What's the time of arrest?
-8:28 a.m.

336
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,650
You have been
arrested at 8:28 a.m.

337
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,984
This is an emergency arrest.

338
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,904
You have the right to a lawyer,

339
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,240
but I guess you already know that.

340
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,658
You have the right to defend yourself,

341
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,827
and file a claim to review
the legality of the arrest.

342
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,913
If she requests

343
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,665
a lawyer during questioning,

344
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,502
we'll contact you immediately.

345
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,547
Take her away.

346
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,116
It happened last night.

347
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,622
With a sharpened toothbrush.

348
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,504
There were several witnesses,

349
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,131
but he didn't even care.

350
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,718
As soon as they grabbed him
he gave them Lee Ro-eum's name.

351
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,096
Apparently, he said he'd tell them
everything about her hire for murder

352
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,514
if they let him meet her.

353
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,187
If that were true,

354
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,105
why give up his client's name

355
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,481
right after the crime?

356
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,318
I think they agreed
to the terms.

357
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,278
They're cross-examining them tomorrow.

358
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,032
To be frank, I never expected her to

359
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,117
lead an easy life after getting out.

360
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,077
What I didn't expect

361
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,787
was you showing up in her life.

362
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,503
I thought she'd have fired you
after the damages suit.

363
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,839
Why are you still her lawyer?

364
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,592
What's so strange about

365
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,344
a lawyer defending their client?

366
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,805
You don't know what kind
of person she is.

367
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,353
You don't know either.

368
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,151
I'll be in touch.

369
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,710
Hey.

370
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,712
Don't talk to me.

371
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,881
Cheer up.

372
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,176
I said, don't talk to me.

373
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,179
I didn't tell her.

374
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,432
Then was it Da-jeong?

375
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:05,188
How would I have known you were still
taking money from Jang Kyung-ja?

376
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,107
Damn it.

377
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,694
It was just business, okay?

378
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,947
You all took her money
when you were young, didn't you?

379
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,033
We provided our skills
and they paid us for it.

380
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,244
Ro-eum took their money too!

381
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,747
Geez, damn it.

382
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,748
Hey!

383
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,083
Who does Ro-eum think she is?

384
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,252
Why is she so selfish?

385
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,839
If I'm being totally honest,
we've known each other for ten years,

386
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,133
but did she ever show
any respect for us?

387
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,553
Did she ever share
any of her plans with us?

388
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,263
Damn it.

389
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,433
I should never have listened
to her in the first place.

390
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,476
She's a scary bitch,
you know that, right?

391
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,395
Ever since we were kids.

392
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,315
A girl like that
rotted in prison for ten years,

393
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,150
so she'd be even scarier now,
don't you think?

394
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,277
That's how she can scheme like this.

395
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,570
Geez.

396
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,821
You guys

397
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,656
should stay away from her too.

398
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,074
Whatever her reason was,

399
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,369
she tried to get me arrested.
That's a fact.

400
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,579
Damn it.

401
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,749
Just because I took a little money
from that woman.

402
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,791
Geez!

403
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,419
How could she do this to me
after I barely got out!

404
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,921
We were worse.

405
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,342
We did it first.

406
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,426
Betraying her.

407
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,069
Yes, hello?

408
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,321
DAJEONG COMIC BOOK

409
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,789
Come on in.

410
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,929
A few days ago,

411
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,806
I went to visit Ye Chung-sik.

412
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,140
What did he say?

413
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,394
He had no idea how he was arrested,

414
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,439
but he said he had a deal with Red Eye
and that they had betrayed him.

415
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,400
We're the ones that got him arrested.

416
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,903
He made the deal on his own,

417
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,447
but Red Eye would never
move as he expected.

418
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,118
I think he was backed into a corner
after the money stopped coming.

419
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,703
He must've realized
he could be taken out.

420
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,122
And he was right.

421
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,625
Hong Chang-gi.

422
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:34,295
He was the director's driver
before Red Eye went bankrupt.

423
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,339
He lost all his assets
in the stock market,

424
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,717
and went into hiding after defaulting
on his loans.

425
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,969
Then he was arrested in 2021 for fraud,

426
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,971
and he's been in prison
for over a year now.

427
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,765
He's a ghost.

428
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:46,975
A ghost?

429
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,352
That's what Red Eye
called the disposable help.

430
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,063
They usually chose people
whose lives had hit rock bottom.

431
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,733
They knew their weaknesses
so they were easy to target,

432
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,110
and those people were bold
because they had nothing to lose.

433
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,570
Moreover,

434
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,321
they were easy to buy with money.

435
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,574
Like the Geumseong murders.

436
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,743
Yes, exactly.

437
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,204
How did they involve Ro-eum though?

438
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,207
There was a man named Ahn Chae-hong
who was a director of Red Eye.

439
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,126
People believe he committed suicide,

440
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:17,380
but Ro-eum believes he was murdered
because he knew the Chairman's identity.

441
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,841
That's why they paid off
Ahn Chae-hong's driver,

442
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,593
Hong Chang-gi, for information.

443
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,429
They could've said it was money
for a contract killing.

444
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,890
Is the Chairman behind this too?

445
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,517
How did you know?

446
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,227
Ye Chung-sik told me

447
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,481
that the Chairman called that day.

448
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,151
Why do you think

449
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,861
Ro-eum's parents had to die?

450
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,115
Ro-eum's parents

451
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,242
found her in the end.

452
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,327
After ten years.

453
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,431
I wrote letters,

454
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,519
and did everything I could.

455
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,732
Did you get my letters?

456
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,782
I didn't know if I could bring myself
to say what I wanted to say,

457
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,117
so I wrote them down.

458
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,871
They told us

459
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,833
you didn't want to see us,

460
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,127
so that's what we thought.

461
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,174
I'm so sorry.

462
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,265
Not long after

463
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,934
you had left,

464
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,980
I couldn't eat,

465
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,857
I couldn't sleep…

466
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,445
But they told me
they couldn't allow you to leave

467
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,364
since you had taken the scholarship.

468
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,785
You father was ill,

469
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,831
and we kept getting
deeper and deeper into debt.

470
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,001
Honestly,

471
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,296
we just wanted to believe

472
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,884
that you were doing well.

473
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,513
Since you were so smart and sweet,

474
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,019
we thought you'd be better off there

475
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,563
than at home.

476
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,031
We're so sorry.

477
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,914
I know it sounds like an excuse,

478
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,833
and so shameless,

479
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,723
but will you please come home

480
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,600
with us?

481
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,232
Let's go home.

482
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,286
EAT WELL AND STAY HEALTHY

483
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,080
OUR HOME'S STILL THE SAME

484
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,724
Ro-eum just wanted
to go back to her family.

485
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,767
That's all.

486
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,359
Ye Chung-sik

487
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,863
told his fellow inmates

488
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,449
that he was just the patsy

489
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,701
5 HOURS AFTER THE ARREST

490
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,536
and that the real killer
was someone else.

491
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,999
You sent commissary money
to Hong Chang-gi, didn't you?

492
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,083
What kind of trick

493
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,253
were you playing with those two?

494
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,510
I knew a psychopath like you

495
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,345
would be back.

496
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,557
My boss

497
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,601
arrested you ten years ago
and got your confession.

498
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,814
I thought we had put
an evil bitch like you away for good,

499
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,444
but who knew all hell would break loose
ten years later?

500
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,158
Did you start seeing red
when you heard Ye Chung-sik

501
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,285
was saying he'd expose
the real killer?

502
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,831
That's why you hired Hong Chang-gi
to kill him.

503
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:05,084
You paid him and used that smart
brain of yours to threaten him.

504
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,546
Oh,

505
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,423
I remember.

506
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,011
The interrogation ten years ago
went just like this.

507
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,183
What are you talking about?

508
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,979
It was just so obvious that

509
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,356
he was following orders like a dog.

510
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,649
Your boss.

511
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,027
Why, you little…

512
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,695
How dare you?

513
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,741
You better watch your mouth.

514
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,119
Lawyer.

515
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,998
I want my lawyer.

516
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,115
What are you doing?

517
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,366
I don't have time for this.

518
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,992
That's Ro-eum's bag.

519
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,918
I told you,

520
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,296
my job is to make sure she doesn't
go anywhere near the mud.

521
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,259
You should be able to tell whether
she walked in herself or fell in.

522
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,136
I'm sorry,
but is the trial over?

523
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,222
It's my understanding
she was arrested today.

524
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,058
She's presumed innocent
until proven guilty.

525
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,434
Oh, well,

526
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,479
to me, she's just a criminal.

527
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,358
Just like the other 100 or so ex-cons
assigned to me.

528
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,610
Are you sure about that?

529
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,073
It feels like your interest in her
is a bit excessive

530
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,616
for a probation officer.

531
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,411
What do you mean?

532
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,038
Is that a compliment
about my professionalism?

533
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,833
Is that what you call professionalism?

534
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,334
Look, Mr. Attorney Han.

535
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,255
Don't you think you're getting
carried away with playing the hero?

536
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,716
I'm just doing my job.

537
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,093
You go do yours.

538
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,015
Should we make a bet?

539
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,727
Let's see who she really needs.

540
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,021
Her probation officer from
the Ministry of Justice,

541
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,231
of her lawyer who'll roll around
in the mud with her.

542
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,150
Let's just see, for the heck of it.

543
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,532
Where are you always off to these days?

544
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,875
The disciplinary hearing is in
two days but what are you working on?

545
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,254
Why are rumors going around about your
involvement in Ye Chung-sik's death?

546
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,717
You were still meeting up
with Lee Ro-eum?

547
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,011
You didn't listen to a word I said?

548
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,848
I warned you there was something
off about her,

549
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,018
and to stay away from her
after that damages case!

550
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,521
Why are you doing this?

551
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,357
How long are you going to defend her?

552
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,776
Don't you know the meaning
of "lay low"?

553
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,069
Gyu.

554
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,904
If you go there

555
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,241
as Lee Ro-eum's lawyer,

556
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,244
and it turns out she's behind
the murder of Ye Chung-sik,

557
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,995
you'll be an accomplice too.

558
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,791
People are going to say
you betrayed Ye Chung-sik

559
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,753
and helped her murder him
as her lawyer.

560
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,214
I don't care.

561
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,507
Moo-young.

562
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,426
I just have to be
at the disciplinary hearing, right?

563
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,303
Don't you get what's going on?

564
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,807
Your former client who
you betrayed because of her

565
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,225
just got killed.

566
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,060
And they're saying she's behind it!

567
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,896
Did the judgment come out already?

568
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,568
If this is a problem,
I'll leave the firm.

569
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,779
Moo-young.

570
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,345
Deliver this to Ringo today.

571
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,183
Is that all?

572
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,813
Aren't you even curious

573
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,816
about whether
I really had him killed him or not?

574
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,818
Did you have him killed?

575
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,489
I won't think you did
unless you tell me otherwise.

576
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,714
8 HOURS AFTER THE ARREST

577
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,724
Did you read this?

578
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,642
No.

579
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,772
PUT A REVOLVER IN THE GOLF BAG

580
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,151
I'm sorry it took me
a while to answer.

581
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,903
What was it that I wanted?

582
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,323
FYI, I wrapped up the deal
with Shim Gyeong-hwa.

583
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,201
Park Jong-gu might have avoided
being arrested on site

584
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,577
thanks to Han Moo-young,

585
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,996
but we had evidence of his gambling
and embezzlement.

586
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,832
Moo-young

587
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,211
believed I wanted him out.

588
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,965
The same goes for Na-sa who had been
taking Jang Kyung-ja's money.

589
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:50,346
Park Jong-gu, the boss in name only
of the waste disposal company.

590
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,189
Recently, Wolgye Environment Development

591
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:04,235
secured a contract to dispose of evidence
from all the police stations

592
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,571
in the western and southern regions of
Gyeonggi-do.

593
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:20,418
The item that I need
will soon be disposed of too.

594
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,597
Who's it for?

595
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:35,850
Ro-eum.

596
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,312
Ro-eum is going to use this?

597
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,189
Why?

598
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,067
You've gotten quite chatty.

599
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,863
Is curiosity a sin?

600
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,449
It'll take a few days
to grind out the serial number.

601
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,617
Just leave it.

602
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,744
Leave the number.

603
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,873
I thought you said it was for Ro-eum?

604
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,542
Na Su-ho.

605
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,170
Who's your boss?

606
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,341
The person who pays me.

607
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,638
Not Ro-eum.

608
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,686
The revolver?

609
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,071
The revolver.

610
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,491
The revolver. Damn it!

611
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,579
Ro-eum, you bitch!

612
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,790
If Moo-young
delivered the note,

613
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:46,795
Ringo will bring it within 24 hours.

614
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,007
The revolver

615
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,052
that Na-sa assembled,
and Ye Chung-sik used

616
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,639
to kill my parents.

617
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,850
13 HOURS AFTER THE ARREST

618
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,032
Da-jeong.

619
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,450
Da-jeong.

620
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,786
Damn it!

621
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,540
Da-jeong!

622
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,583
Da-jeong!

623
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,253
Hey.

624
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,176
Ow.

625
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,765
I'm right, aren't I?

626
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,767
Wolgye Environment Development's
waste disposal contract.

627
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,685
What?

628
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,562
-Na-sa!
-Am I right?

629
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,859
Ro-eum
is looking for the revolver.

630
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,236
She knows

631
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,238
that I carved my name on it.

632
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,996
Calm down.

633
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,542
You don't care?

634
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,168
You don't care as long as
it's not you?

635
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,212
You don't care
if I go to prison?

636
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,465
You don't care about friends or family
just like her?

637
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,762
What does it matter
what I think?

638
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,140
What?

639
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,684
Whether she uses that gun
to send you to prison,

640
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,312
or expose Red Eye
or target the Chairman,

641
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,065
or kills us all one at a time,

642
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,028
we don't know what she'll do
and we can't stop her.

643
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,072
Just beg her for your life.

644
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,499
This is

645
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,876
the radius.

646
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,628
Take care of it quietly.

647
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,896
Let's just beg

648
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:09,980
for our lives.

649
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,822
WOLGYE ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT

650
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,367
We'll go in as their employees

651
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,870
and get all the evidence that's being
disposed of from the stations.

652
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,240
2022-AJ-5512
REVOLVER

653
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,214
Prepare a fake bag

654
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,633
and write down the serial number.

655
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,510
2022-AJ-5512
REVOLVER

656
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,135
Oh no.

657
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,512
I'm so sorry.

658
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,973
I'm so sorry.

659
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,349
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

660
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,064
We'll clean it up right away.
I'm sorry.

661
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,071
2022-AJ-23423.

662
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,199
Evidentiary item, two cotton swabs.

663
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:27,868
Check.

664
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,245
2022-AJ-11049.

665
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,663
Item, outer garment.

666
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:32,789
A jacket.

667
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:33,707
Check.

668
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:38,253
2022-AJ-5512.

669
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,672
Evidentiary item, one revolver.

670
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,472
Check.

671
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,951
Good work.

672
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:12,955
Boss.

673
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,290
Be careful.

674
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,792
Don't worry.

675
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,585
You guys won't get into trouble.

676
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,089
We're not worried about that.

677
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,718
See you.

678
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,183
32 HOURS AFTER THE ARREST

679
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,893
Let's start the cross examination.

680
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,771
Lee Ro-eum's lawyer may be present.

681
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,566
You have the right to refuse to make
self-incriminating statements.

682
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,526
The entire process will be recorded.

683
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,221
It's a gift.

684
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,932
It's just like ten years ago.

685
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,273
Keep your eyes open.

686
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,358
We will always

687
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,610
be watching you.

688
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,532
That's all.

689
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,957
What about
the contract killing?

690
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,171
She had nothing to do with it.

691
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,133
I just wanted to see her face.

692
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:50,844
I killed him

693
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,597
because I wanted to.

694
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,600
Ye Chung-sik, that prick

695
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,977
was always

696
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,354
so annoying.

697
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,273
Look here.

698
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,858
This is ridiculous.

699
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,818
We have records

700
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,528
of your commissary money…

701
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,738
Oh.

702
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,616
It's true I received money,

703
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,119
but it was for information

704
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,413
on how Ye Chung-sik was doing.

705
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,626
Is it a crime to tell her

706
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,130
about a fellow inmate?

707
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,048
What?

708
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,744
35 HOURS AFTER THE ARREST

709
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,914
What did Hong Chang-gi mean
by what he said?

710
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,124
Was it some kind of code?

711
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,085
Did you really send him commissary money

712
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,545
because you were curious
about Ye Chung-sik?

713
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,462
No.

714
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,298
It's not a normal choice
that people make.

715
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,969
You're not entirely innocent, either.

716
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,762
You committed fraud and assault
in prison too.

717
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,598
The way I see it,
you've been planning this since then.

718
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,267
You bought off Ye Chung-sik,

719
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,352
and gave him the weapon you used
all those years ago.

720
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,937
Right?
No?

721
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,981
We're searching

722
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,191
Hong Chang-gi's house right now.

723
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,777
What are you going to do
if we find something there?

724
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,863
You'll really regret not talking.

725
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,156
Do you smoke?

726
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,325
If there's anything you'd like to eat,
tell me. I'll order it for you.

727
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,828
Then why did you confess?

728
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,413
Because my boss coerced you?

729
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,457
He was a nobody,

730
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,292
just a fat old boomer.

731
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,502
Why would someone smart like you

732
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,713
confess to something

733
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,631
you didn't even do?

734
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,594
Oh,

735
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,722
you must want to go to prison.

736
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,225
That must be it.

737
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,148
Say something, will you?

738
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,942
If you keep your mouth shut,

739
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,904
I can only assume
that you're admitting to the crime.

740
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,031
Do you admit it?

741
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,784
Say something!

742
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,079
Take a seat.

743
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,499
What were you doing?

744
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,628
Preparing for tomorrow's trial.

745
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:30,670
Hmm.

746
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,217
How's Ro-eum doing?

747
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,510
She's okay, right?

748
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,719
She's fine.

749
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,304
She'll be out by tomorrow.

750
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,263
Okay.

751
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,100
Ro-eum's room.

752
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,685
Someone tossed it.

753
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,437
It was probably the police.

754
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,524
I moved some of her things
before they came.

755
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,442
Oh.

756
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,486
That's why I couldn't find the bag.

757
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,824
Uh, Moo-young.

758
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,034
Yes?

759
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,746
Why do you think we're all back together
again despite how broken we all are?

760
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,458
We always wanted to run,

761
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,210
and get away from it all.

762
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,420
But we never had the courage.

763
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,298
Funny, isn't it?

764
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,050
The person who left Red Eye first

765
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:20,136
was Ro-eum who never once
thought about escaping.

766
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,139
Not the rest of us who always
dreamed about it.

767
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,642
Did I tell you?

768
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,145
I owe her my life.

769
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,226
If you want to kill him,
just kill him.

770
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,604
Don't drag it out by torturing him.

771
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,901
I need him.

772
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,861
So stop messing him up.

773
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,865
Tell the Chairman

774
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,034
if he hurts him anymore,

775
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,369
I won't work for him either.

776
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,416
The Geumseong murders.

777
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,502
Da-jeong and Na-sa
were a part of it too.

778
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,254
I just ran.

779
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:40,008
They can at least make an excuse
saying they had to follow orders,

780
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,384
but not me.

781
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,347
I knew she was in danger,

782
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,599
but I chose to save myself first.

783
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,393
She saved my life,

784
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,729
but I abandoned her
all those years ago.

785
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:58,735
That's why I'm loyal

786
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,154
and dedicate my life to her.

787
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,866
But that's just me.

788
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,203
She was the one
who called the cops on our op.

789
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:11,539
If it had all gone to her plan,
a lot of people would've gotten hurt.

790
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,584
None of us know what she's thinking,

791
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,336
and no one can control her.

792
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:22,634
Moo-young.

793
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,097
I can trust you, right?

794
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,559
I'm supposed to put this

795
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,812
in the bag she mentioned.

796
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,148
Do you think I should?

797
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:42,904
Yes.

798
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,573
Do it.

799
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,537
Thank you.

800
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,937
Ever since Ro-eum chose her family,

801
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,275
the Chairman has been toying with her.

802
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,069
UNKNOWN USER

803
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,976
BAR ASSOCIATION

804
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,596
END OF THE ARREST

805
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,773
Hey.

806
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,694
That's mine.

807
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:30,530
No.

808
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,365
It was stolen.

809
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:35,785
Give it back.

810
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,454
I understand.

811
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,206
You understand?

812
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,375
I do.

813
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,299
You?

814
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,680
Yes.

815
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:56,806
I do.

816
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,188
Three months.

817
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,858
Just trust me for three months.

818
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,029
Since I'm no longer
a lawyer for three months.

819
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,242
Ro-eum.

820
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,371
He's Han Jae-seok's son.

821
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,751
Of Moyang Foods.
When we were 14,

822
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,631
we made that company go bankrupt.

823
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,668
Han Moo-young

824
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,128
was his son.

825
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,937
I'm going to eradicate Red Eye
from this country.

826
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,525
And to do that,
the first thing I need to do

827
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,985
is go after Jang Kyung-ja.

828
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:36,990
Okay.

829
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,158
Let's do it together.

830
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,159
Let's run a con.

831
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,901
You're going to run a con
with a lawyer?

832
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:14,902
Use me.

833
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,654
I'm using you.

834
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,740
I'm a suspended lawyer.

835
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:19,782
Because of you.

836
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,159
Did you know

837
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,161
they're all part of a team?

838
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:27,081
Scholarship students
from the same foundation.

839
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,166
What do you want?

840
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,251
It's been a while.

841
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,295
I've been wanting
to ask you something.

842
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,172
The truth about Red Eye.

843
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,715
It's in here.

844
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,550
The identity of the Chairman.
