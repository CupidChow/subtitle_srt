1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,512
Next presenter, please get ready.

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:13,847
Great job.

3
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,192
Hundreds of thousands of people visit
Napo every year

4
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,194
to see its beautiful beach.

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,530
And on one side of the beach,

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,367
although they don't blend in well,

7
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,621
two silos are standing there.

8
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,000
How should we change them?

9
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,087
Please take a moment to listen to this.

10
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,423
NAPO SILO SOUND

11
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,525
Hello.

12
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,862
I'm from TSC Architecture Office.

13
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,698
My name is Seong Yun-o.

14
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,769
Is that a student's work or what?

15
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,604
Professor!

16
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,158
What could this sound be?

17
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,786
This is the sound

18
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:47,792
from inside a silo
that is 20 meters wide and 50 meters high.

19
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,588
When you enter the silo here,

20
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:57,594
even the smallest sound of your breath
echoes off the rusted iron plates…

21
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,600
allowing you to feel
the sound of your own breath

22
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,393
in a way you've never felt before.

23
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,189
How long have the rusted plates

24
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,275
lasted inside this silo?

25
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,945
Fifty years.

26
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:23,703
They've been waiting for your voice
and breath for 50 years.

27
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,635
It's heavy.

28
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,194
SOMEBODY

29
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,079
Change the entrance again?

30
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,333
But then we'll have to change
the whole structure.

31
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,922
Think of all the people
who will suffer a loss.

32
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,175
What's the point of all that?

33
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,093
What?

34
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,263
There's nothing special about our lives.

35
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,516
We'll all be forgotten with time.

36
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,562
To leave behind
a lasting mark in this world.

37
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,025
Is there anything more important
to us than that?

38
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,991
We have to at least strive
to achieve that.

39
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,620
TSC DIRECTOR

40
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,335
Yeong-hoon,
do you see Earth out the window?

41
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,213
It's time to get back to Earth.

42
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,548
I enjoyed our space trip.

43
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,343
Yun-o, get a hold of yourself.

44
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,191
Na-eun. Don't wait for me, get some sleep.

45
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,750
EDIT PROFILE

46
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,101
WANT TO GO FOR A DRIVE?

47
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,860
A NICE DAY TO ENJOY A DRINK ALONE

48
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,946
DRINKING ALONE, BUSINESS TRIP, LOVE
SEA AT NIGHT, LET'S TALK

49
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,755
A LONELY NIGHT
THE SEA AT NIGHT

50
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,808
SEND A MESSAGE

51
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,192
Huh? I just saw those fireworks.

52
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,152
Really?

53
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,030
Yes!

54
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,116
We must be close.

55
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,785
Did you see the fireworks?

56
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,538
They were right in front of me.

57
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,958
Whoa, are you the one that set them off?

58
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,292
Yes.

59
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,670
Having a beer alone is too boring.

60
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,672
I wanted to set the sky on fire.

61
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,008
Wow, thanks to you,
I felt a little better for a moment.

62
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,385
It was satisfying.

63
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,637
You must've had a bad day.

64
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,099
Actually, it's never a good day.

65
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,017
Life is boring.

66
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,312
LIFE IS BORING… LOL

67
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,234
ACCEPT VOICE CHAT WITH 15?

68
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,703
Why is it boring?

69
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,372
Well…

70
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,377
I've chased my dream to get to this point.

71
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,297
But now my dream has vanished,
and I'm already over 30.

72
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,383
If someone treats me nicely
with a warm gaze

73
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,636
and offers to give me something great,

74
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,305
I just fall for them.

75
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:56,225
Then, when they turn their back on me,
I'm left hanging.

76
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,565
But…

77
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,944
today I saw a splendid piece of work
that I had only dreamed of.

78
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,823
So I feel worse.

79
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,492
It's so annoying.

80
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,247
To be honest, I'm jealous.

81
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,044
Because I've become so run-down now.

82
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,924
There's not much I can say to comfort you.

83
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,884
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,557
I've shared too much with a stranger.
How embarrassing.

85
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,476
I'll set off some fireworks for you.

86
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,910
START A VIDEO CHAT WITH 15?

87
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,252
-Huh? You…
-Um…

88
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,046
You're…

89
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,967
-Were you at the…
-Right?

90
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,306
No, it's mine.

91
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,780
Give me money too.

92
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,874
Hey, you bastard!

93
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,640
Would you like to try Napo soju?

94
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,350
-Yes.
-Okay.

95
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,686
-Ma'am!
-Yes.

96
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,938
What is the Napo soju called here?

97
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,106
Samhak soju.

98
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,610
Yes, I'd like one of those.

99
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,527
All right.

100
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,198
A table opened up over there.
Would you like to move?

101
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,620
-Sure.
-Okay!

102
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,841
The sky is really pretty, right?

103
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,054
PROFESSOR MIN

104
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,368
PROFESSOR MIN

105
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,997
You fucker.

106
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,582
I'm…

107
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,918
done with you.

108
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,506
Didn't you say you love him earlier?

109
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,093
He has another woman.

110
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,432
You don't care, do you?

111
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,269
Fine, I'll tell you what you want to know.

112
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,857
This is what he wrote.

113
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:39,281
"You can hear the sound of your breath
echoing inside the silo?"

114
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,369
"That's when only one person goes in."

115
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,038
"How many people can enter in a day?"

116
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,123
"What about profit?"

117
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,876
"I mean,

118
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,797
does he really think the local government
would run a culture center

119
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,966
that can't even earn its upkeep costs?"

120
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,845
That's what he said.

121
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,308
"A student's work."

122
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,020
Well, you're not a student but…

123
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:14,692
"A student's work."

124
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,486
Professor, can you see me?

125
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,657
Do you see what I'm wearing?

126
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,232
What the…

127
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,073
Jeez.

128
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,911
Na-eun.

129
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,245
Gosh.

130
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,206
Oh Na-eun!

131
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,707
Damn it!

132
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,959
What the hell?

133
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,053
Why did you ask me to come out here?

134
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,474
Hey, Na-eun.

135
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,811
You'll need a spanking today, huh?

136
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,231
You…

137
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,431
What?

138
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,199
Gosh.

139
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,445
Please!

140
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,274
CONGRATULATIONS ON BECOMING
THE KING OF GAMES THIS MONTH, EMMA

141
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,555
I NEED TO SEE YOUR FACE!
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

142
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,390
Are you busy?

143
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,814
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE FROM ISLE

144
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,733
WON, 29

145
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,318
DREAMS ARE SHORT BUT HAPPY

146
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,328
I LOVE SOMEONE WHO LAUGHS A LOT

147
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,422
WHEELCHAIR
BARRIER-FREE

148
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,366
CANCEL MATCH

149
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,341
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE FROM WHEEL ME

150
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,028
HELLO! I'M TOO LATE, AREN'T I?

151
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,696
IT'S SO SUNNY OUTSIDE.

152
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,116
IT'S ALMOST ANNOYING
TO BE STUCK INSIDE.

153
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,674
You're right.

154
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,135
WOW, I GOT A REPLY! HAHA

155
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,430
I WAS WORRIED WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO TALK BECAUSE I WAS TOO LATE.

156
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,270
I thought it was interesting
that your profile picture is a wheelchair.

157
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,938
That's why I wanted to chat with you.

158
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,987
AH! THE WHEELCHAIR SAVED ME? HAHA

159
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,031
I STARTED LIVING WITH MY WHEELCHAIR
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

160
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,451
What does that mean?

161
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,371
With your wheelchair?

162
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,092
Do you use a wheelchair?

163
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,983
SANGDONG POLICE STATION

164
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,027
I did what the group chat told me to do,

165
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,946
and I made a 230% profit
with the crypto in a week!

166
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,033
I put in ten million won
and earned 23 million won!

167
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,784
So obviously I couldn't think rationally!

168
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,829
So you clicked on the smishing text?

169
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,457
Yes, even the host told me to do it.

170
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,918
Your complaint has been filed.

171
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:08,423
If you send us proof of your transaction,
the IP address, your bank statement,

172
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,426
and the stock exchange details,
your case will be moved to our division.

173
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,513
-Please help me out.
-Sure.

174
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:16,848
Just a moment.

175
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,644
Let me write down what I told you.

176
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,774
IP address.

177
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,694
You'll need to send me all of these.

178
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,337
ARE YOU… CURIOUS?

179
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,971
Please hold on for a moment.

180
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,908
Well, it's just that…

181
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,038
I… use a wheelchair…

182
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,943
REALLY? NICE TO MEET YOU!

183
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,032
I'M IN A WHEELCHAIR TOO!

184
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,533
HAVE YOU EATEN YET?

185
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,719
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU, CUCKOO

186
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,223
CUCKOO: LOL, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

187
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,893
WHEEL ME: HAHA
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS WEEKEND?

188
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,103
WELL, I DON'T HAVE PLANS YET!

189
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,606
OH! GREAT!
I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE!

190
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,901
Where to?

191
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,404
YOU SAID YOU WANT TO SWIM.
SO I'LL TAKE YOU SWIMMING!

192
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,239
All right, I'll trust you.

193
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,895
You're in my seat.

194
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,022
Yeah, I know.

195
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,316
Your butt's nice and warm.

196
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,202
This is yours…

197
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,455
and this is mine.

198
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,311
All those bottles from there to there.

199
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,313
They're all mine.

200
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,232
I'm friends with the bartender here.

201
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,735
If you want any of it…

202
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,239
show her this.

203
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,327
I AM INSTRUCTOR LEE YOON.

204
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,459
What if I drink them all?

205
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:18,256
If you drink any of them,
my friend over there will call me.

206
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,593
Then I'll come…

207
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,181
like this.

208
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,017
And if you're drunk…

209
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,074
Then I'll be nervous.

210
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,370
Do whatever you want.

211
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,981
Drop me off
in front of the convenience store.

212
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,399
Yeah, here.

213
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,240
Man…

214
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,242
We're already here.

215
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:29,911
Thanks.

216
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,790
You're just going to leave like this?

217
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,417
I have work early in the morning.

218
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,169
What do you do?

219
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,260
I can drive you to work tomorrow.

220
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,898
You still aren't giving me your number?

221
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,321
Bye.

222
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,665
Why do you use Somebody?

223
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,672
I want to connect with people.

224
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,467
How?

225
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,514
You should be asking who, rather than how.

226
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,018
With whom?

227
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,273
People who can understand me.

228
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,029
What would you do with the cat?

229
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,701
I'd probably do the same as you.

230
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,539
What you're thinking now, it's right.

231
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,708
Do it.

232
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,550
I killed the cat.

233
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,261
Do you think I'm a monster?

234
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,640
No, not at all…

235
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,560
I told you to do it.

236
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,981
I know you wanted to help the cat.

237
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,567
So that it wouldn't suffer.

238
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,571
Great job!

239
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,157
Where are you now?

240
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,327
I need to see your face!

241
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,995
I'll be right there.

242
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,793
Is this supposed to be funny?

243
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,091
Sometimes, I do ribbon cutting on my own.

244
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,206
Yes, I'll tell you when I get there.

245
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,833
WHEEL ME: ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY?

246
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,251
I'll be there soon.

247
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,356
ACCEPT VOICE CHAT WITH WHEEL ME?

248
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,779
Let's talk like this.

249
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,448
This way, our hands are free.

250
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,450
Okay.

251
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,871
I'm crossing the bridge
and heading down right now.

252
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,456
Ah, okay.

253
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,918
So, I found this place that I really like.

254
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,963
The pool is like the ocean.

255
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,507
I'll send you a picture.

256
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,058
It looks so nice.

257
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,810
Isn't it?

258
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:36,063
I think I can get there in my wheelchair.
I'll be there soon.

259
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,816
Yes, I think
you'll be able to get pretty close.

260
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,737
Keep coming down,
until you're next to the black greenhouse.

261
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,989
Oh, okay.

262
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,957
The swimming pool.

263
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,792
Look.

264
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,547
Are you going to show me the pool
and not your face?

265
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,383
I want to see your face.

266
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,973
The pool is so big.

267
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,436
Are you sure we can swim there?

268
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,355
Of course.

269
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,007
Hey, Mok-won!

270
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,217
Hey, how are you?

271
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,053
What's up? I'm good.

272
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,805
Is something wrong?

273
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,932
My dream was a mess.

274
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,476
-Your dream?
-You were in it.

275
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,271
What sort of dream? Did I die?

276
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,815
Jeez.

277
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,483
That's not it.

278
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,819
It's fine now that I hear you.

279
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,238
You're creeping me out.
Do I need to be careful?

280
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,448
I'm getting a call. I'll call you back.

281
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,664
Yes, hello?

282
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,166
Hello? Mok-won, did you call me?

283
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,377
There were a lot of customers today.

284
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,421
Is something wrong?

285
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,674
Oh, I called because you
and my friends were in my dream.

286
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,050
In your dream?

287
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,051
What's wrong?

288
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,888
GI-EUN
CONNECTING…

289
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,401
What is she doing?
Why isn't she picking up?

290
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,298
GI-EUN
CALL FAILED

291
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,380
HERRINGTON
I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL TODAY

292
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,134
GI-EUN
CONNECTING…

293
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,618
Hey, why did it take so long for you to…

294
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,583
Hello?

295
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,466
Who are you?

296
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,223
Uh…

297
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,226
May I speak to Gi-eun?

298
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,942
Did something happen
to the owner of this phone?

299
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,867
She's a police officer.

300
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,166
Excuse me.

301
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,837
Can you lower the volume, please?

302
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,949
Yes, I'm here

303
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,285
at a restaurant on Euljiro sam-ga.

304
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,539
I picked up a phone here.

305
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:14,420
I'll leave it at the restaurant,
and I'll send you their number

306
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,754
so you can come pick it up.

307
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,172
Do you know…

308
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,651
AN.JP.0423: I'LL BUY YOU BEER

309
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,279
SORRY FOR RESPONDING SO LATE

310
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,998
MISSING LOVELOVE
DAMN THE SOPHOMORE OLD-TIMERS!

311
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,083
THEY ARE SO PATHETIC!

312
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,004
IF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE OLD…

313
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,635
Fuck.

314
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,429
Is this a survival game?

315
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,729
I'm going to kill that bastard.

316
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:06,193
