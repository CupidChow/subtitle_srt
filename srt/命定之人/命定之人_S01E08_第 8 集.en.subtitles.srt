00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,591
Over here, everyone.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,177
Everyone?

3
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,221
Yes, I'll take the photo now.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,307
One, two, three.

00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,560
EULJIRO REDEVELOPMENT MERCHANTS
ASSOCIATION, REMEMBERING THE YEARS

6
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,718
You're here.

7
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,349
I have something to--

8
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,684
Hey, Sum.

9
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,148
When I took a proper look at the photo
of you and your boyfriend, I could tell.

10
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,736
He's not your boyfriend.

11
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,032
I know you.

12
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,285
You care about body proportions.

13
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,997
And you like men
who look like David of Michelangelo.

14
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,592
I also

15
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,513
didn't believe you when you said
you were going to track down

16
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,767
that limp David by yourself.

17
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,817
I did what I did…

18
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:55,365
because it had been so long
since I met a guy.

19
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,033
That's why.

20
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,377
Sum.

21
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,964
I'm gonna catch that bastard.

22
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,219
Promise me that you won't interfere.

23
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:29,232

24
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,997

HUH? I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME BACK
BECAUSE YOU KNEW.

30
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,630
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME?
HOW DISAPPOINTING…

31
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:45,767
OH… SO WE DO KNOW EACH OTHER.

32
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,981

You don't recognize me?

36
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,836
Do you not know who I am?

37
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,757
Who are you?

38
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,723
"A student's work!"

39
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,519
How's your project going?

40
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,329
Who…

41
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,792
are you?

42
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,502
Do you really not know who I am?

43
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,464
Who are you?

44
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:03,970
Who the hell are you?

45
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,523
YOU HAVE A VIDEO CHAT REQUEST FROM FOXY.

46
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,283
Hello?

47
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,787
Meet me at H Hotel in 30 minutes.

48
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,706
Can you? Or you wanna pass?

49
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,128
Who are you?

50
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,005
Strangle me.

51
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,343
Strangle my neck.

52
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,596
Harder.

53
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,182
Harder.

54
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,560
Harder.

55
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,896
I'm asking who you are.

56
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,365
Who are you?

57
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,462
EULJIRO 4TH DISTRICT

58

59
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,950
Hello?

60
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,035
Why did you ask me to find that bastard?

61
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,291
That bastard is a murderer.

62
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,710
He killed Hong Gong-ju!

63
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,754
Did you drop these phones off?

64
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,467
Don't come looking for me anymore, got it?

65
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,385
Calm down and listen to me.

66
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,240
Who is it?

67
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,008
Sit if you're here for fortune-telling.

68
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,323
You…

69
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,743
Sum,

70
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,245
and Wheelchair.

71
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,125
I heard you're friends.

72
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,764
Why are you so interested in me?

73
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,269
Why are you so interested in Sum

74
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,271
and Gi-eun?

75
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,106
Why?

76
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,026
Are they both yours?

77
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,035
I could smell incense from Gi-eun…

78
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,748
after she went swimming with you

79
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,291
and at Euljiro too.

80
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,127
It was as if she were dead.

81
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,631
But she didn't die.

82
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,720
Are you complaining?

83
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,225
Should I have killed her?

84
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,486
Why do I have to go out of my way

85
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,572
to put something in a trash bag,

86
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,951
when I don't even want to recycle it?

87
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,412
That Wheelchair girl…

88
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,418
is beyond redemption.

89
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:17,343
How and why would I love something
that's already broken?

90
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,846
You're a scumbag.

91
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,310
I didn't know you were curious about that.

92
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,854
Is that why…

93
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,108
you followed me around?

94
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,902
Because you thought it was unfair?

95
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,487
If what you said is true,

96
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,532
you shouldn't waste your energy
on Sum either.

97
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,706
You're wrong.

98
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,209
She's the complete opposite of Wheelchair.

99
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,049
Sum is like a world that is perfect
even when it doesn't try to be.

100
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,555
I just hate people who act

101
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,683
like they're refined,

102
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,895
elegant and perfect…

103
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,442
when in fact, they're worthless.

104
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,613
That's funny.

105
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,088
I had fun listening

106
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,259
to your refined logic about this world--

107
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,612
You also…

108
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,949
have a world that you respect,

109
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,411
so I believe you understand me.

110
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,962
Let's not…

111
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,138
Let's not…

112
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,520
get on each other's bad side.

113
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,153
Okay?

114
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,370
These are all his?

115
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,796
Gi-eun!

116
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,636
Mok-won.

117
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,272
-Gi-eun.
-Yeah.

118
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,858
We don't have much time.

119
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,612
Sum…

120
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,530
Yeah?

121
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,657
Let's go to her.

122
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,090
Huh? Isn't this Someone?

123
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,758
Something's different about it.

124
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,094
What is this?

125
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,763
My friend Someone.

126
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,349
It's an AI messenger program.

127
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:06,108
Did you two sleep here?
That bastard's energy is all around.

128
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,402
Gosh, my head hurts.

129
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,620
So you're saying this is all evidence?

130
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:19,955
Yeah.

131
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,311
DEVICE INFORMATION

132
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,479
This is a lot.

133
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,356
What are you going to do now?

134
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,902
I'm sending them all
to the Violent Crimes Department.

135
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,279
And I'll request a warrant.

136
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:57,367
But I came to you first because I thought
you could help me with something.

137
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,662
A warrant? With this?

138
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,832
It will only be a violation
of the Communications Act.

139
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,628
I'm guessing he'll face a fine?

140
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,880
So that won't work.

141
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,424
You must be the cop here.

142
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,470
So I'm asking you
to tell us everything you know.

143
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,389
Everything you know, Kim Sum.

144
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,184
I'm just stating the facts as they are…

145
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,275
That bastard came looking for me.

146
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,904
He knows that the three of us are friends.

147
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:39,910
If he came here and to my house,
he must know where Gi-eun lives too.

148
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,954
-Shit.
-Kim Sum.

149
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,624
If you don't tell us what you know,
we can't win.

150
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,167
Sum.

151
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,172
Kim Sum!

152
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,633
If I had known anything,

153
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,511
would I have taken all of my knives
out of my house?

154
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,555
Knives? What are you talking about?

155
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,642
Where did you take them?

156
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,565
Did you give your knives to him?

157
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,820
Huh?

158
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,490
Let's go.

159
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,095
I have no idea…

160
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,434
what's going on…

161
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,313
inside your head.

162
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,905
Damn it.

163
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,699
Mok-won, wait for me.

164
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,917
Jeez.

165
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,688

167
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,918
Mok-won?

168
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,295

It's okay. I didn't wait for long.

What kind of space do you like, Sum?
Tell me.

My space?

Yes.

180
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,408
The office at your workplace

181
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,993
I can make it the same.

You won't be nervous that way.

What do you think?

189
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,812
Don't you think this place is great?

190
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,063
It's so nice.

191
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,399
I want to go there.

192
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,736
You gonna make it like that?

193
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,534
When you finish it one day,
please show me.

194
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,828
No.

195
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,539
What?

196
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,465
I'm going to make
a space for you right away.

197
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,342
Right away?

198
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,802
I bought this place.

199
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,305
I'll use it as a hideout forever.

200
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,306
What?

201
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,434
I'll finish it quickly,
so we can come every weekend.

202
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,896
I wouldn't mind living here for good.

203
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,148
I know you will like it.

204
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,445
It'll be perfectly to your liking, Sum.

205
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,281
Wow, I'd like that.

206
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,783
I really like it.

207
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,370
Then I'll wait for you.

208
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,967
Thanks to his video chat with Sum,

209
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,471
Seong Yun-o's new IMEI device
is now linked to 189 server.

210
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,308
I don't think you need
to worry about it anymore.

211
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,893
Let's see what happens.

212
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,562
So this means

213
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,357
that Seong Yun-o won't cause
any more trouble.

214
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,441
Right?

215
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,197
Since nothing will get on our nerves
or bother us anymore,

216
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,494
let's stop worrying
and focus on our new project.

217
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,667
SERVER ADMINISTRATOR

218
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,421
Can I ask you a personal question?

219
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,006
Yes.

220
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,927
It seemed as though you liked Seong Yun-o.

221
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,100
I do like him.

222
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,520
I really like him a lot.

223
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,631
What do you want?

224
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,468
Oh, Finger.
Thank you very much for last time.

225
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,720
There's something very important--

226
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,555
Come on, what do you want?

227
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,975
Is there something else you need?

228
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:24,934
FINGER

229
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,731
I need you to find out
if the Somebody user "ISLE"

230
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:33,735
has chatted with a user under the name

231
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,738
of either 16, 17, or 18.

232
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,867
I want to know what they talked about
or when they last talked.

233
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,452
And?

234
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,287
And…

235
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,669
is it possible to track
the cell phone location of ISLE?

236
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,797
Yeah. You know how to pay, right?

237
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,465
Yes, with the coin.

238
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,344
Okay.

239
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,689
There are a total of eight people
identified as missing or dead

240
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,067
that are owners of these phones,
including Hong Gong-ju and Oh Na-eun.

241
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,904
And the Somebody app is downloaded
on all of their devices.

242
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,073
The call history?

243
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,701
I requested them,
and I'm waiting for them.

244
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,036
Mr. Seong Yun-o!

245
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,871
-Excuse me.
-Are you not here?

246
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,583
Take the hard drives from the computer.

247
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,003
Look for any tablets,
and take all of his notebooks!

248
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,714
Go through the trash can too!

249
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,466
-What is this?
-That's nothing.

250
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,761
Take everything other than the materials.

251
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,639
Detective. Take a look at this.

252
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,397
Why are there so many?

253
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,251
-One more time?
-Yes.

254
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,092
-A student's…
-…work!

255
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,011
-Work!
-Student!

256
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,774
-H Hotel…
-Thirty minutes.

257
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,110
Can you? Or you wanna pass?

258
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,614
Wait, I think…

259
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,870
this will be worth a lot of money.

260
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,694
YOU HAVE A VIDEO CHAT REQUEST
FROM FRAFGILE.

261
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,983

PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS FOOTAGE

265
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,215
It's nothing.

266
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,759
IS THAT TRUE?

267
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,804
Yes.

268
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,275

270
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,476
I killed people using the app you made.

271
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,594
Unless I'm seeing things…

272
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,102
I think there's something
you should tell me.

273
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,911
I…

274
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,518
I should have…

275
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,688
met you a bit sooner.

276
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,865
You can…

277
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,203
start over.

278
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,975
Thank you. I need to check my email.

279
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,464
I want to go to our hideout.

280
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,290
Okay, let's go.

281
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:41,905
Huh?

282
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,254
Hey, Sum.

283
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,175
I'm going to meet Yun-o.

284
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,426
When and where?

285
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,138
It's dangerous. Take me with you.

286
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,390
He's not dangerous to me.

287
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,561
Where are you gonna meet him?

288
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,190
Are you going to bring the police?

289
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,276
That's not why I'm telling you this.

290
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,278
No, it'll only be me. I mean…

291
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,283
I'll be alone nearby
just to make sure that you're safe, okay?

292
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,453
Okay, Sum?

293
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,538
Gi-eun.

294
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,373
To me,

295
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,712
he's someone very special
whom I might never find again.

296
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,298
That's why…

297
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,384
That's why I'm like this.

298
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,221
Sum.

299
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,697

302

Bul-gwang!

303
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,597
What is it?

304
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,640
Please help me.

305
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,393
Huh?

306
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,896
Here. She's seeing Seong Yun-o.

307
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,483
Can you ask for a tracking warrant?
I need to track her location, okay?

308
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,776
-Okay.
-It's urgent.

00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,462
I need the current location
of the user I mentioned before, ISLE.

312
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,197
So your friend
is going to meet Seong Yun-o?

313
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:30,657
Yes.

314
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,035
Did you get her location?

315
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,954
What? It hasn't been approved yet…

316
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,915
Oh, fucking hell.

317
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,250
Huh?

320
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,175
Oh, a friend.

321
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,011
Hurry up and go.

322
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,520
Leave.

323
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,022
I really need that.

324
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,067
Nothing you say will convince me.

325
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,861
You don't need it at all.

326
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,238
I just want to have it.

327
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,408
Just holding it in my hands
makes me feel stable.

328
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,285
That's all.

329
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,538
You know I'm not capable
of doing anything.

330
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:04,311
Keep it wrapped in the talisman
so you won't feel tempted to use it.

331
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,854
Okay.

332
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,403

334
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,628
She passed Naebu
and is headed towards Bukbu Expressway.

335
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,220
Did she get kidnapped or something?
She's not the type to roam around.

336
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,971
Do you think she caught on?

337
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,015
Why is she moving for so long?

338
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,480
It looks like she's exiting
through the Hawolgok Interchange

339
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,981

I don't think I can make it today.

00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,528
But you would love it here.

346
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,991
It will be perfectly to your liking.

00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,462
it's fine with me.

You're right.

350
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,808
It will be exactly the same

351
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,311

00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,511
I like you a lot, Sum.

368
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,763
Yun-o.

369
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,641
Sum…

370
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,687
Can you say that one more time?

371
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:27,277
I like you a lot, Kim Sum.

372
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,215
Sum.

373
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,053
Yun-o.

374
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,101
Can you say that one more time?

375
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,650
Even if you're late,

376
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:09,861
please…

377
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,322
come.

378
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,076
I want to see you.

379
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,336
Yun-o.

380
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,091
Can you say that one more time?

381
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,430
Yun-o.

382
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,102
Can you say that one more time?

383
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,358
Yun-o.

384
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:52,987
Can you say…

385
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,081
Were you waiting for me?

386
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:15,963
Shall we go?

387
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,257
Yeah.

388
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,610
Try to do better.

389
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,362
Hey, you're in last place.

390
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,364
Come on!

391
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,449
-I wanna play another round.
-Me too.

392
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,202
It's not easy.

393
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:59,465
Ma'am, the fare is 243,000 won.

394
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,057
Here.

395
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,142
Thank you.

396
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,226
No problem!

397
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,477
Good night.

398
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,248
She's not picking up?

399
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:33,833
No.

400
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:40,006
She must have driven around all day
because she wanted some fresh air.

401
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,507
SPECTRUM

402
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,593
-Is this where she works?
-Yes.

403
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,274
Go left.

404
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,275
Oh, good.

405
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,276
He won.

406
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,945
-Ms. Kim, do you want to try?
-Is she here?

407
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,614
-Yeah, have a go!
-Hurry!

408
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,449
-Before you die.
-Try it!

409
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,201
-Yeah, have a go!
-Hurry!

410
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,952
-Try it.
-Sum, give it a try.

411
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,370
Hurry!

412
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,877
Didn't she just win?

413
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,298
Let's play for coffee.

414
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,387
Wow.

415
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:29,722
Hey, she just won.

416
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,724
-She's really good.
-Her score is going up.

417
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:32,809
Going up.
