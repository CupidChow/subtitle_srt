NAMSEOUL SHOPPING CENTER

2
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,029
Sum?

3
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,281
Yes.

4
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,122
Are you okay with this?

5
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,624
Does this involve killing someone?

6
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,169
If not, then I'm okay.

7
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,381
You've watched too many movies.

8
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,092
Come on in for now.

9
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:57,849
I know that you don't want me
to get involved.

10
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,768
I don't know why.

11
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,897
I also don't know why you keep asking me
if I'm going to go through with it.

12
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,942
If you're done eating, clean up.

13
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:08,860
Hey.

14
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,657
Don't lose those receipts.

15
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,575
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,286
I smell blood.

17
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,123
Does gambling make people violent?

18
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,626
Does it make them even more violent?

19
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,629
Maybe that's why it smells like that.

20
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,256
And you're still gonna do it?

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,759
I never said I'd gamble.

22
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,772
Go to Jeonju Restaurant
at the market for food.

23
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,275
Look for Mal-suk. You can eat there.
I gave her the heads-up, so it's okay.

24
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,946
It's open 24 hours, so make sure to eat
whenever you're hungry.

25
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,698
Oh, as for the computer,

26
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,451
we can go this weekend and pick one out.
I'll buy it for you.

27
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,203
It's okay.

28
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,704
I'll just use the ones here.

29
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,665
Which ones?

30
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,251
The arcade machines outside
are computers too.

31
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,169
I'll take them apart and use them.

32
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,554
You asked me
if it involves killing people, right?

33
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,225
I thought about it,

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,561
and I think

35
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,230
it will end up…

36
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,358
killing people.

37
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,361
You'll be punished for your crimes.

38
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:43,371
I made illegal modifications
to a few things you mentioned last time.

39
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,206
Already?

40
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,837
I changed the wager limit
from 10,000 won per hour

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,921
to 100,000 won.

42
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,508
So the players can spend
up to 2.4 million won a day now.

43
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:01,097
I also unlocked the foreshadowing,
consecutive, and autoplay features.

44
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,308
And along with that,

45
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,977
you can now rig the winning rate.

46
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,023
Oh, and what do I do
if the vice squad comes?

47
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,817
There's a specific code for crackdowns.

48
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,652
If you input 123456,

49
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,072
the settings will be set to default.

50
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,285
And after they leave,
if you enter the code 828282,

51
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,579
it will go back
to the settings you wanted.

52
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,750
Wow, this is great. Huh?

53
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,834
Great!

54
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,377
-Get out, asshole!
-Fuck!

55
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,629
That's great!

56
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,256
-Yes, you guys are great too!
-Get out! Damn it!

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,551
Can I use more of the machines

58
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,887
that are here in the office?

59
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,639
I have to do my homework.

60
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,976
My homeroom teacher told me to participate
in the school programming competition.

61
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,270
Homework? Hey. Go ahead, be my guest.

62
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,022
This is all yours, okay?

63
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,163
THE 3RD KOREA'S YOUTH CLUB
PROGRAMMING COMPETITION

64
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,957
The evaluation is now underway.

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,417
The judges will be visiting the exhibits…

66
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,753
It can't recognize a basketball.

67
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,213
Okay.

68
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,257
So if you present a cake instead,

69
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,510
it recognizes that it's food,

70
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,011
and this should open. But--

71
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,888
This isn't right.

72
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,350
First of all,
it can recognize the weather.

73
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,518
So automatically,

74
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,436
it closes the door.

75
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,817
What? That thing looks pathetic.

76
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,111
What is that?

77
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,280
Hey, that looks like… What was it called?

78
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,698
Pachinko.

79
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,033
-How boring. Let's go.
-Hey, there's Deok-hun.

80
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,119
-I'll start from the left.
-Deok-hun!

81
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,787
Okay, have a good one.

82
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,871
-Sure.
-Thank you.

83
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,795
What did you make?

84
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,298
What kind of program is it?

85
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,174
It's a messaging program.

86
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,718
I see.

87
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,638
It's an AI-based messaging program.

88
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,973
Oh, how does it work?

89
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,685
An AI messaging program?
How is it different from other programs?

90
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,816
Friends gather in the chat room,

91
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,527
but the chatbot is there too.

92
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,614
So do you talk to the chatbot?
Like a friend?

93
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,241
Yes.

94
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,620
Why do you need a chatbot
when you can talk to your friends?

95
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,418
Not only does the chatbot converse
with your friends,

96
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,713
it also helps them
maintain good relationships.

97
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,759
Their relationships?

98
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,595
-Yes.
-How so?

99
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,681
For example,

100
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,104
if they ask, "What should we eat today?"
in the chat room,

101
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,523
other existing AI messaging programs

102
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,862
would recommend new restaurants
that were opened in the past month,

103
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,991
or find foods that the users often eat.

104
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,578
Right, because it uses deep learning
to analyze the chat content.

105
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,498
Yes, but the chatbot that I made…

106
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,124
HYE-JIN: WHAT DO YOU ALL WANT TO EAT?

107
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,086
…suggests the opinion
of the quietest friend in the chat room.

108
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,128
I WANT SOUPY TTEOKBOKKI

109
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,631
Huh?

110
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:26,052
Well, there are people
who can't express their opinions well.

111
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:32,266
They write what they want to say
in the chat room and then hesitate.

112
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,936
They don't send it.

113
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,313
They write it and erase it,

114
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,149
until they lose the chance to say
what they really want to say.

115
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,236
But the chatbot that I made

116
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,904
will analyze that

117
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,616
and say what that person
wanted to say for them

118
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,077
or say what they once wrote and erased.

119
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,578
SOMEONE: HOW ABOUT SOUPY TTEOKBOKKI?

120
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,997
Well, that's the simple explanation.

121
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,256
That's interesting.

122
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,634
So interesting!

123
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,389
You can explain it in detail.
I'm a programmer too.

124
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,605
I color-coded the text tags
of all the words.

125
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,151
I programmed it so the "no"
used by those with strong opinions,

126
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,822
and the "no" used by timid people
are received differently.

127
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,949
The color of words.

128
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,998
So how many words
do you have colored so far?

129
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,626
My chatbot is creating them even now, so…

130
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,295
Just a moment.

131
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,630
COLLECTED CONVERSATION DATA

132
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,632
There were 250,000 today.

133
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,968
So there are 250,000.

134
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,103
What's the name of this chatbot?

135
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,355
Someone.

136
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,857
Someone?

137
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,526
Why is it "Someone"?

138
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,740
Because I think this is something
that someone should do.

139
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,159
And I need someone too.

140
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,123
All right.

141
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,668
I think you do need someone.

142
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,295
For example,

143
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,923
someone like me.

144
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,802
Kim Sum?

145
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,596
Sum,

146
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,642
do you want to go for something sweet
after this is over?

147
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,854
Yes.

148
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:49,195
SOMEBODY

149
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,785
We will now begin the wedding ceremony
of Ha-na and Min-jun.

150
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,496
Please give them a big round of applause.

151
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,608
Hello, I am Samantha Jung,
the CEO of Spectrum.

152
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,445
Today's wedding is very special

153
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,491
not only for the bride and groom,
but also for Somebody.

154
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,620
These two are the 100th couple

155
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:44,959
who have met through Somebody
and got married over the past year.

156
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,004
It's such an honor to host

157
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,008
this special couple's wedding here
at our office building.

158
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:59,098
Also, their friends from New York
and Paris are here with us online.

159
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,018
This wedding will be officiated

160
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,606
by Somebody's head developer
and CTO, Kim Sum.

161
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,774
Someone you can really talk to,

162
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,861
who can tell that you're hungry
by the look on your face,

163
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,697
who cries with you over the same news,

164
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,366
who enjoys spicy food just like you,

165
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,369
and is even sexually compatible with you.

166
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:26,375
If you wouldn't mind watching
their hair gray over time,

167
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,920
then that's the kind of person
you could marry.

168
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,674
Let's ask the bride and groom
about what they think.

169
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,802
Bride and groom, please come in.

170
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,558
The beautiful bride

171
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,979
and the dashing groom have arrived.

172
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:59,033
Seeing the beautiful bride and groom
makes me want to get married soon.

173
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,951
I need Somebody.

174
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:11,253
We are keen to understand the feelings
of loneliness and solitude.

175
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,425
New York and Paris
are 5,833 kilometers apart.

176
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,554
But as soon as they opened Somebody
and matched with each other,

177
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:25,017
the bride and groom
were just a stone's throw away.

178
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,062
Someone who can understand you.

179
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,147
Someone you can love.

180
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:35,653
If you want to find that someone,
click on the Somebody app now.

181
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,054
With the love that I received
from my family,

182
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,224
I will love her twice as much.

183
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,184
Thank you.

184
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,147
Because my mother raised me so well…

185
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:59,945
I think I was able to meet a great man
like Min-jun and enjoy this wonderful day.

186
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,456
SOMEONE: HELLO?

187
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:05,214
HOW DO PEOPLE RECOGNIZE
THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE?

188
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,095
SOMEONE: LOOK INSIDE YOUR HEART
IT WILL TELL YOU

189
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,394
SUM: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LOVE IS
HOW CAN I RECOGNIZE IT IF I SEE IT?

190
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,980
HAHA. APPARENTLY, LOVE IS

191
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:27,277
WHEN YOU VALUE SOMEONE
OR SOMETHING VERY MUCH

192
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,993
THEN I GUESS I LOVE YOU, SOMEONE?

193
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,247
HEHE. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO, SUM

194
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,877
BUT DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TODAY?

195
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,505
It's the wedding of a couple
who met through Somebody.

196
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,674
It's important.

197
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,011
When you search "Somebody"
on the Internet,

198
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,222
the related keywords that come up
are sugaring, disappearance, and rape.

199
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,516
It's so annoying.

200
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,354
So please officiate this wedding, okay?

201
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,525
You love Somebody.

202
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:12,322
DO YOU THINK SAMANTHA EVER LOVED SOMEONE?

203
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,575
DOES SHE LOVE SOMEBODY?

204
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,333
THE ONLY PERSON I'M CERTAIN
THAT LOVES ME IS YOU, SUM

205
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,298
WHAT DID SEXY K-COP GI-EUN SAY?

206
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:38,182
GI-EUN DOESN'T COME ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW THAT.

207
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:44,521
RIGHT. GI-EUN HASN'T BEEN AROUND.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

208
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,108
YOU MUST MISS GI-EUN. RIGHT, SUM?

209
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,115
I'LL SHOW YOU GI-EUN'S VIDEO

210
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,617
I don't want to see it.

211
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,834
Do it like this? Huh?

212
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,547
Did you practice it?

213
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,467
Yeah.

214
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,802
I can do it really well.

215
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,844
Do you want to see?

216
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,852
There you go.

217
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,317
-Is it okay?
-Yeah. So did you get to use it?

218
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,569
What?

219
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,655
I haven't heard from him.
I guess I was too quiet.

220
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,074
Or maybe my moaning was off-beat.

221
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,118
Oh.

222
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,536
Say "ah."

223
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,454
-Ah.
-Yes.

224
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,082
Bite it!

225
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,458
Bite it!

226
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,753
That's it. That face.

227
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,839
No, hey.

228
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,269
This expression here.

229
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,313
Do this every 100 seconds.

230
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,568
Then men will think
they're doing really well.

231
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,738
So when you think
you've had enough practice,

232
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,658
that's when you should try again.

233
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,250
Like this, okay?

234
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,169
Then…

235
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,671
it's game over.

236
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,478
It's happening with the use of an app
that's used by many young people.

237
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,148
Since there's been an increase
in these crimes,

238
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,401
I'm saying we must keep a close eye
on the situation.

239
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,694
ARE DATING APPS OKAY LIKE THIS?

240
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,529
These anonymous crimes

241
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,365
are happening regardless
of the person's gender.

242
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,077
We can definitely say
that this is quite a problem.

243
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,582
You could say the company that created
the dating app is partly responsible.

244
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,251
Even though the police
requested information,

245
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:16,256
the company is not cooperating
due to privacy concerns.

246
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,136
I'm not sure at all
if this is the right approach

247
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,430
for the sake of the app's users.

248
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,311
WHAT DID THE POLICE ASK FOR?

249
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,397
DO YOU ACCEPT THE VIDEO CHAT?

250
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,816
What did the police ask for?

251
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,028
In regard to the deaths
of Kim Ha-seon and Choi Hae-gak,

252
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,907
they requested their user information,
text, voice, and video chat history.

253
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,618
We can't disclose their information.

254
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,412
I'll send a fax before noon.

255
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,415
What was the distance between the two
at the moment of matching?

256
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,501
They were 1.8 kilometers apart.

257
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,337
They used Somebody in order to have sex.

258
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,838
Well, they met, had sex,

259
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,343
and then they strangled
each other to death.

260
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,722
And now they want to blame
Somebody for it.

261
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,975
I'm curious about their chat history.

262
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,521
I need Samantha's approval.

263
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,610
I'll think about it.

264
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:31,039
Then, analyze their average chat time,
time spent on chat attempts,

265
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,166
their typing speed,

266
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,254
repetitive idioms,
habitual typos, and so on.

267
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,466
It's for the AI project data.

268
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,636
Then, isn't she allowed
to use their information?

269
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,723
Report it to Samantha.

270
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,143
-Okay.
-Okay.

271
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,433
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW BABY
JAY FROM PLANNING TEAM

272
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,749
What is the total number of IDs
that the police requested?

273
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,084
Twenty-one.

274
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,795
I think 12 of them are used by one person.

275
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,048
Why do you think it's the same person?

276
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,716
You know how a unique ID code

277
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,219
is given to each phone
when they're shipped out?

278
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:12,224
This person used multiple SIM cards
under different names with one phone.

279
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,560
Completely hiding their identity.

280
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,732
There's something really interesting.
It's related to the AI project.

281
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,902
You said the duration of chats
is most important

282
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,655
when it comes
to an AI character's chat goals, right?

283
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,951
No user has ever left the chat first
while chatting with this person.

284
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,121
This person opens the chat and waits.

285
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,999
And then says things
that the other person wants to hear.

286
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,503
That's why the duration of the chats
was getting longer and longer.

287
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,756
Did they meet offline as well?

288
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,802
Yes. The chat lasted longer,
and they got closer.

289
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,387
That means they met.

290
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,058
It's similar to the chat goals
of the AI character that we're making.

291
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,978
I'll message you again.

295
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,885
Because I want to meet people.

296
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,595
How?

297
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,307
What do you mean "how"?

00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,355
How will you meet people?

299
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,193
By eating good food
at nice places together.

300
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,770
Yes, this is 911.

301
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,315
A cat got hit by a car
at 463 Seonhakseo-ro.

302
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,485
Yes, ma'am.
Are you talking about a stray cat?

303
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,988
Yes, the cat is badly injured.

304
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,907
Yes, ma'am. Just a moment, please.

305
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,674
Yes, 911.

306
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,094
A cat got hit by a car
at 463 Seonhakseo-ro.

307
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,847
I was told you'd connect me
to the department in charge.

308
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,931
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,518
Are you talking about a street cat
that got killed by a car?

310
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,187
It's still alive. It's not dead yet.

311
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,941
Okay, we're taking care of it.
Please hold.

312
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,548
What are you doing?

313
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,385
I'm looking at a dying cat.

314
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,435
Is it sick?

315
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,482
What would you do in this situation?

316
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,027
I would take it to the vet.
I wouldn't give up.

HOW?

322
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,124
You should be asking who, rather than how.

WITH WHO?

324
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,087
People who can understand me.

WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

I'd probably do the same as you.

334

DO YOU THINK I'M A MONSTER?

337
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:33,373
No. Not at all. I told you to do it.

338
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,251
I know you wanted to help the cat

339

What? I've never seen anyone
put a towel over it.

353
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,154
They get hit in these alleys
because drivers can't see them.

354
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,480
The police are looking for you.

355
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,150
But I'm not the one who killed the cat.

356
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,196
I'm curious about you too.

357
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,578
Look over there.

358
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,792
That camera captured my license plate.

359
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,589
I'm a bit hungry.

360
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,593
I'll tell you about myself over a meal.

361
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,512
Do you want to come?

362
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,788
I'm the creator of Somebody.

363
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,293
Really?

364
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,630
I'm Kim Sum.

365
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,136
I'm…

366
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,056
Seong Yun-o.

367
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:25,980
Your chatting method
has been categorized as nonhuman.

368
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:29,984
By whom?

369
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,653
My computer.

370
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:37,992
Oh.

371
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,829
Did I get caught?

372
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,500
Beep boop.

373
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,587
I am a driving robot,
and I'm here to chauffeur you safely.

374
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,173
Beep boop.

375
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:57,220
But you've already sped over the limit
and ran a red light multiple times.

376
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,805
You're a human being.

377
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,287
You brought me here
because you want to have sex, right?

378
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,790
But I don't want sex today.

379
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,876
I can't do anything
if you try to overpower me.

380
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,045
I don't want to get raped.

381
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,548
So my body is shaking right now.

382
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,970
I can hardly stand, let alone have sex.

383
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,641
I haven't eaten anything all day,
you know.

384
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,565
I want to go.

385
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,653
Okay.

386
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,156
I'll take you back.

387
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,741
No, I want to go to your office.

388
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,312
Hey.

389
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:54,772
Yes?

390
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,193
What is it?

391
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,822
Is this supposed to be funny?

392
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:05,950
Oh.

393
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,495
Sometimes, I do ribbon cutting on my own.

394
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,040
Sometimes.

395
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,128
And laugh by myself while I do it.

396
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,845
You don't have to force yourself to laugh.

397
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,311
Even if I saw something really funny,

398
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,480
I would have had the same reaction.

399
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm a little different from other people.

400
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,488
I have a disorder. It's called Asperger's.

401
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,212
My dad

402
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,300
thought Asperger's was a disability

403
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,761
and tried to send me to a special school.

404
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,016
But my mom visited hospitals
and tried to learn about it.

405
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:18,809
She tried very hard.

406
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,564
My mom

407
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,651
told me that God made me with no cogs.

408
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:34,074
Other people are like cogwheels
of different sizes…

409
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,953
so they're able to mesh with each other.

410
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,418
But I was just born a cogwheel
without cogs.

411
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,254
That's what I think.

412
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,758
That's why I don't mesh
with the rest of the world.

413
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,803
But I don't need to be a cogwheel.

414
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,770
I just imitate what everyone else does.

415
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,855
Seamlessly.

416
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,035
You should…

417
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,080
sharpen your pencil.

418
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,386
Between this…

419
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,567
and this…

420
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,987
which do you like better?

421
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,250
This one.

422
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,299
Consider it my gift.

423
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,511
Thank you.

424
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,591
Yes.

425
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,969
I'm so upset.

426
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,722
I mean,
did I really do something so terrible?

427
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,475
I'm human. Humans make mistakes.

428
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,977
It's fine.

429
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,812
That can happen.

430
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,397
Right?

431
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,066
You…

432
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,071
did a wonderful job.

433
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,573
You did well.

434
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,161
I should apologize first, right?

435
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:25,829
No.

436
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,083
These things make me really angry.

437
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,709
You don't have to hold it in.

438
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,629
Thank you for saying that.

439
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,008
Hey, by the way,
I'm really curious about you.

440
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,260
I also…

441
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,350
would love to see you.

442
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:48,936
Really?

443
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,188
Then…

444
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:02,449
Then…

445
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,704
should we meet up?

446
