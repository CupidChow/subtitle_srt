1
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,364
NEW MESSAGE FROM WAITING FOR YOU

2
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,783
THIS MAZE WAS SO HARD,
BUT I SOLVED IT FIRST!

3
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,035
BRO!
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

4
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,453
DID YOU LEAVE THE CHAT ROOM?

5
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,086
DID YOU WASTE JAE-MAN?

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,049
WHY DID YOU THROW AWAY MY WHEELCHAIR?

7
00:00:58,975 --> 00:00:59,809
Jeez.

8
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,231
This one's a crazy bitch too.

9
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:13,490
SOMEBODY

10
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,710
-Sir.
-Yes, what?

11
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,212
Thank you for your hard work.

12
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,964
A lot of dust blows
into the redevelopment office

13
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,050
on demolition days.

14
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,260
Do you mind if I block the passage?

15
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,513
Just in the back there.

16
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,889
Sure, whatever.

17
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,142
-Thank you.
-Thanks for the drinks.

18
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,389
EULJIRO 4TH DISCTRICT

19
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,159
Are you… Is it you?

20
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,619
-Huh?
-Really?

21
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,252
Are you okay?
You didn't get hurt, did you?

22
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,588
I looked everywhere for you.

23
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,590
I couldn't find my way back.

24
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,509
When I got to the parking lot,
only your car was there.

25
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,927
Did you get home safely?

26
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,180
You seem so mad.

27
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,683
But we found each other again.
It feels like destiny to me.

28
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,185
Destiny, my ass.

29
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,187
You need a good beating.

30
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,898
I don't know about destiny,

31
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,233
but I did think about your body.

32
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,571
Do you want to meet?
I'll apologize in person.

33
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,823
Let's meet here tomorrow.

34
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,993
At 32 Euljiro 8-gil.

35
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,270
BUL-GWANG

36
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,855
Yeah, what is it?

37
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,025
Bul-gwang, how is
the Somebody investigation going?

38
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,027
Why are you so interested?

39
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,528
-Come on.
-What?

40
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,739
Please tell me!

41
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,658
You like beef, right?

42
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,993
Why do you keep tempting me with beef?

43
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,828
Please make some time for me.

44
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,918
IF I'M LATE…

45
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,087
You can take the meat home with you.

46
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,256
I'm craving noodles all of a sudden.

47
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,550
So I'm off to the best ramyeon place,
Princess Snacks in Euljiro.

48
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,998
YEAR OF THE WHITE HORSE, SEONG YUN-O
YEAR OF THE BLUE DOG, KIM SUM

49
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,298
How do you want to help these people?

50
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,056
Sum is a friend of mine.

51
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,896
And I sense bad energy surrounding her.

52
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,649
So I need to drive it out.

53
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,279
If you get involved with them
in the wrong way,

54
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:25,033
you could be attacked by an evil spirit
or even a demon.

55
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,077
Do you still want to help her?

56
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,499
I do.

57
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,209
Do you think you have two lives?

58
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:40,506
Even if you are somehow able to survive
and save your body,

59
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,177
it won't be an easy task.

60
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,679
I want to do it.

61
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,726
If you say you'll risk your life,
I can't stop you.

62
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,189
That's why I'm here to ask for your help.

63
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,610
I don't want to see my child
get hurt by an evil spirit.

64
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,530
If you were me, would you?

65
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,117
But you'll have to see it anyway.

66
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,294
So, an exorcism…

67
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,240
EULJIRO 4TH DISTRICT

68
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,784
Kim Sum.

69
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,455
Once I step on the straw cutter,
call your boyfriend right away.

70
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,290
Okay.

71
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,836
Come on out, you bastard.

72
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,800
HEY, I'M HERE!

73
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,607
You're here?

74
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,359
I'm on my way there with coffee.

75
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,401
Do you like sweets?

76
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,324
Ah, seriously.

77
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,243
Who left this open?

78
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,410
Miss!

79
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,912
What are you doing here?

80
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,705
Get out of here.

81
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,750
This place is getting demolished soon.
Get out now.

82
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,752
-Sir, you need to come out.
-Okay.

83
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,630
-We're starting now.
-It's hectic as it is. Get out!

84
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,300
-There's a ton of dust too.
-That's what I'm saying.

85
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,595
Come here!

86
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,183
How did she get in here in a wheelchair?
Shouldn't we tell her what's going on?

87
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,915
It's the year of the white cow,
the 11th lunar month,

88
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,875
and the ninth day of the month.

89
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,754
This is for Kim Sum.

90
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,175
Please get rid of all the evil spirits
in this world.

91
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,262
I present this ritual
to the skies and to the earth.

92
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,514
May you accept it.

93
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,849
Now, shoo.

94
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,493
I WANT TO SEE YOU. LET'S MEET!

95
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,744
Hang on just a minute.

96
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,997
I bought a lot of macarons
for a chance to explain myself.

97
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,582
I'll be right there.

98
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,584
Damn it.

99
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,061
Bow three times.

100
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,168
Hey!

101
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,503
Hey, miss!

102
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,423
If you go straight that way,
you'll find a way out.

103
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,674
Keep going!

104
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,289
WHERE ARE YOU?

105
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,506
THEY'RE TEARING THE PLACE DOWN
I MOVED SOMEWHERE ELSE

106
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,007
ANSWER ME
PICK UP THE PHONE

107
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,094
I'LL GIVE YOU THREE MINUTES

108
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,642
Damn it!

109
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,770
Shit!

110
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,120
Gods of Heaven and Earth, watch over us.

111
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,872
She goes on the straw cutter stage.

112
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,542
Please don't let your child get hurt.

113
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,545
Deliver her from punishments
and evil spirits.

114
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,257
Please watch over your child
as she walks on the straw cutter.

115
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,177
And, General, please save Sum,
for she is your child.

116
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,885
Don't let her get hurt.

117
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,555
Please let her finish the walk
and come down safely.

118
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,973
Don't let her get hurt.

119
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,308
I beg you.

120
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
Please don't let her get hurt, General.

121
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,601
Hello?

122
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,856
Hello?

123
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,650
Sum?

124
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,835
Rotating now!

125
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,912
Chief, we're going down.

126
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,584
"A student's work."

127
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,047
Well, you're not a student but…

128
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,133
"A student's work."

129
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,729
-Oh God!
-What the hell?

130
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,813
Sir!

131
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,898
On… On the wall…

132
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,028
Are you okay?
Report back, what's the situation?

133
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,196
There's an ear here, sir!

134
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,658
It looks like a human ear!

135
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,326
What are you saying? Slow down!

136
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,181
Sir! The ear is here!

137
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,515
PROFESSOR MIN'S EAR

138
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,392
It's definitely a human ear…

139
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,882
SEONG YUN-O, KIM SUM

140
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:13,926
Hey!

141
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,844
What's going on? Are you okay?

142
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,682
Fuck!

143
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,352
Fuck!

144
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,355
Fuck!

145
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,043
Excuse me!

146
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,360
Damn, why isn't she picking up?

147
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,528
Wait.

148
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,281
I have to go. Gi-eun isn't picking up.

149
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,409
Why are you acting like this?

150
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,710
I can find Gi-eun.

151
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,767
Ma'am.

152
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,688
Samantha…

153
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,191
There's something I really need to know.

154
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,782
Hello? I'm here!

155
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,993
Hello!

156
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,995
I'm still in here!

157
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,834
Hello!

158
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,966
Hello!

159
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,766
Hello!

160
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,770
I'm in here!

161
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,525
I'm in here!

162
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,469
Um…

163
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,055
-Yes.
-And you're waiting for Yeong Gi-eun?

164
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,224
-Oh, yes.
-Here you go.

165
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,712
Ah, fuck!

166
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,710
Fuck!

167
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,443
Huh? Hey!

168
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,445
There's someone here!

169
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,530
Hello!

170
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,202
I'm here!

171
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,787
Hello!

172
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,795
Hello!

173
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,146
I'm here!

174
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,029
Sorry, the coffee got cold.

175
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,948
I'll come back with hot coffee.
It's going to take a while.

176
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,869
Shit.

177
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,043
God damn it, you son of a bitch.

178
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,878
Where are you?

179
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,338
Come out here.

180
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,298
Come out!

181
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,177
Show yourself!

182
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,555
Hey!

183
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,933
You fucking bastard!

184
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,997
Something sweet.

185
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,431
Gosh.

186
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,767
Are you angry?

187
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,359
Damn it, why aren't you saying anything?

188
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,448
Is there anything
you want to know about me?

189
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,409
Ask away.

190
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,792
Why did you ditch me back then?

191
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,217
You want to know?

192
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,594
Do you?

193
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,514
Is that what you want to know right now?

194
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,308
Well, then…

195
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,645
Then I should give you a serious answer.

196
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,149
I mean, you…

197
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,318
Fucking hell.

198
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,698
You ordered me to bring you a wet wipe!

199
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,164
You're supposed to ask for help,
not demand it.

200
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,754
You wouldn't have helped even if I asked.

201
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,427
Jeez, seriously…

202
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,681
You would have abandoned me anyway.

203
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,432
Do you think…

204
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,103
you're even worthy of getting abandoned?

205
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,317
You can only abandon someone

206
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:06,322
after you spend time with them
and give them your affection.

207
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,287
Like…

208
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,124
when a mom carries a baby in her womb,

209
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,626
or raises her kids for a long time.

210
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,346
You're talking about yourself.

211
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,312
That's your story, right?

212
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,939
Poor bastard.

213
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,741
How insolent of you to crawl out here.

214
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,420
But…

215
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,381
why are you curious about that?

216
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,349
I wonder why.

217
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,640
Let's not see each other again.

218
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,824
Yes, Sum.

219
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,912
Is this your police friend
who came to the office the other day?

220
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,580
Yeah.

221
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,711
Her phone lost connection
at 3:50 p.m. in Euljiro.

222
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,548
I'll say.

223
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,759
Okay.

224
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,053
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

225
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,139
Yeah.

226
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,532
IF I'M LATE…
YOU CAN TAKE THE MEAT HOME WITH YOU.

227
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,951
I'M CRAVING NOODLES ALL OF A SUDDEN.

228
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,955
SO I'M OFF TO THE BEST RAMYEON PLACE,
PRINCESS SNACKS IN EULJIRO.

229
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,209
PRINCESS SNACKS
EULJIRO 8-GIL, JUNGBUK-GU, SEOUL

230
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,005
The number you dialed is not available.

231
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,067
PRINCESS SNACKS

232
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,405
It says it's scheduled for demolition.

233
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,074
Jeez…

234
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,200
Where are we?

235
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,079
-Talk to me, please.
-Just stay still!

236
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,335
Isn't… Isn't that Gi-eun's wheelchair?

237
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,259
-It is!
-Sir!

238
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,261
Where is the owner of this wheelchair?

239
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,807
Don't know. I think someone brought it
because it's not broken or anything.

240
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,642
I bet the owner will come back for it.

241
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,768
-Was it in there?
-Yeah.

242
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,319
What's that?

243
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,238
It's blocked again!

244
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,576
Hey!

245
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,622
Why did you stop the ritual?
You have to tell me something.

246
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,916
What are you talking about?
Gi-eun is in danger!

247
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,168
I know, so we're here.
We can save her now.

248
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,754
So you should tell me what's going on now.

249
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,756
The guy you called, is he your boyfriend?

250
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,257
Why do you want to know?

251
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,010
Just answer the question.
Is he your boyfriend?

252
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,557
He's the bastard that Gi-eun met.

253
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,558
The impotent guy.

254
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,730
-You're wrong.
-I'm wrong?

255
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,190
Yeah. You're wrong.

256
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,691
Oh, how would you know that?

257
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,693
Because he is not impotent!

258
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,279
Oh, I get it now.

259
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,116
You used the app you made
to make love with people

260
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,701
and share them with your friend.

261
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,161
How cool.

262
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,330
Watch your mouth.

263
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,502
Why are you girls here?

264
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,836
He's not the guy.

265
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,048
-Fine. Find Gi-eun first.
-Who are they?

266
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,425
How did you get in here?
Get out. It's dangerous.

267
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,302
This isn't a place to play around.

268
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,847
Get out, already!
Ladies, we want to finish work!

269
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,015
Hold on.

270
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,104
-Why?
-Hold on.

271
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,772
I think I hear something.

272
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,482
What?

273
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,382
Damn it. It's dangerous in here!
Get out now!

274
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,592
I'm telling you, there's someone in here!

275
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,055
They're saying someone's in there.

276
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,562
Yeong Gi-eun!

277
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:19,940
Gi-eun!

278
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,818
Gi-eun!

279
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,862
Gi-eun!

280
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,868
Yeong Gi-eun!

281
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,536
Gi-eun!

282
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,164
Yeong Gi-eun!

283
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,459
I'm over here!

284
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,050
Yeong Gi-eun!

285
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,635
Mok-won!

286
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,811
Yeong Gi-eun!

287
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,978
Mok-won?

288
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,400
Mok-won.

289
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,823
Mok-won!

290
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:10,950
Mok-won…

291
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,044
Hey, why did you come here?
Did you come to meet someone?

292
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,840
You need to be more careful
with your wheelchair.

293
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,509
-You should never throw it away like that!
-Can't you…

294
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,929
-Can't you ask me if I'm okay first?
-You look okay!

295
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,013
What?

296
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:34,682
What is this?

297
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,226
Someone is burning incense.

298
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,688
The smell led me to you.

299
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,525
I thought you were dead!

300
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,778
Are you okay?

301
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,779
It's okay.

302
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,781
It's okay.

303
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,283
This way.

304
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,620
-Watch your head.
-Careful.

305
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,038
The wheelchair.

306
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,172
-Hold on.
-Lift her up.

307
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:53,177
PRINCESS SNACKS

308
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,602
Oh, hello.

309
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,700
All I did…

310
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,912
was have pity…

311
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,748
on that young man.

312
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,127
Is it fun?

313
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,548
If it is, teach me what it is.

314
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,259
Sure.

315
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,426
EULJIRO HOTTIE

316
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,179
LIVE COOL, LOVE HOT

317
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,749
I have a favor to ask of you.

318
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,510
Hey! How many cell phones do you have?

319
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,180
You have four numbers.
Do you use all of them?

320
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,642
It's illegal to lend your name
to people who aren't family.

321
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,775
You have four cell phones?

322
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,904
A young lady came and picked up
the phone you left earlier.

323
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:17,988
Did I tell you?

324
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,877
Who did you send the picture to?

325
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:35,339
I was asked to find the person
who left the phone here.

326
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,841
By a shaman.

327
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,186
What is it?

328
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:45,404
