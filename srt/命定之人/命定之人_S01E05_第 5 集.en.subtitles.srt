1
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,850
HI.

2
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,102
What did you and Yun-o
talk about yesterday?

3
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:24,566
YUN-O SAID HE WANTS TO SAVE
ABANDONED DOGS AND CATS

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,737
AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT LONELY!

5
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,701
HE SAID YOU PURIFY HIS HEART!

6
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,579
BUT… SUM!

7
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:42,375
WHEN I ASKED HIM
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH YOU,

8
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:48,131
YUN-O TYPED THIS AND THEN ERASED IT…

9
00:00:54,429 --> 00:01:00,560
SEX, I WANT TO TAKE OFF ALL HER CLOTHES
AND TOUCH HER.

10
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:07,609
I WANT TO BITE AND SUCK ALL OVER HER BODY.

11
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:14,240
I WANT TO HUG HER, TOUCH HER,
BURY MY FACE AND SMELL HER FOREVER.

12
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:44,437
SOMEBODY

13
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,107
YUN-O

14
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,359
Hello, I'm Kim Sum.

15
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,445
I want to talk to you.
I have so much to say.

16
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,197
Come to me.

17
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,477
You need to go through immigration.

18
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,564
Do you want to enter?

19
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,442
Yes.

20
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,027
How long will you be staying?

21
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,156
I don't know yet.

22
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,743
You're not carrying any drugs
or weapons, are you?

23
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,205
Have you ever been involved
in a serious criminal case?

24
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,416
Yes.

25
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,627
Really?

26
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,006
Because you are being honest,
I'll forgive you.

27
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,591
In exchange,

28
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,178
don't ever leave me alone.

29
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,804
Do you promise?

30
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,764
Yes.

31
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,766
Hug me.

32
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,909
SOMEONE: HELLO

33
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,337
WHAT DOES SUM USUALLY HAVE FOR BREAKFAST?

34
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,922
WHOLE WHEAT BREAD!

35
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,115
How did you know I eat whole wheat bread?

36
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,618
I'm not sure.

37
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,872
There's something I want to do.

38
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,541
What is it?

39
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,044
Swearing.

40
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,880
I want to do it while swearing.

41
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,137
Okay.

42
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,641
What the fuck are you waiting for? Strip.

43
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,236
Didn't you hear me?

44
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,104
Fuck, it's delicious.

45
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,774
I'm eating you, motherfucker.

46
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,443
You know that?

47
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,616
Did you want to take off my clothes
and touch me?

48
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,454
Hug me, fuck me, touch me,

49
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,040
and smell me forever?

50
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:47,300
Someone can remember the things
you write and erase.

51
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,808
You didn't know, did you?

52
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,232
Keep going, you motherfucker.

53
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:05,985
Harder.

54
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,072
Harder. Fuck me harder.

55
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,476
Hello, this is Spectrum.

56
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,812
Would I be able to see the CEO?

57
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,820
Hello.

58
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,658
Director Kim Sum took the day off today.

59
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,160
I can't reach her by phone, either.

60
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,329
That's very strange.

61
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,998
Right?

62
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,878
So you know something
about the Somebody user who went missing?

63
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,841
You can go to the police for that, though.

64
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,051
Actually, I'm a cop.

65
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,351
I think someone picked up my cell phone.

66
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,105
That person logged in
to my Somebody account and deactivated it.

67
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,817
So, I came here hoping
I could bring my account back online.

68
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,528
Oh, I'm sorry.

69
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:18,701
But we don't store any data
from deleted accounts.

70
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:27,084
I want the chat history from my account.
Just my account.

71
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,301
Well, I'll try my best.

72
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,638
But I'm not sure how long

73
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,724
a deleted user's data stays
on the servers.

74
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:47,855
Then there's the issue with backups,
so I'm not sure it will work.

75
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,025
But we will do the best we can.

76
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,527
I'll work on this and give you a call.

77
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,363
Only for you

78
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,324
because you're Sum's friend.

79
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,692
So, do you know what my hobby is?

80
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,112
I do.

81
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,197
I know everything.

82
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,199
It's murder.

83
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,786
Do you want to go around
killing people with me?

84
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,545
Yes.

85
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,466
All right.

86
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,139
It sounds fun, right?

87
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,059
Yeah.

88
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,815
Hey, Gi-eun.

89
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,569
I'm charging you 1,000 won per minute.
Make this quick. I'm super busy.

90
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,906
The Namyeong-dong guys you talked about,
who keep secrets and work fast.

91
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,742
Can you introduce me
to someone who's trustworthy?

92
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,744
It could be someone you worked with.

93
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,370
Jeez.

94
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,375
This person works fast and never talks.

95
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,797
Drinks are on you later.

96
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,803
OPEN ON SOMEBODY

97
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,814
FINGER
CONNECTING VIDEO CALL

98
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,610
Hello.

99
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,988
FINGER

100
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,617
What is this? Is this working or not?

101
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,285
What do you want?

102
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,999
Come on, what do you want?

103
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,090
I want to see all records
related to this ID.

104
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,177
Make it bigger. Bigger so I can see!

105
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,680
Oh, I'll bring it closer.

106
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,645
Do you want me to send things
as I find them,

107
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,273
or do you want it all at once?

108
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,442
As you find them. This is urgent.

109
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,195
But,

110
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,947
on the app,

111
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,450
how did we get connected
if we didn't match?

112
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,744
Did you hack the app?

113
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,330
Yeah.

114
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,416
Using the matching code in the program?

115
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,924
If I couldn't at least do that,
people wouldn't look to me for help.

116
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,009
Wow.

117
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,054
How do I pay you?

118
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,143
MOCOBIT

119
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,731
Huh, what is this?

120
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,525
I need to pay in crypto?

121
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,488
Um…

122
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,491
I've heard a thing or two
about cryptocurrency,

123
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,454
but I've never seen
this website you sent me.

124
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,917
You're really, really…

125
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,128
really making me mad!

126
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,759
One fimitcoin will get you info
from all the IDs that you want.

127
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:33,015
There's an additional charge of one coin
for every backed-up text, photo,

128
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,683
or video restored.

129
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,268
Ah, I see.

130
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,025
Then…

131
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,528
I'll make an account first…

132
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,574
and then I'll call you.

133
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,206
What? What now?

134
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,624
Bul-gwang…

135
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,334
Can I trust this person?

136
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,088
I mean, they're asking me to pay in crypto

137
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,299
through a trading platform
I've never heard of.

138
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,593
If it's not urgent,
you don't have to do it.

139
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,929
But if you agreed, just trust them.

140
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,849
If it turns out to be a scam,
then you can investigate them, right?

141
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,894
I'm hanging up.

GI-EUN
THIS IS SPECTRUM'S CUSTOMER SERVICE

146
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,848
YOUR CHAT HISTORY
IS NOT STORED ON OUR SERVER

147
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,642
WE CANNOT RESTORE YOUR CONTENT

148
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,061
Are they kidding me?

149
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,143
I'm Yun-o.

150
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,565
Why do you think
Sum invited me to her house?

151
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:17,281
I'M NOT SURE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME
SHE'S INVITED A MAN OVER.

152
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,377
Obviously, she called me over to have sex.

153
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,464
HAHAHAHA

154
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:40,929
What is that?

155
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,514
Are you laughing?

156
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,602
YES.

157
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,064
Why are you laughing?

158
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,276
HAHAHAHA
I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOUR IMAGINATION.

159
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,575
If you don't know anything,
don't fucking laugh.

160
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,538
IF YOU COULD CHANGE ONE THING
FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD, WHAT WOULD IT BE?

161
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,252
Do you really want to know?

162
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,840
I THINK IT WILL HELP US GET CLOSER!

163
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,354
I'm not telling you.

164
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,024
You fucking bitch!

165
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,039
YOU

166
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,926
YOU ARE

167
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,565
YOU ARE GOING TO DIE

168
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,988
THAT CAN HAPPEN.

169
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,993
IT'S OKAY.

170
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,438
Jack and Coke, please.

171
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,356
Sure.

172
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,021
I've always been a regular,

173
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,817
but I came here every day
hoping to see you.

174
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,781
Your earrings don't match.

175
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,205
This is fashionable!

176
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,416
Wait.

177
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,087
Did you think I came looking like this
because I rushed to see you?

178
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:43,922
Really?

179
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,007
No.

180
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,273
I thought you weren't interested in me,

181
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,358
so I found myself a lover.

182
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,288
But you still came here.

183
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,382
I've been waiting for you for so long.

184
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,285
Aren't you creeped out by all this?

185
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,540
Why? Do you think there are ghosts?

186
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,461
I've been serving the General
for three years.

187
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,214
And it's been ten years

188
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,217
since I got possessed.

189
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,678
Why would I be scared?

190
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,726
Then were you not scared

191
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,771
when you asked me to come here?

192
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,193
I was scared.

193
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,870
Come on out.

194
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,706
The people who come here

195
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,961
must be desperate enough to ask you
to take responsibility for their lives.

196
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,927
And you listen to all of them,

197
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,805
taking it all in so sincerely.

198
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,686
It makes me think

199
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,355
that you must've felt very lonely…

200
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,360
not being able to talk about your work.

201
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,706
Come on out.

202
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,042
Why? I like it here.

203
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,296
Come to me. Come.

204
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,641
I got you.

205
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,186
So, you were a shaman.

206
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,069
I'll protect you.

207
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,490
Stop with the sweet talk.

208
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,243
I don't want to stop.

209
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,997
I'll just be…

210
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,334
your talisman.

211
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,115

212
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,873
The person uses many IDs on Somebody.

213
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,792
I sent you the list, so take a look.

214
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,503

MARMOT ROBOT

219
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:37,418
I won by a landslide when I entered
the maze-solving competition.

220
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,339
I don't know how I can be good at this.

221
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,801
Jae-man will take first place again.
How did you win?

222
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,386
Why? Are you going to try?

223
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,764
Forget it, Jae-man will win again anyway.

224
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,182
Oh, just give up.

225
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,851
Tell me how you did it!

226
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,311
You're lying, aren't you?

227
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,397
Anyone can say that they've won!

228
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,024
I really need to beat Jae-man.

229
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,109
It's simple.

230
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,236
Kill Jae-man.

231
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,321
Then you'll take first place.

232
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,698
What?

233
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,745
Don't laugh. Tell me how!

234
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,914
I really want to come first!

235
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,586
Wow.

236
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,170
I love that look in your eyes.

237
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,381
It's cute.

238
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,676
Okay.

239
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,679
I'll tell you what you need.
Let's talk later.

241
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,705
How is it? It's fun, right?

242
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,873
Totally!

243
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,042
Using invisible thermal energy.

244
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,710
Jae-man is so dead!

245
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,589
But how did you come up with this idea?

246
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,009
Weren't you my age back then?

247
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,510
I was always alone.

248
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,346
What about your mom?

249
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,139
She was never home.

250
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,140
And your dad?

251
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,475
He was busy.

252
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,353
Well,

253
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,271
I'm pretty much the same.

254
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,026
I think I need to eat something first.

255
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,444
I'm hungry.

256
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,363
What'll you have?

257
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,202
I'm craving meat all of a sudden.

258
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,871
-I want to have meat.
-Okay.

259
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,790
Enjoy your food.

260
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,035
"I waited for you."

261
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,120
"Agape."

262
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,750
-The security camera!
-What about it?

263
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,126
I was told it's not working!

264
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,045
Did that bitch invite us to kill us?

265
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,338
Then that makes us victims!

266
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,229
I'M SORRY! LET'S MEET ANOTHER TIME.

267
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,231
I'LL TREAT YOU TO A MEAL FOR THE TROUBLE.

268
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,157
Okay.

269
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,326
Let's do that.

270
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,829
Fuck.

271
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,316
I miss you.

272
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,528
NOVEMBER 9, 2021
I MISS YOU

273
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,212
I miss you too.

274
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,339
Should I come and see you?

275
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,383
Where are you?

276
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,970
I'm in the garage.

277
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,723
I'm just sitting here.

278
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,227
It's cold. Go inside.

279
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,448
Are you the one who wrecked Someone?

280
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,828
You should be asking why I wrecked it.

281
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,710
It's probably because you found out
Someone can remember the things

282
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,795
you wrote and erased.

283
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:12,980
That's right.

284
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:20,238
You are dear to me,
and Someone was your dearest friend.

285
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,824
So I'm sorry.

286
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,039
Where are you right now?

287
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,797
ACCEPT VIDEO CHAT WITH 17?

288
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,683
You know where this is, right?

289
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,193
Why are you there?

290
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm asking you.

291
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,364
Because of work.

292
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,868
I thought you'd be happy to see me here.

293
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,031
I can leave early in the morning.

294
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,790
It's so late already…

295
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,126
No one's telling you to leave.

296
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,796
I lost track of time while I was with you.

297
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,672
I have to go to work.

298
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,761
Kim Sum?

299
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,306
Who's that?

300
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,726
She's my friend. I wonder why she's here.

301
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,853
Did you have plans?

302
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,523
I should get going.

303
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,776
-Get home safe.
-I'll call you.

304
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,777
Okay.

305
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,410
We need to talk.

306
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,500
Yoon, I'll call you.

307
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,418
Yeah.

308
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,183
What is all this?

309
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:42,982
You said that if I had a knife in my hand,
I'd end up hurting someone, right?

310
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,529
And your power gets stronger
when you're around knives.

311
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,323
So what?

312
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,034
Are you turning these in?

313
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,538
Or is it a donation?

314
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,783
What is this?

315
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,165
This looks too small
to kill a person with…

316
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,169
but why is it giving me the creeps?

317
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,507
Please help me.

318
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,804
I really don't want to lose him.

319
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,268
But… what if I end up killing him?

320
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,437
I finally found him.

321
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,108
I think I finally found someone
that's just like me,

322
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,902
but I'm terrified.

323
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,668
I'll write you a talisman.

324
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,555
Don't you have anything stronger?

325
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:42,851
Like exorcism?

326
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,735

327
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,252
By the way, who was that girl?

328
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,088
Your lover?

329
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,466

I am.

It's not difficult, but…

343
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,424
I'll pay you more.

344
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,470
You know how to pay, right?

345
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,763
I'll send it now.

Bro.

00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:13,479
"Bro, where are you?"

368
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:20,360
Bro, you have the right to remain silent,
and the right to an attorney.

369
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:25,199
"Did you leave the chat room?"

370
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:32,790
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law, bro.

371
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,369
Happy birthday.

372
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,918
There we go.

373
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,088
I'm not going to download Somebody.

374
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,422
Why not?

375
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,258
I don't have to. I met you.

376
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,718
But we met on Somebody.

377
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,930
-Do you want me to download it?
-Yeah.

378
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,351
-My ID is "11."
-Uh-huh.

379
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,435
So make yours "12."

380
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,771
That works, right?

381
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,775
EDIT PROFILE
NICKNAME: 12

382
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,863
Okay. Perfect.

383
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,948
Great job!

384
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,042
Hold on. I can't breathe.

385
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,961
Hold on!

386
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:20,142
