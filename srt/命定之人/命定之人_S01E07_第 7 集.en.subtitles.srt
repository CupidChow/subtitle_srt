1
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,606
Hey, I can't resist it today.

2
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,567
I'm gonna go dancing.

3
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,113
-What?
-I'm craving whiskey.

4
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,949
And I have to dance
to blow off some steam.

5
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,077
But don't you think
that Gi-eun should be in a hot bath

6
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,329
and warming herself up?

7
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,957
No.

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,793
I can get warm under the club lights.
Let's go.

9
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,378
Sounds good.

10
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,047
Let's all go.

11
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:58,600
SOMEBODY

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,741
Hey!

13
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,243
Why are you drinking so much?

14
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,041
Cheers.

15
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,459
Me too?

16
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,087
Get out of my way!

17
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,925
What's wrong with her?

18
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,720
Hey! I survived!

19
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,555
Let's dance.

20
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,443
Hey, Kim Sum!

21
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,782
Dance!

22
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,299
Hello?

23
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,384
Hey.

24
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,973
The redevelopment site
at Euljiro 4th District.

25
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,725
You need to go there now.

26
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,109
I discovered a body there.

27
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,905
But I survived.

28
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,329
Mok-won.

29
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,914
Yeah?

30
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,791
Lock the door before you go.

31
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,709
Thanks, Tae-u.

32
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,002
Don't drink too much.

33
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,424
Do you know… what the hardest thing was
after the accident?

34
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,554
I did everything I could
to rehabilitate myself,

35
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
but my mom cried every time she saw me.

36
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,811
She cried when I exercised like crazy.

37
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,732
She also cried when I shouted
that I couldn't take it anymore.

38
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,777
And when I went to Eun-pyeong

39
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,988
to try and overcome this,

40
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,825
and yelled at him
that I want my position unoccupied.

41
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,954
She cried because of how pitiful I looked.

42
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,539
Damn it.

43
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,127
She was the best at tiring me out.

44
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,965
I'm so glad that I survived,

45
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,468
but my mom will probably cry again.

46
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,930
You didn't tell her, right?

47
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,515
-Don't tell her.
-We won't.

48
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,313
As I crawled out of the Euljiro alleys

49
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,315
and breathed in the cold air

50
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,070
deep into my lungs,

51
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,324
I suddenly wondered what kind of person

52
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,618
that bastard's mother was.

53
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,956
She probably didn't cry so sadly
like mine.

54
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,752
Maybe his mom neglected him too much.

55
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,506
Maybe he grew up alone

56
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,260
to become a psychopath
because he was abandoned.

57
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,347
Is it better to have a mom
who cries for me?

58
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,848
That's what I thought.

59
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,892
Here.

60
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,230
So…

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,030
you're saying… that if his parents
had given him lots of love,

62
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,116
he could've ended up differently, right?

63
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,284
Yeah.

64
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,037
Hey, do you remember
when I started my own shrine?

65
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,164
My mom and I lived together

66
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,126
because she worked as my manager
from dawn till night.

67
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,546
When my mom fell asleep,
I went to clubs to find a lover.

68
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,132
Jeez, what a bitch.

69
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,927
But when I came home drunk in the morning,
my mom was cooking breakfast.

70
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,433
What I'm saying is,
no matter how much your parents love you,

71
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:12,687
you can't change who you are.
No, you choose not to.

72
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,733
Anyway,

73
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,736
that's just what General Mok-won thinks.

74
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,699
But, Gi-eun, why do you keep bringing up
touchy-feely stuff?

75
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,950
It's pissing me off.

76
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,416
So what I'm saying is that…

77
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,671
we should use that to catch the bastard.

78
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,593
Use what? Motherhood?
We're going to catch him with motherhood?

79
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,471
Yes, motherhood.

80
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,141
But did he tell you about his mom?

81
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,185
How do you know all this?

82
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,105
Which one of us is going to be the mom?

83
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,357
Damn it.

84
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,943
Mom?

85
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,619
Okay, I get it.

86
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,706
First, I'll write a talisman
that will lure him to us.

87
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,166
-Huh?
-And…

88
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,628
I'll take that talisman…

89
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,548
and put it on Sum!

90
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,303
A talisman? On me?

91
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,304
Yeah.

92
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,849
Jeez.

93
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,186
We need to put it on Sum.

94
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,816
-I can't be the mom.
-No.

95
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,236
That's exactly why you should do it.
We have to put the talisman on you!

96
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,073
Hey, Kim Sum.

97
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,828
That bastard is different from you.

98
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,829
He's different?

99
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,747
Let's sober up,

100
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,708
and we'll focus
on crushing him from tomorrow on.

101
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,754
Now, how do we build a trap?

102
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,507
That's all we need to think about, okay?

103
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,425
Yeah!

104
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,219
Bring it in.

105
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,518
I need more time to think.

106
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,243
EULJIRO 4TH DISTRICT

107
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,544
We told you to stop,
so we can secure the crime scene.

108
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,546
How can you continue the demolition?

109
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,673
I'm telling you, we stopped!

110
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,592
I can't even go home at this hour.

111
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,677
You should be apologizing. Jeez.

112
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,929
KCSI
FORENSICS

113
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:52,930
I found it.

114
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,101
Detective, you should take a look at this!

115
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,019
Did you find it?

116
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,491
Yeah, Mok-won.

117
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,701
Gi-eun.

118
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,956
I've been thinking about it,
and I think I should tell you.

119
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,669
The guy from the pool.

120
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,174
I think he's Sum's boyfriend.

121
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,261
Why do you think that?

122
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,098
Did you feel it? With your powers?

123
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,894
The General showed it to me.

124
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,230
I definitely saw it.

125
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,363
He's surrounded
by a ton of vengeful spirits.

126
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,742
The smell of incense won't go away.

127
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,037
He's dangerous.

128
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,540
Really dangerous.

129
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,321
SEOUL SANGDONG POLICE STATION

130
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,079
Gi-eun!

131
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,748
What the hell?

132
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,751
Hey, thanks for the meat.
By the way, what happened to you?

133
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,004
Would you look at that?

134
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,756
-What?
-Move out of the way for a second.

135
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,012
Does that car have a disability sticker?

136
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,763
-This one?
-Check.

137
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,933
I don't think it does.

138
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,018
It doesn't, right?

139
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,519
Damn it.

140
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,772
Who's this jerk?

141
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,776
What kind of jerk parks a car
in the handicap spot?

142
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,278
Ah, this is outrageous.

143
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,614
There were no fingerprints on the body.

144
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,868
The autopsy report says
that the victim was strangled to death,

145
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,703
but there's nothing.

146
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,790
Also, her neck was completely broken.

147
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,708
Jeez.

148
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,085
This is not an average psycho.

149
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,714
Why'd you even go there?

150
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,133
It wasn't a coincidence, right?

151
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,773
So…

152
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,330
Hi.

153
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,901
You suddenly barging in here like this
makes me uncomfortable.

154
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,820
You should be thankful.

155
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,281
I'm being considerate of you.

156
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,493
What are you talking about? Make it clear.

157
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,041
I'm waiting to see
if you really think he's not the guy,

158
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,461
or if you're just pretending
because you want to believe

159
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,256
that he's not the guy.

160
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,925
Can you not live without him?

161
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,387
Is it the sort of love
you could trade your life for?

162
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,974
It's not him.

163
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,059
I'll prove it.

164
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,519
Oh!

165
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,940
You guys were curious about his mom.
I should ask him about her, right?

166
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,484
Hey, Kim Sum.

167
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,779
YUN-O

168
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,580
Huh? What's up?
You don't usually call at this hour.

169
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,916
There's something
I'm suddenly curious about.

170
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,834
Oh…

171
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,503
-What is it?
-Yun-o.

172
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,255
You know how

173
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,468
my mom said I was born
a cogwheel with no cogs?

174
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,970
Yes. What about it, Sum?

175
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,514
What was your mom like?

176
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,605
My mom was a total tiger mom.

177
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,775
I took three private lessons
since kindergarten.

178
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,195
She split my day into ten-minute intervals
and took me around.

179
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,489
She was always next to me.

180
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,785
I'm so excited!

181
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,208
Gosh, my mom… was hard to deal with.

182
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm sorry.

183
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,548
Oh, and was it Samantha?

184
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,300
I got a call from Spectrum.

185
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,513
She said she wants to renovate
the building and build an extension.

186
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,848
-Samantha said that?
-Yes.

187
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,227
So I'm going to visit Spectrum soon.

188
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,147
Oh, I'll see you then.

189
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,233
Yeah, I'll see you then.

190
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,829
Happy now?

191
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,913
Please leave.

192
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,167
Left or right?

193
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,044
What are you doing right now?

194
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,632
Should I ask the General?

195
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,135
General Kim Sum of Spectrum, take a guess.

196
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,179
Left or right?

197
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,641
I don't get why you're doing this.

198
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,853
Why did you ask for the exorcism?

199
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,647
What did you want from it?

200
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,944
You can find out about him if you want.

201
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,280
Through all the information on Somebody.

202
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,199
Why aren't you doing it?

203
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,743
Or did you do it already?

204
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,208
-Left.
-What?

205
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,966
My left?

206
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:47,970
Or…

207
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,808
your left?

208
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,312
If the General weren't with you,

209
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,356
if you weren't a shaman…

210
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,321
you would have been meeting people
and living a happier life.

211
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,908
That's what I'm doing right now.

212
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,662
I don't want you
risking your life for him.

213
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,706
You don't have to worry.

214
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,585
Everyone will be punished
for the crimes they commit.

215
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,592
I'm going to do as much as I can.

216
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,898
I'm taking this.

217
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,788
LIGHT AND SHADOW, I LIKE THEM ALL

218
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,653
What's wrong?

219
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,864
Is something wrong?

220
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,200
No.

221
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,330
Are you okay now?

222
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,665
MY NUMBER'S 8095-4584.
I WANT TO HEAR YOU.

223
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,125
Can I help you somehow?

224
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,836
Tell me anything.

225
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,632
There's someone I want to find.

226
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,260
Why do you want to find the person?

227
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,054
When I think about it,

228
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,682
I hate them so much
that I want to kill them.

229
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,769
But they seem to know me really well.

230
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,647
That's why I want to find them.

231
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,816
I'm jealous,

232
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,276
whoever it is.

233
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,780
But if you ask me to help you, I will.

234
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,577
Do you want me to come over?

235
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,542
No. I have something to do right now.

236
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,294
I'll see you another time.

237
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,092
Damn it!

238
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,228
You…

239
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,857
bother me too much.

240
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,734
I have to do something.

241
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,254
Yun-o is coming to the office tomorrow.

242
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,341
If you're that curious,
you guys can come and see for yourself.

243
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,887
What are you going to do?

244
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,437
Then I'll go to Spectrum tomorrow.

245
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,573
Okay.

246
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,742
You can see him tomorrow.

247
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,880
It's like a strange love triangle.

248
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,466
Gi-eun, Sum, and that bastard.

249
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,636
Then, what are you?

250
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,390
Me?

251
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,231
The Three Musketeers
is about four people too.

252
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,568
So what does that make you?

253
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,991
I'm the one
who's attached to you at the hip!

254
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,858
Shall we go in?

255
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:58,942
Thank you.

256
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,156
So, this is the Spectrum Hall.

257
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,159
Thank you for coming, Mr. Seong Yun-o.

258
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,493
It's my pleasure.

259
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,370
As you can see,

260
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,540
the special thing about this hall
is it's an open-plan office.

261
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:18,128
It's very different from the offices
with partitioning walls.

262
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,213
Ah! Here's something fun.

263
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,800
It's a candy bar that shows

264
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,511
how employees feel
at the beginning of the day.

265
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,848
They place their candies

266
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,517
depending on how they feel,
whether it be anger,

267
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,686
happiness, sadness, or whatever.

268
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,356
Then, can I…

269
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,442
take one of these?

270
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,527
Are you afraid of something?

271
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,528
No.

272
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,699
We also have a bar.
Would you like a cup of tea?

273
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,284
-Sure.
-Let's go.

274
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,799
To be honest with you,

275
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,718
I hope we can see each other more often.

276
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,553
Sure.

277
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,392
Also-- Oh, just a moment.

278
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,726
U-cheol?

279
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,727
Yes.

280
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,066
This is Shim U-cheol.
And this is Seong Yun-o.

281
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,984
-I see. Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

282
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,653
You can contact U-cheol

283
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,155
for any operational matters
or other details.

284
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,156
Yes.

285
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,493
Here's my card. Feel free to contact me.

286
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,577
Yes, thank you.

287
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,829
-Thank you.
-No problem.

288
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,634
Then, do we have anything left
to talk about today?

289
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,803
Are you in a hurry?

290
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:54,015
Actually, my friend works here.

291
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,934
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

292
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,395
Who's your friend?

293
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,939
It's Kim Sum.

294
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,775
Our CTO, Kim Sum?

295
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,528
Yes, we planned on meeting after this.

296
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,407
Well, we're done talking for now.

297
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,993
-Do you want me to take you to her?
-Oh, thank you.

298
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,953
-Let's go.
-Okay.

299
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,919
Here.

300
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,300
I can tell that this
is not my friend's office.

301
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,887
I thought we were friends too.

302
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,934
As a friend, I have something to say.

303
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,605
Can you talk with me for a bit
and then go meet Sum?

304
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,233
Yeah, sure.

305
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,486
Let's go in.

306
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,908
You can sit here.

307
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,587
PROFILE: AGAPE

308
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,256
The missing graduate student, Oh Na-eun.

309
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,344
You used her phone to create an ID
with the nickname Agape.

310
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:18,016
And here are the messages inviting
the four hooded men to Space 39.

311
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:25,482
Shall we put this up
on the wall over there

312
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,443
and invite Sum to talk with us?

313
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,201
What I'm saying is,
you should stop seeing Sum.

314
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,621
I don't want to hand over
any personal information

315
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,457
to the authorities
and damage my own company.

316
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,836
Whoever you meet

317
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,005
and whatever you do with them,

318
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,507
I'd like to protect you.

319
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,635
Because that's beneficial for me.

320
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,929
So,

321
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,640
don't step out of line.

322
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,352
There's one condition.

323
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,605
You will no longer put your hands on Sum.

324
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,400
If you can do that,

325
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,862
I think this will be the start
of a great friendship.

326
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,831
Are you…

327
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,501
really going to tell Sum?

328
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,505
It depends on how you behave.

329
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,761
You shouldn't tell her.

330
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:38,930
Then,

331
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,017
you shouldn't meet her ever again.

332
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,277
I mean…

333
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,531
Sum already knows.

334
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,415
Is Sum…

335
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,793
yours?

336
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,547
She's mine.

337
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,134
Sum is not an adult.

338
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,221
That's what makes her more valuable.
I have to protect her.

339
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,893
If we lose Sum, it's over for Somebody!

340
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,573
If there is no Somebody,

341
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,950
then Sum will be free.

342
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,286
No.

343
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,249
Somebody is Sum's everything.

344
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,900
Sum's freedom?

345
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,490
She knows who Agape is?

346
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,454
You must be lying.

347
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,716
KIM SUM: HEADING OUT NOW.
I WILL SHOW YOU.

348
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,261
GI-EUN: I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SAME GUY
OH, I DON'T KNOW!

349
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,596
GI-EUN: BE CAREFUL ANYWAY

350
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,099
STAND BY. I'LL SEND YOU A PICTURE.

351
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,027
-Yes, this is Yeong Gi-eun.
-Did you see it?

352
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,822
Yes, that's not him.

353
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,907
He's not the guy?

354
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,371
Hey, is he Sum's boyfriend?

355
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,374
They were arm in arm. Hang up for now.

356
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,542
Okay.

357
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,694
Yun-o. Listen to me.

358
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,614
There's someone waiting for you.

359
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,075
She's the shaman
you talked with on the phone.

360
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,037
What should we do?

361
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,530
Sit over there.

362
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,199
Okay.

363
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,375
If… you take a single step out of here,

364
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,670
I'll kill you.

365
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,180
Look.

366
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,892
I'll use these to kill you…

367
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,313
then cut you into pieces,

368
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,691
and put you in a safe.

369
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,154
Got it?

370
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,907
Yes.

371
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,559
LIEN BEING EXERCISED, CRIMINAL CHARGES
WILL BE FILED FOR OBSTRUCTION

372
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,838
-Have you been well?
-No.

373
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,384
All right, then.

374
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,056
I'm doing well.

375
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:49,313
It was snowing
when I heard that you went to jail.

376
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,358
NIV ENGLISH-KOREAN STUDY BIBLE

377
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,862
I thought it was because you broke
the Regulation of Speculative Acts.

378
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,363
I looked it up.

379
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,074
But then, I went to Jeonju Restaurant.

380
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,870
It was spring. There were forsythias.

381
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,876
The lady there told me you went to prison
because you killed someone.

382
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,259
Yeah.

383
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,597
Did that person wrong you enough
for you to kill them?

384
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,433
No.

385
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,022
Is it okay to kill someone
if they deserve to die?

386
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,614
You told me
that people are punished for their crimes.

387
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,916
Can you forget
about the person you killed?

388
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,210
Like everything else in this world?

389
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,213
No.
