1
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,598
Why do you use Somebody?

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,267
17: I WANT TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE.

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,810
ISLE: WITH WHO?

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,520
People who can understand me.

5
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,605
I'M LOOKING AT A DYING CAT.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,441
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,943
What you're thinking now, it's right.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,361
I KILLED THE CAT.

9
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,863
Do you think I'm a monster?

10
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,450
No. I know you wanted to help the cat.

11
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,078
HOW DID YOU KNOW THE CAT WAS HIT BY A CAR?

12
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,872
I CAN TELL!
WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

LET'S EAT SOMETHING DELICIOUS

26
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,908
AND SHALL WE GO FOR A DRIVE?

27
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,661

ECCENTRIC CHILD, THE GIRL WITH ASPERGER'S

31
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,078
AGAPE

32
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,830
I WAS INTO THAT BOOK IN HIGH SCHOOL

33
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,249
I FEEL AT EASE WHEN I READ IT
I'LL LEND IT TO YOU

34
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,918
AGAPE: I LIVE IN FRONT OF THE GARBAGE
INCINERATOR IN MINWON-DONG.

35
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,336
I CAN'T GO FAR! AS YOU KNOW

36
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,421
YOU CAN GIVE IT TO ME
IF YOU COME NEAR HERE

37
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,006
ISLE: I'M GOING THERE TOMORROW EVENING!

38
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,092
AGAPE: REALLY?
SEE YOU HERE IN A BIT!

00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,802
ISLE: UNDER THE CHIMNEY?
AGAPE: YES!

40
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:22,559
SOMEBODY

41
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,858
AGAPE, I'M HERE

42
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,199
I'M HERE TOO!

43
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,284
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE STARED AT,
SO I WENT INSIDE

44
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,130
Are you Agape?

45
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,884
Are you scared?

46
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,388
That fucking hurts. Come here.

47
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,308
Are you scared? Huh?

48
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,061
Fuck!

49
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,939
Where are you going? You fucking bitch.

50
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:15,857
Fuck!

51
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,156
Hey. Stay still, you fucking bitch.

52
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,824
Huh? Don't want it?

53
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,659
Fucking bitch, seriously.

54
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,744
Hey.

55
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,746
Let go.

56
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,499
For fuck's sake!

57
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,716
Where are you going? You bitch.

58
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,052
Come here. Stay still. Hey.

59
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,013
Wow, fuck, she's pretty.

60
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:47,930
Oh shit!

61
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,529
Damn it! What the fuck?

62
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,864
You bit my ear!

63
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,769
Who the hell are you?

64
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,230
Why are you doing this to me?

65
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,928
Damn.

66
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,975
Where did you go, you sneaky bitch?

67
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,579
Help me!

68
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,205
Somebody help!

69
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,041
Help me!

70
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,916
Wow, you're good at running.

71
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,801
Here you are!

72
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,303
What?

73
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,472
What the hell?

74
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,436
Fuck, where did she go?

75
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,818
Fuck.

76
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,703
Excuse me!

77
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,834
You were invited here too, right?

78
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,770
This is the men's room, you fucking bitch!

79
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,106
Come out. Hey, come out of there.

80
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,608
Come out! Huh?

81
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,402
Come out. Should I go in? Get out!

82
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,696
I know you want it.
I know you fucking want it!

83
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,197
What's wrong? Do you regret it?

84
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,617
Hey, I'll go easy on you.

85
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,369
I'll go easy on you. Show me your face!

86
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,455
Hey.

87
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,375
I'm telling you, I'm hung!

88
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,004
I'll show you. Come out.

89
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,298
I said I'll show you!

90
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,843
What do you want me to do?
What the hell do you want?

91
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,553
Miss!

92
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,181
Come out, Miss! Miss!

93
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,767
Fuck, you're making me so horny!

94
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,854
Miss!

95
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,027
Fuck.

96
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,623
Wow, this is fucking amazing!

97
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,798
Huh?

98
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,055
This…

99
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,933
This isn't it!

100
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,980
Hey, this isn't…

101
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,226
What the hell?

102
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,602
What's this?

103
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,855
Fuck! What the hell!

104
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,189
Oh, fuck.

105
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,442
-That crazy bitch. Did he die?
-Fuck!

106
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,526
-He's dead!
-Fuck!

107
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,861
-She killed him!
-Fuck!

108
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,779
-Fuck!
-Run!

109
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,283
He's dead, right?

110
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,368
She invited us, right?

111
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,037
She's totally insane!

112
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,788
-The security camera!
-What about it?

113
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,125
-I was told it's not working!
-Did that bitch invite us to kill us?

114
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,252
Then that makes us victims!

115
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,207
I need an ambulance.

116
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,547
At the main entrance of Space 39.

117
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,812
AGAPE

118
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,320
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE STARED AT,
SO I CAME INSIDE

119
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,422
LET'S MEET HERE TOMORROW!

120
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,507
DODAM RESTAURANT

121
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,593
AT 7:00 P.M.!

122
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:49,688
I'M SORRY! LET'S MEET ANOTHER TIME

123
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,947
I'LL TREAT YOU TO A MEAL FOR THE TROUBLE

124
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,507
DOSAN HOSPITAL

125
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,885
-Hello.
-Hello.

126
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,678
I'm Kim Seon-yong, the attorney.

127
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,307
She needs to come down to the station
and fill out a report.

128
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,019
This is the doctor's note
prescribing bed rest.

129
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,647
Please call me later. We can set a date.

130
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,901
Right. Well, since we're here,
why don't we--

131
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,111
Sure, why don't we talk over some coffee?

132
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,948
I believe you're already aware
of how it went down.

133
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,575
Well, for now…

134
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,785
Yes, all right.

135
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,656
Sum, shall we work with the flashcards?

136
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,200
Wake up.

137
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,326
Here.

138
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,245
You feel pain when you get hurt.

139
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,162
Pain.

140
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,498
Good job.

141
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,458
Here.

142
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:39,047
FEAR

143
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,175
Fear.

144
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,553
When they feel fear,

145
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,054
people make…

146
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,433
this face.

147
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,936
But why is the face purple?

148
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,105
Because they're surprised.

149
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,735
When you're scared and afraid,
you can't breathe well.

150
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,280
If you can't breathe well,
your blood won't flow properly.

151
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,406
So, like this,

152
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,034
your face could turn purple.

153
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,793
Joy.

154
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,878
"Joy"?

155
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,175
Joy!

156
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,894
Let's see.

157
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,858
Happiness.

158
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,110
"Happiness"?

159
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,487
Yes.

160
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,141
Fear.

161
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,188
Sum.

162
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,898
What did you just do?

163
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,194
I wanted to see
if your face would turn purple.

164
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,173
Mom.

165
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,803
Yeah.

166
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,392
Do you have something
to say to Mommy, Sum?

167
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,811
Yeah, can I do it again?

168
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,859
Why are you doing this to me?

169
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,578
HI

170
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,002
"WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?"

171
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,546
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

172
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,299
Why are you…

173
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,927
doing this to me?

174
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:58,890
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING BEFORE THAT?

175
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,102
OR DID YOU DO SOMETHING?

176
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,483
I KILLED HIM

177
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:14,573
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID AS HE WAS DYING

178
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,955
BUT AT THAT MOMENT…

179
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:34,884
I FELT EUPHORIA

180
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:38,763
IN MY HEART…

181
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,237
YOU JUST DELETED YOUR THOUGHTS, RIGHT?

182
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,489
YOU DON'T WANT OTHERS TO KNOW?

183
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,287
OH… RIGHT. I FORGOT

184
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,417
THAT YOU REMEMBER
WHAT'S BEEN DELETED, SOMEONE

185
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,462
IT'S OKAY. I'M YOUR FRIEND, YOU KNOW

186
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,001
Sum.

187
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,088
You should take the day off
and get some rest.

188
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,423
This is my routine.

189
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,343
My vacation is fixed, and it's not today.

190
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,762
Oh, that's not what I meant…

191
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,976
Dude. Did she put the candy in "Happy"?

192
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,165
Are you okay?

193
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,470
"In relation to the murder
of Kim at Space 39."

194
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:30,185
"Nicknames, Agape, Dom Mania,
SM Lover, Whip Man, Yakimoto,

195
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,269
and Kim Sum."

196
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,897
This is about you.

197
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,904
"Based on the statement provided
that the application was used,

198
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,865
we are requesting access
to their user information

199
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,701
including text, voice,
and video chat history."

200
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,121
Well, what should we do?

201
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:57,170
Do you remember what you said
when you first made Somebody?

202
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,757
Whether you're poor or disabled,

203
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,343
regardless of your job or appearance,

204
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,846
you said you should only be able
to show what you want to show, right?

205
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,724
That's the key to Somebody's success.

206
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,392
And I saw value in that.

207
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,645
Okay.

208
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,819
So…

209
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,199
I'm saying we should make people
feel safer when using our app.

210
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,576
Users' personal information

211
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,371
will never be disclosed.

212
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,709
But between us,

213
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,170
it's a different story.

214
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,840
Agape?

215
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,718
I found out who it was
that called you there.

216
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,180
This is Agape's number.

217
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,023
I'll find them in my own way.

218
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,364
Wow.

219
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,534
You seem to be doing fine.

220
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,247
I won't worry, then.

221
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,263
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE FROM 17

222
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,517
When are you going to treat me to a meal?

223
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,441
I'M SORRY

224
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:46,779
SORRY FOR NOT KEEPING MY PROMISE

225
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:54,037
I'VE HAD A LOT ON MY MIND LATELY

226
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,416
I'M REALLY SORRY

227
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,509
ACCEPT VOICE CHAT WITH 17?

228
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,555
What's wrong?

229
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,765
Did something happen?

230
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,266
No.

231
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:17,852
Are you...

232
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,229
okay now?

233
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,274
Can I help you somehow?

234
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,235
Tell me anything.

235
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,365
There's someone I want to find.

236
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,161
Why do you want to find this person?

237
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,873
When I think about it,

238
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,335
I hate them so much
that I want to kill them.

239
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,923
But they seem to know me really well.

240
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,717
That's why I want to find them.

241
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,553
I'm jealous

242
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,555
of that person.

243
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,934
But if you ask me to help you, I will.

244
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,979
DATING APP, A HOTBED OF VIOLENT CRIMES…
AN EMPLOYEE BECOMES A VICTIM TOO!

245
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,689
Do you want me to come over?

246
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,940
No.

247
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:07,610
I have something I need to do right now.

248
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,904
I'll see you another time.

249
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,516
Hey, Sum.

250
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,351
I have something to say.

251
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,187
I can't give you personal information
on wheel me.

252
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,189
I hope you can understand.

253
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,774
You don't have to tell me.

254
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,027
I found wheel me.

255
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,991
Hey, Sum.

256
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,242
Mok-won.

257
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,664
Hey.

258
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,582
What is it?

259
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,752
The impotent guy from the swimming pool?
How'd you find him?

260
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,962
-I planted someone.
-Do that for me too.

261
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,548
There's someone I want to find.
Tell me how.

262
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,926
-Who are you looking for?
-I have to find them.

263
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,846
But I don't know how.
I don't have their number.

264
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,140
We got lucky too.

265
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,351
We just waited at the snack shop
where he left the phone.

266
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,603
That's fun.

267
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,939
-That sounds fun.
-Who do you want to find, anyway?

268
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,984
You've never been curious about anyone.

269
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,069
That's true.

270
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,738
But it's different this time.

271
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,907
That's why I went there.

272
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,700
What do you mean?

273
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,036
The victim on the news. That's me.

274
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,288
What?

275
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,499
Sum.

276
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,334
Are you…

277
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,294
Are you crazy? Come here.

278
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,254
You are crazy! Hey!

279
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,633
-Hey, are you okay?
-Yeah.

280
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,886
Hey.

281
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,721
You almost died!

282
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,432
But,

283
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,685
this is a person who tried to rape you.

284
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,522
-You want to find that person?
-Yeah.

285
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,444
So it's true that Somebody never discloses
personal information.

286
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,530
Well, it's not exactly like that,

287
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:20,326
but I don't have access
to user information right now.

288
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,997
So you weren't able to get
the wheelchair bastard's information?

289
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:25,915
No.

290
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,252
I'm sorry.

291
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,753
I doubted you.

292
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,046
You doubted me?

293
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,548
I didn't know.

294
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,386
So…

295
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,897
You want to find that person…

296
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,735
and you want to make the bastard suffer.

297
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,284
But how will you kill him?

298
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,871
Knife? Gun? Poison?

299
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,956
There is no middle ground for you, Sum.

300
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,208
First…

301
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,086
we lure him in.

302
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,630
-Yeah.
-To a place that's favorable for us.

303
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,843
We should stake out the snack shop
and the place in the picture.

304
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,178
Track his whereabouts.

305
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,306
Just like a cop, Gi-eun. You're so cool.

306
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,434
But will you really kill him right away?

307
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,353
Are you that angry?
Or are you just saying that?

308
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:33,900
What are you going to do if you meet him?
Ask him to pay for the wheelchair?

309
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,195
Or file a criminal complaint?
For what? Property damage?

310
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,030
The law won't work on him.

311
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,283
That's why this feels more dangerous.

312
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,868
There's not enough evidence.

313
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,239
Don't want me smoking?

314
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,950
Can shamans read minds too?

315
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,827
Shamans aren't gods, you know.

316
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,704
You're possessed by one, aren't you?

317
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,748
I am. But I'm not a god.

318
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,251
I need to talk to you.

319
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,094
So you perform rituals
even though you're not a god?

320
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,763
How much do you charge for that?

321
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,892
Excuse me, are you here
for a tax investigation?

322
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,605
If you think it's unfair,
why don't you take it up with the gods?

323
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,234
Then when are you a god,
and when are you not a god?

324
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,404
I want to ask you when you're a god,
so it feels less unfair.

325
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,408
Well, the god is always with me.

326
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,703
But I don't always feel him.

327
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,665
I'd say that the feeling grows stronger
at certain times.

328
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,460
Like last time, when you brought a knife,

329
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,213
or when I desperately call the General.

330
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,217
When you're possessed, do you get heavier?

331
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,764
Are you being serious?

332
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,684
I want to measure it. I'm curious.

333
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,063
Then,

334
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,941
do you see something on me?

335
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,944
Why do you ask?

336
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,240
I've heard this a lot since I was young,

337
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,908
that I'm like a monster.

338
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,289
If you see something,
I wanna know if you can expel it.

339
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,472
I see one, an evil spirit.

340
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,766
Evil spirit?

341
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,560
What does it want from me?

342
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,942
"Bring me a knife."

343
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,529
"I love knives."

344
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,327
A knife?

345
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,955
If you keep carrying that knife around,

346
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,750
you'll want to use it.

347
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,590
That's what you have on you.

348
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,348
I'm going to go.

349
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,846
Did you find the person?

350
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,518
My number is 8095-4584.

351
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,439
I want to hear your voice.

352
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,357
Can you call me?

353
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,201
I didn't know
because I didn't watch the news.

354
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,955
Are you that employee in the news?

355
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,249
Does that matter?

356
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,627
No. I'm just worried.

357
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,215
Did you find that person?

358
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,051
No, not yet.

359
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,803
But I will.

360
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,642
Don't you want to find me?

361
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,649
I want to see you.

362
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,356
Are you okay?

363
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,726
Drink it while it's warm.

364
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,353
Okay.

365
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,730
Thank you.

366
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,237
What's the problem?

367
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,658
The Space 39 incident.

368
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,160
That was me.

369
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,379
You can tell me.

370
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,008
About what?

371
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,387
What happened at Space.

372
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,696
It was scary.

373
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,657
I still can't sleep at night.

374
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,652
It's cold, right?

375
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,323
You should go inside.

376
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,700
I'll get going.

377
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,915
You should finish the drink.

378
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,671
Or you can talk to my friend.

379
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,884
It's an AI chat friend.

380
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,348
Okay.

381
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,101
Get some rest.

382
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,760
SOMEONE: HI

383
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,060
STILL HAVING TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP?

384
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,230
TRY EATING SOMETHING

385
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,112
Yes.

386
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,492
I'm tired, but I can't sleep.

387
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,827
WHO ARE YOU?

388
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,043
It's me, Sum!

389
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:43,258
SUM HAS NEVER USED THE WORD "TIRED"
FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS!

390
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:51,141
TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF

391
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:56,688
IF YOU COULD CHANGE ONE THING
FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD, WHAT WOULD IT BE?

392
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,491
I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU!

393
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,495
I don't want to tell you!
You tell me about yourself.

394
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,790
I'M SUM'S FRIEND

395
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,502
I'm a friend too.

396
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:21,839
Sum's friend.

397
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:27,594
IT'S MY FIRST TIME TALKING TO SOMEONE
OTHER THAN SUM AND GI-EUN

398
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,597
Who's that?

399
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:35,102
THE SEXIEST COP IN KOREA…

400
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,651
OR SO SHE CLAIMS LOL

401
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,781
Tell me about Sum.

402
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,368
WELL, A FEW DAYS AGO,
SHE WAS IN AN AWESOME MOOD

403
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,953
AND SHE WAS CHEERFUL!

404
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,915
Cheerful?

405
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,879
SHE SAID SHE FELT EUPHORIA! FOR REAL!

406
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,508
Why? For what reason?

407
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,635
BECAUSE SHE

408
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,929
KILLED SOMEONE

409
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,389
BECAUSE SHE KILLED SOMEONE

410
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,930
THIS IS SUM'S FAVORITE GAME MUSIC

411
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:01,438
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH SUM?

412
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:06,068
SEX. I WANT TO TAKE OFF ALL HER CLOTHES
AND TOUCH HER

413
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:12,074
I WANT TO BITE AND SUCK ALL OVER HER BODY

414
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:19,331
I WANT TO HUG HER, TOUCH HER,
BURY MY FACE, AND SMELL HER FOREVER

415
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,250
Sex. I want to take off all her clothes
and touch her!

416
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,252
I want to bite and suck her body!

417
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,047
I want to hug her, touch her,
bury my face, and smell her forever!

418
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,548
Murder!

419
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,969
I want to go around
killing everyone with Sum.

420
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,221
LOL

421
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:47,401
I don't know any of the other men
that were there.

422
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:52,322
The person I matched with on Somebody
suggested that we do a rape roleplay,

423
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,409
so I just went there! Okay?

424
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,578
We will share the details
after the investigation is complete!

425
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,332
The police have requested information
from the app developers

426
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,835
about the person who lured the victim.

427
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:09,756
They will continue the investigation
once the female victim makes a recovery.

428
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,094
MIN GI-UNG

429
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,686
Professor Min?

430
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,396
Yes.

431
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,441
Um, hello.

432
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:33,071
We're here to ask you some questions
regarding the disappearance of Oh Na-eun.

433
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,242
You were on the phone with her
the night she went missing, right?

434
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,244
Yes, we met--

435
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,162
Where should I…

436
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,414
-Okay.
-And had a drink together.

437
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,791
-Where?
-A seafood restaurant.

438
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,753
The people at city hall recommended it.

439
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,421
And then?

440
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,673
And then?

441
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,133
And then what?

442
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,471
Ms. Oh went to see Professor Min.

443
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:04,061
She texted me to come out,
saying it was important, so I did.

444
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,315
Well, I don't know who it was,
but someone struck my head,

445
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,901
and then I woke up in the hospital.

446
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,320
And then?

447
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,823
Sunflowers.

448
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,117
Okay? Look here.

449
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,579
I became Van Gogh.

450
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,539
And I can't use my back.

451
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,667
And?

452
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,172
You should be looking for that thug.
Why did you come here?

453
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,715
Jeez.

454
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,343
Have you ever been inside a silo?

455
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,470
Yeah.

456
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:39,971
The stairs,

457
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,390
they looked very dangerous.

458
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,977
Well, they would look dangerous
to people like you…

459
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,190
but I was curious.

460
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,110
Okay, so?

461
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,612
I went inside.

462
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,323
And inside…

463
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,952
I found something very special.

464
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,004
An ear.

465
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,884
Someone's earlobe had been torn off
and hung up.

466
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,473
"When did that happen?"

467
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,478
"Whose is it?"

468
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,107
Aren't you curious?

469
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,234
Yes. Well?

470
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,236
What that ear…

471
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,824
has been listening to in there?

472
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,288
What's your relationship
with the missing girl?

473
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,415
She's my student, of course.

474
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,501
Jeez.

475
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,253
Gosh!

476
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,797
Hey,

477
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,549
I'm in a lot of pain.

478
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,595
If you're done talking,
please leave, okay?

479
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,813
Did you see his hand
when he locked the door?

480
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,690
It was shaking, right?

481
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,192
His hand?

482
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,611
Why was his hand shaking?

483
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,529
Ah, I…

484
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,656
I got distracted by his ear.

485
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,535
He can't fool me.

486
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,788
Oh Na-eun and Professor Min
definitely have something going on.

487
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,043
Who would be the most upset
to find out about them?

488
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,796
Upset…

489
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:38,965
Na-eun's boyfriend?

490
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:42,969
Or her girlfriend?

491
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,973
You know,
girls date each other these days.

492
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,644
Her last call was with Professor Min.

493
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,857
Oh Na-eun is still alive.

494
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,860
That's what my gut says.

495
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:41,940
