1
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,780
Are you going to keep showing me the pool
instead of your face?

2
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,199
I want to see your face.

3
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:52,427
SOMEBODY

4
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,269
Hello.

5
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,730
Hello.

6
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,815
Nice to meet you.

7
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,782
Would you like to come down here?

8
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,037
How did you get down?

9
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,456
By diving in.

10
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,043
You're lying!

11
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,005
Right, it's a lie.

12
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,510
But there's a bigger lie, you know.

13
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,102
You have a girlfriend, right?

14
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,112
The bigger lie is…

15
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:11,965
Shit!

16
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,469
I'm sorry, I…

17
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,684
I was just…

18
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,562
I was curious about you

19
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,980
and wanted to meet you,

20
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,274
so I lied a little bit.

21
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,401
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,573
How can I trust you?

23
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,331
I don't know.

24
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,092
Didn't you say you want to swim?

25
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,603
Shall we swim together?

26
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,026
Then,

27
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,777
can I come

28
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:16,821
closer?

29
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,308
I surprised you, didn't I?

30
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,486
Can I carry you?

31
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,890
GENERAL MOK-WON

32
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,501
Take my panties off.

33
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,043
I want you to eat me out.

34
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,449
Stop.

35
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,876
To be honest,

36
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,962
I can't feel anything.

37
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,136
After the accident,

38
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,559
you're the first one to touch me.

39
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,063
Thank you.

40
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,075
Am I doing okay?

41
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,497
Am I?

42
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,214
Touch me here.

43
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,869
What's with the wound?

44
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,421
I have one on my back too.

45
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,133
Yours looked pretty big.

46
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,388
It must have hurt, as big as it is.

47
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,059
Mine hurt too.

48
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,650
When I'm in the wheelchair,
I get bruises on my thighs.

49
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,402
You saw them earlier, right?

50
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,033
Huh?

51
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,749
Can you get me a wet wipe?

52
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,753
Huh?

53
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,423
Get me a wet wipe, please.

54
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,096
Oh, were you asleep?

55
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,269
Can you get me a wet wipe?

56
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,355
Huh?

57
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,287
Don't take too long.

58
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,251
Damn it, where's my phone?

59
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,302
Damn it.

60
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,983
Fuck!

61
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,736
Ah, fuck.

62
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,738
You son of a bitch!

63
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,907
Where the fuck are you?

64
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,242
Hey!

65
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,412
What did you do to my wheelchair?

66
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,248
Damn it!

67
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,732
Shit.

68
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,753
Damn it.

69
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,222
Ah, fuck.

70
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,242
Shit!

71
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,067
Excuse me.

72
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,570
Who is it?

73
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,284
-Can you come out here?
-Mok-won!

74
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,121
Mok-won.

75
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,665
-Where do I put her down?
-Here.

76
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,172
Oh, the smell. Did you shit your pants?

77
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,257
-No, I didn't.
-Jeez.

78
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,510
Sir.

79
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,472
-Here you go.
-Okay.

80
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,349
Thank you.

81
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,941
Why weren't you answering my calls?
Where's your phone?

82
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,985
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

83
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,030
What's that smell?

84
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,115
Do I smell?

85
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,117
You fucking reek.

86
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,954
Did you say I smell?

87
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,624
Huh?

88
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,876
Shit. Did you say I smell?

89
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,544
You smell like shit!

90
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,339
Goddamn it! Hey!

91
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,009
-How dare you yell at me?
-Damn it!

92
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,569
Where's your wheelchair?

93
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,196
I'll go get it.

94
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,620
Are you really not going to say anything?

95
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,705
How are you gonna stay at my house?

96
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,376
Hey, did that guy take your wheelchair?

97
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,003
How did you know?

98
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,755
GI-EUN

99
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,057
-Are you the owner of this phone?
-Yes.

100
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,727
Miss, this is Princess Snacks.
You can pick it up here.

101
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,855
When did you get the phone, and from whom?

102
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,482
A customer left it here.

103
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,900
Did they say anything?

104
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,610
Not really.

105
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,197
A tall guy gave it to you, right?

106
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,615
I don't know.

107
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,661
Right, I'm going on a trip,
so you'll have to come in a few days.

108
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,413
Okay, I understand.

109
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,540
I can't be bothered anymore,
so hang up now.

110
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,791
Damn it.

111
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,128
What are you doing?

112
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,131
LOADING

113
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,930
THIS ID HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED

114
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,142
What is it?

115
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,977
Damn it.

116
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,901
So you met the bastard on Somebody.

117
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,742
Go to the police.

118
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,162
-Tell them what happened.
-Then what?

119
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,957
Should I tell my boss
that I met him on Somebody?

120
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,502
Then Eun-pyeong will go
look for that jerk?

121
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,549
You might as well tell me
to go to work naked.

122
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,263
Give me her number.

123
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,142
Kim Sum. Give me her number.

EULJIRO 4TH DISTRICT

125
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,615
-You fought and won.
-Yes, I won.

126
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,870
This is what you call "working hard."

127
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,041
All right, everyone. Did you enjoy it?

128
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,126
-Yes.
-Yes.

129
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,462
Do you know who he is?

130
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,797
-Sure.
-We know him well.

131
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,840
Ah, really?

132
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,219
In the past,
when this shopping center was booming,

133
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,890
I heard this place did so well
that it got crowded to the point

134
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,060
that you had to climb over people
to move around.

135
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,481
I was hoping you could tell me
about your experiences

136
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,815
from back then.

00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,296
So you're Kim Sum.

144
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,797
Where is Gi-eun?

145
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,841
But

146
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,176
why did you bring a knife?

147
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,221
-A knife?
-Oh, it's a small one.

148
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,684
No matter how small it is,
don't bring stuff like that next time.

149
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,354
The General can sniff it out right away.

150
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,482
My divine powers strengthen
when there's a knife around.

151
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,654
Are you a shaman?

152
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,700
Follow me.

153
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,400
Kim Sum.

154
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,920
Find me a person on Somebody.

155
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,008
Can you?

156
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,593
No.

157
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,184
-What are you doing?
-Hey.

158
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:10,105
I almost died
because of some jerk I met on Somebody.

159
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,273
His ID is "wheel me,"

160
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,818
and his profile picture is a wheelchair.

161
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:16,945
Fuck.

162
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,864
I get pissed just thinking
about the wheelchair.

163
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,077
Get me his information
if you want to know more, Kim Sum.

164
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,248
You never called me "Kim Sum" before.

165
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,834
You curse more now.

166
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,752
What a filthy mouth.

167
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,217
I can't give you personal information
from Somebody. You know that.

168
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,220
But you didn't die.

169
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,765
That's a relief. I'm really glad.

170
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,394
Forget it.

171
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,148
If you won't help, just go.
I'll take care of it myself.

172
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,197
Thanks…

173
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,493
for coming today.

174
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,079
You're right.

175
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,457
I came to a place like this
for the first time just for you.

176
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,709
You should be thankful.

177
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,604
You two need to meet again.

178
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,551
Going up.

179
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,756
Your house is gone. Your old house.

180
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:43,967
Yeah.

181
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,760
Did your dad build a new one?

182
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,846
Yeah.

183
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,810
It must be easier
to move around in a wheelchair.

184
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,719
Gi-eun!

185
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,527
Oh, you got here quick, Sum.

186
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,575
Look at all these packages, Gi-eun.

187
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,245
Did you two talk?

188
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,499
Nice to be together
after a long time, right?

189
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,588
Mok-won.

190
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:04,923
Yeah.

191
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,696
Are you happy to be back at work?

192
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,616
Yeah.

193
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,373
But still, telling a friend
with an injured back

194
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,375
that she wasn't trying hard enough…

195
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,502
That was way too harsh.

196
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,089
It's true. She wasn't trying hard enough.

197
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,968
She wasn't doing her rehab properly,

198
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,763
and all she did was lie in bed,
not even thinking of going back to work.

199
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:58,351
Sometimes, it's just better to stand by
and watch over someone.

200
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,645
That can be comforting.

201
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,152
Cheers.

202
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:12,907
Hey.

203
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,587
I didn't have anyone to tell me that.

204
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,175
Because it was always you who did.

205
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,848
After what happened,
you didn't even want to talk to me.

206
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,811
I'm sorry, Gi-eun.

207
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,105
I didn't know. That's why I was like that.

208
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,036
Cheers.

209
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,497
Cheers.

210
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,541
Cheers.

211
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,183
I'm coming.

212
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,859
Ta-da.

213
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,572
So what happened?

214
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,158
-Huh?
-See?

215
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,993
I told you she'd be curious and come back.

216
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,331
Hey.

217
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,708
-Do you want to know?
-Yeah.

218
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,580
You've gotten better!

219
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,250
Gosh, you horny girls.

220
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,543
Mok-won.

221
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,711
Seriously.

222
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,548
-What?
-Gosh.

223
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,342
It didn't end well,

224
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:41,597
but I'm happy to hear
you had a fling with someone.

225
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,891
Remember how you told me

226
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,935
to put it to use?

227
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,647
How did it feel to put it to use?

228
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:56,237
If his profile picture was a wheelchair,
was he disabled too?

229
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,447
Then how did you guys do it?

230
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,284
Could he use the muscles in his back?
Because you can't.

231
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,661
Or did you just use your hands?

232
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,960
You want to know how we had sex?

233
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,928
He was in a wheelchair,

234
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,723
but he wasn't disabled.

235
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,851
He was probably over 190 centimeters tall.

236
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,645
And he had wide shoulders.

237
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,356
But why was he in a wheelchair?
To trick you?

238
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,359
No, it's not like
he was trying to trick me.

239
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,613
I guess he wanted
to share a bond with me somehow.

240
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,449
I kind of liked him.

241
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:47,455
But I guess he thought he would startle me
if he approached me first.

242
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:52,460
He must have thought
my body would crumble or something.

243
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,462
So he didn't really know what to do.

244
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,548
But his hand on my waist

245
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,800
was so soft.

246
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,220
Oh, I love guys with soft hands.

247
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,139
So one by one,

248
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,725
he held my waist,

249
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,394
then my shoulders,

250
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,981
touched my face like this,

251
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:18,152
and slowly went down to my breasts--

252
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:22,365
But how did he touch all of them
at the same time?

253
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,450
Is he Shiva? Does he have four arms?

254
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,451
Hey.

255
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:29,080
At that moment,
he wasn't one but two Shivas.

256
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,373
Like, oh!

257
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,632
All I had to do was stay in his arms.

258
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:43,261
Jeez, I can see you two are tight as hell.

259
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,846
Yeah, we've always been tight as hell.

260
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,308
I was so turned on.

261
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,271
It was as if all of the cells in my body
were lighting up.

262
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,440
So…

263
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,111
that's when we got down for real.

264
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,320
How?

265
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:03,906
"Take…

266
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,742
my panties off."

267
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,330
"I want you…

268
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,208
to eat me out."

269
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,879
And just like that, he slowly touched

270
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,132
my breasts,

271
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:22,925
waist,

272
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,552
legs…

273
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,607
Well…

274
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,404
that would've been nice.

275
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,783
But he didn't get hard.

276
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,578
At all? Nothing?

277
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,288
Nope.

278
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,417
So I tried my best.

279
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,629
I tried hard.

280
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,673
But it didn't work.

281
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,845
I've never seen a flaccid penis.

282
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,057
Is it like Michelangelo's David?

283
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,610
It would have been nice if it ended there…

284
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,490
but that jerk threw away my wheelchair.

285
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,452
That's why I'm looking for him.

286
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,385
How do you feel toward her?

287
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,597
What do you mean?

288
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,268
I don't understand why you lied to her.

289
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,608
Is it fun to tease her like that?

290
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,151
You're funny.

291
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,613
Well,

292
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,990
she's your best friend.

293
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:16,372
But you didn't tell her
what exactly happened.

294
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,208
I won't ask you about it anymore.

295
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:23,379
Just let me know if you ever need help.

296
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,763
But

297
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,892
isn't it a shaman's job
to know without being told?

298
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,990
I mopped the floor today.

299
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,201
SOMEONE: NO WONDER IT FELT REFRESHING!
HAHAHA

300
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,705
Gi-eun is coming over to hang out.

301
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,461
DID YOU MAKE UP WITH GI-EUN?

302
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,089
YOU MISSED HER A LOT

303
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,049
Yeah.

304
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,885
And on Somebody,

305
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,971
I met someone with Asperger's.

306
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,184
DO YOU HAVE ASPERGER'S?

307
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,230
I'M A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT, AND IT FEELS
LIKE I HAVE A KNIFE STUCK IN MY HEART

308
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,238
I KNOW… I USED TO WANT TO KILL EVERYONE
WHO REACTED NEGATIVELY TOWARD ME

309
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,575
I LIKE READING, SO I KEPT TO MYSELF.
IT HELPS ME FORGET EVERYTHING.

310
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,246
It felt like looking at myself
ten years ago.

311
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,249
WHEN YOU MADE ME?

312
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,167
Yeah!

313
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,420
I want to help that person.

314
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,635
ECCENTRIC CHILD, THE GIRL WITH ASPERGER'S

315
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,472
Do you know the book called
Eccentric Child, The Girl with Asperger's?

316
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,433
I was into that book in high school.

317
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,519
I feel at ease when I read it.

318
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,110
If you need it, let me know.

319
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,363
I'll lend it to you.

320
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,414
I'm actually a fund manager.

321
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,625
If I took out a loan…

322
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,463
The thing is,
I want to get married to my girl.

323
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,342
You risked your destiny,
but she only risked her love.

324
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,237
I'm not sure.

325
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,323
I don't know
if you'll have a chance this time.

326
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,744
The General has nothing to say.

327
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,331
Let's see your fortune with your blood.

328
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,417
Let's see.

329
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,491
Your fortune carries no more wealth.

330
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,201
Damn it.

331
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,836

335
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,939
Excuse me, I'm here to pick up a phone.

336
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,941
Oh, the phone. Hold on.

337
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,327
I don't use cash.

338
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,249
Three thousand, three…

339
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,796
Here.

340
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,177
When did you get this?

341
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,845
I'm not sure.

342
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,937
I'm so hungry.

343
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,355
Can I get ten rolls of gimbap…

344
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,316
to go?

345
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,777
Sure!

346
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,243
So, when did you get this?

347
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,163
It's been about five days?

348
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,002
Did you pick it up on the street?

349
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,171
Did someone else find it
and leave it here?

350
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,884
I don't pick things up
because I can't be bothered.

351
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:33,397
If the redevelopment proceeds,
the impact would be tremendous…

352
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,733
-Jeez. Ms. Hong!
-Goodness!

353
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,317
Give us budae jjigae and somaek.

354
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,986
-I'm here!
-Hey!

355
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,821
-So hungry.
-Why are there so few customers?

356
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,823
Is today a good day or a bad day?

357
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,284
Both.

358
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,746
I wish someone would negotiate
with the Merchants Association.

359
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,081
Things aren't working out.

360
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,916
-Take your gimbap.
-It's frustrating.

365
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,274
I sent 300,000 instead of 30,000.

366
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,985
There's nothing we can do.

367
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,862
Let's say I paid in advance.

368
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,031
I'll come by and eat often, so keep track.

369
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,132
Yeong Gi-eun.

370
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,843
I got your phone.

371
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,637
Thank you.

372
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,889
Gi-eun.

373
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,224
Yes.

374
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,315
Did you meet anyone there?

375
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,109
I met no one.

376
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,612
There was just a lady with red lipstick.

377
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,658
But the owner lady didn't seem
to know anything, either.

378
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,160
Old ladies don't like you, that's why.

379
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,579
You little…

380
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,295
THE PHONE IS STARTING…

381
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:27,177
PRINCESS SNACKS

382
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,304
Ma'am, I'm hungry.

383
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,140
-Do you know what time it is?
-Come on.

384
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,727
Just eat whatever I give you then.

385
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,396
Sure, as long as it's not dog food.

386
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:41,984
Hey,

387
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,902
is this the guy?

388
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,115
The guy who left the phone
is eating here right now.

389
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,283
Jackpot, right?

390
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,493
Is this from your lookout guy?

391
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,411
Yeah.

392
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,872
I think it is him.

393
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,083
I wish I could see his face a little more.

394
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,084
Give it.

395
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,045
-Let's call him.
-Okay.

396
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,130
CALLING
79NEW MONEY

397
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,568
Your call is not connected…

398
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,904
Is he crazy? Seriously.

399
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,157
Jeez, I'll have to go now.

400
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,284
What bullshit is this? Your food's ready.

401
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,369
I'm sorry. How much is it?

402
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,372
79NEW MONEY

403
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:39,917
Hello?

404
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,338
Come on, General, why do you keep calling?
I sent you the picture.

405
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,006
Are you sure it's him?

406
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,883
Yes. The owner lady told him

407
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,510
that a young lady took
the phone last week.

408
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,096
But I can't see his face clearly.

409
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,140
Take a better picture of his face.

410
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,141
His face?

411
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,895
Damn, he looked like a strong dude.

412
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,229
Hey.

413
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,231
You better take the picture.

414
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,275
Eyes, nose, mouth, everything.

415
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,779
Do you know how many talismans
I wrote to fix your fortune?

416
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,033
All right, General. Yes.

417
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,900
Ouch, hey!

418
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,283
-Fuck.
-Mister…

419
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,202
-Who are you?
-Wait.

420
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,620
It's not what you think.

421
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:02,332
Can you let go first?

422
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,419
-Your phone.
-Pardon?

423
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,005
Give me your phone.

424
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,840
Yes, here you go.

425
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,199
Hello? Yes, General!

426
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,120
Jeez, the bastard stuffed himself
and left already.

427
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,204
Where did he go?

428
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,873
Hey,

429
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:46,043
I'll be on the lookout starting today,
so don't you worry.

430
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,462
Yes. Goodbye.

431
00:52:55,338 --> 00:53:00,343
