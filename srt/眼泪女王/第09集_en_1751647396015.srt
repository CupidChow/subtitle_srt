1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay.

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,480
Something's off.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,920
What is?

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,880
I came here because they said

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,480
this is the best date course.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,920
Why isn't anyone here?

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,360
I know. There's no one.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's go.

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,760
The music...

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
is a bit...

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
What?

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,020
Why isn't the music...

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,860
Usually,

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,160
this is the song of a bright and cheerful mermaid.

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,200
Isn't it?

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,800
I think it's a bit sticky.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Hey, change the music.

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,840
I changed it to a playlist that calls for love.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
The music changed.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
The music changed.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
It does.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,840
It's really interesting.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Ms. Hong Haeyoon,

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
I think the whole universe

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,840
is helping us to be together.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Even when we go to a famous restaurant,

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
we end up being together.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,840
When we went to the amusement park last time,

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,840
we were in the same place.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
We were in the same place.

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
We were in the same place.

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
We were in the same place.

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
We were in the same place.

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
We were the only two of us.

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
I know.

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
That's why...

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
The whole universe is helping us.

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Do you...

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
want to get married?

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Yes.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Are you crying?

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
What are you sorry about?

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Do you really worry about me that much?

48
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Don't worry.

49
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
Baek Hyeonho.

50
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
I love you.

51
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
Baek Hyeonho.

52
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
I...

53
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
I don't want this to end.

54
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
I want this to continue.

55
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
I hope you don't know anything

56
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,840
and keep smiling at me.

57
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,840
I hope it continues.

58
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
What are you talking about?

59
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
I don't know you.

60
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Don't be surprised.

61
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
We went to Germany.

62
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
We went?

63
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
We got treated?

64
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
No.

65
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
We weren't in the condition to get treated.

66
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
I was in the hospital.

67
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
This is ridiculous.

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
How can I forget that?

69
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Why can't I remember anything?

70
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
It's so unfair to be sick.

71
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
People...

72
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,840
There are times when you forget

73
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
what you should remember even if you're not sick.

74
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
I was like that too.

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
I forgot everything.

76
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
What is it?

77
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
What happened?

78
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Did I forget something?

79
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Did I forget something?

80
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
I wrote a divorce letter

81
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
without telling you.

82
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
What?

83
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
You found out about it in Germany.

84
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
That's why we've been having a hard time lately.

85
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,840
So you were going to divorce me.

86
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
You were going to divorce me?

87
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Yes.

88
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
I knew about it?

89
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Yes.

90
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Liar.

91
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
If that's true,

92
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
your life can't be this normal.

93
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,840
You must have broken a bone or at least a eardrum.

94
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Hae In.

95
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Or do you want to break something?

96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

97
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
If you don't know, remember that.

98
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
I don't know what I did to you.

99
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,840
I don't know how much you hated me.

100
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
No.

101
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
I don't remember anything.

102
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Are you not going to do anything now?

103
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Then you're not going to sue me?

104
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
If you just divorce me,

105
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
I'm grateful.

106
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm not going to live with you in this situation.

107
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Don't lie to me.

108
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
I don't know what you're thinking.

109
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
Would I have been like that if I was a coward?

110
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
I could have stayed in the house

111
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,840
but I really didn't want to live with you.

112
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
When you said you were going to die in three months,

113
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
I thought I was alive.

114
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
If you endure three more months, you'll break up.

115
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
But if you don't do anything,

116
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,840
give up everything, and just divorce me,

117
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,840
I'm grateful.

118
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Will you do that for me?

119
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Haein.

120
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Stop it. I remember now.

121
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,840
I was such a terrible person to you.

122
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,840
I made your life miserable because of me.

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Why?

124
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
I thought you'd be comfortable

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
listening to the news about me getting married.

126
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
But after I tried it, it didn't work out.

127
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
You must have been really upset just now.

128
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
You didn't remember anything

129
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
and just watched me get angry.

130
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
What?

131
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Haein, that's not what I meant.

132
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
I was unhappy because of you too.

133
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
It's not just you.

134
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
I was too.

135
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
I can't just stand by you

136
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
for the rest of my life.

137
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Haein, wait.

138
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Let's stop now.

139
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Divorce.

140
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Divorce.

141
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Divorce.

142
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Divorce.

143
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Divorce.

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Divorce.

145
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Divorce.

146
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Divorce.

147
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Divorce.

148
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Divorce.

149
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Divorce.

150
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Divorce.

151
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Divorce.

152
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Divorce.

153
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Divorce.

154
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Divorce.

155
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Divorce.

156
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Divorce.

157
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Divorce.

158
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Divorce.

159
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Divorce.

160
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Divorce.

161
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
It's a divorce agreement.

162
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Why would you want to see me

163
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
when you're already divorced?

164
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Who's that lawyer?

165
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
I don't know.

166
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
No wonder he's a bit tough.

167
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
What's wrong with him?

168
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840
He's a bit...

169
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
He's a bit...

170
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
He's a bit...

171
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
He's a bit...

172
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
He's a bit...

173
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
He's a bit...

174
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840
He's a bit...

175
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
He's a bit...

176
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
He's a bit...

177
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
He's a bit...

178
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
He's a bit...

179
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
He's a bit...

180
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
He's a bit...

181
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
It must be him.

182
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
The lawyer of the divorce of Chairman Hong Hae-in.

183
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
So?

184
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
You really don't know anything.

185
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
He's very scary.

186
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
What's so scary about a lawyer?

187
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,840
There were a lot of things about his identity.

188
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
He was the youngest son of a rich family.

189
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
He was from a foreign army.

190
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
No, he was on a spaceship.

191
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
He wasn't a human being.

192
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
He was a wolf boy.

193
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
But his name is Vincenzo.

194
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
The real identity is...

195
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Please let me go.

196
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Please save me.

197
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
The new Pugin Entertainment City 772772.

198
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
The new Pugin Entertainment City 772772.

199
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Please save me.

200
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Please save me.

201
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840
It's the mafia.

202
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
The mafia?

203
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
The mafia from the mafia game?

204
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
The real mafia!

205
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
That's also a concillier.

206
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Boss!

207
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
I heard there was an Italian. Why did he come in?

208
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Hey, Vincenzo

209
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
doesn't talk when negotiating.

210
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
The secretary of the lawyer of the divorce of Chairman Hong Hae-in.

211
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
I'm not going to talk to you.

212
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,840
I think Chairman Hong changed his mind.

213
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
He won't forgive you.

214
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
You're the one who did it.

215
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
You're acting like you love him.

216
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
You're acting like you're a human being.

217
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
You?

218
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
So?

219
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
You want to kill him.

220
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Hae-in, please save me.

221
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Mr. Baek, the crime of you wanting to kill my client

222
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
is too big to be dealt with with a piece of paper.

223
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm sorry, but I...

224
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840
I ban evil from evil.

225
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,840
I'm not an evil.

226
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
Hae-in, Yang-gi did it.

227
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Yang-gi ordered it.

228
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Yang-gi...

229
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
I brought this.

230
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Shut up.

231
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Hey, can't I just go?

232
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,840
I have a grandchild.

233
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
You don't have a child.

234
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm sure you don't have a grandchild.

235
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Do whatever you want.

236
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
What I want to say first

238
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
is that I'm not here to negotiate.

239
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
That document is the official document

240
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
of the court, right?

241
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Yes.

242
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
If you look at it,

243
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
you said the main reason for the divorce

244
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
was the personality difference.

245
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840
You're a pervert.

246
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
You're a pervert.

247
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Isn't it the most normal

248
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
and okay?

249
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Look at you, Hae-in.

250
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
The first daughter is 3 years old.

251
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
The owner of a department store as soon as she was born.

252
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
She's the daughter of

253
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
the Anamu in various rumors.

254
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,840
The member of the Iljo Club.

255
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
She's not yet with the Iljo Club,

256
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
but it's hard to say

257
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
that she looks like a good person

258
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
in Korea.

259
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
The president of the Iljo Club

260
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
divorced Baek Hyeon-woo,

261
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,240
to divorce Baek Hyeonu, the director.

262
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,440
But the reason is the personality difference.

263
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,240
It seems like Chairman Hong

264
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
has a bad personality.

265
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,740
Yes.

266
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,240
Then what else can I say besides personality?

267
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,540
Do you have an alternative?

268
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Yes.

269
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,540
If you two had a busy schedule and had to...

270
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,740
I had to buy a house, but I was busy.

271
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,740
We decided to stay as good friends.

272
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,140
I don't think we can be friends.

273
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,340
We'll bless each other's future.

274
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,740
Wait.

275
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,140
I don't bless anyone.

276
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,140
From what I know,

277
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,240
no one else blesses anyone.

278
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,740
They just talk like this.

279
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,240
You can write whatever you want.

280
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,640
Really?

281
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,240
Won't you regret it?

282
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Yes.

283
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,640
Whatever you write,

284
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,440
it's not the real reason.

285
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,140
What?

286
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Why did Baek Hyeonu take the subway with a taxi

287
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,540
and a car on the ground?

288
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,540
I had a really tough day.

289
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,740
I had nowhere to go, so I took Line 2.

290
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,240
Why?

291
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,340
This is a gentle line,

292
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,240
so it's a roundabout route.

293
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,540
If you sit down and look at people,

294
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,340
you'll have more time.

295
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,040
If you turn around and the sun sets,

296
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,840
and you reach the Hapjeong Station from Dangsan Station,

297
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,840
you'll see the best sunset in Seoul.

298
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,440
Isn't it pretty?

299
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,940
If you look at that,

300
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,840
you'll see how upset I was today.

301
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,440
I'll forget everything

302
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,340
and just go home.

303
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,840
That's what I think.

304
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,140
I'll tell you

305
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,140
I love you

306
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,840
I love you

307
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,740
I love you

308
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,440
My whole heart

309
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,240
is with you

310
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,940
I miss you

311
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,640
Can you go somewhere else?

312
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,040
I had soup, went to the baseball game,

313
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,340
went to the car wash,

314
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,440
and I had soup again.

315
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
Is it good?

316
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,540
I had spicy pork soup.

317
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,840
I can't believe I'm doing this.

318
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,940
What's wrong?

319
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,040
Why are you running again?

320
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,040
You're running so fast.

321
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,140
What's wrong with you?

322
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,140
Geez.

323
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,740
Everyone runs like that.

324
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,540
Why is she running alone?

325
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,540
Is this fun?

326
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Is it fun?

327
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,140
What's wrong?

328
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,440
Two rice balls and a bottle of soju.

329
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Okay.

330
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,140
I'll bring it to you.

331
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,440
Okay. Thank you.

332
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,940
I had soup, went to the game, and had soju.

333
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,940
What?

334
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,540
I had soup, went to the game, and had soju.

335
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,140
You had soup, went to the game, and had soju.

336
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,240
Okay.

337
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,740
You couldn't eat the soup because your wife didn't like it.

338
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,540
But you ate what you wanted.

339
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,640
There's a good thing about divorce.

340
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,140
Just think of the good things.

341
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,040
Look.

342
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,740
You don't have to worry about

343
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,140
anyone following you around anymore.

344
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,940
You used to run when your mother-in-law called you

345
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,640
even when you were drinking with your friends.

346
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,540
You used to run when your mother-in-law called you.

347
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,240
That's why you didn't eat with your friends

348
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
and always ate alone.

349
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,540
I know everything,

350
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,240
but I just wanted to live like that.

351
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,140
What's wrong with you?

352
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,740
Why do you want to live like that?

353
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,340
Are you a Stockholm resident?

354
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,940
I don't know.

355
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,140
I just...

356
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,340
I just wanted to live like that next to you.

357
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,140
This is the medicine you asked for.

358
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,740
I'll send you an email,

359
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,740
but it's a drug for malignant nerve tumor treatment.

360
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,840
It's like a anti-cancer drug.

361
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,740
Are you sure?

362
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,140
Yes, I'm sure.

363
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,940
Mom!

364
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,940
Mom!

365
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,140
Mom!

366
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,440
Mom!

367
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,940
Mom!

368
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,540
Mom!

369
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,940
Mom!

370
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,340
Mom!

371
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,740
Mom!

372
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,340
Mom!

373
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,140
Hey!

374
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,940
Hey!

375
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,840
Hey, hey, hey!

376
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,340
Hey!

377
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,840
You punk!

378
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,740
What are you going to do if you hurt my dog?

379
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,440
Are you crazy?

380
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,640
You little punk!

381
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Do you know how expensive this dog is?

382
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,840
What are you talking about?

383
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,040
Stop it.

384
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,240
You almost got bitten by a dog.

385
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
What are you?

386
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,840
How can we educate our kids here?

387
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Ms. Han!

388
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,040
Hyein.

389
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,340
Grandpa.

390
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
Are you okay, Hyein?

391
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,340
Are you hurt?

392
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,340
You're the chairman.

393
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,040
You're the granddaughter.

394
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,240
I'm sorry for the surprise.

395
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,140
Are you okay?

396
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,940
Let's go to the hospital first.

397
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,940
Oh, my gosh.

398
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,240
Thank you.

399
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,940
Director Oh, I don't think Hyein is home yet.

400
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,740
Where is she?

401
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,640
The chairman told me to go in first.

402
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,040
I dropped her off in front of the elementary school.

403
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,840
You should've seen where she was going.

404
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,240
She keeps going around alone and missing her way.

405
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,140
Then the appointment I made will change.

406
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,140
I'm sorry.

407
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,640
Why are you so late?

408
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,240
Why did you take a taxi?

409
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
I had to stop by to listen to the press conference.

410
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,340
Wait.

411
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,940
Are you going to keep working here?

412
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,240
You're uncomfortable with each other.

413
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm fine with it, but I don't want to quit.

414
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,940
He's the one who needs the company.

415
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,740
The one who needs your company...

416
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,540
Is me.

417
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,340
The one who needs you...

418
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
Is me.

419
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,340
Do I still have to prove that?

420
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,240
I was going to set up a meeting and talk about it,

422
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,340
but I'll just say it.

423
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,240
I've thought about it a lot,

424
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,340
but I'm going to give up

425
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
working at the company.

426
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
What?

427
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
I know you've been working hard for me,

428
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
and I'm grateful.

429
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
But Chairman Haerim was going to sign a contract

430
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,740
with our department store not because of me,

431
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,640
but because of the cards you have.

432
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,640
I wanted to use them before I could,

433
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,440
so I came here.

434
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,140
That's why I'm here.

435
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,640
Do you know how I've lived to become someone

436
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,140
you can use?

437
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,840
Do I have to know?

438
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,240
Haeyoon, even if you choose to work at Herkine,

439
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,340
I won't accept any cards from you.

440
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,040
I just wanted to show you that

441
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,940
I can do anything for you

442
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,640
that no one else can.

443
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,140
I guess I'm the one who got divorced

444
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,640
because you kept talking about this to me.

445
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Listen carefully.

446
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,340
I didn't get divorced to give you a chance.

447
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,640
I married you because I liked Baek Hyeonu,

448
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
who always wanted to be with me.

449
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,640
I got divorced because I felt sorry

450
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,940
for the person who had a hard time being with me.

451
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,640
Even if I get everything you have right now,

452
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,140
can you still say such a bitter thing?

453
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
What?

454
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Do you still

455
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,640
not need me?

456
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,140
Haeyoon, you're finally here.

457
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Anyway, you've worked hard, ma'am.

458
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,140
You were my

459
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,140
butler.

460
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,640
But you can't just leave me.

461
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,140
Why can't you just quit your job?

462
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,640
You should quit.

463
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,140
Mom, I can beat other guys,

464
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,640
but I can't beat my head.

465
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,640
What are you talking about?

466
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
I'm not going to lose to you.

467
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,640
I'm going to win.

468
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,140
I'm going to win.

469
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
I'm going to win.

470
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,640
I went out quietly with my hands empty,

471
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,140
but I'm going to touch it and

472
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,640
use the data I didn't get

473
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,640
to fill out the complaint.

474
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,140
But the legal director is an important position,

475
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,140
isn't it a shame to stay?

476
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,140
Of course.

477
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,640
So you should get it done quickly.

478
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,140
Oh, my. Why is she calling?

479
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,140
You have a guest. I'm glad.

480
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,140
Mom, what's going on?

481
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,640
I'm talking about the hair of a female politician.

482
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,140
Do me a favor.

483
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
What?

484
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,140
When you apologize to the people,

485
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,140
you can feel sorry for them

486
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
from your hair,

487
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,140
but you can't feel it too much.

488
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,640
That's not true.

489
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,140
You know what?

490
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,140
You work and work and work and work.

491
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,140
Oh, really?

492
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,140
Yes.

493
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,140
You need to have a good head to live.

494
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,140
I talked to the lady last time

495
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
and she was really upset.

496
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,140
Marriage is the most important promise in life.

497
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,140
How upset would Hyein be?

498
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,140
How upset would the old men be?

499
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,140
I must have raised the wrong son.

500
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,140
I'm so sorry.

501
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,140
Did you plan this?

502
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,140
What?

503
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,140
Did your son do this?

504
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,140
Did you think it would benefit

505
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,140
the financial division?

506
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,140
What?

507
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,140
Are you sure this isn't being recorded?

508
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,140
You can't use the recording data

509
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,140
that the other party doesn't have.

510
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,140
Record?

511
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,140
How would I know?

512
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,140
Why?

513
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,140
Your son is a good son.

514
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
Is it from Hyeonho?

515
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,140
Yes.

516
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,140
He installed a recording machine in your room.

517
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,140
I don't know if he was trying to sell the recording file

518
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,140
or to get the divorce papers.

519
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,140
What did Hyeonho do?

520
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,140
Did he do that?

521
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,140
He said no.

522
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
That doesn't mean it's true.

523
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,140
Does it matter now whether it's true or not?

524
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,140
They got divorced.

525
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,140
You still don't know?

526
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,140
That's why there are lives

527
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,140
that shouldn't be put in one basket.

528
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,140
They'll both break and get ruined.

529
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,140
That's why I was against it.

530
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,140
Even if you were against it,

531
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,140
you both had a good time

532
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,140
as much as you wanted to marry Kihyun.

533
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,140
What?

534
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,140
I've lived my life too.

535
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,140
Even if life seems long,

536
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,140
I don't have much time to shine so brightly.

537
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,140
So?

538
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,140
Even if the end was so bad,

539
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,140
I hope our children can enjoy

540
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,140
the time they spend together

541
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,140
and not be hurt by it.

542
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,140
That's a good idea.

543
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,140
They seem to have already agreed.

544
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,140
So you shouldn't make up things

545
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,140
that will make you want to rip off even more.

546
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,140
And if possible,

547
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,140
tell the companies to stop.

548
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,140
What is it?

549
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,140
You're being so stubborn.

550
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,140
I hope we never see each other again.

551
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,140
Bye.

552
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,140
The person you have called...

553
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,140
My gosh.

554
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,140
You didn't say you were meeting someone?

555
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,140
If she had that much of a belly,

556
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,140
and had a hair, and went to Seoul,

557
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,140
wouldn't she be a rich lady?

558
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
Why didn't you answer my call?

559
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Mom is coming. Mom!

560
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,140
Mom.

561
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,140
I gave her so much money,

562
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,140
but she's dead.

563
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
Go. Go and talk to her.

564
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,140
Grandma.

565
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,140
My baby. My baby.

566
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,140
My baby. My baby.

567
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
You're still here?

568
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
Yes.

569
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,140
I bought slippers because my feet hurt.

570
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,140
It's okay.

571
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,140
I was worried about your call.

572
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,140
What about dinner?

573
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,140
I'll order.

574
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,140
Hey, you get the Chinese food.

575
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,140
No, thanks. I have to eat.

576
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,140
What Chinese food?

577
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
Where should I order?

578
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,140
No, I don't want to.

579
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,140
I'm too busy to eat.

580
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,140
When?

581
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,140
These are the names of the customers

582
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,140
who purchased the 101st anniversary edition.

583
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,140
There's only one Korean customer.

584
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,140
I'm sorry.

585
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
You're the chairman, right?

586
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,140
Where's the buyer?

587
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,140
Chairman Gan, the owner of the 5th Menata.

588
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,140
It's a men's watch.

589
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,140
Who did you give it to?

590
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,140
About two or three times a week?

591
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,140
Sometimes, he goes somewhere without my car.

592
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,140
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,140
I'm fine.

594
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,140
I didn't bump into anyone.

595
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
Was it a coincidence?

596
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,140
No.

597
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,140
He followed me to the car

598
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,140
that was in front of the company.

599
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,140
It's a drug for malignant nerve tumor.

600
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,140
It's like a anti-cancer drug.

601
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
Yes, I'm sure.

602
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,140
Is anyone around you sick?

603
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
Hello?

604
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,140
Mr. Min?

605
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,140
I'm sorry.

606
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,140
I reported to you

607
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,140
about where you go and who you meet.

608
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
You told me to look up the ingredients

609
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
while giving me the drug.

610
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,140
I found out through a friend of mine.

611
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,140
I'm really sorry.

612
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,140
Why are you trying to find out?

613
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
You're not my husband anymore.

614
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,140
You're a stranger. What does it have to do with you?

615
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,140
If you follow in her footsteps,

616
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
I'll follow in her footsteps too.

617
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,140
If you try to do something to her,

618
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
I'll do something too.

619
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
I'll do that.

620
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,140
You must want to protect her.

621
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
Do whatever you want.

622
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,140
I'll end up by her side.

623
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,140
You'll find out soon enough.

624
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Min.

625
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,140
Did the family all leave for a private trip?

626
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
Or did they leave early?

627
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,140
They all left for a private trip.

628
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,140
When I graduated from college,

629
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
my parents passed away too.

630
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,140
I don't have a family in the US or Korea.

631
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,140
Yes?

632
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Eunsung.

633
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,140
Why didn't you call me?

634
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,140
I was in a rush.

635
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,140
I got a call from Mr. Na.

636
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,140
What? Why?

637
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,140
Because of the military issue.

638
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,140
The military unit near the resort.

639
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,140
The military unit?

640
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,140
What did I say?

641
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,140
I'm done talking about moving the unit.

642
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,140
If it stays like that,

643
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,140
we can't build the hotel high because of the laser.

644
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,140
They said the move was cancelled.

645
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,140
What?

646
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,140
Why did you say you were moving the unit?

647
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,140
I said we were moving the unit,

648
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,140
but the Ministry of Defense said it was too expensive

649
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,140
and that it would be completely abandoned.

650
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,140
If the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Land and Land

651
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
are together, will the Ministry of Defense win?

652
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,140
I'm not sure.

653
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,140
The Ministry of Defense must win.

654
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,140
We need to call the head of the Ministry of Defense.

655
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,140
I'm on the phone. Just text me.

656
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
I'm in trouble if he does this to me.

657
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
Yes.

658
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
Yes, I understand.

659
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,140
What?

660
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,140
Did you call me?

661
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,140
Yes.

662
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,140
I'm sorry.

663
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
I'm sorry.

664
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,140
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,140
I'm sorry.

666
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,140
I'm sorry.

667
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,140
I'm sorry.

668
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,140
I'm sorry.

669
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,140
I'm sorry.

670
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,140
I'm sorry.

671
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
I'm sorry.

672
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
The head of the Ministry of Land and Land

673
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,140
is calling.

674
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
Don't you know how to do ad-libs?

675
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,140
I just saw him calling his grandfather

676
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,140
and refusing him for the first time.

677
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,140
If you're tired of this, call him.

678
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,140
What if he says he understands?

679
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,140
Maeyoung.

680
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
Where is Maeyoung?

681
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Maeyoung.

682
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,140
Maeyoung,

683
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
how hard have you been?

684
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
What is it?

685
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
I heard that all the employees

686
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,140
are wearing the same clothes.

687
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,140
You could have put divorce papers in the gold box.

688
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,140
Is that the fault of the person who wrote it?

689
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,140
It's the fault of the person who saw it.

690
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,140
What is it?

691
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,140
Something bad happened.

692
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,140
What?

693
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,140
The military should have transferred the money

694
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,140
so that people could come to the resort

695
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,140
and ride the high-speed elevator,

696
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
go up to the Sky Lounge, eat steak and wine,

697
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
and watch the stars on the infinity pool.

698
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,140
But they won't transfer the money.

699
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,140
I told you to check the land quality.

700
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,140
I did.

701
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,140
Did Maeyoung do that?

702
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,140
But then,

703
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,140
CEO Yoon Eunseong brought rice cakes

704
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,140
and was talking nonsense,

705
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,140
so I quickly got him.

706
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,140
Okay. Let's get rid of the person who brought the rice cakes.

707
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,140
He's from America.

708
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
He didn't even go to the army.

709
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,140
How can you talk about the military with him?

710
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,140
On the other hand, Maeyoung is from the Marine Corps.

711
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,140
It's not just the Marine Corps.

712
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,140
It's the Special Guards.

713
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,140
See?

714
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,140
I came to you because you're so special.

715
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,140
I'm sorry.

716
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,140
Please protect me.

717
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
Honey!

718
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,140
What?

719
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,140
What are you doing there?

720
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,140
I just got a card.

721
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,140
This is a 2000-pc card, but the last piece is gone.

722
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,140
That's a big deal!

723
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,140
If the military has built a large-scale complex resort,

724
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,140
the Queen's Group, which threw a fire in the night market,

725
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
has been hit by an evil plan.

726
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,140
According to the front-line map of the military,

727
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,140
the resort's height is limited to 180m.

728
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,140
In this case, the high-rise hotel we planned to build

729
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,140
should be lowered to 39 floors below the original.

730
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,140
The hotel's expected revenue will be significantly reduced.

731
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,140
Investors are requesting an early investment...

732
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
Soonchul, are you still on the phone?

733
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,140
Yes.

734
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,140
I think he's busy trying to solve his problem.

735
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,140
You shouldn't cause trouble.

736
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Is this the time to solve your problem?

737
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,140
How can you be the one who's less in trouble?

738
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,140
What?

739
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,140
Darn it.

740
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,140
Oh, you're all here.

741
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,140
Why aren't you answering your phone?

742
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,140
I came here myself.

743
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,140
I brought my solution.

744
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,140
What is this?

745
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,140
I looked up information about

746
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,140
a long-range mobile radar near the base.

747
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,140
It was introduced in 1994

748
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,140
and was old-fashioned, so it needed maintenance.

749
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,140
It has a 60% chance of working,

750
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,140
and the safety test was approved last year.

751
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,140
Then the government will get a compensation

752
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,140
and start getting it this summer.

753
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,140
How about we build a construction

754
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,140
that raises the base height during the time

755
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,140
when we get the radar?

756
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,140
Pardon?

757
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,140
The radar base is 180m

758
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,140
and the hotel is 350m.

759
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
But if we build a concrete structure

760
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,140
that's 170m above the base

761
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,140
and raise the base height,

762
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,140
the problem will be solved.

763
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,140
You're doing your best, sir.

764
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,140
You're smart, Baek Hyonho.

765
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,140
I suggested the direction

766
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,140
and you just submitted the documents.

767
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,140
I'm a bit of a wimp.

768
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,140
Is it just me?

769
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,140
Why isn't anyone listening to me?

770
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,140
Anyway, meet the investors

771
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,140
and explain the situation.

772
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,140
Of course.

773
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,140
They'll all be very relieved.

774
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,140
Did you not hear me?

775
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,140
The problem is solved.

776
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,140
But I don't understand why you're trying to

777
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,140
take out the investment.

778
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,140
I heard Chairman Hong's financial support

779
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,140
is under arrest.

780
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,140
The prosecution is investigating.

781
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
Well...

782
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,140
Why didn't you tell me

783
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,140
that it's important?

784
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,140
If my lawyer hadn't told you,

785
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,140
you would've been in deep trouble.

786
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,140
If it's your lawyer,

787
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,140
did you hear it from Apollo?

788
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,140
You came up with a good scenario.

789
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,140
The chairman's financial support is under arrest.

790
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,140
There's no company to invest in.

791
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,140
AOMG New Beijing Entertainment City

792
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,140
772772

793
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,140
The most exciting PG game on the line.

794
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,140
The mahjong is over.

795
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,140
The mahjong is over 2.

796
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,140
The prize-winning queen.

797
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,140
The treasure-hunting golden city.

798
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,140
The talented cat.

799
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,140
The prize-winning captain.

800
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,140
The super high odds.

801
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,140
The reward rate is high.

802
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,140
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

803
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,140
Hurry up and join.

804
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,140

772772

806
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,140
If you want to take revenge,

807
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,140
why don't you do it to me?

808
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,140
If all the investors fall,

809
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
is this project over?

810
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,140
Oh, I...

811
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,140
Why is it over?

812
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,140
What?

813
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,140
It's the beginning.

814
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,140
Brother...

815
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,140
No way...

816
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,140
Excuse me, sir.

817
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,140
Please tell me this.

818
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,140
AOMG New Beijing Entertainment City

820
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,140
The most exciting PG game on the line.

821
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,140
I'll invest in Kaiwon Investment tomorrow.

822
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,140
I can't just do it alone.

823
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,140
Of course.

824
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,140
Investing is a must.

825
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,140
People who don't know anything

826
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,140
are always asking for a share.

827
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,140
When you're in love,

828
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,140
you can get the love of your life.

829
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,140
Yes, business is also a human thing.

830
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,140
I also think trust is the most important thing.

831
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,140
Are you really my soul mate?

832
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,140
I always say this.

833
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,140
Business is about the person.

834
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,140
I bet my life on you now.

835
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,140
Anyway, I'm sure you had a lot to say.

836
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,140
Thank you for making such a difficult decision.

837
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,140
Before you change your mind,

838
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,140
you should sign the contract first.

839
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,140
I'm sorry.

840
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,140
No, sir.

841
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,140
Sir!

842
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,140
Mr. Baek, what's going on?

843
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,140
Secretary Jang.

844
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,140
Mr. Baek,

845
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,140
we gave the board a draft of the investment contract

846
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,140
and it didn't seem to be delivered.

847
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,140
Please re-examine the whole situation.

848
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,140
If there's a problem with the owner risk,

849
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,140
6.7% of the board's shares

850
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,140
will be transferred to Mr. Yoon's fund.

851
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,140
We can't take this kind of action hastily.

852
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,140
Okay.

853
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,140
Mr. Baek!

854
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,140
Actually, what Mr. Baek said

855
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,140
is not completely wrong.

856
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,140
Father!

857
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Do as you please.

858
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,140
But I'll leave if the contract isn't approved today.

859
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,140
Trust is a one-sided thing.

860
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,140
I'll help you.

861
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,140
We have to make an important decision soon.

862
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,140
If someone wants to give you a lot of money

863
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,140
while you put it on the line,

864
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,140
don't hesitate and take it.

865
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,140
That's the way the chairman and this company will live.

866
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,140
Someone is trying to set a trap there.

867
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,140
He's the one who's going to stab you in the back

868
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,140
and he's going to kill you.

869
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,140
Gosh.

870
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,140
Listen to me carefully.

871
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,140
The last time you were in the hunting area,

872
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,140
you saved the chairman's life several times.

873
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,140
You're right.

874
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,140
What?

875
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,140
No.

876
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,140
Mr. Baek.

877
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,140
Yes?

878
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,140
I won't give up on a person.

879
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,140
I'll give you three chances.

880
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,140
But you betrayed my granddaughter,

881
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,140
set a record player in my room

882
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,140
and tried to ruin my job today.

883
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,140
So you're out.

884
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,140
Father.

885
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,140
Get out!

886
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,140
What?

887
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,140
What's wrong with the phone?

888
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,140
Go and get it.

889
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,140
Okay.

890
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,140
Director, you should come out.

891
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,140
Mr. Baek, please put your ID,

892
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,140
your phone, your laptop, and your tech equipment

893
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,140
in place and leave immediately.

894
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,140
It's time to go home.

895
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,140
What if you suddenly come and do this?

896
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,140
It's an order from the chairman.

897
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,140
Please leave.

898
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,140
Don't you need to be regulated?

899
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,140
Don't you need anything?

900
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,140
Is this your personal unit?

901
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,140
It's not working hours.

902
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,140
Please leave.

903
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,140
But it's an order from the chairman.

904
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,140
I told you to leave.

905
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,140
You should make a deal.

906
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,140
You should ask for a lot of money

907
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,140
on the condition of leaving the company.

908
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,140
Are you going to be so stupid to get kicked out?

909
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,140
I'm not getting kicked out.

910
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:39,140
You can do whatever you want as the chairman,

911
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,140
but I'm also the team leader of the legal team.

912
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,140
To get rid of the team leader,

913
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,140
you need to be just.

914
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,140
You've been trying to get rid of me through the audit room,

915
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,140
but you couldn't find a reason to do so.

916
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,140
That's...

917
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,140
Why do you have to endure it?

918
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,140
When do you want to run away and secretly

919
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,140
write a divorce papers and get kicked out?

920
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,140
Why do you have to endure it and get insulted like this?

921
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,140
When you live with me...

922
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,140
I know you had no choice,

923
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,140
but you don't have to do that anymore.

924
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,140
I know.

925
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,140
I'm doing it because I want to,

926
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,140
and I want to forget about it.

927
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,140
How are you?

928
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,140
I'm fine.

929
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,140
I'm fine.

930
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,140
Aunt.

931
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,140
You should do it, or I'll kick you out.

932
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,140
I'm fine.

933
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,140
Where are you?

934
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,140
At work?

935
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,140
At a club? At a bar?

936
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,140
Don't answer me one by one

937
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,140
whether you know or not.

938
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,140
There's no one to answer you.

939
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,140
There's only one answer.

940
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,140
Another woman.

941
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,140
Aunt.

942
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,140
The only woman I had was Hyein.

943
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,140
Then don't leave!

944
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,140
You're the only one for Hyein.

945
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,140
What if you leave?

946
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,140
I'm not going anywhere.

947
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,140
Where would I go leaving Hyein behind?

948
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,140
That's why I'm holding on to the company.

949
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,140
I'm sure Hyein will be by my side.

950
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:13,120
I'll find out who installed the

951
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,140
That part...

952
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,140
I'm a bit suspicious.

953
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,140
About Ms. Mo Suri?

954
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,140
How did you know?

955
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,140
Is there anyone who doesn't know

956
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,140
that your aunt hates her?

957
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,140
No.

958
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,140
She's scarier than you think.

959
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,140
She's been deceiving us for decades

960
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,140
by living with other people's relatives.

961
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,140
What do you mean?

962
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,140
Mo Suri's real name is Oh Soonyeong.

963
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,140
She had a son when she was Oh Soonyeong's age.

964
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,140
She's 30 now.

965
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,140
But Oh Soonyeong is a dead family.

966
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,140
What do you think?

967
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,140
It's no joke, right?

968
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,140
You should investigate with me.

969
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,140
I have a team member.

970
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,140
It's Conan.

971
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,140
You're the one, right?

972
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,140
How did you know?

973
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,140
I noticed that you looked very stubborn.

974
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,140
I see.

975
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,140
He's a half-asshole.

976
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,140
He's the one I raised.

977
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,140
Did you find out anything?

978
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,140
I met the prison officer at the prison

979
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,140
where Oh Soonyeong was arrested.

980
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,140
He was released from prison

981
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,140
and sent to a orphanage in Gangwon-do.

982
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,140
Where in Gangwon-do?

983
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,140
Gangwon-do...

984
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,140
Wonsan.

985
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,140
Wonsan is near the place where the rapist is?

986
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,140
Right? It's near our villa.

987
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,140
Yes, right around there.

988
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,140
The name of the orphanage is Hope Prison.

989
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,140
Hope?

990
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,140
That place?

991
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,140
My father and the rapist

992
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,140
even gave him a scholarship

993
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,140
for the charity event 10 years ago.

994
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,140
Hope was put out of fire 10 years ago.

995
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,140
I heard that the director passed away.

996
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,140
Do you know anyone else

997
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,140
who could be the newscaster?

998
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,140
I'm not sure.

999
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,140
Don't you know anyone?

1000
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,140
Who?

1001
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,140
The one who came with us last time?

1002
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,140
He said he'd buy us a dog.

1003
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,140
CEO Yoon Eunsung?

1004
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,140
Why are you saying that?

1005
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,140
Why? You said you looked like him.

1006
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,140
Who does CEO Yoon look like?

1007
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,140
He used to live in Hope Prison.

1008
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,140
He received a scholarship from Kinji Group

1009
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,140
and was smart.

1010
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,140
He took drugs from the neighborhood dog food

1011
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,140
and killed him and went to the police station.

1012
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,140
He looked a bit like him.

1013
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,140
Me?

1014
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,140
CEO Yoon said he went to America for a divorce.

1015
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,140
Yes, he did.

1016
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,140
He went to America for a divorce too.

1017
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,140
Is that the chairman?

1018
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,140
Who did he give it to?

1019
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,140
She's a scarier woman than you think.

1020
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,140
She's been deceiving us for decades

1021
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,140
by using other people's identities.

1022
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,140
She gave birth in a prison

1023
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,140
and sent her son to a orphanage in Gangwon-do.

1024
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,140
She went for a divorce.

1025
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,140
She was adopted into a Korean family at the age of 12.

1026
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,140
She gave birth to a son at the age of 50.

1027
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,140
She's 30 now.

1028
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,140
I don't have a family in Korea or the US.

1029
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,140
What?

1030
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,140
Why would you use this?

1031
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:19,140
Why would I be forced to take your right to a divorce?

1032
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,140
When a non-payment investigation comes in,

1033
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,140
it's hard to say that the woman

1034
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,140
stole the non-payment from you.

1035
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,140
Anyone can be a gold digger.

1036
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,140
Is that so?

1037
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,140
Look.

1038
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,140
I'm doing this for me.

1039
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:38,140
Aren't you going to do it for me?

1040
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,140
I should.

1041
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,140
It's your birthday today.

1042
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:45,140
Let's make this a birthday gift.

1043
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,140
Okay.

1044
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,140
Okay, let's make this my birthday gift.

1045
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,140
What?

1046
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,140
Why is the CEO of Yun Eunseong here?

1047
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,140
You should sit at the family table.

1048
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,140
I...

1049
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,140
I told you to do that.

1050
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,140
What?

1051
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,140
That's right.

1052
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,140
You don't even have a family.

1053
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,140
Why not?

1054
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,140
You're sitting at the table with your family.

1055
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,140
So?

1056
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:42,140
I'm saying that family isn't the only legal family.

1057
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,140
If you live under one roof...

1058
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,140
So?

1059
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:48,140
Do you think you might become a family too?

1060
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,140
Do you think so?

1061
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:51,140
No.

1062
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,140
Who says that?

1063
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,140
It's been a while since Hyein became like that.

1064
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,140
What would people do if she sat with another man?

1065
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,140
Wouldn't they think she's being reckless?

1066
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:03,140
Reckless?

1067
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,140
Did you just say that I'm reckless?

1068
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,140
Is that it?

1069
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,140
Or...

1070
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,140
I shouldn't be misunderstood.

1071
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,140
Who are you talking to?

1072
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,140
This house's owner is my sister.

1073
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,140
You're such a great lady.

1074
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,140
Fine.

1075
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,140
Let's not get involved in this.

1076
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,140
Why is this in her hands?

1077
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,140
It's mine, father!

1078
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,140
I told you I'd give it back to you

1079
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,140
if you were to be sulking all your life.

1080
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,140
How could you do that to me?

1081
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,140
Fine.

1082
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,140
Let go of this. I'll take it off.

1083
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:00,140
Father, why did you go so far?

1084
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:04,140
You only knew about work, but this is nothing.

1085
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,140
Can't you tell the difference in status?

1086
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,140
I'm the one who has to tell the difference in status!

1087
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,140
Who do you think you are?

1088
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,140
You're chasing after your big brother.

1089
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,140
You're treating your little brother like a fool.

1090
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,140
Look who's left beside you.

1091
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,140
You're waiting to suck up to your father's bone.

1092
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,140
You're the only one left!

1093
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,140
Watch your mouth!

1094
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,140
You're all just here to get caught

1095
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,140
by the police just in case they arrest you.

1096
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,140
This is the only person who's been here!

1097
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,140
I guess the prison isn't that scary.

1098
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,140
I've already been there.

1099
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,140
What? What nonsense!

1100
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,140
You don't know anything.

1101
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,140
I was going to tell you everything later,

1102
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:39,140
but this woman has been to prison and had a baby.

1103
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,140
She's been here to steal other people's names

1104
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,140
and their identities!

1105
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,140
Bum-ja, why are you doing this to me?

1106
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,140
I've lived without you,

1107
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:52,140
but I've been trying to live without doing anything bad.

1108
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:01,140
I'm sorry, but I can't take it anymore.

1109
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,140
I'll just leave.

1110
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,140
Hey, hey, hey.

1111
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,140
How dare you talk about her being out of her mind?

1112
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,140
It's only been two days.

1113
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,140
You better get a grip before you get your act together.

1114
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,140
Got it?

1115
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,140
A mental hospital?

1116
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,140
Then I'll have to do this.

1117
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,140
Let go of me.

1118
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,140
Let go of me.

1119
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,140
Let go of me.

1120
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,140
Let go of me.

1121
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,140
Let go of me.

1122
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,140
Father.

1123
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,140
You're so annoying.

1124
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:44,140
Your mom did her revenge.

1125
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,140
How could she torture me like this

1126
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,140
without your knowledge?

1127
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,140
Please, please.

1128
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,140
Please leave. Please leave!

1129
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,140
I will.

1130
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,140
If you kick out three of my children,

1131
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:05,140
I won't be able to face you.

1132
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,140
I'll leave on my own.

1133
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,140
Have a good birthday party today.

1134
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,140
I'll see you at the funeral.

1135
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:18,140
But please take care of Mansook, Father.

1136
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,140
What is this?

1137
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,780
Are all the

1138
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,140
money in the bankbook?

1139
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,140
I'm sure they are.

1140
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,140
I spent all my money on this.

1141
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,140
What about Yun Eunsung's?

1142
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,140
He worked hard.

1143
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,140
Mother.

1144
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,140
No.

1145
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,140
I'm not okay, Yun Eunsung.

1146
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,140
I was beaten by my father for the first time

1147
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,140
since I was born.

1148
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,140
My father beat me up.

1149
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,140
Yun Eunsung.

1150
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,140
I was so surprised by the surprise gift.

1151
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,140
What if my grandfather fainted?

1152
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,140
Don't overdo it.

1153
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,140
Just be calm.

1154
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,140
I've been too calm.

1155
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,140
But now is not the time.

1156
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,140
I don't know.

1157
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,140
I'm the replacement for Queen's.

1158
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:02,140
I'm the one who saved the company that was about to be disbanded.

1159
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:08,140
But my grandfather asked me to celebrate his birthday quietly.

1160
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,140
We are all so naive.

1161
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,140
I'm not fooled by my grandfather.

1162
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,140
It's all a test.

1163
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,140
It's like a midterm and final exam.

1164
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:18,140
In that sense, today is like a college entrance exam.

1165
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:21,140
Whether to use the crown as a successor or not.

1166
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,140
The day of the final battle.

1167
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,140
But I have a feeling.

1168
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,140
What?

1169
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:34,140
Today will be the best day of my life.

1170
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,140
You should put some effort into your dress

1171
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,140
and get your hair done at the hair salon.

1172
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,140
I'll be going.

1173
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,140
Honey.

1174
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,140
Thank you.

1175
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,140
Honey.

1176
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,140
Dad.

1177
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,140
Dad.

1178
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,140
Many people came here today

1179
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:04,140
to celebrate your birthday.

1180
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:08,140
Recently, we had a hard time.

1181
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,140
All the rumors and false rumors

1182
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,140
that were trying to shake you.

1183
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:18,140
But our heroes didn't get tired or bent.

1184
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,140
They overcame all the hardships.

1185
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:24,140
Everyone, this is Chairman Hong Mandae.

1186
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,140
He's the chairman of Hong Mandae.

1187
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:29,140
Everyone, this is Chairman Hong Mandae.

1188
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,140
I'm going to the hair salon.

1189
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,140
I'll be going.

1190
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,140
I'll be going.

1191
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,140
I'll be going.

1192
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,140
I'll be going.

1193
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,140
I'll be going.

1194
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,140
I'll be going.

1195
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,140
I'll be going.

1196
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,140
I'll be going.

1197
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,140
I'll be going.

1198
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,140
I'll be going.

1199
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,140
I'll be going.

1200
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,140
I'll be going.

1201
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,140
I'll be going.

1202
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,140
I'll be going.

1203
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,140
I'll be going.

1204
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,140
I'll be going.

1205
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,140
I'll be going.

1206
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:16,140
I'll be going.

1207
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,140
I'll be going.

1208
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,140
I'll be going.

1209
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,140
I'll be going.

1210
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,140
I'll be going.

1211
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,140
I'll be going.

1212
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,140
I'll be going.

1213
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,140
I'll be going.

1214
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:24,140
I'll be going.

1215
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,140
I'll be going.

1216
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,580
We go out to play?

1217
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,100
We don't.

1218
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,420
Put it out here.

1219
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:38,420
Oh.

1220
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,460
Supplies.

1221
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:46,820
Hi.

1222
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,540
Take a seat, help yourself.

1223
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,700
Don't go out wearing aüsirs.

1224
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,740
You're in a hurry.

1225
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,540
I made it myself.

1226
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,540
My grandfather, Chairman Hong Mandae,

1227
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,240
is the main character.

1228
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,640
What?

1229
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,340
Sucheol is giving you a proper birthday present.

1230
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,640
Exactly.

1231
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:13,840
I'm so happy to finally reveal it to you.

1232
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,040
Please come out, Mansoong!

1233
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,240
Wow!

1234
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,040
Wow!

1235
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,740
Mansoong will be selling dolls, golf balls,

1236
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:47,840
mugs, key rings, and foot mats.

1237
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,840
Of course,

1238
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,440
he will also be releasing LFTs.

1239
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
Mansoong!

1240
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,240
Tell him to come in now.

1241
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,040
He's here. The surveillance footage is out.

1242
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,840
Dahye.

1243
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,740
Honey.

1244
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:30,940
Director chocolate

1245
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,800
The doll.

1246
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,800
Dahye!

1247
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,740
Dahee!

1248
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,440
Dahee!

1249
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:24,340
Dahee!

1250
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:25,740
Dahee!

1251
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,520
Dahee!

1252
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,420
Geonu!

1253
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:47,420
Dahee.

1254
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:55,120
My son can't sleep without you.

1255
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,900
Dahee, please!

1256
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,400
Let's go.

1257
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,140
Geonu, let's eat.

1258
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:10,640
Geonu, let's eat.

1259
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,240
Let's go.

1260
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,420
Geonu.

1261
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,020
Geonu, Geonu.

1262
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:21,820
Geonu.

1263
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,520
Geonu, it's okay.

1264
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,560
Geonu, it's okay.

1265
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,960
Geonu.

1266
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,420
It's okay.

1267
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:47,420
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

1268
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,420
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

1269
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:58,420
What?

1270
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,420
Why are you calling me at this hour?

1271
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:15,720
What do you want to say?

1272
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,620
I'm sorry.

1273
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:17,920
I have something urgent.

1274
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,720
Are you alone right now?

1275
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,920
I'm keeping the phone on.

1276
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,320
If Ms. Mo is with you, just listen to me.

1277
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,320
What?

1278
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,320
Ms. Mo and Mr. Yoon Eunsung

1279
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,520
have done a DNA test.

1280
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,320
It's confirmed that the possibility

1281
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:49,400
of a

1282
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,660
I look for kings.

1283
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,480
Chancellor.

1284
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:04,080
I came looking for a king.

1285
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,280
Why?

1286
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,800
Is there anything you want to say?

1287
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,320
Oh, my.

1288
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,920
Oh, my.

1289
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,320
Are you okay?

1290
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,720
You're not okay, are you?

1291
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,120
I'm sure you are.

1292
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,060
That's what it's called.

1293
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,460
It's said that you'll get a mild paralysis

1294
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:48,720
in 10 minutes after you touch the ventilator.

1295
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,120
It's true.

1296
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,420
Yong-ae.

1297
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,320
Okay.

1298
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,820
Don't worry.

1299
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,220
I won't die right away.

1300
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,720
If you die right away, it won't help.

1301
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,820
I can be your legal guardian

1302
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:16,020
and your attorney

1303
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,320
only when you're in a coma.

1304
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,120
So please lie down for a couple of months

1305
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,120
like a dead body and then die.

1306
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,220
Can you do that for me?

1307
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,820
I know.

1308
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:58,820
You and Mr. Baek were both right.

1309
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,920
Why did you believe me

1310
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,220
instead of believing someone else?

1311
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:19,220
Happy birthday to you

1312
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:22,420
Happy birthday to you

1313
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:26,020
Happy birthday to you

1314
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:29,020
Happy birthday to you

1315
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,220
Hurry up.

1316
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,820
Let's take a picture. Smile.

1317
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,720
One, two, three. Then we'll do a kimchi pose.

1318
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,620
One, two, three.

1319
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,920
Kimchi.

1320
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:54,720
What's wrong with you?

1321
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,520
Don't you know who I am?

1322
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,820
Why can't you hear me?

1323
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,620
Only those who are allowed

1324
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,220
to enter the room can enter.

1325
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,220
Move.

1326
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,220
Move.

1327
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,220
Move.

1328
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,320
Look at this.

1329
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,820
This is my son and I'm his daughter.

1330
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,220
Who's your guardian?

1331
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,220
Come out.

1332
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,520
Oh, my.

1333
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,120
What are you doing?

1334
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,620
You bitch.

1335
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,620
What are you doing?

1336
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,220
Wait a minute.

1337
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,020
What happened, Ms. Han?

1338
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,820
The chairman was suddenly

1339
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,620
taken to the emergency room

1340
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,120
but he's unconscious.

1341
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,720
Oh, no.

1342
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:43,420
And the current chairman's legal guardian

1343
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,220
is Ms. Mo Suri.

1344
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,620
What's wrong with you?

1345
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,820
What?

1346
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:56,420
What do you mean, legal guardian?

1347
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,420
Yes.

1348
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,020
The chairman recently

1349
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,020
changed his position as the head of the medical department.

1350
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,620
If this is what the chairman wants,

1351
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:10,020
Ms. Mo Suri, who is unconscious,

1352
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,820
will take on all the power

1353
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,920
as the chairman's legal guardian and head of the medical department.

1354
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,820
If this document is manipulated,

1355
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:19,020
the department will be able to control

1356
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:25,960
the chairman's

1357
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,820
and the chairman's legal guardian.

1358
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,820
The chairman has a video of the chairman

1359
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,620
writing the warrant himself.

1360
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:33,020
I'll give it to him.

1361
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,020
Oh, no.

1362
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,520
Honey. Honey.

1363
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,620
If he didn't trust his children,

1364
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:43,820
he would've asked me to do everything for him

1365
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,420
when the Manir incident happened.

1366
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,020
Everyone was worried

1367
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,220
that the company he was working for was more important.

1368
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,420
I know what the chairman wants better than anyone else.

1369
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,820
I'll do whatever he wants.

1370
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:55,820
What the chairman wants?

1371
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,020
What the chairman wants?

1372
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,920
Hey, I don't know that.

1373
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,620
But I know what you want.

1374
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,020
You want to take all the rights of your father

1375
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:08,420
and your son, Yoon Eunseong, and take them all!

1376
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,620
What are you talking about?

1377
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,120
Yoon Eunseong?

1378
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,620
CEO Yoon Eunseong?

1379
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:15,820
That's right.

1380
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:17,820
The DNA test results have been released.

1381
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:22,620
Yes, CEO Yoon is my son.

1382
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,820
But why? Can't I do that?

1383
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,820
Will it change anything?

1384
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,820
Hey!

1385
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,620
If you keep acting up,

1386
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,620
I'll move you to the hospital without knowing

1387
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:37,020
and I'll make sure your father doesn't get infected.

1388
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,020
Do you think I can't do it?

1389
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:47,020
Okay.

1390
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,420
The incident of the re-establishment of the company

1391
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,420
has occurred.

1392
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,220
The owner's rights to run the company

1393
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:59,420
have been revoked at the Queen's Group's temporary headquarters.

1394
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:01,420
The PY1 investment, which was known

1395
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,220
as the investor of the Queen's Group's new complex resort,

1396
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:07,420
declared the management participation of 14.7%

1397
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,620
of Queen's Group stocks every day.

1398
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:13,220
PY1, which has raised the share rate to 24.3%,

1399
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,620
has become unconscious

1400
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:17,420
due to a sudden heart disease.

1401
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,220
It immediately passed a transfer

1402
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,820
and secured 6.7% of the shares of Chairman Hong.

1403
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,820
It is now a total of 31%

1404
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,420
and is ranked as the second largest shareholder

1405
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,020
of the Queen's Group.

1406
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:30,420
PY1 then requested for a temporary headquarter.

1407
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,820
Mo Seulhee, who was granted the right to

1408
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:35,620
run the company, raised the hand of PY1 investment

1409
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:39,220
and the Queen's Group owner's remuneration was 68.8%

1410
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,820
and 31.2% was the opposite.

1411
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:44,020
This is a shocking news.

1412
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:47,020
This is the first case in which the owners

1413
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,420
of the big companies' owners' houses

1414
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:52,220
have been revoked.

1415
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,420
What about our owners' houses now?

1416
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:08,120
I don't know. Even the reporters don't know.

1417
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:10,320
They don't have a home and can't go to hotels.

1418
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,920
They probably can't go to work because of the police.

1419
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,520
I know. Where did they all go?

1420
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,120
Hey.

1421
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,120
Hey.

1422
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,120
Why aren't you guys coming?

1423
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,320
We just got here this morning.

1424
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,120
We were supposed to talk.

1425
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,720
How much is this sausage?

1426
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,320
How did you open the store?

1427
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,320
The password is 007-0.

1428
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,520
No one in this neighborhood knows that.

1429
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,120
Geez.

1430
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,120
We should change.

1431
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,120
People want to have a property.

1432
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,920
We were open because you said you didn't have one.

1433
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,520
Look at this.

1434
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,120
I wrote it all down.

1435
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,920
Why did you suddenly not return it

1436
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,920
even though you were on TV?

1437
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,520
I saw the news articles and told you to cheer up.

1438
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,720
The weather is nice today.

1439
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,920
Let's have a cup of soju and ramen.

1440
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,520
Okay.

1441
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,520
Okay.

1442
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,220
Okay.

1443
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:36,820
Here.

1444
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,620
Here.

1445
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,220
Here. Be careful.

1446
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,420
Gosh.

1447
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,620
You're amazing.

1448
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,020
Enjoy.

1449
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,420
By the way,

1450
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:55,220
why did you have to go to the supermarket?

1451
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:57,020
I'm disappointed.

1452
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:01,620
Why did you have to go to a house?

1453
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,820
You were just talking.

1454
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,220
It wasn't you who got the water.

1455
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:06,620
It was Hyeonho.

1456
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:09,020
What water did Hyeonho get?

1457
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:12,420
He just got hit by a typhoon.

1458
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,120
By the way,

1459
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,620
you know about farming.

1460
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:30,220
The water from the fields in Seoul

1461
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:31,820
doesn't have a deep root.

1462
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,020
There's no need for that.

1463
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,820
But strong winds and strong children

1464
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:38,420
just get hit by the roots and stand on their feet.

1465
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,220
If you think about it,

1466
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,820
typhoons are not useless in life.

1467
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,420
What?

1468
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,820
If you think about it,

1469
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,820
he's a philosopher in a white box.

1470
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,420
Hey.

1471
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:55,420
If typhoons are that useful,

1472
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:58,020
you should be the ones to suffer.

1473
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,220
I thought my son would be standing alone

1474
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:02,220
and I was right.

1475
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:06,220
I'm so frustrated.

1476
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,820
Forget it.

1477
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:15,420
What?

1478
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:17,820
What?

1479
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,820
Who is it?

1480
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:22,220
Who is it?

1481
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:23,220
What?

1482
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,220
What?

1483
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,220
What?

1484
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,020
Who is it?

1485
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:28,220
What?

1486
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,020
Hey, Hyeonho.

1487
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:33,020
What are you doing here at this hour?

1488
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,420
Dad, I was in a rush.

1489
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,620
Hey, Baek Hyeonho.

1490
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,620
Why aren't you answering your phone?

1491
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,620
Hey, you.

1492
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,620
You're eating without paying me.

1493
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,220
What's wrong with your face?

1494
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,020
Gosh.

1495
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,220
No, it's not that.

1496
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:47,220
It's not that.

1497
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,020
That crazy jerk's house is a success.

1498
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:49,620
Look.

1499
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,420
The house you left is ruined.

1500
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,420
It's too much to be human.

1501
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,220
Wait, Hyeonho.

1502
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:55,220
Of course.

1503
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,620
I was so relieved to see the news

1504
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,020
that the house was ruined.

1505
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,220
It was a disaster.

1506
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:02,620
Anyway, you just have to forget about that crazy jerk

1507
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,220
and live your life in peace.

1508
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:27,020
You came with me.

1509
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,420
To a crazy jerk.

1510
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,020
Yes.

1511
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,620
You came.

1512
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,820
I... I came even more.

1513
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,420
What are you doing?

1514
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:02,820
I'm going to the hospital.

1515
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,220
I'm going to the hospital.

1516
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:05,620
I'm going to the hospital.

1517
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,020
I'm going to the hospital.

1518
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,420
I'm going to the hospital.

1519
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:09,820
I'm going to the hospital.

1520
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,220
I'm going to the hospital.

1521
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,620
I'm going to the hospital.

1522
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:14,020
I'm going to the hospital.

1523
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,420
I'm going to the hospital.

1524
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:16,820
I'm going to the hospital.

1525
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:18,220
I'm going to the hospital.

1526
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:19,620
I'm going to the hospital.

1527
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,020
I'm going to the hospital.

1528
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,620
I'm going to the hospital.

1529
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,020
I'm going to the hospital.

1530
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:25,420
I'm going to the hospital.

1531
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:27,020
I'm going to the hospital.

1532
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:28,420
I'm going to the hospital.

1533
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:29,620
I'll be back.

1534
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,220
I'll see you at the hospital.

1535
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,220
Bye.

1536
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,220
I know how you feel,

1537
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:48,220
but I just wanted to live like that.

1538
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:49,420
What's up with you?

1539
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:50,820
What do you mean you wanted to live like that?

1540
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,220
Are you trying to talk me into it?

1541
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:53,620
I don't know.

1542
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:54,820
I just...

1543
01:22:54,820 --> 01:23:04,820
I'm sorry.

1544
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:08,820
Thank you for the meal.

1545
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:10,820
Oh, my. Are you back?

1546
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:20,820
Yes, thank you for the meal.

1547
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:34,820
Oh, my.

1548
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:35,820
Are you all right?

1549
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,820
Why are you crying?

1550
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:47,820
Huh?

1551
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:48,820
My husband?

1552
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:51,820
Yes.

1553
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:56,820
He wants to live next to me.

1554
01:23:56,820 --> 01:24:01,820
Oh, my. Is that a cry?

1555
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:06,820
What's the matter?

1556
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:14,820
I want to live, too.

1557
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:17,820
Then live. What's the problem?

1558
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:27,820
I want to live, too.

1559
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:33,820
That's what he said.

1560
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:43,820
You're drunk.

1561
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,820
I want to live.

1562
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:59,820
Really?

1563
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:27,820
I'm falling.

1564
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:37,820
I'm falling.

1565
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:47,820
I'm falling.

1566
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:17,820
I'm falling.

1567
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:47,820
I'm falling.

1568
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:17,820
I'm falling.
