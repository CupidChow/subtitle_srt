1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Wait a minute.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,300
I know that car.

3
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,800
When Grandpa said,

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,640
he was changing the air conditioning system,

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,140
he said his family was going out.

6
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,540
I thought it was weird.

7
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,740
But I saw that car that day.

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,340
Then the money must have gone home.

9
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,940
If that's true,

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,980
wouldn't the money be at home?

11
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,260
Wow!

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,400
You shouldn't be leaking any more.

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,540
Just wait here for a little bit.

14
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,700
I'll go get the car.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I watched TVtime what three were watching and a cat watching the soap Third floor

16
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,020
I will also prepare a handful of pop dollars

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Hang on.

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Mr. Park.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're here.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
What are you doing?

22
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Get up.

23
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,800
I'm dizzy.

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm hungry.

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm going to eat something delicious.

26
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's go.

27
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:36,800
I'm hungry.

28
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I'm hungry.

29
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Are you okay?

30
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Yeah.

31
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Should I call the police?

32
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Hang on.

33
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
You should.

34
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
You should.

35
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Hang on.

36
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,800
You're not crying, are you?

37
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
What?

38
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Is this how you recognize me?

39
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,800
That's too bad.

40
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
How could I...

41
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
I know.

42
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,800
How could you mistake me for Baek Hyeon-woo?

43
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Hae-in!

44
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Open the door.

45
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,800
What are you going to say when you open the door?

46
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
What?

47
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Are you going to say that you thought I was Baek Hyeon-woo and that you followed me?

48
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
You must be surprised.

49
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Wouldn't it be more natural to say that it was a road to somewhere with me?

50
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Hae-in!

51
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Open the door.

52
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Open it.

53
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Are you okay?

54
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Yeah, I'm fine.

55
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Then it's okay.

56
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I thought something happened.

57
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Let's go.

58
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:50,800
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I met Yoon Eun-sung here a while ago.

60
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
But he invited me home.

61
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:08,800
You know I wanted to see my grandfather, right?

62
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
I'll be back.

63
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I see.

64
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Then I'll come with you.

65
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm sorry, but I only invited Hae-in.

66
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Don't worry.

67
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Come pick me up later.

68
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Is there really nothing else?

69
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:44,800
No.

70
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I'm sorry.

71
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:44,800
What a surprise.

72
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,800
What a surprise.

73
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
What's wrong?

74
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Aren't you happy to see me?

75
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,800
No, I was going to call you.

76
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Oh, that's what happened.

77
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,800
I didn't know that.

78
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I was going to kill you if I knew.

79
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
What's wrong?

80
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Is it him?

81
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,800
The picture is better.

82
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Hey, Dong-u, say dad.

83
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
It's Geon-woo.

84
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,800
If I say Dong-u, it's Dong-u.

85
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Anyway, you've done a lot of work.

86
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
I live with a fool who doesn't even talk.

87
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Hong Su-cheol will be arrested.

88
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Why?

89
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I made some mistakes while working as a financial advisor.

90
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
I worked on turning everything upside down on Hong Su-cheol.

91
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I'll stab the prosecutor while I'm in Korea.

92
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
What are you doing?

93
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Hey, it's all for you.

94
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,800
What if he chases you to get revenge?

95
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Hey, you're so loud.

96
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Hey!

97
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:11,800
I'm going to the bathroom.

98
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Hyun-woo and Hye-in aren't answering their phones.

99
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Are they going to sleep in Seoul?

100
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,800
It's better than driving late at night.

101
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Honey, isn't this too American?

102
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Honey, isn't this too American?

103
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
What?

104
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Hye-in said so.

105
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Hyun-woo is going to the United States.

106
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Aomensin Pujin Entertainment City 772772, Kong

107
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Did you tell me that I could work for a few days

108
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
with the Chagatang family?

109
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Yes.

110
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,800
We can work for a few days and talk about it.

111
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
I'll just leave it to the alarm.

112
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Leave it to the alarm.

113
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Honey, did you see Hyun-woo's eyes lately?

114
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,800
He's already gone crazy.

115
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
He's not going to stop me from doing this.

116
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Okay, stop.

117
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
What?

118
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Stop calling.

119
00:12:50,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Okay.

120
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,800
What is this?

121
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Hey.

122
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
You're up.

123
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
What is this?

124
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
What are you doing?

125
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Shut up. Let's go back to sleep.

126
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,800
I'll warm up your body when you fall asleep.

127
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Oh, my.

128
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Why are you coming this way?

129
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm going to see my grandfather.

130
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
It's cold because you didn't eat.

131
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Go and change.

132
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,800
And let's eat.

133
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
I didn't come here to do that.

134
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I brought you here to do that.

135
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Change your clothes and eat with me.

136
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:25,800
I'll do the rest when I don't have a grandfather.

137
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Is this steak?

138
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Yes, it's a simple yuzu salad.

139
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
He likes it.

140
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Okay, I'll bring the wine.

141
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,800
And the plate...

142
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
This is better.

143
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Okay.

144
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
The wine glass...

145
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:53,800
This one.

146
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
What?

147
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Yes, I took care of Baek Hyunwoo.

148
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Are you sure?

149
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Yes.

150
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
What should we do now?

151
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Don't call me for the time being.

152
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Hide.

153
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
What about my money?

154
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
What about the plane?

155
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
I'll give it to you.

156
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
But if you meet me or take money,

157
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
you'll be suspected.

158
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Don't call me until I call you.

159
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Put in a few more peppers.

160
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Yes.

161
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
How does it feel to be home after a long time?

162
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,800
No wonder it doesn't feel like my house.

163
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
This is your favorite wine, right?

164
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I'm done drinking.

165
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Yeah?

166
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,800
The steak is good. Try it.

167
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
I don't have a good appetite.

168
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
You said you were hungry earlier.

169
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
I did a little bit, but now I'm out of appetite.

170
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Let's go now.

171
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Let's go.

172
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
You have to give me time, too.

173
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
What time?

174
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
It's time to solve the misunderstanding you have about me.

175
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,800
What misunderstanding?

176
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
You said that, right?

177
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I helped you after I put you in the palace.

178
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,800
That's right.

179
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Do you remember this?

180
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
What is it?

181
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
It was yours.

182
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,800
A long time ago.

183
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:08,800
But why do you have this?

184
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,800
That was you?

185
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Yeah.

186
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Then was that when we first met?

187
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
It was before we met.

188
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Before? When?

189
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
You saved me back then?

190
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Yeah.

191
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Did you know I saved you from that accident?

192
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
What are you doing?

193
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
I just couldn't sleep.

194
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I was watching our babies' albums when they were young.

195
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Would you like to watch them with me?

196
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Of course.

197
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Have a seat.

198
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Oh, my. Is this Mr. Baek's room?

199
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Yes.

200
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
He was handsome when he was young.

201
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Right?

202
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
In this room, even if I don't know his name,

203
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,800
I know all the handsome sons of the bamboo house.

204
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
You must have been happy.

205
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
A handsome son who studies well.

206
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Yes, he's good at boxing and swimming.

207
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,800
So he was a soldier in the Children's Marine Corps.

208
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
He saved a baby who fell into the water once.

209
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Why?

210
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,800
I mean, I saw this beach a lot yesterday.

211
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Why were you there?

212
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
I went to see my mother.

213
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
I was there and happened to see an accident.

214
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Really?

215
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Yeah.

216
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,800
I was the one who met you and liked you.

217
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
I didn't know.

218
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
You should have told me.

219
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,800
My mother abandoned me in the orphanage

220
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
to keep her secret.

221
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,800
So I couldn't say anything.

222
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
That must have been hard.

223
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Right?

224
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,800
So let's eat together.

225
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I wanted to eat with you at this table.

226
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I really wanted to say what you didn't like

227
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
even though you did it every day.

228
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,800
So stop making that face.

229
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Let's eat.

230
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Let's eat.

231
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Wait, let's talk to your grandfather.

232
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Father.

233
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Father.

234
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Father.

235
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Father.

236
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Father.

237
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Do you recognize me?

238
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Yes.

239
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Are you crazy?

240
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
How dare you talk about her here?

241
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Are you alone in that room?

242
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Leave it.

243
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
You're so shameless.

244
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,800
You were so embarrassed at the public meeting.

245
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Move!

246
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
What happened when you were alone with a crazy old woman?

247
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
I'm going to kill you!

248
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
It's been a while.

249
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Yes, it's been a month.

250
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
I heard about it.

251
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,800
You're not supposed to be sick at your age.

252
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
So I came to see you.

253
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I didn't know when I would die.

254
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Haena.

255
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
You don't know when you'll die.

256
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
What made you come here?

257
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
You were scared that I might die.

258
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Your grandfather had all the rights

259
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
to me in case this happened.

260
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
You didn't know what your family would do

261
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
when you were mentally unstable.

262
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
So you trusted me.

263
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Say whatever you want.

264
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
You know it's a lie and I know it too.

265
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
What?

266
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Fortunately, your grandfather is alive

267
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
so your family's safety is at stake.

268
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,800
I believe that you'll take good care of him

269
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
so that he won't get sick.

270
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Since when were you such a close family?

271
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
You were always fighting over money

272
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
without your parents or siblings.

273
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I know.

274
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
We've been working hard thanks to you

275
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
and we've been getting to know our parents

276
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
and siblings.

277
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
I'm not saying I'm grateful.

278
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
I'll be back soon.

279
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Don't go.

280
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Who?

281
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
What if you get chased?

282
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Where is the front door?

283
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
The front door.

284
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
What?

285
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
What?

286
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
What?

287
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
What?

288
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
What?

289
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
What?

290
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
What?

291
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
What?

292
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
What?

293
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
What?

294
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
What?

295
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
What?

296
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
What?

297
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
What?

298
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
What?

299
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
What?

300
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
What?

301
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
What?

302
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
What?

303
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
What?

304
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
What?

305
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
What?

306
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
What?

307
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
What?

308
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
What?

309
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
What?

310
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
What?

311
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
What?

312
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
What?

313
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
What?

314
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Hae In.

315
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Are you okay?

316
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
What's wrong?

317
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Baek Hyeon-woo?

318
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Is that you?

319
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Yes, it's me.

320
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
What's wrong?

321
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
What's that?

322
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Did you get hit by someone again?

323
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
How many times do I have to tell you?

324
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
I'm sorry.

325
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
I'm sorry.

326
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
I'm sorry.

327
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
I'm sorry.

328
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
I'm sorry.

329
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
How many times do I have to tell you?

330
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,800
I'm not the kind of person who gets hit by someone.

331
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm not the kind of person who gets hit by someone.

332
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
I can't believe I was pretending to be okay.

333
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Baek Hyeon-woo is here.

334
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
I'm sorry.

335
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Can you believe me?

336
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
What happened?

337
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
You said Baek Hyeon-woo was killed.

338
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
I know.

339
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Why did you do that?

340
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
What?

341
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Check it first.

342
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
What?

343
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
There's no difference between killing me first

344
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
or killing me later.

345
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,800
But if you call the person who told you to kill me,

346
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
you'll know if he keeps his promise or not.

347
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Yes, Baek Hyeon-woo has been killed.

348
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Are you sure?

349
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Yes. What should we do now?

350
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Don't call the director. Hide.

351
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
What about the money?

352
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
What about the plane?

353
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
I'll give it to you.

354
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
But if you meet me or get the money,

355
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
don't call me until I get there.

356
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Hello?

357
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Please...

358
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,800
You punk.

359
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
You're just a real estate fraud.

360
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
But the moment you kill me, you become a murderer.

361
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Don't be so mean.

362
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
The police still have a case of you assaulting me.

363
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
The moment I die,

364
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
that case will be a murder case, not an assault.

365
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
It's obvious that you'll be in prison

366
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
and you'll be charged with a criminal offense.

367
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Even if you run away from abroad,

368
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
you'll be in the highest level of defense,

369
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
the Interpol's top-level defense.

370
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Shut up.

371
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
If you're charged with a murder

372
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
for the purpose of revenge,

373
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
you'll be in prison for at least 20 years.

374
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,800
But if you don't do anything here,

375
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
you'll be charged with a three-year fine.

376
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,800
If I help you negotiate with the landowners,

377
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,020
you can even go to a

378
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,800
What should I do?

379
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
If you stop here,

380
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
I'll say that nothing happened tonight.

381
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
So you just let it go?

382
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Are you stupid?

383
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
I was stupid.

384
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Send me the money right now.

385
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Or I'll blow up everything

386
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
that you've committed.

387
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,800
This is where I used to live alone.

388
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Forget it. Leave it.

389
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
I was busy.

390
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
I was wondering where you were after the divorce.

391
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
You were here.

392
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Were you uncomfortable?

393
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
I'm not uncomfortable.

394
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
I'm fine.

395
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,800
I'm new here, so I have a full option.

396
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Why did you sleep on the sofa?

397
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
I sleep well.

398
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
I sleep anywhere I want

399
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
whenever I feel like it.

400
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Oh, you must have been asleep

401
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
after the divorce.

402
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
I didn't sleep well.

403
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
What?

404
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
You said it was your dream.

405
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
You said you wanted to get divorced

406
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
after you had achieved your dream.

407
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
I didn't.

408
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
You said you wanted to get divorced.

409
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,800
I think you slept well after you had achieved your dream.

410
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
At the new house, full option, and the hostel.

411
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Why are you talking like that again?

412
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
No, no.

413
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
I was comfortable with one person after the divorce.

414
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
It's fine.

415
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I wasn't comfortable at all.

416
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
I was a little distracted

417
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
because it was a new house.

418
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
So I had a headache.

419
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Look.

420
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,800
The living room and the kitchen are right next to each other.

421
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,800
If I cook something, I can't breathe well.

422
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Above all,

423
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
you're not here.

424
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Isn't it comfortable without me?

425
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
No.

426
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
Sometimes,

427
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
I wonder what it would have been like

428
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
if this was a newlywed house.

429
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
I wish I could have sent a newlywed

430
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
to a place where we can't go anywhere

431
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
even if we fight.

432
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,800
If I think about it alone,

433
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I miss you.

434
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
That's what I think.

435
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I'm hungry.

436
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Really?

437
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
I'll cook for you.

438
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Take a break.

439
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
I'm hungry.

440
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
It looks delicious.

441
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Let's eat.

442
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
You're so good at it.

443
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Why didn't you do it before?

444
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
I guess I had a team to play with.

445
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
But

446
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
will you date another woman if I die?

447
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
What?

448
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Living in a cozy house

449
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
where you can't run away even if you fight with another woman,

450
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
will you cook for me

451
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
and make me happy

452
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,800
and sweet?

453
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
What are you talking about?

454
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Eat.

455
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Answer me.

456
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
If you talk back again, I'll kill you.

457
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Do you want to die before me?

458
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
You're worrying too much.

459
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Who else would date me?

460
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
You're already a national heroine.

461
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,800
You're a pure woman who saves her ex-husband.

462
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
I'm a pathetic man who got divorced

463
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
without knowing those women.

464
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
But some woman...

465
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,800
What woman wouldn't want to meet you?

466
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
She's handsome, right?

467
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
She's nice, right?

468
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
She's smart, but she doesn't pretend to be good.

469
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,800
And she's good at cooking stew.

470
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
There's no man like you.

471
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I want to meet you

472
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
100 times, even if I'm born again.

473
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:59,800
No, I don't forget that kind of thing.

474
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
No.

475
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
It's true.

476
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Why would you forget?

477
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
She's really...

478
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
She's really...

479
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,800
She's really...

480
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
She's really...

481
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
She's really...

482
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
I'm sorry.

483
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Do you get it now?

484
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
You're nothing to Haein.

485
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
You're always being used.

486
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
I never knew that.

487
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
You knew and got used to it?

488
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Yes.

489
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Because I'm an adult.

490
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,800
I've always been used by my mother.

491
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
You blamed me for pretending not to know

492
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
after I sent my child to a strange land, right?

493
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,800
I don't think I knew that your adoptive parents

494
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,800
took so much money and abused you.

495
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Were they the people who didn't even drink?

496
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Did they die of a drunk driving accident?

497
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
What are you talking about?

498
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
The director of Hope Children's Hospital

499
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
who made you suffer

500
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
suddenly got fired and the director died.

501
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
Do you think it was an accident

502
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
that he just died?

503
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
I didn't neglect my son.

504
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
I didn't just leave the people who

505
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
tormented you, made you suffer,

506
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
or blocked your path.

507
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
I'm still going through the same thing.

508
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
I'm not the one who made you a queen

509
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
because of my own son.

510
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,800
My goal is to make all of this yours.

511
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
I won't just leave the people

512
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
who are in the way.

513
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Whether it's Hong Haein or whatever.

514
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Do you understand?

515
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
This is how I love you.

516
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
If you really love Haein,

517
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,800
and you don't want to hurt him,

518
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
don't be used.

519
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,800
I can't just let that go.

520
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,800
How long has it been since you got hurt?

521
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
How did this happen?

522
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
I told you.

523
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
It was just an accident.

524
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
I was driving so recklessly

525
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
because I was so busy.

526
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
Did you go home and see your grandfather?

527
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Grandpa, do you recognize me?

528
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Young lady.

529
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
I'm hungry.

530
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Grandpa.

531
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Grandpa.

532
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm sorry, but we don't have time.

533
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Do you remember this pen?

534
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
You gave it to me as a gift.

535
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
You wrote my initials and made them for me.

536
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
It has a recording function.

537
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,800
I'll put it over there, so if you have anything to say,

538
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
please record it over there.

539
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
I'll be right back.

540
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
When you come back,

541
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
I'll find out about that pen.

542
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
I got it as a gift from the special production

543
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
and it's only for me and my grandfather.

544
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
What did your granddaughter say?

545
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
She must have come to ask where the money is.

546
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Why are you hiding it from everyone

547
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
and making them suffer?

548
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
If you had done it for me,

549
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
you should have left it on my account.

550
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
What's the use of that money?

551
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Is it cheap when it's worth it?

552
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
You fool.

553
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,800
You can't die.

554
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
You can't live or die because of that money.

555
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Is this how you get by?

556
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
I'm sorry.

557
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Are you sure you're out of your mind?

558
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Did you hear what Hyein said?

559
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Yein, you're going to die soon.

560
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
She can't live long

561
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
because of some strange brain tumor.

562
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,800
How did the whole family end up like this?

563
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
She doesn't even understand that her granddaughter

564
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
is dying and she's so lucky.

565
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,800
I'm strong.

566
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
I'm crazy.

567
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm a crazy bastard.

568
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
I'm a totally crazy bastard.

569
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
I'm totally...

570
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
I'm a totally strong bastard.

571
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
When did you get here?

572
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
I just came back from the morning run.

573
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
I think I'm starting to work out.

574
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
You're in a good position.

575
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
Are you going somewhere?

576
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
I'm taking Hoyul to school.

577
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
I see.

578
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
By the way,

579
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,800
do your wife and husband work far away?

580
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
Do they work on weekends?

581
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
No, they live together.

582
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
I see.

583
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
But I don't think I've seen them before.

584
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,800
Oh, that's because

585
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
my mother said when my wife and I got married,

586
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
you're my daughter-in-law.

587
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
You're not my daughter, right?

588
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
I hate it when a daughter-in-law like you

589
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
does something like this.

590
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
I'm going to hit my daughter.

591
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Seriously, Mom.

592
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
I can't hit your precious daughter

593
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
just because I'm going to hit her.

594
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
It's not right to be so rude

595
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,800
and not even show any respect to her.

596
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Yes, I guess so.

597
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Let's not see each other again when we get married.

598
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,800
What?

599
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
Really?

600
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,800
You can go to your parents' house on Chuseok

601
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
or go somewhere to hang out.

602
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Thank you.

603
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
And don't say you're going to celebrate your birthday.

604
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,800
If you're upset, send me a text message.

605
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,800
But isn't it too simple?

606
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Shut up.

607
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,800
But there's one condition.

608
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Byeok Yontae has a lot of problems.

609
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
But I can't help him.

610
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,800
You can fix it or return it.

611
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
Mom.

612
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
I'll try.

613
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
You're so cool.

614
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Thanks to you, my wife was chosen

615
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,800
as the best woman to marry at the reunion.

616
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
That's understandable.

617
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Since you did that for my wife,

618
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,800
my wife will forgive me for my mistakes.

619
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
That's life.

620
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
I'm not a woman.

621
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
I'm not a man.

622
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Hey.

623
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
I didn't mean to brag.

624
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
You did.

625
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
I didn't mean to be rich.

626
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
I'm sorry.

627
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Are you upset?

628
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
I have something to tell you.

629
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
Darn it.

630
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
This is all you have?

631
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,800
I heard you stole all the expensive art supplies

632
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
and threw them away.

633
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
What do you mean, all of them?

634
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
I just brought a few.

635
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
That's what I left after signing the contract.

636
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,800
I heard you stole all the expensive stuff.

637
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
I don't know.

638
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
Who is this?

639
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Join us.

640
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,800
AOMG New Peking Entertainment City 772772.

641
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
I didn't mean to be rich.

642
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Gwang-gung, are you okay?

643
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,800
What are you doing?

644
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Oh, that's your Achilles' heel.

645
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Are you crazy?

646
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,800
I'm going to kill you if you try to touch me.

647
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
I'm asking you where you are.

648
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I haven't even put it on the market yet.

649
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
I've looked it all up, so stop lying.

650
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,800
I'll leave it to the police.

651
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Go with me to the house.

652
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,800
Okay.

653
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,800
Good, good.

654
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,800
Let's go.

655
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Hey, let's have a drink.

656
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
Did you sleep well?

657
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Yeah.

658
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800
I like this house.

659
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,800
I can't sleep because I'm like you.

660
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,800
I'm going to sleep.

661
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
I'll go to you.

662
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,800
I'll go to you.

663
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
I'll go to you.

664
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
I'll go to you.

665
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
I told you.

666
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,800
Do you want to sleep more?

667
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,800
No.

668
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,800
There's something I want to say.

669
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
No, I'm sorry.

670
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,800
I'm sorry.

671
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,800
It's nice to have a morning meeting after a long time.

672
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,800
I should have some salad and coffee.

673
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Baek Hyunwoo came into my house last night.

674
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
What?

675
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,800
Oh, my God.

676
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,800
What should I do?

677
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,800
I came in because I knew the CCTV was broken.

678
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,800
I see.

679
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Anyway, the students are very thorough.

680
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,800
They are thorough.

681
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
They didn't remove the black box

682
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,800
that was parked there.

683
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,800
So I saw everything.

684
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,800
How they came in.

685
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,800
What's wrong with you?

686
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,800
Why are you doing this to me?

687
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
Did you forget who I am?

688
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,800
You're the ghost hunter.

689
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,800
You came to us.

690
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,800
No, if I'm like this, I'm a ghost hunter.

691
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,800
If you get caught by Ms. Oh, I'm done.

692
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,800
I think I'll find out where the non-financed funds are.

693
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,800
That's why Hyein went home.

694
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Oh, my God.

695
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
If you find the non-financed funds, I'll give you 3%.

696
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
5%.

697
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,800
Really?

698
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,800
I haven't been hurt by the ghost hunter yet.

699
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,800
Of course.

700
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,800
Trust me.

701
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Don't laugh.

702
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,800
Anyway, good-looking people are not bad.

703
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,800
I'm sorry.

704
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,800
If I keep doing this, I'll die of heart attack.

705
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,800
Thank you.

706
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,800
I let you off once.

707
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
And you're acting like a rat

708
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,800
after you went there?

709
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,800
You know that you don't raise rats

710
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,800
even if you raise dogs at home, right?

711
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,800
You must get rid of them

712
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,800
whether it's medicine or dutch.

713
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,800
You're going to use this to get your car,

714
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,800
your ID, your car, and everything.

715
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,800
You're going to spend money on a small building

716
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,800
in the countryside because you're greedy.

717
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,800
It's good to be a spy for your safety.

718
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,800
Madam.

719
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,800
Get lost.

720
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,800
No, I can't.

721
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,800
You're full of misunderstandings.

722
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
How can I get lost?

723
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
I live on information.

724
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,800
I get misunderstood a lot.

725
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,800
What can I do?

726
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,800
That's my basic setting.

727
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
Misunderstand?

728
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,800
Then you're not someone else

729
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
but Baek Hyeonu.

730
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
Explain yourself.

731
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,800
Baek Hyeonu made a deal with me.

732
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,800
He said he'd give me 10% if I found the money.

733
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Does he know where it is?

734
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,800
I was curious about that too.

735
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,800
That's why I helped him.

736
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,800
Where is it?

737
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,800
I gave him 10%

738
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
but I'll only get 7% from here.

739
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
You want to keep doing this?

740
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
Okay.

741
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
Then I'll get rid of the small building.

742
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,800
You have to do this.

743
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,800
Tell me.

744
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,800
I think it's in this house.

745
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,800
Is this a trap?

746
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,800
What?

747
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,800
I think some men are filming me behind the wall.

748
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,800
This is crazy.

749
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,800
I'm not dead yet.

750
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,800
I believe you.

751
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,800
Why?

752
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,800
I'll just leave.

753
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,800
You're gone?

754
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,800
No.

755
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,800
I'm gone.

756
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,800
Relax.

757
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Right?

758
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,800
I think I saw those men yesterday.

759
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,800
They were in black and white.

760
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
They were taking pictures.

761
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Where are my shoes?

762
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,800
Hey.

763
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,800
Look at me for a second.

764
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,800
What?

765
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
What?

766
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
You just took a picture of my wife.

767
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,800
Give me the camera.

768
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,800
What do you mean?

769
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
I saw you taking pictures.

770
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,800
I told you to give it to me.

771
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,800
You punk.

772
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,800
Are you crazy?

773
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,800
Hey.

774
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,800
You hit me first.

775
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
So what?

776
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
Do you know what kind of shoes I'm wearing?

777
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,800
They're shoes that I stepped on.

778
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,800
You guys stepped on shit today.

779
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,800
What are you doing?

780
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,800
Hurry.

781
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,800
Wait.

782
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,800
What are you doing?

783
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,800
Hey.

784
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,800
What are you doing?

785
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,800
Hey.

786
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,800
What are you doing?

787
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,800
What?

788
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,800
What is this?

789
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Help me.

790
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,800
Hey.

791
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Hey.

792
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,800
What are you doing there?

793
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,800
What are you doing?

794
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,800
Help me.

795
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Ready, go.

796
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,800
Cross. That's right.

797
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,800
Cross.

798
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,800
Cross.

799
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,800
Cross.

800
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,800
Cross.

801
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,800
Cross.

802
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
Cross.

803
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,800
Cross.

804
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,800
Cross.

805
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
That's right. Cross.

806
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,800
Cross.

807
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,800
Cross.

808
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,800
Jump.

809
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,800
Did you see that?

810
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
Yongguri is recruiting Oh Youngjae.

811
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
The one who's recruiting the village's security guard?

812
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
I heard there was a riot because of the strange car.

813
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,800
Keep going.

814
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,800
Cross.

815
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,800
So I'm going to apply for it.

816
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,800
I want to get my muscles pumped up by the riot.

817
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
It's okay.

818
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,800
If it's Oh Youngjae, five people will be recruited.

819
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,800
If we get there, we'll be in the top five in Yongguri.

820
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,800
I think that'll work.

821
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
I'm going to prepare for the war.

822
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,800
Which one would be better,

823
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
Kang Mok or Gi Hwa?

824
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,800
Sucah.

825
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
I know it's hard.

826
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
I had a good dream last night.

827
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
I have a good feeling about this.

828
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,800
There won't be five applicants.

829
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
It's working.

830
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,800
Five people like this.

831
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,800
I'm going to take it out.

832
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,800
How long has it been since the second chapter was withdrawn?

833
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,800
If you decide to form an organization like this and move,

834
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,800
this could be interpreted as a political act.

835
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,800
The truth is that there is a conflict between the former and current governments.

836
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,800
I can't leave my mother alone.

837
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,800
Hey, you hate only the good things when you drink.

838
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
You're a good guy when you're like this.

839
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800
Why are you all doing this?

840
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,800
At least five people should be recruited

841
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,800
to apply for the support fund.

842
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,800
Excuse me.

843
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,800
Did you pass?

844
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
Yes, I did.

845
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
I can show you a fierce demonstration.

846
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,800
But once you sign up here, you're a member of the research committee.

847
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,800
Don't fall into the middle.

848
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,800
See?

849
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,800
I told you not to work too hard.

850
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,800
Are you done?

851
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,800
Yes, almost.

852
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
Would you like to get off for a moment?

853
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,800
It's cold.

854
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,800
This is a place like a famous restaurant in my neighborhood.

855
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,800
The current score is 100 out of 100.

856
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,800
If you confess here, it will definitely come true.

857
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,800
It's a very likely atmosphere.

858
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
There's no such thing.

859
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,800
Not only is the sunset here beautiful,

860
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,800
but your face looks slightly warm-toned

861
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,800
and more beautiful.

862
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,800
You're very pretty right now.

863
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,800
Really?

864
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,800
So you're going to confess to me?

865
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,800
Rather than confessing,

866
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,800
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

867
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,800
What?

868
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,800
A request to cancel the divorce.

869
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,800
Marrying someone is a burden,

870
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,800
so why don't you just cancel the divorce?

871
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,800
You remembered my size.

872
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,800
Of course.

873
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,800
But I have to put this on you.

874
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,800
It's a half-baked.

875
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,800
Why?

876
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,800
You said you wanted to meet me 100 times.

877
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,800
That's when you were born, not now.

878
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,800
So why can't I?

879
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,800
I thought yesterday...

880
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
it was you.

881
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,800
What?

882
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:50,800
I thought you were Yoon Eunsung.

883
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,800
That's how I am now.

884
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,800
I forgot where I was

885
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:03,800
and I couldn't recognize you.

886
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,800
With all these words in my head

887
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,800
I take one step forward

888
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,800
leaving only the distance behind

889
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Answer me

890
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,800
What should I do for you?

891
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,800
I'm scared

892
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,800
I'm going to you

893
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:45,800
I know you're there in front of me

894
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,800
I told you

895
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,800
that I don't want to be with you

896
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,800
when the next step comes.

897
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,800
I think it came faster than I thought.

898
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,800
The sunset is pretty

899
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,800
just like you said.

900
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,800
Because of the sunset

901
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,800
you look even more handsome.

902
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,800
But...

903
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,800
Is it really you who's in front of me?

904
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Is this a dream?

905
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
I'm not sure anymore.

906
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,800
So I can't make any promises.

907
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,800
I'm sorry.

908
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,800
I'm sorry.

909
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,800
What's in your hand?

910
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,800
I can't see because of the curtain.

911
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,800
The image quality is low.

912
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,800
Should I buy a higher one?

913
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
Did you see my mother?

914
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,800
I didn't.

915
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,800
You're not lying, are you?

916
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,800
I'm serious.

917
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,800
What?

918
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,800
I'm serious too.

919
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,800
There she is.

920
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,800
She's not here, right?

921
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,800
She wasn't even here last night.

922
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,800
We should report her to the police.

923
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,800
I did.

924
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,800
Good job.

925
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,800
I hope she didn't go up the mountain.

926
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,800
The sun will set soon.

927
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,800
I'll go.

928
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,800
Wait.

929
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,800
I think I can find her.

930
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,800
She's gone.

931
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,800
Go a little further to the right.

932
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,800
That's the waterfront.

933
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,800
Over there.

934
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,800
Over here.

935
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,800
It's over there.

936
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,800
Go up.

937
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,800
Go up.

938
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,800
There's a hole in the sky.

939
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,800
Again?

940
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,800
There she is.

941
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,800
There she is.

942
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,800
Oh, my.

943
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,800
Oh, my.

944
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,800
I'm so happy to see you.

945
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,800
Mom.

946
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,800
Mom.

947
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,800
Are you sleeping?

948
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,800
Yes.

949
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,800
Thank you so much for today.

950
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,800
I'm so jealous.

951
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,800
Of what?

952
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,800
My father is okay now, too.

953
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,800
I can't be by his side.

954
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,800
I heard about it.

955
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,800
My father was a great person.

956
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:54,800
I didn't think I'd fall down just by looking at it.

957
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,800
So I looked at it a lot.

958
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,800
I was so worried.

959
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,800
I shouldn't have done that if I knew it would happen.

960
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,800
I know what I said to my father last.

961
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,800
I'll see you at the funeral.

962
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,800
I'm so sorry.

963
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,800
I shouldn't have said that.

964
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,800
I've never been treated like my mother.

965
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,800
Are you bragging about being a good son?

966
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,800
My mother was very cold to me when I was young.

967
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,800
My father used to hit me and make me feel bad.

968
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,800
So I grew up without my mother.

969
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,800
After I got dementia,

970
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:52,800
I brought her to the nursing home and stayed with her.

971
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,800
I'm sad that I had to fight my mother.

972
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,800
I didn't know you had such a story.

973
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:06,800
Everyone has their own life.

974
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:12,800
Everyone has their own life.

975
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,800
So you don't have to be jealous of anyone.

976
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,800
You don't have to feel guilty.

977
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,800
I'm sure you know how I feel.

978
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,800
I'm sorry.

979
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,800
I'm sorry.

980
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,800
I'm sorry.

981
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,800
I'm sorry.

982
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,800
I'm sorry.

983
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,800
I'm sorry.

984
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,800
I'm sorry.

985
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,800
I'm sorry.

986
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,800
I'm sorry.

987
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,800
I'm sorry.

988
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,800
I'm sorry.

989
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,800
I'm sorry.

990
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,800
I'm sorry.

991
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,800
I'm sorry.

992
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,800
I'm sorry.

993
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
I'm sorry.

994
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,800
I'm sorry.

995
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,800
I'm sorry.

996
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,800
I'm sorry.

997
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,800
I'm sorry.

998
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,800
I'm sorry.

999
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,800
I'm sorry.

1000
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,800
I'm sorry.

1001
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,800
I'm sorry.

1002
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,800
I'm sorry.

1003
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,800
I'm sorry.

1004
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,800
I'm sorry.

1005
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,800
I'm sorry.

1006
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,800
I'm sorry.

1007
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,800
I'm sorry.

1008
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,800
I'm sorry.

1009
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,800
I'm sorry.

1010
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,800
I'm sorry.

1011
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,800
I'm sorry.

1012
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,800
I'm sorry.

1013
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,800
I'm sorry.

1014
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,800
I'm sorry.

1015
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,800
I'm sorry.

1016
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,800
I'm sorry.

1017
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,800
I'm sorry.

1018
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,800
I'm sorry.

1019
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,800
I'm sorry.

1020
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,060
Okay.

1021
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,800
We've been scanning the Express Truck.

1022
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,600
It's aныхore should be a great idea

1023
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,800
then.

1024
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,800
What do you mean?

1025
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,800
That money should stay at home?

1026
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,800
It's kissing my nines.

1027
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,800
Even if it costs half a billion kurol,

1028
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,800
it takes about 1,500 boxes of boxes to do it.

1029
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,800
But that's not going to help one single closet.

1030
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,800
We at least need about 50,000 units of it.

1031
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,800
Would a house have a hidden compartment?

1032
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,300
Or storagefinances?

1033
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,840
the house was destroyed.

1034
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,100
There was no hidden space.

1035
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,340
Then what happened?

1036
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,740
Last night,

1037
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,640
you said something when you met Grandpa.

1038
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:31,840
What is it, Grandpa?

1039
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,340
What did you say?

1040
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,080
Miss, when the war is over,

1041
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,340
come to my house.

1042
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:41,680
My house has a guard.

1043
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,540
Come and hide there.

1044
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,340
My house has a guard?

1045
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,300
A guard?

1046
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,480
My house has such a guard?

1047
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,800
There's no such thing.

1048
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,340
You must have been out of your mind.

1049
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,900
There's something similar.

1050
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,800
When you first built my house,

1051
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,800
you said you had a panic room.

1052
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,400
That's right. I heard about it.

1053
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,700
But where is it?

1054
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:04,400
No one knows where it is

1055
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,600
and what it's about.

1056
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,840
I heard there's no hidden space

1057
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,600
in the construction design.

1058
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,700
That's true.

1059
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,940
But there's a possibility that

1060
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,000
there's a secret design.

1061
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,100
If the money is in this house,

1062
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,240
I have no way of not knowing.

1063
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,800
It's not the money for the financial aid.

1064
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,200
There's also that in this house.

1065
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,400
The secret space in the movie.

1066
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,200
It must be a panic room, you fool.

1067
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,000
I heard there's a panic room in this house.

1068
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,500
Do you not know where it is?

1069
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,640
This isn't the 5th floor. It's the 3rd floor.

1070
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,900
Everyone will come when the patrol is over.

1071
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,800
What time is it?

1072
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,000
Aren't they the ones who made a mess in the daytime?

1073
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I should've brought some shock absorbers.

1074
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,500
It's a taxi.

1075
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,100
Taxi?

1076
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,900
I heard it was a black van.

1077
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,700
Who's driving at this hour?

1078
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,740
I saw a carrier late at night.

1079
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,300
A carrier near the mountain.

1080
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,700
Isn't this the same thing we saw in the news?

1081
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,600
Press it. Should I press it?

1082
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,200
How have you been?

1083
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,800
As expected.

1084
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,500
I...

1085
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,400
I had a good dream.

1086
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,300
I'm sorry.

1087
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,200
I brought everything except the flight and hotel fee.

1088
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,200
I had a contract with a foreign apartment.

1089
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,500
I decided to return it.

1090
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,200
I'll return it once it's paid.

1091
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,700
I'm really sorry.

1092
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,400
You just...

1093
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,800
Do you know what you're doing?

1094
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
Is this something you can resolve by returning money?

1095
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,700
Mom, I know it's not.

1096
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

1097
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,500
I'm sorry.

1098
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,100
I'm sorry.

1099
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,500
I'm sorry.

1100
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,300
I'm sorry.

1101
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,100
I know it's not.

1102
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,000
I know you won't forgive me.

1103
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,400
I'm really...

1104
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,100
I'm sorry.

1105
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,300
It's late.

1106
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,200
Everyone has to sleep, so go back and sleep.

1107
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,000
Yes, but first...

1108
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,700
Why are you sleeping?

1109
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,100
I don't want to see you, so leave this house.

1110
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,600
Not this house.

1111
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,900
I'm talking about Geon-u.

1112
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Why do you have the right to tell my wife and son to leave?

1113
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
This isn't even our house.

1114
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,600
That's not wrong, Geon-u.

1115
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,500
So you're going to live with someone else?

1116
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,000
He's my son!

1117
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,400
I gave birth to him,

1118
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,800
I took him to sleep every night,

1119
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,000
and I took him to baths.

1120
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,400
Geon-u is the one who's more strict than you!

1121
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,700
What are you doing? Get up.

1122
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,400
Geon-u.

1123
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,700
We need to sort things out, right?

1124
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,900
Let's start with the title.

1125
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,700
I don't care about your age.

1126
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,100
I don't care...

1127
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,600
I do care.

1128
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,500
I'm your sister.

1129
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,500
You want me to call you sister?

1130
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,300
Why?

1131
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,900
I didn't come to live with you like before.

1132
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,100
Then...

1133
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,500
I just wanted to return what I took.

1134
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,700
And Jun-ho...

1135
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,600
Han Jun-ho, that bastard,

1136
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,500
he's trying to put everything he's done on you.

1137
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,800
You have to stop him, or you'll be in trouble.

1138
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,500
You came to tell me that?

1139
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,500
I was worried, so I came.

1140
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:56,400
I just wanted to get rid of that bastard

1141
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,800
and get married to make a big deal out of it.

1142
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,200
But I didn't expect it.

1143
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,500
I didn't know you would...

1144
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,600
Treat me so dearly.

1145
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,300
I've never received a treat like this from anyone in my life.

1146
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,600
The way you treated me...

1147
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,800
I keep remembering it.

1148
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,700
I couldn't get over it because I was so thirsty.

1149
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,200
So I came.

1150
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,900
You came to tell me that?

1151
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,200
Really? If you tell me everything,

1152
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,800
are you going to leave again?

1153
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,600
I'm your partner, right?

1154
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,700
How am I supposed to live here?

1155
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,600
No.

1156
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I have to live with you.

1157
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,100
No matter why you came here,

1158
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,500
I have to live with you.

1159
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,200
I'm never going to send you and my son anywhere.

1160
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,500
Go anywhere.

1161
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,700
I'm going to follow you to the end of the world.

1162
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,000
You're really...

1163
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,200
You don't understand what people say.

1164
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,600
I'm your sister.

1165
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,800
Shut up.

1166
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,400
Here.

1167
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,200
Try this.

1168
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,000
Here you go.

1169
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,600
I told you to apologize.

1170
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,200
As I said, the master...

1171
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,600
You're such a lady. Stop staring at me.

1172
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,700
You said you were the best.

1173
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,800
I was no joke.

1174
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,600
I heard from my husband too.

1175
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:49,000
He said he came with Buddha's head in the middle of the night.

1176
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,700
My husband was so surprised.

1177
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:54,800
He kept pressing the rice and breaking it.

1178
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,900
I told you.

1179
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,700
Chunsik needs to feed him black and gold.

1180
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:59,500
Feed him.

1181
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,800
Feed him?

1182
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,800
But is the gold statue real gold?

1183
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,000
Gold statue?

1184
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,400
I don't know.

1185
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,900
It's a mission. How does it feel?

1186
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,700
We should decide who we like.

1187
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,700
What?

1188
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,800
We'll run into each other in small towns.

1189
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,100
What stance will the members of our group take?

1190
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,000
Will they welcome us or not?

1191
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,100
Right?

1192
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,600
Like or dislike.

1193
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,600
We'll follow your decision.

1194
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,800
It's still a bit uncertain.

1195
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,800
It's uncertain.

1196
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,500
It's a bit sad.

1197
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,800
But it's also a bit new.

1198
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,800
I think I'll have to go through more.

1199
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:08,800
Anyway, the size is like a ghost, okay?

1200
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:18,800
The cutting is round brilliant cut.

1201
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,200
Weren't you at work?

1202
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,800
Yes.

1203
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,400
I left something behind.

1204
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,000
I'm going to return it.

1205
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,000
I thought about it after hearing you say it.

1206
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,600
I think I pushed you too hard.

1207
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,400
I'll return it as soon as I get to work.

1208
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,000
Right away?

1209
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,600
This isn't important right now.

1210
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,600
Don't feel pressured. I'm really fine.

1211
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,800
Okay then.

1212
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,600
What?

1213
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,600
What?

1214
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,600
I just saw it.

1215
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,600
It's a design I didn't see before.

1216
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,600
I'll analyze the trend.

1217
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,600
If you take a break from it, it's hard to keep up with it.

1218
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,100
That's right.

1219
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,600
I liked the ring.

1220
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,600
You know I'm good at things like this.

1221
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,600
I'm not good at it.

1222
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,600
I'm not good at it.

1223
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,600
You know I'm good at things like this.

1224
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,600
You didn't look. I admit it.

1225
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,600
But it's neither above nor below.

1226
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,600
Don't misunderstand or exaggerate.

1227
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,600
But can I analyze the trend for a moment?

1228
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,600
Why don't you take it and see it?

1229
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,600
The analysis is over. I'll go now.

1230
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,600
What?

1231
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,600
Haeyoon.

1232
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,600
I won't do this again.

1233
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,600
I'll just leave it here. It was here before.

1234
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,600
I have to analyze the trend.

1235
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,600
I don't know when it'll be done.

1236
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
A panic room?

1237
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,600
The one in the movie?

1238
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,600
There's no end to nuclear war.

1239
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,600
There are guns and stuff you can buy after years.

1240
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,600
I don't know about that.

1241
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,600
The chairman said there was a panic room.

1242
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,600
But no one knows where it is.

1243
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,600
What about the back?

1244
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,600
There was no such thing.

1245
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,600
There must be someone who designed it.

1246
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,600
He's gone.

1247
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,600
The son is running the design office.

1248
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,600
Then we can ask him.

1249
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,600
I did ask.

1250
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:07,600
But he doesn't know.

1251
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,600
He asked me to show it to him.

1252
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,600
He said there's no one.

1253
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,600
And he kept calling.

1254
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,600
He's not picking up.

1255
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,600
Really?

1256
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,600
What do we do?

1257
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,600
I don't think so.

1258
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,600
I think we should try to convince someone else.

1259
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,600
Who?

1260
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,600
You.

1261
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,600
Me?

1262
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,600
We meet again.

1263
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,600
What a coincidence.

1264
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,600
I know.

1265
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,600
I can't believe I met you, my savior.

1266
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,600
What about the savior?

1267
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,600
How's the building in the middle of the street?

1268
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,600
It's all thanks to you.

1269
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,600
I almost blew up the place.

1270
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,600
By the way,

1271
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,600
I heard my friend here

1272
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,600
made it really annoying.

1273
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,600
I'm sorry.

1274
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,600
I thought it'd be good

1275
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,600
if you could tell me.

1276
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,600
No, I'm sorry for asking you.

1277
01:17:52,600 --> 01:18:07,280
If the panic room was really for the

1278
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,280
The elevator?

1279
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,280
I didn't feel anything different

1280
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,280
even though I always got on it.

1281
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,280
The elevator was open-door.

1282
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,280
The space behind it looks like a wall.

1283
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,280
But it actually opens.

1284
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,280
If the front door of the elevator opens,

1285
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,280
it's a family room.

1286
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,280
But the video is just

1287
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,280
a separate space behind the wall.

1288
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,280
It looks like a panic room.

1289
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,280
I guess so.

1290
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,280
But I think it's a good idea

1291
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,280
to go check it out.

1292
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,280
Can't we just go back home?

1293
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,280
The security guard is on the run.

1294
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,280
What if he gets caught and gets sued?

1295
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,280
What if he finds out

1296
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,280
that the witch found out first?

1297
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,280
I met with your grandfather today.

1298
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,280
He's conscious and has returned home.

1299
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,280
He's still in the treatment of

1300
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:57,280
cognitive rehabilitation and memory loss.

1301
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,280
He must have run out of drugs.

1302
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,280
He's not here to get a remission.

1303
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,280
What?

1304
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,280
I knew it.

1305
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,280
What should we do?

1306
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,280
In this case, we can report the police

1307
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,280
for the crime of imprisonment

1308
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,280
and go home with the police

1309
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,280
to figure out what happened.

1310
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,280
Then we can check the elevator.

1311
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,280
Let's go together

1312
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,280
as soon as tomorrow morning.

1313
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,280
I'm sorry.

1314
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,280
You're back.

1315
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,280
No wonder.

1316
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,280
Something was wrong

1317
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,280
with you after Hong Yein left.

1318
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,280
You're coming to your senses

1319
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,280
very quickly, aren't you?

1320
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,280
But you can't do anything for a short while.

1321
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,280
You can't help out with customers,

1322
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,280
you can't move properly,

1323
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,280
you don't have a cell phone.

1324
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,280
This is hell, isn't it?

1325
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,280
That's right.

1326
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,280
This is the real hell.

1327
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,280
I'm being watched.

1328
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,280
That's why I told you to eat and sleep

1329
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,280
and forget about everything.

1330
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,280
But what if you don't eat?

1331
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,280
Oseul, did you come to my house

1332
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,280
with this plan from the start?

1333
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,280
Then would you have been here

1334
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,280
for a long time

1335
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,280
because you really liked the chairman?

1336
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,280
I'm terrible, aren't I?

1337
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,280
I want to go to my children.

1338
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,280
I'll send you.

1339
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,280
But tell me how to

1340
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,280
pay off the debt.

1341
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,280
You can't do anything

1342
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,280
for a short while

1343
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,280
without a few minutes of experience.

1344
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,280
Just tell me

1345
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,280
and everything will be fine.

1346
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,280
Tell me!

1347
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,280
I'm sorry.

1348
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,280
I'm sorry.

1349
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,280
I'm sorry.

1350
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,280
I'm sorry.

1351
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,280
I'm sorry.

1352
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,280
I'm sorry.

1353
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,280
I'm sorry.

1354
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,280
I'm sorry.

1355
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,280
I'm sorry.

1356
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,280
I'm sorry.

1357
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,280
I'm sorry.

1358
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,280
I'm sorry.

1359
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,280
I'm sorry.

1360
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,280
I'm sorry.

1361
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,280
I'm sorry.

1362
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,280
I'm sorry.

1363
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,280
What's going on?

1364
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:39,280
Mr. Park, did you call an ambulance?

1365
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,280
No, I haven't met the officer yet.

1366
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,280
Then what's going on?

1367
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,280
Is something wrong at home?

1368
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,280
What is it?

1369
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,280
What's going on?

1370
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,280
What's going on?

1371
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,280
Tell me!

1372
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,280
Move.

1373
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,280
You can't go in.

1374
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,280
It's a patient with dementia in her 80s.

1375
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,280
She's suspected of having a stroke.

1376
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,280
She's expected to be sent to the hospital.

1377
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,280
Dad!

1378
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,280
Dad!

1379
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,280
Dad!

1380
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,280
Dad!

1381
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,280
Dad!

1382
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,280
Dad!

1383
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,280
Dad!

1384
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,280
We're here.

1385
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,280
We're here.

1386
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,280
Dad!

1387
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,280
How can you do this to me?

1388
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,280
Dad!

1389
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,280
How can you do this to me?

1390
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,280
Dad, your hands are still warm.

1391
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,280
What do I do?

1392
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,280
What's going on?

1393
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,280
Excuse me.

1394
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,280
Please give me CPR.

1395
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,280
Dad!

1396
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,280
Please do something.

1397
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,280
I'm sorry. I'll move.

1398
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,280
We'll move.

1399
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,280
Dad!

1400
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,280
Dad!

1401
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,280
Dad!

1402
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,280
Dad!

1403
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,280
We have to move.

1404
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,280
Dad!

1405
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,280
Dad!

1406
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,280
Dad!

1407
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,280
Dad.

1408
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,280
Dad.

1409
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,280
Dad.

1410
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,280
Dad.

1411
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,180
is also paying attention to the situation.

1412
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,180
Chairman Hong Jeon is giving all the authority

1413
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:25,180
to his shareholder and the management of the house

1414
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:28,180
to his roommate, Ms. Mo Sook.

1415
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:31,380
But Chairman Hong Jeon is against it,

1416
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:33,880
so all of Ms. Mo's authority will be gone.

1417
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,880
The house is being destroyed.

1418
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,880
The house is being destroyed.

1419
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,880
The house is being destroyed.

1420
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,880
The house is being destroyed.

1421
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,880
The house is being destroyed.

1422
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,880
The house is being destroyed.

1423
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,880
The house is being destroyed.

1424
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,880
The house is being destroyed.

1425
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,880
The house is being destroyed.

1426
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,880
The house is being destroyed.

1427
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,880
The house is being destroyed.

1428
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,880
The house is being destroyed.

1429
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,880
The house is being destroyed.

1430
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,880
The house is being destroyed.

1431
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,100
No.

1432
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:03,780
Chairman Hong's death

1433
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:05,480
iting everything you told the chairman

1434
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,480
gives you the authority of having the fortune

1435
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,280
android brothers taken.

1436
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,680
The press will tell you

1437
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,280
that the sorry to you

1438
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,380
hadphy celebrity without the statute of conduct.

1439
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,280
Did you understand what he said?

1440
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,480
Pack up fast

1441
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,880
I think it's time to pray for the chairman's well-being.

1442
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:24,680
I think that will be enough for later.

1443
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,580
Let me know if you like the house...

1444
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:36,080
And if you want to see it for the last time.

1445
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,880
The End

1446
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:53,880
You must be happy.

1447
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,980
Your handsome son is doing well at school.

1448
01:28:55,980 --> 01:29:00,180
Yes, he's good at boxing and swimming.

1449
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:02,280
So he did something like that

1450
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,780
at the Children's Marine Corps.

1451
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,680
He even saved a baby who fell into the water.

1452
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:11,180
The End

1453
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:14,380
No, you can't!

1454
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,380
What are you doing?

1455
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:17,180
What are you doing?

1456
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:18,380
You have to do it!

1457
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,380
What are you doing?

1458
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,180
What are you doing?

1459
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:25,980
Chaerin!

1460
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:28,180
Chaerin!

1461
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,580
Chaerin!

1462
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:32,380
Chaerin!

1463
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,680
The End

1464
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,880
Why did you go in there?

1465
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:29,880
Are you okay?

1466
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,880
Come here.

1467
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,680
Chaerin!

1468
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,680
You can't go in there!

1469
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:51,180
Chaerin!

1470
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,180
You can't go in there!

1471
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,680
The End

1472
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:33,680
Thank you, Chaerin.

1473
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,680
It's you, right?

1474
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,680
I told you I wanted to save her.

1475
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,380
I'm going to go on my way after I finish my work.

1476
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,380
A treasure?

1477
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,980
My hope for Chaerin,

1478
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:45,680
whom I never thought I'd see again.

1479
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:49,880
This is the most fateful story ever.

1480
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,580
Do you want to ruin everything because of one Hong Yein?

1481
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:53,980
I got caught.

1482
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:56,080
Please keep telling Yun Eunseong about it.

1483
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,080
That way, I won't be nervous.

1484
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,480
Chaerin!

1485
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:02,180
There's something I didn't tell you.

1486
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:10,680
The End
