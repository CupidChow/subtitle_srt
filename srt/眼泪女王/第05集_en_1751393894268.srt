1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,760
training

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,120
considered luck,

3
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:45,000
the

4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,200
one

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,520
Neutral 500

6
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:23,240
Pass the Emergency

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,900
I remind you all.

8
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,500
Shake hands and leave your beginning cards ready.

9
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
One, two, three.

10
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,300
different, different.

11
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,900
What's the change?

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,160
I can be a good player,

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,080
I chicken out with younger players!

14
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,860
I'm just an issue.

15
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,340
Alright,

16
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,100
I got it.

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm sure he's been talking a lot.

18
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,120
I knew that Myeong-gyu was the head of the department.

19
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,600
He wanted to start his life again

20
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,920
by working under me.

21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,040
I begged him.

22
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,080
I was fooled.

23
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,240
After I was fooled by Myeong-gyu,

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,600
I heard that Myeong-gyu was going to start his own company

25
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,000
with my money and check-in

26
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,280
when he hid in the South Sea with Director Oh.

27
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,720
I should have taken care of him.

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,760
I was the one who taught him.

29
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,480
But I had no intention

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,840
to work in his company.

31
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,160
I was so sorry to have kept you waiting

32
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,480
forever because you promised to do it.

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,760
I feared you might get the wrong idea.

34
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,140
The branch manager

35
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
You always took care of me like a family.

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm willing to sacrifice my life for you.

37
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Thank you.

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Oh.

40
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Really?

41
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Okay, come here.

42
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Boss.

43
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
The kids took the money from the bookshop.

44
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
And they were attacked by the subordinates.

45
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
They were injured?

46
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
No, they didn't say anything like that.

47
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
But...

48
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
They lost all the money in the safe.

49
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
They were injured?

50
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
I think they're fine.

51
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
I think they're fine.

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
And...

53
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
They caught a man in the shop.

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
But he couldn't be treated.

55
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
What should we do?

56
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,200
If the patient comes to the emergency room after committing a crime,

57
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,200
the doctors will report to the police.

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,200
So I kept the hospital closed so that I could have surgery.

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm sure Myeong-gyu kept the hospital closed too.

60
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
I'll put it on Du-young.

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Motorbikes are better.

62
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
What's wrong?

63
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Good job.

64
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Hey.

65
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Good job.

66
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Oh, yes.

67
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
You should go to bed.

68
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
And come to the shop for lunch.

69
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
What for?

70
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
To give you food.

71
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Oh.

72
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
You don't want to?

73
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
I don't usually eat lunch.

74
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Come.

75
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Yes.

76
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Go.

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Go.

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Are you okay?

79
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I lost the money in the safe.

80
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Are you okay?

82
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Yes.

83
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Are you okay?

84
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Du-young.

85
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
I'll move the box to you.

86
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
You should go to bed first.

87
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
You really didn't get hurt, did you?

88
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
No.

89
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
You haven't done it yet?

92
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
You're a little short-tempered.

93
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
You have cool eyes.

94
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Oh, my.

95
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,200
If the car they took was a cannon car or a car-catcher,

96
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
can you track how far the car went with a CCTV camera?

97
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,200
It's not impossible, but it will take a long time.

98
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,200
The police will find the car in the frame.

99
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,200
The car will be found in the police frame.

100
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
CCTV cameras should be searched in the control center.

101
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
The control center is different from each department.

102
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
I need some time to find the person.

103
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
You don't have to spend a lot of money.

104
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Do it as soon as possible.

105
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Yes.

106
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Find out who the owner of the book store is.

107
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
If it's Mr. Choi, you can find the address of the house.

108
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Yes.

109
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
I'll talk to Du-young for a while.

110
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Yes.

111
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Did you hear that?

112
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Yes.

113
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Why did you just let the culprit go?

114
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Maybe he didn't have time to pay the money.

115
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
It's a long story.

116
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,200
People who think positively don't have any development.

117
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Think negatively.

118
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,200
They're afraid that they're using their power to catch me.

119
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
They're trying to get their heads around me.

120
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
They're trying to get their heads around you?

121
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Add them to the hospital.

122
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Put them on a patient's clothes and put them on the scene.

123
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Yes.

124
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Put them on Jun-min's clothes, too.

125
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Director Kim, I'm sorry.

126
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
I told you to think negatively.

127
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Mr. Choi might have taken off his clothes.

128
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Jun-min is afraid, so he can't control his expression.

130
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
He might notice it even if he sees it from afar.

131
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,200
It's better not to know.

132
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
I don't think Hwang Yang-jung will move because of him.

133
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I'm going to send Du-young.

134
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,200
I told you to move widely on the motorcycle.

135
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Yes.

136
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Go back and forth and catch him.

137
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Yes.

138
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
It's going to be fun.

139
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
I slept well.

141
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Did you sleep well?

142
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Yes.

143
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Why don't you take a rest?

144
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I slept well.

145
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I have something to tell you.

146
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Han Jun-won is a lonely child.

147
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
He's always in the shadow of his heart.

148
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
That's why he acts indiscriminately.

149
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,200
After I met you and Woo-jin, Hyun-joo became very bright.

150
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm very grateful to you two.

151
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
It's good to be with Hyun-joo.

152
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,200
And the money I gave you.

153
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I don't have it anymore.

154
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Where did you go?

155
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I just said it.

156
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Why?

157
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Do you know how much money I brought from the bookstore yesterday?

158
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I gave you the bonus because I paid the money.

159
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I want to have it because I work fairly.

160
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
You worked fairly.

161
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
The money you brought is quite a lot.

162
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,200
And you and I are no longer in the financial business.

163
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I'll take my mother to a good cafe in Jeju Island.

164
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I'll invest everything.

165
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Thank you very much.

166
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,200
But I want to help you catch Kim Myeong-gil.

167
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I've helped you enough.

168
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
No, I want to be with you until the end.

169
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Why?

170
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I have to repay your kindness.

171
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
I've paid you enough.

172
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm not enough yet.

173
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,200
It's not over until it's over.

174
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Okay.

175
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,200
It's not over until it's over.

176
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Let's have a drink together.

177
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,200
I don't drink.

178
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I'll pour you a drink instead.

179
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Go upstairs.

180
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Yes.

181
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Okay.

182
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Put it on the top of the pepper paste and eat it with soy sauce.

183
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
It's delicious.

184
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
It's natural.

185
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,200
This fish may be a little greasy because it has a lot of fat.

186
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,200
But this natural fish has a lot of fat.

187
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,200
The taste of this fish is very...

188
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
It's very delicious.

189
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,200
It's well-cooked.

190
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Do you like sashimi?

191
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,200
I used to be a YouTuber.

192
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,200
I stopped because I couldn't get over 1,000 subscribers.

193
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
I've never eaten this long.

194
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
It's very delicious.

195
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,200
It's the best yellowtail I've ever eaten.

196
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
I like it.

197
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
You're amazing.

198
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
You've lived hard.

199
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
I'll subscribe.

200
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
I saw it all.

201
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
You worked hard yesterday.

202
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I called you to feed you.

203
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Thank you.

204
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
What are you going to do now?

205
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
I'll kill the fish.

206
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I'll catch the one who looks like a fat cat and give it to you.

207
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,200
That fat cat is the cleaner of Kim Myung-gil.

208
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
If Kim Myung-gil is in trouble,

209
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,200
he will be the one who will pay for it and threaten him.

210
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,200
If you find the body that Kim Myung-gil ordered, it's over.

211
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
If you find the body, you can't stop him with money.

212
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Smile Capital is over.

213
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
That's right.

214
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,200
What should I find if I can't find the body?

215
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Find the murder weapon or video that you used when you killed him.

216
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
This is a defense arm.

217
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
This is a training arm.

218
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Sorry.

219
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Sit down.

220
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm Lee Do-young.

221
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
I heard about you. Nice to meet you.

222
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
I'm Kim Geon-woo.

223
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
I'm Hong Woo-jin.

224
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
The lawyers are different.

225
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,200
I went to the underground portal that day.

226
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
I ran away as soon as I got a call.

227
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
I arrived late because I lived far away.

228
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,200
But I was impressed by the gangsters.

229
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,200
They were really good at fighting.

230
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,200
You also dreamed of becoming a world champion.

231
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Why are you talking about me?

232
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Why?

233
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Can you play today?

234
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
What?

235
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
The sales director.

236
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Talk to me when you two are together.

237
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Why? The kids will run with you.

238
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
What are you talking about? Why would they run?

239
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
What's the problem?

240
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
They are all accomplices because of the police.

241
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Why are you talking to me?

242
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
The kids will run.

243
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,200
If you get a certificate, you can't go back to the ring.

244
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Do you understand?

245
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Yes.

246
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Why are you fighting with Kim Myung-gil?

247
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
I killed my kids, so I have to pay them back.

248
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,200
You might die fighting with Kim Myung-gil.

249
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Aren't you scared?

250
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm not scared of dying.

251
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I'm scared of not killing them.

252
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
What are you going to do?

253
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
We have to go.

254
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Me too.

255
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Why?

256
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Kim Myung-gil is a really bad guy.

257
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,200
If it weren't for you, my family would be ruined.

258
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I can only do what I can do.

259
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I want to help them to the end.

260
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Me too.

261
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
I believe our marine duo will be of great help.

262
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Did you guys come from the marine team?

263
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Yes.

264
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Are you from the marine team?

265
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm from the marine team, and you're from the marine team.

266
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Victory!

267
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Why do you keep telling me to go back to the ring?

268
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
We're just getting to know each other.

269
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Get off the car.

270
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Give me the keys.

271
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
You're not getting off?

272
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
I want to call you senior.

273
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
You're making me stand up.

274
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Get off.

275
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,200
It's the eternal dawn of the marine team.

276
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Please forgive me.

277
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,200
You're trying to win me over, aren't you?

278
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm still thinking about winning the marine team.

279
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Senior, this guy is a little out of his mind.

280
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Please forgive him.

281
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
What's that?

282
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
He's a little too much of a man.

283
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
What's the meaning of the word, out of his mind?

284
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
It's the pride of the marine team.

285
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Please forgive me.

286
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
He's out of his mind.

287
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Please forgive me.

288
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
It's the 570th day.

289
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Are you done?

290
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Senior, victory!

291
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Are you going too?

292
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Do you think I can't fight?

293
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
I asked you because I was worried you'd be worried.

294
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
I started this.

295
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
I'm going to see the end.

296
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Okay.

297
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Then we're going to dinner tonight.

298
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Call me when Du-young is in business.

299
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,200
I'll wait in front of the hospital and go in when you call me.

300
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Okay.

301
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Why wait and go in?

302
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Du-young is in business, and if there are gangsters, he's aware.

303
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
That means there are gangsters in the hospital.

304
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Isn't it dangerous for Du-young to go alone?

305
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
It's okay. He's fast.

306
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Isn't it safer to just go to the hospital and catch Kim Jun-min together?

307
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,200
If we know we're moving, we'll solve all the problems.

308
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Then we die.

309
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
We can't play games.

310
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
We have to split up and hit at the same time.

311
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
It's dangerous, right?

312
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
That's the only way to win.

313
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm fine riding a motorcycle.

314
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,200
If you're in trouble, you can run away.

315
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
What should we do?

316
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Can you ride a motorcycle?

317
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
No.

318
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Sing-Sing is fast, too.

319
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
What?

320
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
No.

321
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I'll take the kids.

322
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
They might need it in the hospital.

323
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
I'll go with Du-young. I'll ride a motorcycle.

324
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Okay.

325
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Shall we eat?

326
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Yes.

327
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Hyun-Joo, are you riding a motorcycle?

328
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Yes.

329
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
What are you riding?

330
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm riding a naked.

331
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Don't we look alike?

332
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Right?

333
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
I don't like it.

334
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Why are you cursing?

335
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Where did you learn to be fast?

336
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I told you not to talk about the army.

337
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Stop it.

338
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Hey, Min-Dong.

339
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Give me some soup and rice.

340
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Okay.

341
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Du-young.

342
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
How are you?

343
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
I'm fine.

344
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
I'm going to ride this.

345
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Hello.

346
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
I've prepared this.

347
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
It's nice.

348
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Have you ridden a motorcycle before?

349
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I rode it once in the past.

350
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
I've ridden it before.

351
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Did you learn how to hold a knife in the army?

352
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Hold it.

353
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
No.

354
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
You didn't learn it?

355
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
No.

356
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Hold it for now.

357
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Sir, we don't want to use a knife.

358
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Who's going to use a knife?

359
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Didn't you just give it to me?

360
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I'll do my best.

361
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
You need to know how to use a knife

362
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
to read the thoughts of the people who use it.

363
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
You need to read the thoughts to win.

364
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
You scared me.

365
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Let's see.

366
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
When you get used to it,

367
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
this is the fastest.

368
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
It suits you.

369
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
The sashimi knife

370
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
doesn't have a shield between the handle and the blade.

371
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
This knife isn't made to stab.

372
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Look.

373
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
If you stab it hard,

374
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
the hand will slip forward

375
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
and the fingers of the blade will be cut off.

376
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
To stab it deeply,

377
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
you need to support the back of the handle.

378
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
That way,

379
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
it won't slip in.

380
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
If you hold the knife like this,

381
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
what do you think you're doing?

382
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I think I'm trying to see the back of my hand or wrist.

383
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
That's right.

384
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
It's not a deep attack.

385
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
When you hit it with boxing,

386
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,200
the outboxer will jab from a distance.

387
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
One more time.

388
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
It's okay.

389
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
If you support the back of your handle with both hands,

390
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
you're trying to kill me, right?

391
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,200
This is because you're pressing the back of the handle with your thumb.

392
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
It won't slip even if you use a lot of strength.

393
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
If you hold the knife like this,

394
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
you're using the knife.

395
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Just stab it as you see it.

396
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Don't press it too hard.

397
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
It's okay.

398
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
What's wrong with you?

399
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Turn it around.

400
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Let me see.

401
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Aren't you going to say hello?

402
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
You bastard.

403
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
You bastard.

404
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
You bastard.

405
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
You bastard.

406
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
You bastard.

407
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
You bastard.

408
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Let's wait here.

409
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Let's wait here.

410
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
How hot is it?

411
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
It's 603 degrees.

412
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Go inside the car.

413
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
It's hot.

414
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
What should we do?

415
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Wait a little longer.

416
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I'll go.

417
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Thank you.

418
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Drink it and go inside.

419
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
If you want to survive on this floor,

420
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
you have to sell everything you have.

421
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Your fist,

422
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
your soul,

423
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
your dream.

424
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
If you sell everything, you won't die.

425
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
But no matter what happens,

426
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
don't sell your family and friends.

427
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
If you're going to live like that, just die.

428
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Yes.

429
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
I'll go to the hospital later

430
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
and tell you to run away.

431
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
You can run away without saying a word.

432
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
I'll take care of it.

433
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Aren't you going to answer?

434
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Didn't you just say

435
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
not to abandon your family and friends?

436
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
I'm a criminal.

437
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
We're on the same boat now,

438
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
but you and I are not family.

439
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
We won't meet after this.

440
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
So don't think about

441
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
getting attached to something for nothing.

442
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Okay?

443
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Okay?

444
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Yes.

445
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Yes.

446
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Kim Jun-min is here.

447
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
What are you going to do?

448
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Mister, what are you going to do?

449
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Can you hear me?

450
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Answer me.

451
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
I'm going to answer.

452
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
What's wrong with you?

453
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
What's wrong with you?

454
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Hey, answer the phone.

455
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Answer the phone.

456
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Answer the phone.

457
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Answer the phone.

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,620

Hurry up!

465
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,480
You scumbag!

466
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,760
You scumbag!

467
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Are you okay?

468
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Yes.

469
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Are you okay?

470
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Okay.

471
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Let's go.

472
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Yes.

473
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Go.

474
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
It's the head of the department.

475
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Go up.

476
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Okay, let's go up.

477
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Go.

478
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
What's this?

479
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Go.

480
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Let's go.

481
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Go.

482
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Go.

483
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Go.

484
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Hello.

485
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Go.

486
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Can you clean this up?

487
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Yes.

488
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Be careful.

489
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Where's the salt?

490
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Salt?

491
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
In the office.

492
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Bring some salt.

493
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Find Yang Dong and put it in.

494
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Okay.

495
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Let's go.

496
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
It's in the corner.

497
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Okay.

498
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Hyun-joon, are you okay?

499
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Yes.

500
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Are you okay?

501
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Yes.

502
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
We caught Lim Jung-woo.

503
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
Where's Kim Jun-min?

504
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
I didn't see him outside.

505
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
He was caught.

506
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Did you kill him?

507
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Yes.

508
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Let's go get some salt.

509
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Find him.

510
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Okay.

511
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I think we can use this.

512
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Where's the water?

513
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I saw it downstairs.

514
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Let's go down.

515
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Hyun-joon, let's go.

516
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Hey.

517
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
I'll be there in five minutes.

518
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Shake it a little.

519
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,200
And tell Hyun-joon and the others to watch.

520
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
What?

521
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Tell Hyun-joon to watch too.

522
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
He's telling me to watch Hyun-joon too.

523
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Why?

524
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Will Hyun-joon be okay?

525
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Are you here?

526
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,200
This way.

527
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Stop.

528
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Let's go up the stairs.

529
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
There's no camera there.

530
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Why?

531
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
There's no camera there.

532
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
What are you talking about?

533
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Is there a camera outside the hospital building?

534
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
That's where we need to go.

535
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Where's Jun-min?

536
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
He's still in there.

537
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Go to the apartment management team

538
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
and get the numbers of the people who hit Jun-min.

539
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Yes.

540
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Wait.

541
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
How much did you put in?

542
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Didn't you say you were going to put in all of it?

543
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
That's too much.

544
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Just put it all in.

545
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
You said you were going to answer.

546
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Okay.

547
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
What are you doing?

548
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
I'm making salt water.

549
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Salt water.

550
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Okay.

551
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Come and look at this.

552
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Why?

553
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
The boss told me to look.

554
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,200
I hate people who open their mouths and touch them again.

555
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,200
So I decided to tell you everything.

556
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,200
If you close your mouth and say you're going to tell me,

557
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
I'll cut your mouth off with a knife.

558
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Do you understand?

559
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Only Andrew Couto's sauceß

560
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I prepared his soda too.

561
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,160
out this city

562
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,800
now,

563
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,960
this city

564
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,800
I'm wearing

565
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,540
clothes

566
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,600
É

567
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,000
hey

568
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,100
a

569
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,640
Occasionally

570
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:16,760
mother

571
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,480
my

572
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,040
my

573
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,320
mother

574
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,080
my

575
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,480
I

576
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,800
I

577
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,120
I

578
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,320
I

579
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,080
I

580
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,560
She knew about us…

581
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,440
I told you, she didn't know about us.

582
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,080
What?

583
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,800
She didn't know did she.

584
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,080
And I also told her that I'm not a beautiful woman,

585
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:05,840
and that 개�max

586
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
What did she say?

587
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,440
Thatrando

588
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,760
Little Hyang

589
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
I'm not dead yet.

590
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,640
Someone has to die.

591
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,640
I can't guarantee that I'm alive.

592
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
We can win.

593
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Why do you always think negatively?

594
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
Hyeon-Joo.

595
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
It's okay.

596
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
Hyeon-Joo.

597
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
Please take care of Hyeon-Joo.

598
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Yes, sir.

599
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,640
You bastard.

600
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
Geon-Woo.

601
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
Yes, sir.

602
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:57,640
If you and Myeong-Gil fight,

603
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,640
can you protect us?

604
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
I'll protect you till the end.

605
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Thank you.

606
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
I'll teach you one thing

607
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,640
even if you don't have much time.

608
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,640
To win against a group of people,

609
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
you need two things.

610
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,640
Divide and divide.

611
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
People have to trust people

612
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,640
who know and sympathize with them.

613
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,640
If you can't gain personal trust,

614
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,640
you can't divide the group.

615
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
Take this off.

616
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
You're not dead yet?

617
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
I'm not dead yet.

618
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
I think you know Myeong-Gil

619
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,640
the best among Myeong-Gil's men.

620
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,640
Myeong-Gil is a very rough and cruel man.

621
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,640
But he treats people like ghosts.

622
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
He knows the way to get money.

623
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,640
So Kim Jin-Min and Kang In-Beom

624
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
will truly trust you.

625
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
But you're smart.

626
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,640
You know Myeong-Gil better than them.

627
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Myeong-Gil is not a man of heart.

628
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
He's a man of heart.

629
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,640
He always knows how to use people.

630
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,640
You know that, but you don't have to be Myeong-Gil.

631
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,640
Why?

632
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,640
Money is the first reason.

633
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Myeong-Gil got a salary

634
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,640
from a big company for five years.

635
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
He's a man who graduated from the police

636
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,640
and wanted to have power.

637
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
He's a man of heart.

638
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,640
He should make money.

639
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
That way, he won't lose his dignity.

640
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,640
But the second reason

641
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,640
why you went under Myeong-Gil is

642
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
that you were confident

643
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
that you wouldn't be used by Myeong-Gil.

644
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
You were sure

645
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
that you wouldn't lose to a criminal like him.

646
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,640
If Myeong-Gil had a motive to kill you,

647
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
you could go to him

648
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,640
and take the money

649
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,640
and run away to Southeast Asia.

650
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
You have a good chance.

651
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,640
But if I take a picture of you

652
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,640
and send it to Myeong-Gil,

653
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
and tell me the names of the people

654
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
who Myeong-Gil ordered to kill,

655
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
I will believe Myeong-Gil.

656
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,640
Because if you look at your condition now,

657
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,640
you have a perfect motive.

658
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,640
Then Myeong-Gil will send the people

659
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
who sent you to find you

660
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,640
and the people who killed you

661
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,640
to the hunting dogs

662
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,640
so that no one knows.

663
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,640
They won't give you

664
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,640
time to explain to Myeong-Gil.

665
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
Myeong-Gil told you not to give them time.

666
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,640
Myeong-Gil is not interested in the truth.

667
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
It's safer to just ask you.

668
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
Anyway, the person who knows the most

669
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
about the crimes Myeong-Gil committed

670
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,640
is not Kim Jong-Min or Kang In-beom.

671
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,640
It's you.

672
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
You know Myeong-Gil as well as I do.

673
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,640
Even if I

674
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,640
ask you to be suspicious

675
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,640
for a very short time,

676
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,640
I will kill you.

677
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,640
Why...

678
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,640
Why would I die?

679
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,640
You bastard!

680
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,640
Stop it!

681
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
I told you not to give them time.

682
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,640
I told you not to give them time.

683
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,640
Listen to me.

684
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,640
If you don't get it right now,

685
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,640
you will die.

686
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,640
I know everything you know.

687
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
Then I will take the money

688
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
you will have to live with

689
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
and send you to a safe country.

690
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Myeong-Gil learned everything from me.

691
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
I know everything

692
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,640
about the places Myeong-Gil doesn't know.

693
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,640
I promise you.

694
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,640
You know what's best for you?

695
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
Think of it as now.

696
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,640
How much

697
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,640
will you give me if I give you?

698
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,640
Answer me honestly.

699
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,640
I will finish Myeong-Gil and Smile Capita

700
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,640
in one piece.

701
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,640
I will send you to Guam after work.

702
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,640
I know some people there.

703
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,640
I will do everything

704
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,640
to start a new life there.

705
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
Give me the clothes.

706
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,640
How long have you been working for Myeong-Gil?

707
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,640
Five years.

708
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,640
What is your job exactly?

709
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,640
The illegal work done by CEO Kim

710
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,640
prevents police from investigating.

711
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,640
If things get too serious,

712
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,640
we will stop them.

713
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
What about the one-on-one?

714
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,640
If things get too serious,

715
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
I will go with In-Beom.

716
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,640
Most of the companies

717
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,640
that CEO Kim runs

718
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,640
are the same.

719
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,640
If things get too serious...

720
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,640
Well...

721
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,640
I will go with In-Beom.

722
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,640
If things get too serious,

723
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,640
I will go with In-Beom.

724
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,640
Are you filming a video?

725
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,640
You threatened the I-LAND Group.

726
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,640
What did you do?

727
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,640
CEO Kim told me to do it.

728
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,640
I didn't ask who told you to do it.

729
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,640
What did you do?

730
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,640
I caught the I-LAND Group's leader

731
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,640
and filmed it.

732
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,640
What?

733
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,640
I just took off my clothes

734
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,640
and filmed it.

735
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,640
Why?

736
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,640
Tell me about it from the beginning.

737
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,640
There is a boutique hotel

738
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,640
that goes up to the 40th floor of Gangnam.

739
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,640
The company was closed

740
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,640
after the pandemic.

741
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,640
CEO Kim heard that

742
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,640
the I-LAND Group leader

743
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,640
was going to take over the company.

744
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,640
From whom?

745
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,640
The building was abandoned

746
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,640
for too long and was abandoned,

747
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,640
so he decided to move to Seoul.

748
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,640
He found a rich man

749
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,640
and played golf with CEO Kim.

750
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,640
The congressman recommended

751
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,640
CEO Kim to the mayor.

752
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,640
CEO Kim's dream is

753
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,640
to build a casino in the hotel.

754
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,640
CEO Kim was excited

755
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,640
because the foreign casino

756
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,640
in Seoul City

757
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,640
would be opened soon.

758
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,640
But the I-LAND Group leader

759
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,640
suddenly tried to step down

760
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,640
and made him kneel down

761
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,640
to make him kneel down.

762
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,640
How many people

763
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,640
did you film?

764
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
50 people.

765
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,640
The video is

766
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,640
stored by Myeong-gyu.

767
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,640
Yes.

768
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,640
The foreign drug store

769
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,640
is all money.

770
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,640
And

771
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,640
the money

772
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,640
is never shared.

773
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,640
Where is the money?

774
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,640
It's stored in a small safe

775
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,640
in CEO Kim's bedroom.

776
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,640
But the safe

777
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,640
is a German smart safe.

778
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,640
If you open

779
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,640
the right-hand side of the screen

780
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,640
and if there is a problem,

781
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,640
you can adjust it by phone

782
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,640
and burn the safe

783
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,640
that is stored in the safe.

784
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,640
There is a liquid fuel

785
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,640
in the ceiling of the safe.

786
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,640
If you press the button,

787
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,640
it will open.

788
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,640
The hard is

789
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,640
the black one.

790
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,640
It's a weapon

791
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,640
if you have it,

792
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,640
but it's a evidence

793
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,640
if the police take it.

794
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,640
Is the drug store

795
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,640
a pawnshop?

796
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,640
Yes.

797
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,640
Where is the person?

798
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,640
I know there are about 30 people.

799
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,640
Call me more when you need me.

800
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,640
Who is the head?

801
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,640
It's CEO Kim's

802
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,640
white card.

803
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,640
He was a professional player

804
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,640
but he was not

805
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,640
able to play the game.

806
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,640
I'm sorry.

807
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
I'm sorry.

808
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,640
I'm sorry.

809
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,640
I'm sorry.

810
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,640
I'm sorry.

811
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,640
I heard that he was a professional player

812
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,640
but he killed someone

813
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,640
during the game

814
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,640
and his player's role was eliminated.

815
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,640
I heard that CEO Kim was

816
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,640
scammed.

817
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,640
How did you deal with the body?

818
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,640
Manager Jung will sort it out.

819
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,640
Tell me what you know.

820
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,640
About three years ago,

821
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,640
CEO Kim got drunk

822
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,640
and got angry

823
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,640
and killed someone.

824
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
I was nearby

825
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,640
and was handling the situation

826
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,640
until Manager Jung came.

827
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,640
Manager Jung called a three-ton

828
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,640
water tank

829
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,640
and a sashimi truck

830
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,640
to take the body.

831
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,640
Manager Jung and the reporter

832
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,640
were talking

833
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
and I thought

834
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,640
it was a company

835
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,640
that was still in use.

836
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,640
I don't remember

837
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,640
the name

838
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,640
because it's been a long time.

839
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,640
Okay.

840
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,640
I know a hospital in Incheon.

841
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,640
I'll call an ambulance.

842
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,640
You can go and rest.

843
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,640
When you're done

844
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,640
and settled,

845
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,640
I'll send you the passport

846
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,640
and the plane.

847
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,640
Don't contact anyone.

848
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,640
I'll find Kim Myeong-gyu.

849
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,640
I'll take your phone.

850
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,640
Let me ask you one more thing.

851
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,640
Where is the source of Myeong-gyu's

852
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,640
information?

853
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,640
That's only the person who did it.

854
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,640
What's the relationship?

855
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,640
The only person Kim Myeong-gyu

856
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,640
trusts is Inbeom.

857
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,640
They met when they were in prison

858
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,640
and I heard that

859
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,640
they saved each other's lives

860
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,640
several times.

861
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,640
Inbeom will even sacrifice his life.

862
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,640
I don't know everything about Kim Myeong-gyu

863
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,640
but I'm sure

864
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,640
that he's his brother.

865
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,640
I'm sorry.

866
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,640
I'm sorry.

867
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,640
I'm sorry.

868
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,640
I'm sorry.

869
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,640
I'm sorry.

870
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,640
I'm sorry.

871
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,640
I'm sorry.

872
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,640
I'm sorry.

873
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,640
I'm sorry.

874
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,640
I'm sorry.

875
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,640
I'm sorry.

876
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,640
I'm sorry.

877
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,640
I'm sorry.

878
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,640
I'm sorry.

879
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,640
I'm sorry.

880
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,640
I'm sorry.

881
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,640
I'm sorry.

882
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,640
I'm sorry.

883
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,640
I'm sorry.

884
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,640
I'm sorry.

885
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,640
I'm sorry.

886
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,640
I'm sorry.

887
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,640
I'm sorry.

888
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,640
I'm sorry.

889
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,640
I'm sorry.

890
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,640
I'm sorry.

891
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,640
I'm sorry.

892
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,640
I'm sorry.

893
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,640
I'm sorry.

894
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,640
I'm sorry.

895
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,640
I'm sorry.

896
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,640
I'm sorry.

897
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,640
I'm sorry.

898
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,640
I'm sorry.

899
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,640
I'm sorry.

900
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,640
I'm sorry.

901
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,640
I'm sorry.

902
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,640
I'm sorry.

903
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,640
I'm sorry.

904
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,640
I'm sorry.

905
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,640
I'm sorry.

906
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,640
I'm sorry.

907
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,640
I'm sorry.

908
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,640
I'm sorry.

909
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,640
I'm sorry.

910
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,640
I'm sorry.

911
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,640
I'm sorry.

912
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,640
I'm sorry.

913
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,640
I'm sorry.

914
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,640
I'm sorry.

915
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,640
I'm sorry.

916
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,640
I'm sorry.

917
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,640
I'm sorry.

918
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,640
I'm sorry.

919
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,640
I'm sorry.

920
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,640
I'm sorry.

921
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,640
I'm sorry.

922
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,640
I'm sorry.

923
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,640
I'm sorry.

924
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,640
I'm sorry.

925
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,640
I'm sorry.

926
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,640
I'm sorry.

927
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,640
I'm sorry.

928
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,640
I'm sorry.

929
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,640
I'm sorry.

930
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,640
I'm sorry.

931
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,640
I'm sorry.

932
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,640
I'm sorry.

933
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,640

941
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,640
I'm sorry.

942
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,640
I'm sorry.

943
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,640
I'm sorry.
