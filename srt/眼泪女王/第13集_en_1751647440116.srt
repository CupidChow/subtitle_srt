1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is my house.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Come in.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Here.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is my secret space.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you turn the handle and press this button...

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Here. How is it?

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There's nothing here.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Look at this. It's a piece of furniture that's been moved.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It doesn't look old.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
My father.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I think he hid something here.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I guess he was hit by her again.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You hid this space from your children.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You killed my father, didn't you?

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why?

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's because you took all the money and my father disappeared.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Where did you leave all that money?

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Even in the yard where my father died, money, money.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Poor thing, our chairman.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Stop talking nonsense.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Get out of this house right now.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you want to kick me out of the house,

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you should go to court and get a criminal record.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You know what I mean, right?

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Are you sure?

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Shouldn't we get out if we're asked to?

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We need a procedure, but you have to go anyway.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's something we have to do.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We're all going to come home now.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're going to stay?

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why?

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We lived in a house for over 20 years.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's how much money we have.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We'll come back.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's live together.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hyein.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Grandpa.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It would have been better if I could see your face and talk to you.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm glad I can leave my story like this.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Like a basement room that opens for a moment a day,

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
my mind comes back for a very short time.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't think of a lot of things every time.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't remember anything and I just regret it.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've been saving up money all my life,

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
trying to avoid losing the money I saved,

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and I didn't cover it up and I fell.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So I spent most of my life.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So what's left?

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I want to give you this confession that I lived wrong.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want you to live a different life than mine.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So I sincerely wish you a happy ending.

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I love you all.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And I'm sorry.

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You have to eat something warm.

59
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I have to.

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you want to go in the car if you're okay?

62
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No.

63
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I feel very strange right now.

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I feel like I'm rehearsing before I go on stage.

65
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Rehearsal?

66
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Death rehearsal?

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Death is a very specific consciousness.

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
All the family comes and digs the ground,

69
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
buries the coffin there,

70
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
eats rice soup under the sewers,

71
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
cries in the grave,

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and when time comes, everyone goes back to their homes.

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll be the only one left.

74
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You know.

75
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The third daughter who was a witness in the hospital.

76
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's already over.

77
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's not strange if I die tonight,

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
but if I die tonight, my family will be in danger.

79
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Isn't that a bit of an image of the family?

80
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So you were worried about that?

81
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What if you get a death wish?

82
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No.

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I kept thinking about living.

84
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The sunlight is so bright.

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The clouds are so soft and the birds are so pretty.

86
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I wish the world was as good as people teasing.

87
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I want to live, too.

88
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I want to live, too.

89
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I want to live, too.

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I won't let you go.

91
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Here's my secret space.

95
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you turn the handle and press this button,

96
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

97
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I told you.

98
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I loved you in my own way.

99
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll protect you with this money.

100
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll protect you with this money.

101
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll protect you with this money.

102
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll protect you with this money.

103
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'll protect you with this money.

104
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll protect you with this money.

105
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll protect you with this money.

106
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll protect you with this money.

107
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll protect you with this money.

108
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll protect you with this money.

109
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll protect you with this money.

110
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll protect you with this money.

111
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll protect you with this money.

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll protect you with this money.

113
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll protect you with this money.

114
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,880
I'm dès Wei

115
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
tutto como tömer

116
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,000
Please take good care of my husband.

117
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,740
Let him rest in peace.

118
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,500
Thank you.

119
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,320
I hope it goes well.

120
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
It'll be all good when I see him.

121
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,660
Yes, thank you.

122
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,960
Look.

123
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,960
21% of Chairman Hong's share

124
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,900
was given to a woman named Oh Su-ri.

125
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,760
But as Chairman Hong passed away,

126
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,360
it became our house.

127
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,240
And now, the share of Yoon Eun-sung's family

128
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,840
was 59.1%,

129
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,440
but it's reduced to 38.1%.

130
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,740
And the share of the house

131
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,380
is 34.7%

132
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,720
if the share of the house is removed.

133
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,180
So the difference in share is 3.4%.

134
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,880
Wow, that's a big change.

135
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,940
How do you know all this?

136
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,140
I'm a member of the club.

137
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,740
What club?

138
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,780
The Queens Small and Medium Group.

139
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,940
The members of our club are also

140
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,620
thinking about how to fight the competition.

141
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,580
They're thinking about it.

142
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,960
What?

143
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,520
There's a lot to think about.

144
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,620
But this is a very important question.

145
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,700
What will happen to Hyun-woo?

146
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,800
What do you mean?

147
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,700
Honestly, after the house was ruined,

148
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,960
Hyun-woo did everything he could.

149
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,940
I think there will be a chance for him to do something.

150
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,100
Like a housewarming party.

151
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,960
Or Hyun-woo can be the president

152
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,600
instead of the chairman.

153
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,200
I don't have much to ask of you.

154
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,240
Can you do me a favor?

155
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,840
Well...

156
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,440
What is it?

157
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,380
If you ever ask me who your father is,

158
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,480
don't mention my name.

159
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,920
Why not?

160
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,880
Eun-jae, wait for me.

161
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,460
What will you do for us this holiday?

162
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,100
You're too reliable for us.

163
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,400
Looks like they've had great things to say.

164
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,160
Good things will happen if you go to Seoul.

165
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,900
May I?

166
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:19,900
I'm sorry.

167
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Excuse me.

168
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
This liver.

169
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
This was originally very weak.

170
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,900
But there's a way to turn a bitter liver that's weak to eat into a sweet liver.

171
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
What is it?

172
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
It's called a liver.

173
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Let's pour some soy sauce on the rib.

174
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,900
So if you cover the bottom of your mouth and leave it, it gets sweet like this.

175
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Try it.

176
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,900
It's sweet.

177
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,900
This guy's life is bitter and trembling like a liver.

178
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,900
It's hard to live with a bitter liver.

179
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,900
I don't think I can live anymore.

180
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:15,900
But if you just hold on, you'll get better and you'll get the strength to live again.

181
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,900
Isn't that right?

182
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,900
Hey, hey, hey, you come here and have a drink.

183
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Oh, yes.

184
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Yes, yes.

185
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
I thought you were from Germany.

186
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Wait a minute.

187
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Hello?

188
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:06,900
I'm sorry.

189
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
So you can get surgery?

190
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Yes.

191
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Why?

192
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,900
What was hard about Hyein's case was that she couldn't do the surgery of opening her brain.

193
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,900
She can do a surgery that destroys the central cells with a high-intensity ultrasound.

194
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
It's quite successful in recent cases.

195
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
It's done. It's done.

196
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,900
Thank you, Baek Sobang.

197
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
Hyein, you should talk to Hyein.

198
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,900
But there's one more thing.

199
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Oh, my, Hyein.

200
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
Is this your birthday?

201
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,900
My father gave me this as soon as I went to heaven.

202
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,900
You can really do surgery?

203
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
Yes.

204
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
You're really lucky.

205
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,900
Oh, my God.

206
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,900
Can I be thankful for this?

207
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
Congratulations.

208
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Baby, congratulations.

209
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
I'm sorry.

210
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
How did you get in touch?

211
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Email? Call?

212
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Did you have a makeup meeting?

213
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
I got a call.

214
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Call?

215
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
It's not like voice phishing, is it?

216
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Like a scam.

217
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
It's not like that.

218
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
Okay, here you go.

219
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,900
But the surgery is definitely right for a rare case like me, right?

220
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Yeah.

221
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
That's right.

222
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
That's right.

223
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
What about the date?

224
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
You should've told me you'd go as soon as possible.

225
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
I told you.

226
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Then it's done.

227
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,900
So if you get surgery, you'll be able to go to heaven?

228
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,900
If I get surgery, I'm going to live, right?

229
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Do you know?

230
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,900
You should tell me.

231
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
But there's one more thing.

232
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
In the process of removing the tumor cells,

233
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
part of the hemorrhage is inevitable.

234
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Then?

235
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Long-term memories are likely to disappear.

236
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Hey, that's...

237
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
What are you talking about?

238
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,900
It means you could lose all your memories before surgery.

239
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,900
But right now, this is the only way to save Hyein.

240
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Hyein's blood pressure doesn't rise easily,

241
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,900
so it's impossible to treat her with the clinical treatment she was supposed to do.

242
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,900
There's really no time left.

243
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
If you know that there's a side effect,

244
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,900
you could say Hyein won't go to get surgery.

245
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
What if...

246
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,900
I lose my memory?

247
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,900
Mr. Baek, let's not talk about the side effects.

248
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
Why don't you go to Germany with Hyein

249
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
and try to persuade her?

250
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,900
I'm asking you.

251
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,900
Why don't you get surgery first and live?

252
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
You mean I can live if I get surgery?

253
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,900
You mean I can live if I get surgery?

254
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
Why?

255
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,900
You can live.

256
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Don't worry.

257
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Okay.

258
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Good night.

259
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
Hyein.

260
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,900
Hyein.

261
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Hyein.

262
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,900
No.

263
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,900
I'm fine.

264
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,900
It's been so long since I've been okay like this.

265
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
I'm so happy to cry.

266
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
I know.

267
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
I feel like I've been

268
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,900
holding back a bad dream for a long time.

269
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
I'm fine now.

270
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
I'm fine now.

271
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
Let's go to bed.

272
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
I'm fine now.

273
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
I'm fine now.

274
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,900
I'm fine now.

275
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
Good morning.

276
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Good morning.

277
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,900
You don't have to go to work until today.

278
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,900
Let's hang out with me.

279
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Let's hang out.

280
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
Two people.

281
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
Okay.

282
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,900
I'm fine now.

283
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Let's go to bed.

284
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Good night.

285
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,900
Good night.

286
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Good night.

287
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
Good night.

288
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Good night.

289
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
Good night.

290
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Good night.

291
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Good night.

292
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Good night.

293
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,900
Good night.

294
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
It's our first time

295
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,900
to just hang out

296
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,900
instead of going on a honeymoon, right?

297
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,900
You're right.

298
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
I've been so careless.

299
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
Let's hang out a lot

300
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
when I get my surgery.

301
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
Let's go.

302
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
Okay.

303
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,900
Good night.

304
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,900
You know what?

305
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
I don't want to get caught

306
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,900
when I go to get my surgery.

307
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,900
You know that, right?

308
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
I know.

309
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,900
What do you mean?

310
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
I didn't mean to lie,

311
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,900
but there are three things that

312
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
are a secret.

313
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
There are three?

314
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
I'm going to tell you one thing

315
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,900
before I go.

316
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
Tell me. What is it?

317
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,900
You said you got this MP3.

318
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Yes.

319
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
It's mine.

320
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,900
What?

321
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,900
It's Hyein's H.

322
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,900
The MP3 that I lost

323
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,900
at the school playground

324
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
when I was studying abroad.

325
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,900
It's here.

326
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
No way.

327
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,900
No way.

328
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,900
No way.

329
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
That's what happened

330
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
between us.

331
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
I was one of the few people

332
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
who passed by

333
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
without even remembering.

334
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
No, it's not that.

335
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Listen to me.

336
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Don't be scared.

337
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,900
You're not getting in trouble.

338
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,900
Why? I'm not like what happened yesterday.

339
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
I'll be born again soon.

340
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
From now on,

341
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,900
I'll only think positive

342
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,900
and focus on the good side of everything.

343
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900
Really?

344
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
Yes.

345
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
This MP3 is like

346
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,900
a reference to our history.

347
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
I'm going to focus on

348
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
the positive side of things.

349
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
That's good.

350
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Honestly,

351
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
I was wondering

352
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
why Yun Eunsung

353
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
saved me in the past.

354
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
What?

355
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
Isn't she crazy?

356
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Where is she?

357
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
Why? We have her now.

358
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
She's like a movie.

359
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
At the playground...

360
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
Was there such a handsome guy

361
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
in our school?

362
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
I can't believe I have to leave her.

363
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
She's so clumsy.

364
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
I was thinking about that.

365
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
Black danwha.

366
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
What?

367
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
You were wearing

368
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
black danwha.

369
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
Your white socks

370
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,900
were very white.

371
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,900
Your hair

372
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
was tied up like this.

373
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,900
I did enjoy

374
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
playing the game back then.

375
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
I saw you

376
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
and we met.

377
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
It was our first date.

378
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
So I went to see you

379
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
and I went to find you.

380
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
I couldn't see you because it was too quick.

381
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,900
Really?

382
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
Yes.

383
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
But I'm not Cinderella.

384
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
I'm just a MP3 player.

385
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
I'll go crazy.

386
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Anyway, we met again

387
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
and got married.

388
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
Of course, we got divorced.

389
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,900
Anyway,

390
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
this is

391
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
the best fate story.

392
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Really?

393
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
I'm your ideal type

394
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
and destiny.

395
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
So from now on...

396
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
From now on...

397
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
I didn't know you were so nice.

398
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
I'm tearing up.

399
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,900
I was going to be gone

400
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
before you were gone.

401
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,900
But now

402
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
we have our future.

403
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
So...

404
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,900
So what?

405
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
I'll accept your request

406
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
to cancel your divorce.

407
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,900
What's with that face?

408
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
What's with that face?

409
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
I don't have any regrets.

410
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
I'm the owner of a department store.

411
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,900
I don't know about

412
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,900
getting a refund on a regret.

413
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,900
One day, you opened your eyes.

414
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Even if I just hate you,

415
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,900
I can't ask you

416
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,900
for the promise.

417
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,900
A simple change

418
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
doesn't make you a refund.

419
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
That's the basics.

420
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,900
We fought

421
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,900
to the death

422
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,900
and even if I hate you,

423
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
it doesn't matter

424
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
if you remember

425
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,900
or not this promise.

426
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
I'm going to be by your side.

427
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
I know.

428
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
I know you'll like it.

429
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
So stop talking.

430
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,900
I like it

431
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,900
when I just

432
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,900
listen to your heart.

433
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
I like you

434
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
more.

435
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,900
I like you

436
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,900
more.

437
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,900
I calculated it.

438
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,900
It was about 4.5 billion won.

439
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,900
I called a car outside

440
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,900
to give you

441
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
4 billion won in cash.

442
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,900
Did you come to get a refund?

443
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
It may sound

444
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
like a bad thing,

445
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
but I think our history

446
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,900
made my attitude.

447
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
I've done all the work

448
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
and I've been hit in the back.

449
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,900
Check it.

450
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
100 million won,

451
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,900
1 million won,

452
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,900
1 million won,

453
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,900
1 million won.

454
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
I respect you.

455
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,900
A beautiful face,

456
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,900
a voice, a charismatic lion.

457
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,900
It's hard to have all of that.

458
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,900
I want to live my life

459
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,900
as you do.

460
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,900
I've got a pay policy.

461
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,900
I need to pay you back

462
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,900
to use it.

463
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,900
Our history

464
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,900
made my attitude.

465
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,900
I've been hit in the back.

466
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
If you do as I say

467
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,900
until I'm satisfied,

468
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,900
I'll let you go.

469
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Take it all.

470
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,900
You're so stubborn.

471
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,900
Mom, what's going on?

472
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,900
It's not the time to eat.

473
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,900
I'm going to Seoul with you.

474
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,900
I'm going to give you some kimchi and pork.

475
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,900
This is not the time.

476
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,900
I'm going to eat noodles.

477
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,900
I'm going to give you some kimchi

478
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,900
and pork.

479
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,900
When are you going to finish this?

480
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,900
Put on your gloves.

481
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,900
I have a lot of money.

482
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
I'll help you.

483
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,900
What should I do?

484
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,900
Oh, that's a good idea.

485
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Wow, you're so fast.

486
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900
You're good at using the old-fashioned way.

487
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
Anyway,

488
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,900
you're not a normal person.

489
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
Why?

490
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Hey,

491
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
do you think I'll be sent back to the family?

492
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
I don't want to be sent back to the family.

493
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
I'll go after I finish my work.

494
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,900
Don't worry too much, Mom.

495
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,900
You said you don't want to be sent back.

496
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Mom, Mom, are you teasing me?

497
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Don't call me that.

498
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,900
I want to do that.

499
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,900
What?

500
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,900
I've never called you Mom.

501
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,900
It's my first time.

502
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,900
Let me call you that.

503
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
What is this?

504
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Oh, my.

505
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,900
Do you want me to get you another one?

506
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,900
No, no.

507
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,900
Wow.

508
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,900
Wow.

509
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,900
I like it.

510
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,900
Why?

511
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,900
I like how you don't get scared at all.

512
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,900
I like that.

513
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Okay.

514
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,900
Okay.

515
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,900
Come here.

516
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,900
Everyone's congratulating you

517
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,900
after hearing about the surgery.

518
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,900
That's great.

519
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,900
Thank you.

520
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,900
But...

521
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,900
What are you doing?

522
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,900
Oh,

523
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,900
have you done this before?

524
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Giving you a peach drink.

525
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,900
No.

526
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,900
You know,

527
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,900
if you have a peach drink until the first snow,

528
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,900
you can have your first love.

529
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,900
That's why you always give this to someone

530
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
in the fall instead of the summer.

531
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
That's romantic.

532
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
It's not romantic.

533
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Do you have any other friends?

534
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
He's just passing by.

535
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,900
I mean,

536
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,900
I don't know when I can't see him.

537
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,900
But I keep seeing him these days.

538
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,900
I don't know how he feels.

539
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Stop talking.

540
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,900
I'm sorry.

541
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
I was too honest, right?

542
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,900
Don't be so upset.

543
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,900
Why?

544
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,900
Actually,

545
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
when Hyunwoo was in high school,

546
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,900
he flirted with me a lot.

547
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,900
I didn't know.

548
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,900
He gave me snacks at church.

549
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,900
Then Hyunwoo

550
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,900
gave me two pieces of chocolate pie

551
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
and steamed bread.

552
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
That's because you stole

553
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
other people's food.

554
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,900
Why are you saying that?

555
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
You're so careless.

556
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,900
You're talking nonsense.

557
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,900
Do I just stay here until the first snow?

558
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,900
I'm sorry.

559
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,900
I'm sorry.

560
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
I'm sorry.

561
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,900
I'm sorry.

562
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,900
I'm sorry.

563
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,900
I'm sorry.

564
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
I'm sorry.

565
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,900
I'm sorry.

566
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
I'm sorry.

567
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,900
I'm sorry.

568
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
I'm sorry.

569
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,900
I'm sorry.

570
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,900
I'm sorry.

571
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
I'm sorry.

572
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,900
I'm sorry.

573
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
Look at this.

574
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,900
A balsamic glass?

575
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,900
It's not a simple balsamic glass.

576
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
It's not.

577
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,900
It's my expectation of the first snow

578
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,900
that I thought I'd never see again,

579
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,900
hope, excitement?

580
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,900
I thought I'd never see the winter again.

581
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,900
I thought I'd never see the first snow,

582
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,900
I'm sorry.

583
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
Then?

584
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
When you first look at someone,

585
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,900
you can tell that they're your first love.

586
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,900
What?

587
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Your first love.

588
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,900
My first love...

589
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,900
Is it the bus driver or the taxi driver?

590
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
You can look at them from afar.

591
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
You can think of them even if you don't want to.

592
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,900
You can even turn around to see their faces.

593
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,900
You can look at them from afar.

594
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,900
You can think of them even if you don't want to.

595
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,900
The guy who went back to see his first love?

596
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
Why would you curse at someone who's fine?

597
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
Really?

598
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,900
That guy?

599
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,900
I hope that luck comes early this year.

600
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900
Haein, you can't be like this

601
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,900
when you're wearing that ring.

602
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,900
It'll ruin everything.

603
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,900
Are you listening to me?

604
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,900
Haein.

605
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
Haein.

606
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Michael met Hong Bumseok?

607
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
Yes, as Ever H's representative.

608
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
The queen's sons must want to come back

609
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,900
after their father died.

610
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,900
Ever H was the main culprit

611
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
of the Chooju case a while ago.

612
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
I think Hong Bumseok

613
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,900
has been collecting shares since the crash.

614
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,900
He's persuading the NKLPs to take my place.

615
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,900
Tell them to do it.

616
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
You can take my place with what I gave you.

617
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,900
As you requested,

618
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,900
we established Shell Company in Hong Kong and Switzerland.

619
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,900
The legal account was established by IEBC.

620
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,900
I noted that only Chairman Yoon can run it.

621
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,900
How should we proceed with the first order?

622
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
Let's do 2.1% in a CD format.

623
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,900
Yes, sir.

624
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,900
We got caught.

625
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,900
Yun Eunsung took out the secret money.

626
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
He must've been worried

627
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
that his father would threaten him.

628
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Is he still in New York?

629
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,900
Yes, he's still meeting the NKLPs.

630
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
Keep him informed.

631
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,900
That way, he'll be more anxious

632
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,900
and buy shares with the money.

633
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,900
If we get the decisive evidence,

634
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,900
Yun Eunsung can put the case

635
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,900
under investigation.

636
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,900
By the way,

637
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,900
the person you told me to look into, Pyeon Seongwook...

638
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
The local media company

639
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,900
that kidnapped you last time?

640
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,900
Yes.

641
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
We're going to hand over

642
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,900
the evidence and the documents,

643
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
but it's not in the place we agreed on.

644
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
He hasn't been using his credit card

645
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,900
or his phone for a week.

646
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,900
Maybe he's been cheating on me.

647
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,900
A body found near the 3-way address

648
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,900
of Yeongjin-gun, Gyeonggi-do,

649
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,900
was found to be a male in his 40s.

650
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
The body found in the murder scene

651
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
is still under identification...

652
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
What's this?

653
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Is this what you call a piece of cake?

654
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Ma'am!

655
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Amazing Grace is here!

656
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,900
What are you doing here?

657
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
What are you doing?

658
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,900
Don't you know?

659
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,900
We're making a bouquet.

660
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,900
Oh, my.

661
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
I'm so glad you're here.

662
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,900
I'm so glad you're here.

663
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,900
I'm so glad you're here.

664
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,900
Your hands are so rough.

665
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
What about the dark circles?

666
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
I barely managed to get the Kims up,

667
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,900
but they're all up.

668
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
The Queen's coming back soon.

669
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,900
That's a battlefield.

670
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
Gather up and fight the evil spirit

671
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,900
and the Queen...

672
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

673
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

674
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

675
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

676
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

677
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

678
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

679
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

680
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

681
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

682
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

683
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

684
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

685
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,900
The Queen is coming back soon.

686
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,900
I'm so jealous.

687
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,900
I've never done anything like this before.

688
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,900
Don't do it. It'll make you wrinkle.

689
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,900
Follow the instructions.

690
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,900
It's whitening, elasticity, recovery, and recovery.

691
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,900
The most important thing in recovery

692
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
is the elasticity of recovery.

693
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,900
Don't worry.

694
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,900
The elasticity will be restored.

695
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,900
We'll go back to the Queen

696
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,900
and Hyein will be treated and get better.

697
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,900
Ms. Hwang, you're getting a surgery?

698
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,900
I heard you can't even get a surgery.

699
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,900
I heard you can't even get a surgery.

700
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,900
I have a surgery I can try.

701
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,900
I'm on my way.

702
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,900
Really?

703
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,900
That's great.

704
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
That's great.

705
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,900
Hello.

706
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,900
I wanted to see you.

707
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,900
Me?

708
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,900
Yes.

709
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,900
I have something to tell you.

710
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,900
What is it?

711
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,900
I didn't know we'd meet like this,

712
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,900
so I left you at home.

713
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,900
Do you want to meet tonight?

714
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,900
Tonight?

715
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,900
Yes.

716
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,900
Well, I guess so.

717
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,900
Why are you so serious?

718
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,900
I'm not serious.

719
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,900
Why are you so overreacting?

720
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
He's so aggressive.

721
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,900
He's so dangerous.

722
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,900
You're here first.

723
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,900
Yes.

724
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,900
I have something to tell you.

725
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,900
I'll go first.

726
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,900
Yes, go ahead.

727
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,900
I'm leaving tomorrow.

728
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,900
I don't know when I'll be back here in Seoul.

729
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,900
I heard about it.

730
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,900
I know what you want to talk about.

731
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:01,900
I've been noticing you since the last audition.

732
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,900
No.

733
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,900
What?

734
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,900
What?

735
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,900
I have a lot of things.

736
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,900
Not only do I have real estate stocks,

737
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,900
I have three ex-husbands.

738
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,900
I didn't know.

739
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,900
You didn't know, did you?

740
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,900
Anyway, I'm a woman.

741
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:29,900
I have so many things that I can't accept your heart.

742
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,900
But you can accept it.

743
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,900
What is this?

744
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,900
Did you write a letter to me?

745
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,900
If you do this...

746
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
It's a deposit.

747
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,900
I heard about your father.

748
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,900
You don't have to give me this.

749
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,900
I'll go.

750
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,900
No, no.

751
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,900
You can't do that.

752
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,900
This isn't for you.

753
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,900
It's for your father.

754
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,900
Even if you're rich,

755
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,900
you'll start out as a poor man.

756
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,900
It won't be long, but if you take this,

757
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,900
your father will have a drink with his friends

758
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,900
and the national treasure tonight.

759
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,900
He'll eat delicious food with his friends

760
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,900
and live comfortably,

761
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,900
so don't be too sad.

762
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,900
Thank you.

763
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
Take care.

764
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,900
Bye.

765
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,900
Goodbye.

766
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,900
What are you talking about?

767
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,900
You won't come home and you're going to stay here?

768
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,900
You're ridiculous.

769
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,900
For the time being.

770
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,900
Until I get my house in Seoul.

771
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,900
So why are you looking for a house?

772
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,900
What are you talking about?

773
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,900
In my life,

774
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,900
I've always had a support wheel.

775
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,900
One side is my mom,

776
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,900
and the other side is my dad.

777
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,900
What are you talking about?

778
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,900
But now,

779
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,900
I'm going to get off this support wheel

780
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,900
and stand on my own.

781
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,900
You're so ridiculous.

782
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,900
Did you ask me to do that?

783
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,900
Did you seduce me again?

784
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,900
Honey, shh. Don't say anything.

785
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,900
From now on, it's a non-profit business.

786
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,900
Don't talk to Dahee directly.

787
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,900
Please get her a lawyer.

788
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,900
What?

789
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,900
I'm sorry, but I'll reject it.

790
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Hey, you take care of your family's problems.

791
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,900
Since you're here, I'll talk to her.

792
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,900
I'm not going home either.

793
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,900
You too?

794
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,900
This guy has a Seoul office.

795
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:07,900
I'm going to go there.

796
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,900
I'm going to Germany soon,

797
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,900
but the airport is closer.

798
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,900
No, the airport is further away.

799
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,900
The building is new and it's a full option.

800
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,900
It's efficient because you have everything you need.

801
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,900
You know,

802
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,900
my house is an elevator to the refrigerator.

803
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,900
The route is too long.

804
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,900
Your excuse is longer.

805
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,900
You two are the only ones I want to be with.

806
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,900
Yes.

807
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,900
I just want to be with Hyein.

808
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,900
Please allow me.

809
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,900
Sure.

810
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,900
If you two feel comfortable, then do so.

811
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,900
Sure.

812
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,900
If you need anything, just let me know.

813
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,900
Wow.

814
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,900
Is this discrimination?

815
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,900
I've never been treated like this before.

816
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,900
It's refreshing.

817
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,900
She's packing tomorrow.

818
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,900
I think she should be preparing for it.

819
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,900
And I met with Cheonda too.

820
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,900
What is this?

821
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,900
She left safely. Why is she back?

822
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,900
It's a secret from Ms. Mo.

823
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,900
Hey, you idiot.

824
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,900
Ms. Mo told me you were here.

825
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,900
Really?

826
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,900
You know everything about

827
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,900
getting a cab in the middle of the night

828
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,900
with your poor hand-carry.

829
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,900
You're so meticulous.

830
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,900
What?

831
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,900
Why are you here?

832
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,900
Are you being guilty or are you just being selfish?

833
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,900
Why would I be being selfish?

834
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,900
I'm here to buy you a heart.

835
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,900
Were you being selfish?

836
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,900
I was.

837
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,900
I was being selfish for the first time

838
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,900
and for the person who helped me.

839
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,900
Oh, my.

840
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,900
Look at her.

841
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,900
She's so angry.

842
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,900
You know that.

843
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,900
If she gets angry,

844
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,900
no one can stop her.

845
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,900
She's so nice to you,

846
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,900
but you're so mean.

847
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,900
That's why you shouldn't trust

848
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,900
a black-haired beast.

849
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,900
And about Yein,

850
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,900
I think she might quit the show.

851
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,900
She's getting surgery.

852
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,900
She's been looking for a hospital

853
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,900
to get her surgery.

854
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,900
She's going to Germany next week.

855
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:07,900
Oh, my.

856
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,900
What hospital is it?

857
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:17,900
Find out what surgery it is.

858
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,900
What are you doing?

859
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,900
I'm just...

860
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:30,900
I can see the stars very well here.

861
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,900
Was it the day before yesterday?

862
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,900
I saw the stars.

863
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,900
Really?

864
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,900
Your dream was to be a star.

865
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,900
You wanted a pretty daughter,

866
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,900
but you dreamed about her.

867
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:58,900
I was so happy.

868
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,900
Hey, I'm having a hard time getting a hold of myself these days.

869
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,900
We've been fighting for over 20 years.

870
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,900
Suddenly, the sweet concept is a little awkward.

871
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:16,900
I'm so sorry.

872
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,900
I want to regret it and do well for you.

873
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,900
I like you right now.

874
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,900
I like you.

875
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,900
I'm not comfortable with being too sweet all of a sudden.

876
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:37,900
There's going to be a lot of time in the future, so let's be nice slowly.

877
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,900
That's all I have right now.

878
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,900
Yeah.

879
00:51:42,900 --> 00:52:00,900
Let's be nice slowly when you get your surgery.

880
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,900
I didn't know that this was how people were being pushed around.

881
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,900
It's as stressful as being in the army for a man.

882
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:14,900
I think we need a break to protect Dahye from Mom.

883
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,900
Why isn't she coming out?

884
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,900
Mom, Dad, I'm done packing.

885
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,900
Oh, yeah?

886
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,900
You'll be stuck in the road soon. You have to go. Hurry up.

887
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,900
Here.

888
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,900
I'm sorry for everything.

889
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,900
I'm the most sorry for leaving this guy behind.

890
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,900
I'm sorry.

891
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,900
It's like I'm going to play and not clean up the garbage bag.

892
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,900
Dad, don't say that.

893
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,900
Why are you in such a hurry?

894
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,900
You have to go to bed for lunch.

895
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,900
Should I?

896
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,900
You've been empty for more than a month. You should go and clean up.

897
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,900
I was going to make kimchi pancake.

898
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,900
Kimchi pancake?

899
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,900
How about crispy kimchi pancake with cool and sweet makgeolli?

900
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,900
What makgeolli? Who's going to drive?

901
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,900
I can drive.

902
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,900
You can go and sleep one more day.

903
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:08,900
Oh, please.

904
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,900
You two!

905
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,900
Do you know when to go and how beautiful it is to see a person who's leaving?

906
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,900
Do I have to know?

907
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,900
We'll go first.

908
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,900
If we're late, we'll get stuck.

909
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,900
Yeah, we have to go before it gets stuck.

910
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,900
Thank you for everything.

911
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,900
I'll go.

912
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,900
Change the surgery well.

913
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,900
Haeyoon, see you again.

914
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,900
Baek Soba, you're so quick.

915
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,900
Don't worry.

916
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:58,900
Well, this mom made kimchi and pear juice.

917
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,900
You should listen to me.

918
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:09,900
I'll go.

919
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:19,900
Go.

920
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,900
Oh, it's the 11th floor.

921
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:34,900
Hello.

922
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,900
He's not a deaf.

923
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,900
What?

924
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,900
I'm not his wife.

925
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:44,900
Didn't you say you lived alone when you moved in?

926
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:48,900
Did you get married?

927
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,900
Yes.

928
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,900
Oh, my.

929
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,900
You're a newlywed couple.

930
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,900
It's a good time.

931
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:05,900
Yes, I like it.

932
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:15,900
Let's go.

933
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,900
We're officially declared newlyweds now.

934
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,900
Why is it an official declaration?

935
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,900
That lady.

936
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:33,900
If you find out who she is in the neighborhood, you'll find out all the part-time jobs on the first floor of the convenience store the next day.

937
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:41,900
I heard that you married a very beautiful woman.

938
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,900
So?

939
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:54,900
You should be like a newlywed couple when you're in a good mood.

940
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:04,900
I'm sorry.

941
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:14,900
The newlyweds who are generally in a bad mood are stuck in one place.

942
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:47,900
Whether it's your hands or your feet.

943
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:52,900
Shoulders.

944
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,900
Anything.

945
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:01,900
That's how we stick together every day and live our daily lives together.

946
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:06,900
It's nice now, but there's no trouble.

947
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:15,900
We're going to forget those sweet memories like we're taking out candy from a glass bottle and endure the hard times.

948
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:29,900
So we have to collect a lot of them when we're in a good mood.

949
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:39,900
I'm sorry.

950
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:58,900
I'm going to focus more on collecting happy memories than collecting stocks and roofing.

951
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:08,900
It's the most important thing for me to fill in that glass bottle.

952
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,900
But why did you come here so often?

953
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,900
Is baseball that fun?

954
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,900
No, it's not fun.

955
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,900
All you have to do is play the ball that comes out of that hole.

956
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,900
That was good.

957
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:29,900
Do you feel better after that?

958
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:35,900
I just like to focus on one thing when it's complicated.

959
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,900
The most important thing for me right now.

960
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,900
I'm just looking at one thing.

961
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:49,900
What's the most important thing for you right now?

962
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,900
Of course I'm saving you.

963
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,900
That's all that matters to me.

964
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:08,900
I'm just going to watch that.

965
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,900
I think Hong Soo-cheol is going to stay there longer.

966
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,900
Hong Hye-in said she'd be with Baek Hyun-woo.

967
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,900
It looks like only the vice president's husband is coming in now.

968
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,900
Who's the vice president?

969
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,900
I'm sorry.

970
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:40,900
But if you bring the house over there, I'm sure you're not going to try to find the vice president again.

971
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,900
As you wish.

972
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:52,900
He's going to regret coming back here.

973
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,900
I was on my way to see you.

974
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,900
Can I see you for a second?

975
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,900
I heard Hye-in got surgery in Germany.

976
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,900
Don't be nervous.

977
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,900
I'm just trying to tell you that it went well.

978
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,900
Oh, really?

979
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,900
Of course.

980
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,900
Hye-in is my favorite woman.

981
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,900
I'm sure it went well because I found a way to be healthy.

982
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,900
You said you were going to Germany with me.

983
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,900
I look forward to your kind cooperation.

984
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,900
All right.

985
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,900
Can I go now that we're done talking?

986
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:39,900
But I heard that the surgery that Hye-in was getting had side effects.

987
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:45,900
Does Hye-in know about this?

988
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:52,900
Well, if she knew, she wouldn't have said she'd get surgery.

989
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,900
She hasn't told you yet, has she?

990
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,900
What do you want to say?

991
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:01,900
Keep it a secret until the end.

992
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,900
Let her get the surgery.

993
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,900
I want to save Hye-in.

994
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,900
Get rid of everything related to the surgery.

995
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,900
And give me the stuff for Gyeon-hwa.

996
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,900
I heard you're coming to the department store as a guest, not as a boss.

997
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,900
So I'm here on vacation.

998
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,900
That's right.

999
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,900
What are you going to buy?

1000
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:43,900
I'm just looking.

1001
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:48,900
You hate customers who just look at you.

1002
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,900
Is this a sauna?

1003
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:53,900
Why are you sitting and chatting with me when you're paying for the stuff?

1004
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:54,900
I'm just looking.

1005
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,900
I'm just looking.

1006
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:03,900
Why are you sitting and chatting with me when you're paying for the stuff?

1007
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,900
I'm just looking.

1008
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,900
Why are you letting the kids go?

1009
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,900
If you want to play, you have to go to the amusement park. Why are you coming to the department store?

1010
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,900
So I got rid of all the rest areas.

1011
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,900
Okay.

1012
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,900
You're a guest, so you should spend money.

1013
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,900
What do you want?

1014
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:23,900
Do you need anything?

1015
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,900
Lip balm.

1016
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,900
My lips are puffy.

1017
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,900
Why am I so tired after using my hands?

1018
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,900
Are you tired?

1019
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:39,900
I can't.

1020
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,900
Let's go somewhere and rest.

1021
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:45,900
It's well-made.

1022
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,900
The route is amazing.

1023
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,900
There's no time to rest.

1024
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,900
I was going to buy lip balm, but I bought moisturizing cream.

1025
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,900
I went to knitwear and bought a coat.

1026
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,900
I tried to buy clothes, but I saw a muffler and a pair of gloves next to it.

1027
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,900
It smelled like an unbeatable perfume.

1028
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,900
That was your strategy.

1029
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,900
You have to keep your customers' eyes and nose from resting.

1030
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,900
So I filled all the spaces with pop-ups.

1031
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,900
I'm making a comeback.

1032
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:09,900
I'm going to get rid of all the pop-ups.

1033
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:10,900
Why?

1034
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:11,900
I'm tired.

1035
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,900
I think I'm a little pathetic because I spent my money.

1036
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,900
Then would you like to come back again?

1037
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:21,900
I'm going to get rid of all this and go to all the chairs again.

1038
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,900
I'm going to make it expensive and comfortable.

1039
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,900
I'm going to remodel the first-story square,

1040
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,900
have a concert, and play with the kids.

1041
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,900
What?

1042
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,900
I'm going to go on a date.

1043
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,900
When it's cold or hot, I'm going to come to see the kids.

1044
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,900
Isn't it nice?

1045
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,900
I'm going to make it a place where they can be happy.

1046
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,900
Really?

1047
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,900
Really.

1048
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,900
You're not just saying anything after the surgery?

1049
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:47,900
Why would I say anything?

1050
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,900
It's like that in movies and dramas.

1051
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,900
After the brain surgery,

1052
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,900
your personality changes or your memory disappears.

1053
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,900
No, I just want to live my life

1054
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,900
as a better person

1055
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,900
for the rest of my life.

1056
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,900
Mother.

1057
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,900
Isn't that Hoyori's mom's voice?

1058
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,900
I'm here.

1059
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,900
Minhui, why are you so careful with your eyes?

1060
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,900
I'm nervous.

1061
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,900
Mother.

1062
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,900
You can't do that.

1063
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:32,900
You can't even get a refund.

1064
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:33,900
I'm sorry.

1065
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,900
I was going to keep my promise,

1066
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,900
but I think it's time.

1067
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:43,900
Fine.

1068
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,900
Let's see if you can get a refund.

1069
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,900
You tell me.

1070
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,900
Me?

1071
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,900
Oh, I was going to a shopping mall

1072
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,900
and spent the night at a PC cafe with the kids.

1073
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,900
No, it's not.

1074
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,900
Oh, did you find my game console?

1075
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,900
Did you buy it as a proof? It's not expensive.

1076
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,900
You bought a game console too.

1077
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,900
You can't just tell me.

1078
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,900
Mother, you're going to get a refund?

1079
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:14,900
I'm sorry.

1080
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:15,900
I'm sorry.

1081
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:17,900
Mother, this is...

1082
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,900
I broke the deposit and gave it to you.

1083
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:23,900
Man-do.

1084
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,900
He even went to the bank.

1085
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,900
He went in with a scar and now he's at minus 90%.

1086
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:31,900
You crazy...

1087
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:32,900
Oh, my.

1088
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,900
I'm sorry.

1089
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,900
Hyeon-suk, I'm not good with people.

1090
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,900
I'm going to get a refund and get rid of him.

1091
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,900
Hyeon-suk, you should go before it's too late.

1092
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,900
But I'm going to text you if I get a refund.

1093
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:53,900
You should come.

1094
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:57,900
I think he's too much for a pretty woman like you.

1095
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,900
Hyeon-suk, I'm really sorry.

1096
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,900
Mother.

1097
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,900
Eat your food and become a human!

1098
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,900
I'm really sorry.

1099
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,900
Let go!

1100
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,900
Good news.

1101
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,900
I think I'm going to be a little bit more famous.

1102
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,900
I heard that Hae-in didn't even take a look at anything.

1103
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,900
This is the water.

1104
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,900
Yes, but I wash it every morning and night,

1105
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,900
wash it with wax, clean the sign with water,

1106
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,900
and disinfect the toilet.

1107
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,900
I'm going to paint it too.

1108
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:46,900
Yes.

1109
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,900
There are many people in the neighborhood

1110
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,900
and they're getting to know the roads, so they're more likely to go.

1111
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,900
This will be a good place to live.

1112
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,900
Yes, that's right. It's a good place.

1113
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,900
But why? Are you going to build a building?

1114
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,900
I discussed it with Hae-in.

1115
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:05,900
We're going to give this building to the owner.

1116
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,900
What?

1117
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,900
After I go to Seoul, our new accountant will contact you

1118
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,900
and let you know what we need.

1119
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:21,900
But how can you give me a building as a gift?

1120
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,900
It's my heart.

1121
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,900
You're so generous.

1122
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,900
I'm going to be the son of the owner of the building!

1123
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,900
I'm going to return it!

1124
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,900
Honey, are you following me?

1125
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,900
I'm going to be the owner of the building.

1126
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,900
Come on.

1127
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,900
I'm thinking of remodeling the first floor

1128
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,900
and making a gym.

1129
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,900
Hey, you should be good at your job.

1130
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:02,900
Mom, I wanted to move to a hair salon.

1131
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,900
The first floor is the hair salon.

1132
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,900
Why are you so stubborn?

1133
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:09,900
I've been working hard to clean it up and stop the sewers...

1134
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,900
I removed all the stickers on the stairs.

1135
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,900
And you use the third floor.

1136
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,900
Hwakse.

1137
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,900
Yes, Mom.

1138
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,900
You should get your stamp out of here.

1139
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,900
Mom, you're joking.

1140
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,900
I'm not joking.

1141
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,900
The rent was too high.

1142
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,900
Mom.

1143
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:24,900
Dad.

1144
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,900
Son.

1145
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:26,900
Yes.

1146
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,900
There's a contract for this.

1147
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:39,900
Cha-in can cancel the contract

1148
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,900
if the rent is over 2 times higher.

1149
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:42,900
You can do that too.

1150
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:43,900
What?

1151
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:44,900
You want me to leave?

1152
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,900
No.

1153
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,900
You're saying that the rent is over 2 times higher.

1154
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,900
Don't be late every day.

1155
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,900
Dad.

1156
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,900
I...

1157
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,900
I...

1158
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,900
The first floor is 100 years old.

1159
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,900
If you can get it right, come in.

1160
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,900
That's more expensive than the seat.

1161
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,900
The seat is better.

1162
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,900
Anyway, we're going to build this building

1163
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,900
and live with you with a lot of tension.

1164
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,900
I'm looking forward to it.

1165
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,900
Why are you being so parents-like?

1166
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,900
Why do you need to be nervous?

1167
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,900
I need to be.

1168
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,900
I've had a lot of times

1169
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,900
where I felt a sense of humor from you guys.

1170
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,900
I'm going to build this building

1171
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,900
so that you can see how loyal you are.

1172
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:25,900
Right, Dad?

1173
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:28,900
No.

1174
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,900
I just want to get my rent.

1175
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,900
So you're going to build it?

1176
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,900
You're going to tell me, right?

1177
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,900
Anyway, we're going to build two buildings.

1178
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:39,900
What? What are two buildings?

1179
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,900
Two buildings.

1180
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,900
Oh, my gosh.

1181
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:44,900
That's so...

1182
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,900
From now on,

1183
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,900
we're going to move the rent

1184
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,900
without any blood ties.

1185
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:52,900
Got that?

1186
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:53,900
Oh.

1187
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,900
It's still October,

1188
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,900
and you're already starting the Christmas party?

1189
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,900
You told me to do that.

1190
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:01,900
Me?

1191
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,900
Are you going to be playing around

1192
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:03,900
because Chuseok is over?

1193
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,900
Christmas is coming.

1194
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,900
Winter is coming.

1195
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,900
You need to make the atmosphere

1196
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,900
so that customers can enjoy the padding shopping.

1197
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,900
It's too late to turn on the lights when everyone else is.

1198
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,900
You should've prepared in advance.

1199
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,900
As soon as Halloween is over,

1200
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,900
we should turn on the lights first

1201
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:18,900
and start the winter market.

1202
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:20,900
Oh.

1203
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,900
So you're not going to the spot rehearsal today?

1204
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,900
No.

1205
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,900
The construction team and the marketing team

1206
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:27,900
were busy earlier.

1207
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:28,900
Oh.

1208
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:32,900
I'm sorry.

1209
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,900
My eyes...

1210
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,900
I can only see my brain.

1211
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,900
I can see it too.

1212
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,900
You even closed your eyes during the rehearsal.

1213
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:06,900
Hold on.

1214
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,900
I can feel my heart is beating

1215
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,900
With the same temperature as yours

1216
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,900
and the same trembling

1217
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:42,900
I'm with you like that

1218
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,900
I'm here looking again

1219
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,900
I'm closer to you

1220
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,900
Where you are

1221
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,900
I'm moving my feet

1222
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,900
into that space

1223
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:00,900
I'm here to feel like in your heart

1224
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:04,900
All my love, I'll give it to you in my dream

1225
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,900
In your eyes, I see your love

1226
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:10,900
I closed my eyes in the fall.

1227
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,900
You said you wanted to see me early.

1228
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,900
It's all going as you wanted.

1229
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,900
I know.

1230
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,900
I think I'm getting better.

1231
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,900
Everything is going as I want.

1232
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,900
Now, we're going to have our first love.

1233
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:28,900
No...

1234
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,900
I don't think I'm saying that.

1235
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:33,900
Why not?

1236
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,900
I think I'm going to be like this.

1237
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,900
What kind of person are you?

1238
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:39,900
Why are you...

1239
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:41,900
like this?

1240
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,900
Actually, I didn't want to talk about this

1241
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:50,900
because I was afraid you'd be too suspicious.

1242
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:51,900
I'll tell you.

1243
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,900
It's my second secret.

1244
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,900
What is it?

1245
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,900
It was bus 372.

1246
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:58,900
What?

1247
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,900
The bus you used to take when you got off work.

1248
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,900
Oh, right.

1249
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,900
You always sat in the back of the window.

1250
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,900
Yeah, how did you know?

1251
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,900
How should I know?

1252
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:14,900
Should I tell you?

1253
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,900
I crossed the Han River several times

1254
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,900
along the bus that took you home.

1255
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,900
It took me an hour and a half to get there.

1256
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:32,900
Why?

1257
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:36,900
The bus I was talking about is bus 372.

1258
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,900
You're the bus.

1259
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:40,900
Yeah.

1260
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,900
How did you get to Seoul Station?

1261
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:51,900
Huh?

1262
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:52,900
Was it me?

1263
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:54,900
I'm sorry.

1264
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:56,900
I'm sorry.

1265
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:58,900
I'm sorry.

1266
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,900
I'm sorry.

1267
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:00,900
I'm sorry.

1268
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:01,900
Was it me?

1269
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,900
Was it me?

1270
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,900
Was it me on the bus?

1271
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:06,900
It was you.

1272
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,900
You're so sweet.

1273
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:12,900
Why did the team suddenly turn a blind eye?

1274
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,900
Director Baek was mistaken earlier.

1275
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,900
Sir, let's do some snow-maker during the rehearsal.

1276
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,900
We don't have to do that during the rehearsal.

1277
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:26,900
The legal team has to make a debut.

1278
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,900
You know how complicated it is when there's a slip.

1279
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,900
I'll check how slippery it is.

1280
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,900
If that's the case...

1281
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,900
Please make it pretty.

1282
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,900
Okay.

1283
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:40,900
Thank you.

1284
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,900
I can tell that love is like an event.

1285
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:47,900
Right?

1286
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,900
Divorce and then get married.

1287
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,900
That's a good idea.

1288
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:53,900
Was it really me?

1289
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,900
Was it really me?

1290
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,900
The plane will take off, right?

1291
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,900
When will it arrive?

1292
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,900
It should take a while.

1293
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,900
It's worth praying every night.

1294
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,900
Haein will be happy if he gets surgery.

1295
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,900
He'll live well with Hyeonho.

1296
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:22,900
That's...

1297
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,900
There's one problem.

1298
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,900
What problem?

1299
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,900
He's still in the hospital after the surgery.

1300
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,900
He might lose all his memories.

1301
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,900
What do you mean?

1302
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,900
He has side effects.

1303
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,900
But what can we do?

1304
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,900
We'll have to wait and see.

1305
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,900
I didn't have a choice.

1306
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,900
I asked Mr. Baek not to tell you.

1307
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,900
That's...

1308
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,900
Good for you, honey.

1309
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,900
You might have been upset

1310
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,900
that I was like him and that I didn't go to Germany

1311
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:20,900
because I knew he was dirty.

1312
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,900
But...

1313
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,900
But I still...

1314
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,900
I still...

1315
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:28,900
But...

1316
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,900
What can we do?

1317
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:57,900
Are you okay?

1318
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,900
I'm fine.

1319
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:03,900
Don't worry.

1320
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,900
German Frankfurt

1321
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,900
Are you going to Frankfurt?

1322
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:39,900
Yes.

1323
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,900
German Frankfurt

1324
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,900
What's the third one?

1325
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,900
What?

1326
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:29,900
You said you had three things to tell me before the surgery.

1327
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,900
I only said two.

1328
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:32,900
Oh, that?

1329
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,900
The third one is...

1330
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:40,900
Yeongsook.

1331
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:41,900
Yeongsook?

1332
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,900
The one with the raccoon on the roof?

1333
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,900
I've never seen her.

1334
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:49,900
I mean it.

1335
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,900
I've never seen her.

1336
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,900
But why Yeongsook?

1337
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,900
It's a lie.

1338
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:56,900
I'm not lying.

1339
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,900
How can a raccoon live on the roof?

1340
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:04,900
Do you believe that?

1341
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,900
Come on.

1342
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,900
I've been fooled for four years.

1343
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:17,900
I called her every time I went to the roof.

1344
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,900
You fool.

1345
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:26,900
Yeongsook?

1346
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:44,900
This is the place, right?

1347
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:47,900
Aein.

1348
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,900
Why?

1349
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,900
I have something I haven't told you.

1350
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:55,900
What is it?

1351
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:01,900
Why?

1352
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,900
Is there a problem?

1353
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:08,900
The surgery...

1354
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:10,900
It's not working.

1355
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:13,900
It's not that.

1356
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,900
After the surgery,

1357
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:25,900
you'll lose your memory.

1358
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:28,900
What do you mean?

1359
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:31,900
What memory?

1360
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:34,900
Maybe...

1361
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:36,900
All your memories.

1362
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,900
People you know, places,

1363
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,900
everything you've been through.

1364
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:46,900
You'll forget everything.

1365
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:51,900
But...

1366
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,900
Even so,

1367
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,900
this is the only way you can live.

1368
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:09,900
So?

1369
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:12,900
I'm not going to...

1370
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,900
make a choice.

1371
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:18,900
I'm not going to...

1372
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:19,900
make a choice.

1373
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,900
I'll lose all my memories after the surgery

1374
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:24,900
and die if I don't.

1375
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:26,900
What's worse?

1376
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,900
Which one should I choose?

1377
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:31,900
No.

1378
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,900
What if you don't?

1379
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:35,900
Forget it.

1380
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,900
I'll have a good dream for a few days.

1381
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:49,900
Go.

1382
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,900
In-gwon, let go of me.

1383
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:02,900
Don't make a choice.

1384
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:04,900
Don't even think about it.

1385
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:07,900
Just listen to me.

1386
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,900
You live.

1387
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:15,900
You live.

1388
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:17,900
Please.

1389
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,900
Live.

1390
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:46,900
I'm sorry.

1391
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,900
I'm sorry.

1392
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,900
I'm sorry.

1393
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,900
I'm sorry.

1394
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:54,900
I'm sorry.

1395
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,900
I'm sorry.

1396
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,900
I'm sorry.

1397
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:00,900
I'm sorry.

1398
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,900
I'm sorry.

1399
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,900
I'm sorry.

1400
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,900
I'm sorry.

1401
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:08,900
I'm sorry.

1402
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:10,900
I'm sorry.

1403
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,900
I'm sorry.

1404
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:14,900
I'm sorry.

1405
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:16,900
I'm sorry.

1406
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:31,900
Hello, Hong Hae-in.

1407
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:37,900
I'm Baek Hyun-woo.

1408
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:42,900
I'm your husband.

1409
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,900
You're flustered and scared, right?

1410
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:46,900
I'm scared too.

1411
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:50,900
I don't remember anything, but I'm seeing you for the first time.

1412
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,900
You're wondering what's going on, right?

1413
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,900
But this is a good thing.

1414
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:09,900
It's a good thing.

1415
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:14,900
You were very sick, but you're back to life.

1416
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:18,900
Yes.

1417
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:23,900
You may be curious about what kind of person you were,

1418
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:28,900
but you may be upset that you can't remember.

1419
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,900
Don't worry.

1420
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:34,900
I remember everything.

1421
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:39,900
I'll tell you everything I know.

1422
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:45,900
I can't cry.

1423
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:54,900
This is probably my first time seeing you.

1424
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:00,900
I'm sorry.

1425
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:02,900
I'm sorry.

1426
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:04,900
I'm sorry.

1427
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,900
And I'm telling you in advance.

1428
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,900
Even if I'm not the man you like,

1429
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:18,900
I'm sorry, but I can't break up with you.

1430
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:26,900
You and I made an unchangeable promise.

1431
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,900
No matter how much you hate me,

1432
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,900
no matter what happens,

1433
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:42,900
even if you don't remember the promise you made with me,

1434
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:51,900
I promised to be by your side.

1435
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:52,900
I'm sorry.

1436
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:04,900
We'll look at each other's first eyes and do things that are nothing every day.

1437
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:13,900
I'm going to collect your empty glass bottle and better memories.

1438
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:15,900
You can do it.

1439
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:19,900
We're the best destiny ever.

1440
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:25,900
I love you.

1441
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:30,900
I love you, Hyein.

1442
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:35,900
I loved you.

1443
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:40,900
I'll love you.

1444
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:44,900
I love you.

1445
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:19,900
The meaning of your pathetic heart.

1446
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:25,900
It's clear.

1447
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:29,900
The scent of that night, the moon, the wind.

1448
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:30,900
I'm leaving.

1449
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:32,900
Don't pray like that.

1450
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,900
Those people who call me a family will get hurt.

1451
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:36,900
Gayeong.

1452
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:39,900
I lived as myself, so I want to die as myself.

1453
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:40,900
I won't let you die like that.

1454
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:42,900
That's what I found.

1455
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,900
I'll protect the hospital that will operate on you.

1456
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,900
Don't do this to me.

1457
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,900
Don't make me want to live.

1458
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:51,900
Hyein!
