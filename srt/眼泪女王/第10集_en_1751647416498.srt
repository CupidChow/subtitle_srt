1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,820
Mo-ra

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:07,660
ately, lots of established buildings and

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,980
luxury toilets in Seoul and

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:22,540
cities alternately present its mega place

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,820
that should be thought of as the

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,820
You're here.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,320
There's no place in our neighborhood

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,120
that's as good as this building.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,720
Feel free to come and use it.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,220
Thank you.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,120
By the way, did Baek Hyeonwoo box?

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,120
He did.

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,020
He even did well.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,520
Is it because he's smart?

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,920
He's good at boxing.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,320
He's reading where his opponent will attack.

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,820
In other words, he's a simulation genius.

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
He's leading the attack and dodging it.

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
He waits for the opponent to lose his power

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
and then he does a counter punch like a ghost.

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,820
He can't do that.

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,320
I've been K.O'd before.

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
I couldn't deliver the letter of the address

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
to the police.

25
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,320
You got it now, right?

26
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,320
Please call the lawyer.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,820
I reported it to the police.

28
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,320
Before I got out of the car.

29
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,020
You're the culprit,

30
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,820
so the rest is up to the police.

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Hyeonwoo?

32
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
Did you just end up at your ex-husband's house

33
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
after you hung up on him?

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,820
I'm disappointed.

35
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,820
Disappointed?

36
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
At least, I didn't hear from you.

37
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,820
How did you find this place?

38
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Now you know.

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,320
I'm a bad guy who does whatever I want.

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,820
This wasn't even a big deal.

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,320
So, Hyein, don't make me feel bad.

42
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,320
Are you threatening me right now?

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Yes.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
I'm threatening you.

45
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
I'm threatening you.

46
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
I'm going to do it right from now on, so listen.

47
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,320
I saw it from your doctor's point of view.

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,320
But the doctor said he can't tell me more

49
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,820
because I'm not your guardian.

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,320
So I'm going to be your guardian.

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Are you crazy?

52
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Yes, I think I'm crazy.

53
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,320
You said you don't have time.

54
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,820
Then I don't have time either.

55
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,320
I'm going to go crazy and I can't do anything.

56
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,820
Do whatever you want.

57
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,320
I'm not scared of anything.

58
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Your parents don't know you're sick.

59
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,320
Why didn't you tell them?

60
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,320
It's because you're scared.

61
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,320
They've already lost their children once.

62
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,820
Hey, Yoon Seonho.

63
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
If you want to see how I destroy the people

64
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,320
you want to protect, then keep doing it.

65
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
If you don't want to,

66
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,820
don't stay here and come back.

67
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,320
The CEO's office is empty.

68
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,320
I'll give you two days.

69
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,320
I have a press conference that day.

70
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Come there.

71
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,320
Leave the rest to me.

72
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,820
I'm not the one who's saving you.

73
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,320
Hey, you punk!

74
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
How could you do this to us?

75
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,320
How could you do this to me?

76
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,820
I'm going to kill you!

77
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Suja!

78
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,320
Hey, are you okay?

79
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,820
It's all because of me.

80
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
I was fooled by a jerk like you

81
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,320
and my family was ruined.

82
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,820
It's all because of me.

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Hey, you fool.

84
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,320
It's not because of you.

85
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Who's going to get fooled by you?

86
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
It's not because of you. Stop crying.

87
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,320
Where's Dahee?

88
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Where is she?

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Just tell me if she's doing okay.

90
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,320
Please tell me.

91
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Please.

92
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,820
Please.

93
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,320
You ran around the street alone at night

94
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,820
and fell asleep.

95
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Why would I?

96
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,820
Because you were on your way home after a drink.

97
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,320
I didn't drink.

98
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,820
I'm telling you not to tell people

99
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,320
that Yoon Eunsung is here.

100
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Why is he here?

101
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
I should know too.

102
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,820
I have something to do.

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
So don't tell Mom and Dad yet.

104
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Aren't you going to answer?

105
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Okay.

106
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,320
I have a dark-skinned syndrome,

107
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
so I didn't see anything earlier.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
You know I don't turn on the lights

109
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
even at night, right?

110
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
That's your only talent.

111
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
I'm curious about the night.

112
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
I know.

113
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
But I'm going to tell them.

114
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
I know.

115
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
But I saw this guy.

116
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,320
He's the new chairman of the PINGZ.

117
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Really?

118
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Isn't he the real Cheolcheonji Wonseong?

119
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
I know.

120
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Do you know him?

121
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
He's my type.

122
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
I'm calling you early.

123
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,320
You got all the Korean phone numbers, emails, and messages, right?

124
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Of course.

125
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
The place I'm going to go to is for someone else.

126
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Good job.

127
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
If it's not something special,

128
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
don't contact me for the time being.

129
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Okay.

130
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Did you meet Hong Sucheol?

131
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Why?

132
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Well,

133
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
he's a very good-natured person.

134
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
I thought he was very worried.

135
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
I'm sure he's worried about you.

136
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
I'm sure he's worried about me.

137
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
I'm sure he's worried about you.

138
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
I'm sure he's worried about you.

139
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
So what?

140
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Are you sure?

141
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Hey, what are you worried about?

142
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
I'm just curious.

143
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Hong Sucheol

144
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
is very angry with you, right?

145
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Oh, really?

146
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
He's trying to keep it from happening.

147
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
So,

148
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
hide well.

149
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Okay.

150
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Bye.

151
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
I'm sure he's a little out of it.

152
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
I'm sure he's a little out of it.

153
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
It's the same for me.

154
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Hong Sucheol, you're awake.

155
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
I wasn't a fool.

156
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Seoyeon.

157
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Seoyeon.

158
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Seoyeon.

159
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Seoyeon.

160
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

161
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Please try again later.

162
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
What happened?

163
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
When did you get off work?

164
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Why do you look like that?

165
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Just...

166
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
No...

167
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Did you get hit?

168
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
I didn't get hit.

169
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
How much did you get hurt?

170
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
I'll tell you.

171
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
What?

172
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
What?

173
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
What?

174
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
What?

175
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
What?

176
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
What?

177
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
What?

178
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
What?

179
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
What?

180
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
I'll tell you.

181
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Wait, Haerin.

182
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Tell me.

183
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Stay still.

184
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
What's wrong?

185
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Let me see.

186
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Why is it red?

187
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Did you get hit with a club?

188
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,320
I'll explain.

189
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I didn't get hit on purpose.

190
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Go ahead.

191
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Did you get hit on purpose?

192
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
No.

193
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I didn't get hit on purpose.

194
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Look at this.

195
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
I'm fine.

196
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
I just got a scratch on my face.

197
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
I got a little bit of a blister.

198
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Why would that happen?

199
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Stay still.

200
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm not trying to brag, but it was a 3-on-1.

201
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,320
It wasn't an easy fight.

202
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,320
The opponent even used three-barrel weapons.

203
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,320
But you got hit with a bare fist?

204
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
I didn't know.

205
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
I didn't know.

206
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,320
I didn't know, but I used to box when I was young.

207
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
There was this place called the boat house.

208
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
It doesn't hurt at all.

209
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
What's this?

210
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,320
I got a little bit of a blister.

211
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Who is it?

212
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Some crazy guy did that.

213
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
You said you had a ban on going abroad.

214
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
You said you didn't have any land.

215
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
I said I didn't have any land.

216
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,320
So you almost got hit by a group of people while you were digging for the frauds?

217
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
But I won.

218
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
It's not cool at all.

219
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,320
It's cool to run away in a 3-on-1 situation.

220
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
But he left it to the police.

221
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
If the fraud is proven, you can turn the tables right away.

222
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Shut up.

223
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
If this happens again...

224
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,320
The next episode will be released on the 7th of July.

225
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
I'm running away.

226
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Promise me.

227
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
You're not going to answer me?

228
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
You said you didn't want to talk.

229
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,320
Promise me.

230
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm sorry, but I can't promise you.

231
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,320
I have a promise.

232
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,320
What promise?

233
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,320
It's about you.

234
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Anyway, I'm a promise to myself.

235
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Don't promise me whatever you want.

236
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,320
That's what married people do.

237
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:57,320
We're divorced so we don't do that.

238
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:13,320
If you go somewhere else and get hit again, you'll die in my hands.

239
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Do you understand?

240
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm not hit.

241
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Okay.

242
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I like you.

243
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Let's go.

244
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:53,320
What's wrong with your face?

245
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
I fell at night.

246
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,320
How did you...

247
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Oh, my God.

248
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,320
What's wrong with Mr. Baek?

249
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
I fell a little bit.

250
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
What?

251
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Both of you fell.

252
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Didn't you two fight?

253
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
How can I fight?

254
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,320
My brother was a boxing player.

255
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Oh, I see.

256
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Our dojang came yesterday.

257
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
He was surprised to see the trophy.

258
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Did you work out?

259
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Oh, my God.

260
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
I'm telling you now.

261
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
It was very painful when I raised Hyunwoo.

262
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,320
If you go to the game, you're a champion.

263
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
If you take the test, you're not a religious person.

264
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,320
I'm going to play in the top 10 in the country.

265
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,320
I was really worried about what to do with this.

266
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Why are you so fraudulent?

267
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,320
It's like a son show.

268
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Anyway, that's what it is.

269
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
I was a little bit of a loser.

271
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,320
No, it's his fault that he lost his dad.

272
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Hyunwoo has been a little bit of a loser since he was a kid.

273
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:06,320
I'm not a person who can't say anything wrong because I look like my mom.

274
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Then what about my brother-in-law?

275
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,320
I don't look like him.

276
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Why?

277
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,320
I look like my father, right?

278
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Our Hyein is very much like her father-in-law.

279
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,320
She's very beautiful.

280
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Brother, why?

281
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Oh, why?

282
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Actually, I told you not to say this.

283
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
What?

284
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
What?

285
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
You said you had something to say.

286
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Me?

287
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
No?

288
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
I...

289
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Go ahead, then.

290
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,320
What's wrong with you?

291
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Don't mind me.

292
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,320
You didn't apply the medicine in the morning, did you?

293
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Yeah, I'm a little busy.

294
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
I'm busy.

295
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Look at me.

296
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
I told you to apply it often.

297
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,320
No, it's okay now.

298
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
What's okay about it?

299
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,320
You apply the medicine often, too.

300
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,320
You have to change your band often to not get a scar.

301
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
Done.

302
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Go.

303
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Yeah.

304
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Then I'll be back.

305
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
Yeah.

306
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,320
Drive safe.

307
00:17:50,320 --> 00:18:00,320
What?

308
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Oh, it's just time now.

309
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:11,320
I think it'll be less blocked if we stay for another five minutes.

310
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Well, there's nothing good about it when it's blocked.

311
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Yeah, I know.

312
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:59,320
What would we have done if we did?

313
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
What?

314
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:12,320
If you had to apply medicine, you'd have applied it then and then, and you'd have disinfected it right away, and if you had to change it to a new band, wouldn't we have been like this?

315
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:21,320
No, before that, I wish we'd just sat here and had a drink and broke up.

316
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:28,320
If we hadn't gotten married, we would've just had good memories of each other.

317
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:38,320
There wouldn't have been anything that would hurt, break up, or get a scar.

318
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,320
At least, you would've been happier than I was.

319
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,320
You would've been meeting a woman who was kind, warm, and not-so-sad.

320
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,320
I don't think so.

321
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:03,320
If we had broken up then, you wouldn't have known my news, but I would've known how you were doing.

322
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,320
I'm sure you would've regretted it.

323
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
But if I knew this would happen then...

324
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:21,320
Even if I knew, I would've done it.

325
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Instead, if I knew what I know now, I would've asked you often.

326
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
What?

327
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:35,320
How was your day?

328
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,320
What's hard these days?

329
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Why couldn't I say that while we were living together?

330
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:19,320
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:29,320
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,320
What time did you come home yesterday?

333
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:49,320
You're doing well, right?

334
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
I know what you want to say.

335
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Anyway, let's put the chairman back where he was and discuss it later.

336
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
I won't discuss it.

337
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
I'm going to marry Hyein as soon as possible.

338
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,320
What? Marry?

339
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Hyein said she would.

340
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,320
You still don't know me?

341
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:22,320
I don't think so.

342
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:48,320
Okay.

343
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:18,320
It's better than I thought.

344
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
It's nice to use alone.

345
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,320
I'm sure you were surprised that the personnel deployment was sudden.

346
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
I expected it to be somewhat.

347
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
But...

348
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
What do you mean, a negative behavior?

349
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Is there a reason?

350
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
You're afraid I don't have one?

351
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I'm going to post it on the board of directors, so check it out.

352
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
It was a surprise.

353
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Where?

354
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
The dragon?

355
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
The air was nice.

356
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
But still.

357
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,320
How can you put him in there?

358
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,320
I guess I didn't hear you because I saw your face.

359
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
We met yesterday.

360
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Hyein, are you talking?

361
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,320
I didn't have time to talk.

362
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,320
I was a little busy yesterday, so I left the police with Pyeon Seong-wook.

363
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,320
I guess I didn't hear you because I saw your face.

364
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
What are you talking about?

365
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,320
I think Pyeon Seong-wook is holding on to it right now.

366
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Don't worry.

367
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
I'm glad you're here.

368
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:32,320
It's my job to reveal that.

369
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
Really?

370
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
That's great.

371
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Then let's do what we're good at.

372
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:50,320
I'm sorry.

373
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
Shouldn't we say hello?

374
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Let's not do that.

375
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,320
I think you're a prince in a dweeju.

376
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
What are you talking about?

377
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
Didn't you watch the movie?

378
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
If you want to kill someone, you have to kill them quietly.

379
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,320
You put the dweeju in the middle of the yard where everyone saw it.

380
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,320
You want to see who's giving him water.

381
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,320
That's why the office is a smoking room.

382
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:35,320
I want to see who's close.

383
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
So you answered my call.

384
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,320
I thought you wouldn't answer.

385
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,320
I don't delete numbers that I didn't calculate.

386
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,320
I've been standing in the middle of the road, and there are people who take the center of the bill.

387
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,320
I always chase them to the end and tear them apart.

388
00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:00,320
That's my way of calculating.

389
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Of course you know.

390
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,320
But I'm a thorough accountant.

391
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
What?

392
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,320
If Grace didn't get what she wanted, wouldn't that be enough?

393
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I didn't work?

394
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Did you work hard for decades like me?

395
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Did you wander around this country for the rest of your life like Eunsung?

396
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,320
I didn't work for free, but I got everything I could get and did a few errands.

397
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,320
I'm embarrassed to say that I'm the representative of the department store.

398
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,320
You're going to work in the countryside with the money you can't afford to buy a small building.

399
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,320
Isn't that a little too much?

400
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
I'll give you the representative of the department store.

401
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,320
But do that much work.

402
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,320
What?

403
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Find Hong Mandae.

404
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
What?

405
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
What?

406
00:26:46,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Why?

407
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:09,320
There aren't many hospitals that have a VVIP ward that can focus on the patient for 24 hours and use the entire floor alone.

408
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Here we go.

409
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Hello, we only have a VVIP ward for a month, so the CEO of the department store is busy.

410
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Is the 23rd floor alone a hospital?

411
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
What?

412
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
How do you know my father?

413
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,320
I mean, where did you get it?

414
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
I'm looking into it, too.

415
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Anyway, the nurse said that Mo Suri didn't know.

416
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
I think it's a single-person incident.

417
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,320
I'm not going to let this go.

418
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Wait a minute.

419
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,320
I'll call a taxi and get off and get back to Seoul.

420
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Hang up.

421
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Oh, my mom's daughter.

422
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
I got hit that day, too.

423
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,320
I was going to return it to you.

424
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
This.

425
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,320
Your mother lent it to me last time.

426
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,320
But why did you lend it to me?

427
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Just...

428
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,320
I spilled some water and told you to wipe it.

429
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:16,320
What did you spill?

430
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
Why are you crying?

431
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,320
That's...

432
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
Oh, my God.

433
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
I almost explained it.

434
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
What's the point of doing it on your own?

435
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,320
Anyway, please tell me.

436
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Crying when you're having a hard time is a third degree.

437
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
What?

438
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,320
I didn't cry.

439
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,320
But it's a second degree to hold it in.

440
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Then what's a second degree?

441
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:50,320
When you're having a hard time, you're the first degree.

442
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Don't cry next time and eat meat.

443
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,320
What are you doing?

444
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,320
You're talking like a baby.

445
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:11,320
This neighborhood is really weird.

446
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:33,320
You look great today.

447
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
What are you doing?

448
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,320
But it's the last time you're going.

449
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Hey, am I going to die?

450
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,320
I'll give you a big round of applause.

451
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,320
It's a great day today.

452
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
Enjoy it as much as you want.

453
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Our party will be at our pork soup restaurant.

454
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,320
You can come and join us.

455
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,320
I'll do my best from now on.

456
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,320
Please watch me.

457
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,320
Park Seok-hoon! Park Seok-hoon! Park Seok-hoon!

458
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Let's just eat.

459
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,320
Where's Junsik?

460
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
Who do you use when you know people?

461
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
Do you use foreigners?

462
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,320
And that...

463
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Tell me the truth.

464
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,320
What did Park Seok-hoon do to you?

465
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,320
He went to the pork soup restaurant

466
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
at the last meeting of the Young-nong subcontractors.

467
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,320
That was in front of Young-soon's eyes.

468
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
Is that why you did that?

469
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,320
And he hired a part-time job

470
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
at the last meeting of the Young-nong subcontractors.

471
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,320
He took all the records and asked if it was your daughter

472
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
or a subcontractor.

473
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,320
I told you to watch this.

474
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,320
Calm down. Calm down.

475
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,320
There are two things that are never there in this world.

476
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
The first is free.

477
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,320
The second is the peace of the government.

478
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,320
That's right.

479
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,320
It's not easy to do it all over the world.

480
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,320
That's just going with the manual.

481
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
When you enter the new government,

482
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,320
you start with the core of the previous government.

483
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
That's not the end.

484
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,320
Next is erasing the traces of the previous government.

485
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Erasing traces?

486
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
What should I do?

487
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
I'm going to get hit.

488
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Get up.

489
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
What should I do?

490
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,320
Seok-hoon, there's no sin in being a ship.

491
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
What?

492
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
What you want to erase is not the ship.

493
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,320
It's the presence of the White-Haired Man.

494
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,320
Isn't that what people believe is the connection?

495
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,320
No, it's not.

496
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
The new catch phrase of the White-Haired Man is

497
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,320
pretty, but it's an apple village.

498
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,320
I need to draw some apples.

499
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,320
It's so easy to make fun of you.

500
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
Do I have to draw here?

501
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,320
My request is not to be polite,

502
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,320
but to be polite.

503
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,320
Are you going to keep staring at me like that?

504
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
I'm feeling pressured.

505
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Ha.

506
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,320
Where did you go?

507
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
Behind you. Behind the tree.

508
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Thank you, honey. I almost died.

509
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
Don't just stand there.

510
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
What are you doing with the poison?

511
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
I don't have poison. I only have the axe.

512
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,320
I told you to upgrade your weapon when you get the game money.

513
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
Who uses the axe these days?

514
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
It's not enough to buy a balkan.

515
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
I don't have the game money.

516
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,320
I need to hunt if I don't have money.

517
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,320
I'm so busy these days that I can't get the field.

518
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,320
Look back.

519
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,320
I keep looking forward and I keep getting hit.

520
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,320
You know, when I look back, I jump out from the front.

521
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
Watch your back!

522
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,320
Are you angry that I can't play games?

523
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,320
The world isn't that easy,

524
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,320
so please be careful of your back.

525
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Oh, my.

526
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
Oh.

527
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
What's wrong?

528
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Our Dahee...

529
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,320
She got in two hours ago.

530
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,320
She's so scary.

531
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Take care, sir.

532
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Okay, I'll go.

533
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
Yes, madam.

534
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,320
I just met the wife of a medical officer.

535
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,320
But the VIP ward

536
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,320
was raided by the second-in-command of Chairman Ryu Sung Kang.

537
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
She had a breast surgery and was lying in bed...

538
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
I'm sorry.

539
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
Yes.

540
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Yes, I'll call you again.

541
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,320
What are you doing here?

542
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,320
You've been in the beauty business for life,

543
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,320
and you've been making good-looking people marry you.

544
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,320
You said you didn't know much about the law, right?

545
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
So?

546
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
I want to tell you something.

547
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,320
You're running a franchise store

548
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,320
in 13 places without a record.

549
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,320
You'll be in big trouble.

550
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,320
No,

551
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,320
if you get a hold of the fact that I bought more than others,

552
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
everyone will be really sad.

553
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,320
You bought a lot, so you even worked hard on the t-shirt.

554
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,320
How much is this?

555
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,320
But who are you?

556
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
This is the kind of person I am.

557
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,320
Director Ko is a famous person in our field,

558
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
so it feels like I'm seeing a celebrity.

559
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,320
What do you mean I'm famous?

560
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,320
He's good at getting married, but he's also good at getting divorced.

561
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,320
If you don't like the middleman,

562
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
you divorced him without a means.

563
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
He's a fake informant,

564
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,320
and he's a player and a bad manager.

565
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Thanks to that, I got a little bit of a raise.

566
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,320
There are this many of our customers.

567
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,320
What do you think they are?

568
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
I don't think they'll stay still

569
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,320
if they find out about this.

570
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Everyone is great at the cost of their lives.

571
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,320
You have a great family.

572
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,320
The National Assembly, the Prosecutor's Office, the court.

573
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Oh, my.

574
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Mr. Lee used to be a member of the group.

575
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,320
Okay, so be quiet.

576
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Why are you doing this to me?

577
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,320
I was on Director Baek's side.

578
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,320
You should actually be on my side.

579
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,320
But I'm not a person who moves with my heart.

580
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I only move with cash.

581
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,320
Actually, it's a little bit hard for me to cut off

582
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,320
the huge offer I got from him.

583
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,320
Let's see how much I can do for you.

584
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Oh, my.

585
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
What are you doing?

586
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Are you an owl?

587
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,320
You're so smart.

588
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
How do you think you can deal with this situation?

589
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Oh, my.

590
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
Why are you talking like that?

591
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Why are you comparing people to animals?

592
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
You know, right?

593
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,320
I'm always ready to be an animal.

594
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Stop teasing me.

595
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
If you don't want to go to jail,

596
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,320
I've been there before.

597
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,320
The girls there hate the style like you.

598
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:16,320
I hate you.

599
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Yoon Eun-sung is so thorough.

600
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
There's nothing left in the black box.

601
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,320
So I listed the VIP wardens with a dedicated elevator

602
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,320
that can be arranged for security reasons among the top-level hospitals.

603
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,320
As long as you can rent a floor.

604
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
I'm looking for it.

605
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
So?

606
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Did you find it?

607
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,320
It'll take a few days to find it.

608
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
I think it would be better to narrow the range

609
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
from Seoul to within an hour.

610
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Why?

611
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
You're a middle-class person,

612
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
but there's no oxygen tank in a regular ambulance,

613
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
so the medical staff would have to pump it with their hands

614
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,320
to supply oxygen, and it would have been difficult for more than an hour.

615
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
You're right.

616
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,320
Then I'll get out of five places.

617
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,320
I'll find the rest at my personal hospital.

618
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,320
Let's share the list and find it.

619
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Yes, ma'am.

620
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
It's family-oriented.

621
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
The atmosphere of this team is so nice.

622
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:20,320
That team is a little rough.

623
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,320
I think I'd have been happy if I sent it like that.

624
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,320
How are you all doing?

625
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,320
What about you?

626
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
Wait a minute.

627
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
I'm sorry, Ms. Mi-sun.

628
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,320
I'm just going to go.

629
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
What's wrong with you?

630
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Everyone's waiting for you to apologize for what happened last time.

631
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,320
No, well, I don't think you should listen.

632
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,320
I didn't mean to say that because I didn't know I was there.

633
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,320
I'm so sorry.

634
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,320
I didn't know you were there.

635
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,320
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

636
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
I'm so sorry.

637
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Right?

638
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
They didn't know what happened last time.

639
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Of course.

640
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,320
We're a little bit ruined in the article.

641
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
That's...

642
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,320
But we didn't believe the media.

643
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,320
No, even if you're rich, you'll be gone for three years.

644
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
That's right.

645
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,320
We wanted to check the facts and tell the truth.

646
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Okay.

647
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
I didn't do anything good.

648
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,320
I should have told you sooner.

649
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
I was just listening.

650
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
That's a relief.

651
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,320
We'll see you all the time, so we'll feel better.

652
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
Of course.

653
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,320
It's not all the time.

654
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,320
I just came back from a short vacation.

655
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,320
I'm just taking a break.

656
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Bali, Hawaii, and Cancun are many places,

657
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
but I don't want to go to places I've been to every day.

658
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,320
It's not bad to take a break at a unique place.

659
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,320
Is it unique?

660
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
It's unique.

661
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
It's different compared to Cancun.

662
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
There's no sea here.

663
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,320
It's a little uncomfortable,

664
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,320
but I think it's a good experience.

665
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,320
I don't think I'll ever live in a place like this again.

666
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
It's an experience I can't live with money.

667
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
Right?

668
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,320
You don't have any money.

669
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
What?

670
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
You don't have any right now,

671
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
so you have some money tied up somewhere.

672
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,320
It'll be untied up, so it'll come undone someday.

673
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,320
But you don't know if it's my life

674
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,320
or my son's life.

675
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
There's a green belt land in my house

676
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
that hasn't been untied in 50 years.

677
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
I know.

678
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
Okay, then.

679
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Let's say we've made up.

680
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
Shall we get going?

681
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
Anyway, I didn't see anyone

682
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
who came to my neighborhood

683
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
and said,

684
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
I'm going to be a star soon.

685
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,320
Excuse me.

686
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,320
What do you want to say?

687
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
No, I just thought

688
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,320
we'd see each other for a long time.

689
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,320
It's a good thing.

690
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
Let's get going.

691
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,320
Okay.

692
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
Let's go.

693
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
It's really hot.

694
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
We're going to get going.

695
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
What?

696
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
Oh, my God.

697
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Oh, stress.

698
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
Cafe.

699
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,320
Cafe.

700
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Cafe.

701
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
I'll order here.

702
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Order?

703
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,820
You have to come here and order.

704
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,320
I'll order here.

705
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
Order?

706
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,320
You have to come here and order.

707
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
Espresso, two shots.

708
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
It's $3.20. Do you have a credit card?

709
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
That's fine. Here.

710
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
It's not working.

711
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,320
What should I do?

712
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Excuse me. I'm in a rush right now.

713
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,320
Can I drink first and then pay later?

714
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
First, coffee, then pay.

715
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,320
Is it hard?

716
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,320
I'm sorry, but there's a customer behind you.

717
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
Can you move aside?

718
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,320
Hello.

719
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,320
10 cups of coffee and 10 cups of latte.

720
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,320
One bottle of syrup and one bottle of ice.

721
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
Of course. I know.

722
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,320
And pay for the one behind you.

723
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Okay.

724
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
You said you couldn't sleep last night.

725
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,320
Anyway, I'll drink. Thank you.

726
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
There's nothing to thank me for.

727
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
You won't pay for the coffee?

728
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,320
Okay, let's get started.

729
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
Okay.

730
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
Latasha.

731
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
Yes?

732
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,320
Tell them to come here.

733
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
Okay.

734
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,320
Aren't you a girl?

735
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,320
Are you talking to me?

736
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,320
Yes, I'm talking to you.

737
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,320
Why are you speaking informally to an adult?

738
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
I'm not an adult.

739
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,320
I'm an elder.

740
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,320
What are you talking about?

741
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,320
I'm an elder.

742
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,320
I'm an elder.

743
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,320
I'm not an elder.

744
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
I'm an elder.

745
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,320
Don't you know?

746
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Yes, the world has gotten so much better.

747
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,320
I couldn't even step on the shadow of an elder.

748
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
What are you talking about?

749
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
You're an elder.

750
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Don't you want to learn?

751
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
If you don't want to, then don't.

752
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,320
Okay.

753
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,320
What? How do I do it?

754
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,320
Follow me.

755
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,320
Hurry up.

756
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,320
What are you doing?

757
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
Just do it once.

758
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
Do this, then this.

759
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,320
And then this.

760
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Try it.

761
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,320
Like this?

762
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,320
You have to hold it here.

763
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,320
You can't hold it like that.

764
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I told you to hold it.

765
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
Is Korean hard?

766
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
Can't you understand?

767
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,320
Hold it like this.

768
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,320
Boss, take this out.

769
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,320
It's not working.

770
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,320
It's not working.

771
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,320
It's not working.

772
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,320
Look at this.

773
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,320
I'm sorry.

774
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
You found it well.

775
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
How is it?

776
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
Do you want me to give it to you?

777
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,320
It's fine.

778
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,320
You brought it, right?

779
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,320
You know this is really a violation of labor law, right?

780
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,320
I was staying up all night

781
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,320
and I was grilling cheese.

782
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
Do you want a hug?

783
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
No.

784
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,320
I don't understand.

785
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,320
My in-laws are my in-laws too.

786
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
Why did you come here?

787
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
I came in a hurry.

788
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,320
I ended up staying a few days.

789
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,320
Even if you're in a hurry, you can't come here.

790
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,320
Are you a housewife?

791
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,320
Then I'm a housewife.

792
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
No way.

793
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,320
In a housewife's house,

794
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,320
they eat food that others make.

795
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
My mother makes everything here.

796
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
I asked if you had japchae and ribs since morning.

797
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
Wow, my mother.

798
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Tell me the truth.

799
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,320
It's a false marriage, right?

800
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,320
What are you talking about?

801
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,320
Or can you be so affectionate?

802
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,320
What affectionate?

803
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
No.

804
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,320
Who is it that you're still holding on to the company

805
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,320
even after being bullied?

806
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,320
What did Baek Hyunwoo do?

807
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,320
Oh, you didn't know yet.

808
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,320
I heard it on my way here.

809
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,320
Director Baek has a major development.

810
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,320
Major development?

811
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
What's the reason?

812
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
I heard it's a false marriage.

813
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,320
The board of directors will open soon.

814
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,320
If it's a false marriage, what is it?

815
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,320
I couldn't catch anything when I was talking

816
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,320
through the auditory system.

817
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,320
I heard that you got a rebate at Lofong.

818
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
What?

819
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
No.

820
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,320
I heard that you got a rebate at Lofong.

821
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Did you get a rebate on your income?

822
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,320
You got a rebate on your V.I.P. client list.

823
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,320
There's a lot more.

824
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,320
So you're saying you'll make up

825
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,320
a reason for not having it?

826
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,320
Yes.

827
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,320
I don't know what to do.

828
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,320
Whatever I do, Baek Hyunwoo will be a prosecutor.

829
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Oh, you're here with me.

830
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,320
I have some business in Seoul.

831
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
Hey.

832
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
I was thinking about telling you this.

833
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Don't.

834
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,320
Do you know who came to my neighborhood last night?

835
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,320
I know.

836
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,320
You know?

837
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,320
You know that Yoon Eunsung came to Haein?

838
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,320
I know.

839
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,320
But why did he come here

840
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,320
and meet her all night?

841
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
Isn't he seeing her?

842
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,320
What's there to see?

843
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
Why are you so annoyed?

844
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
Who's annoyed?

845
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
What's there to see?

846
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,320
He doesn't know anything about her.

847
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,320
What's wrong with him?

848
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,320
Oh, my.

849
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,320
Is he jealous?

850
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
He was surprised by Seoyoung's words.

851
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,320
But he's the only one...

852
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,320
Oh, my.

853
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,320
That idiot.

854
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,320
Oh, my.

855
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,320
Good job today.

856
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,320
Natasha.

857
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,320
Yes?

858
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,320
We got 4,000 copies today, so it's 280,000 won.

859
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
300,000 won as a bonus.

860
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,320
That's great.

861
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,320
And our Sado got 70 copies.

862
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
So it's 4,900 won for 77 copies.

863
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,320
We got 1,700 won without the coffee.

864
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,320
Lee Sookyung.

865
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,320
Yes?

866
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,320
Thank you.

867
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,320
Thank you.

868
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,320
Park Seonyo.

869
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,320
Thank you.

870
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:37,320
Box, computer, thank you.

871
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:47,320
Oh, my.

872
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:58,320
It's been a long time since my wife slept so well without sleeping pills.

873
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:17,320
Why are you drinking alone at this time?

874
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
Oh, yes.

875
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,320
I feel a little better after quitting what I used to do.

876
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:28,320
What's the village head doing?

877
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:33,320
I think I understand.

878
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,320
Really?

879
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,320
Would you like to see it?

880
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,320
It's this hour, and I have half the battery left.

881
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,320
I can't get a call.

882
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,320
Oh, oh, oh.

883
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,320
I can't get it.

884
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,320
I'm the vice president of the village head.

885
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,320
I'm the vice president of the village head.

886
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,320
I'm the vice president of the village head.

887
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,320
Oh, oh, oh.

888
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,320
I don't even answer that.

889
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:03,320
When I was in the vice president's seat, I never heard of any announcements coming out unless I got a call.

890
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:09,320
I hear it every day now.

891
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:14,320
Oh, the end of the coin.

892
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:20,320
It seems to be true that my shadow leaves me when I'm in a dark place.

893
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,320
Do you have makgeolli?

894
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,320
Father, you said you'd give me the car.

895
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,320
Then you should do it with her.

896
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,320
Where are you going to live before you go to my house?

897
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,320
No, I can't do that.

898
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,320
What?

899
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Hey, you.

900
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,320
You, you, you.

901
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,320
You, you, you.

902
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,320
Oh, my God.

903
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,320
If you just want to have fun, it's over.

904
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
Oh, my God.

905
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
Is that really the case?

906
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,320
Yes.

907
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,320
I'm really worried about my money.

908
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,320
I don't know.

909
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:14,320
I don't think the writers did a good job in researching the data every time I watch a drama like that.

910
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,320
Why?

911
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,320
There's a scene where he keeps holding his back.

912
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,320
I don't know about anything else, but people like us are definitely blood pressure-related.

913
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
I'm sure the owner is the owner of the house.

914
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,320
Oh, the owner.

915
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,320
Even if the blood pressure is low, the salt in the diet disappears.

916
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,320
It's disappearing.

917
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:36,320
And every remodeling house has stairs in the middle of the living room.

918
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,320
Right?

919
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,320
He doesn't have all those stairs.

920
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,320
That's not an opera theater.

921
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,320
It's not.

922
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:49,320
I use the stairs when I go up, but I use the elevator for my knee health when I come down.

923
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:54,320
I think that's a little less heavy.

924
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
It's perfect.

925
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,320
Good night.

926
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,320
Are you sleeping?

927
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,320
Haena, are you sleeping?

928
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,320
Why?

929
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
If you have something to say, say it.

930
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,320
I heard Yoon Eun-sung came here yesterday.

931
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,320
Is that what happened to that bastard?

932
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,320
No, that's not important.

933
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,320
What did he say?

934
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,320
What about you?

935
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,320
Why are you here?

936
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,320
What did you say?

937
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,320
Again?

938
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,320
Come back to the department store.

939
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
Come back to the house.

940
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,320
Come back to the house?

941
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,320
What?

942
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,320
If you go in, will he come out of there?

943
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,320
Then he'll be there, too?

944
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,320
No, I didn't say that specifically.

945
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,320
Are you saying we should live in the same house?

946
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,320
What's the relationship between you two?

947
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,320
We're not in any relationship, but we live in the same house.

948
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,320
No, it's different.

949
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:30,320
We were a couple.

950
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,320
Not anymore.

951
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,320
I don't think you've done enough.

952
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,320
What do you mean?

953
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,320
You said the company gave you a big development.

954
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,320
Why didn't you say anything?

955
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,320
It's nothing.

956
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,320
Isn't a big development something?

957
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,320
You know what your stamp is on.

958
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,320
It's not hard to make a deal with a conspiracy.

959
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
Is this the time to worry about me?

960
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,320
You said you didn't want to worry about me.

961
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,320
That's why I'm like that.

962
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,320
I'll solve my problems from now on.

963
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,320
It's burdensome for you, who doesn't even care about me,

964
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,320
to avoid everything.

965
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,320
Why are you so harsh?

966
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,320
I'm doing this for you.

967
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,320
I don't want you to do anything for me.

968
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,320
I'm going to find a way.

969
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,320
I'm going to find a way.

970
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,320
I'm going to find a way.

971
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,320
I'm going to find a way.

972
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,320
I'm going to find a way.

973
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,320
I'm going to find a way.

974
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,320
I'm going to find a way.

975
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,320
I'm going to find a way.

976
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,320
I'm going to find a way.

977
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,320
I'm going to find a way.

978
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,320
I'm going to find a way.

979
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,320
I'm going to find a way.

980
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,320
I'm going to find a way.

981
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,320
I'm going to find a way.

982
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,320
I'm going to find a way.

983
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,320
I'm going to find a way.

984
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,320
I'm going to find a way.

985
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,320
I'm going to find a way.

986
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,320
I'm going to find a way.

987
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,320
I'm going to find a way.

988
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,320
I'm going to find a way.

989
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,320
Yes, Professor.

990
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,320
I've been taking medicine all the time,

991
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,320
but I've been having a lot of headaches lately.

992
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:51,320
I'm getting shots every day that raise the blood sugar index.

993
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,120
I don't think the tumor has gotten wider.

994
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,920
Is something else wrong?

995
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,420
Haeno, I think Haeno is here.

996
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,820
I said, I think he's here.

997
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,220
Tell me the truth.

998
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,520
Are you crazy?

999
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,320
You're sick of Haeyoon, aren't you?

1000
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,420
Tell me.

1001
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,620
You've been acting weird lately.

1002
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,220
You've been licking the floor last time you fell.

1003
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,620
You seem to be getting a shot secretly.

1004
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,620
I think something's going on in the front.

1005
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,020
I don't want Haeyoon to know.

1006
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,820
But...

1007
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,220
While I'm away, you have to take care of her.

1008
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,920
So you just have to keep this in mind.

1009
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,020
What?

1010
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,620
Yes, ma'am.

1011
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,920
I'm in the middle of it.

1012
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,420
But the area is wide...

1013
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,420
And the case is too rare.

1014
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,820
So I can't do the surgery right now.

1015
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,120
I'm taking my medicine and watching the cold.

1016
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,420
But the possibility is not high.

1017
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,620
What possibility?

1018
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,320
The possibility of living?

1019
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,720
Is it not high?

1020
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,720
My goodness.

1021
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,520
What's going on?

1022
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,320
She's not a young baby.

1023
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,520
Other than you,

1024
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,220
I don't know about the family yet.

1025
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,120
You don't know your parents either?

1026
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,620
No.

1027
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,220
You should know about this.

1028
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,820
What if you don't?

1029
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,120
When did you find out?

1030
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,620
I'm getting divorced.

1031
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,720
Do you remember the day I came home?

1032
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,920
I found out when I went back to Seoul that day.

1033
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,120
What are you talking about?

1034
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,420
Then...

1035
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:21,020
You should've said you'd get divorced tomorrow.

1036
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,620
But you suddenly said you weren't getting divorced.

1037
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,320
I just wanted to hold it in a little longer

1038
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,720
because Hyeyeon was sick.

1039
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,720
You scumbag.

1040
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,420
Did I raise you to be a big boy?

1041
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,420
Oh, my.

1042
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,820
I didn't even know about this.

1043
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,520
I only felt sorry for my son.

1044
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,720
How could you do that?

1045
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,120
That's right.

1046
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,920
Your son is a really bad guy.

1047
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,420
Even after knowing all that,

1048
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,920
I asked him to come here, so I followed him.

1049
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,120
So, Mom...

1050
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,620
When I'm not around...

1051
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,220
Please take good care of Hyein.

1052
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,320
Please.

1053
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,320
Mom!

1054
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,420
What is it?

1055
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,220
I was going to get some kimchi.

1056
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,120
Your mom is crying right now.

1057
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,120
Why would she?

1058
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,620
Why would she?

1059
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,120
She said she didn't want to.

1060
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,520
She told me to stop.

1061
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,220
But she was upset that her husband

1062
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,420
left the house because of her.

1063
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,020
What?

1064
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,220
She said she was relieved

1065
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,120
because her father was not here.

1066
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,020
That's what she said.

1067
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,520
Oh, my.

1068
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,620
Mother!

1069
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,920
I'll come later.

1070
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,320
Why are there so many?

1071
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,620
I'll just have breakfast here.

1072
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,420
Go and tell Hyein to eat.

1073
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,020
Okay.

1074
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,820
Honey, it's Pomi.

1075
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,720
What's wrong? Move.

1076
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,920
I know how you feel.

1077
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,520
But...

1078
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,220
What do you think?

1079
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,420
You took all the money

1080
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,320
that was left from all the men

1081
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,320
who were around you.

1082
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:32,920
What do you mean?

1083
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,020
I'm not going to use it.

1084
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,820
That's right.

1085
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,220
You've been drinking since morning.

1086
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,520
Is it some kind of day?

1087
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,420
Yes. Please eat.

1088
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,020
Hyein, come here. Let's eat.

1089
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,020
Okay.

1090
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,320
Where's your sister?

1091
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,420
The criminal went to Seoul early in the morning.

1092
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,520
I see.

1093
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,520
I wish you had eaten with him.

1094
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,220
Let's eat.

1095
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,120
Why can't I see Sucheol?

1096
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,320
Dahye, Dahye, Dahye.

1097
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,320
Dahye.

1098
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,320
Oh, my.

1099
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,820
Why are you here again?

1100
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:58,920
You didn't take off your clothes and put on your hair.

1101
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,620
Seriously.

1102
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,720
I'll just say one thing.

1103
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,320
Forget it. What are you going to say?

1104
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:04,820
What is this?

1105
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,520
It's a vaccination record.

1106
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,720
It has all the English and Korean words.

1107
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,820
This month, you'll be able to get a vaccine.

1108
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:10,820
I'll be there.

1109
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,820
I'll be there.

1110
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,020
I have all the Korean and English words.

1111
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,120
You have to get a shot of the second round of Gunwoo MMR and water.

1112
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,220
Show me where it is and make sure you get it right.

1113
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,420
When you get shot, make sure you call the baby shark.

1114
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,620
Baby shark.

1115
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:27,720
I got a cute baby shark.

1116
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,920
Baby shark.

1117
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,220
Mom shark.

1118
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,420
I got a cute baby shark.

1119
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,120
Thank you.

1120
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,420
Oh, my.

1121
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,020
Oh, my baby shark.

1122
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,520
Oh, my.

1123
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,720
Oh, my baby shark.

1124
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,320
The baby shark didn't even cry.

1125
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,920
What is it?

1126
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,520
What is it?

1127
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,120
Where are you going?

1128
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,620
To Seoul.

1129
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,820
All of a sudden?

1130
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,720
Why are you going to Seoul

1131
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,920
with your aunt and your family?

1132
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,520
Do you want to stand out among the reporters?

1133
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,320
Why are we here?

1134
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,020
I have to go.

1135
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,320
You said you met with Yoon Eunseo the other day.

1136
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:53,920
Did you tell the police to stop you

1137
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,820
because you were so stubborn?

1138
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,820
You're still going to meet with Yoon Eunseo, right?

1139
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,220
What is it?

1140
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,920
Are you going to tell them to save you?

1141
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,620
I have to live.

1142
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,020
Then we'll all die together.

1143
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:09,720
What?

1144
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,220
Look at you.

1145
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,920
Are you trying to get under Yoon Eunseo?

1146
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,520
I'm not under Yoon Eunseo. I'm supposed to be.

1147
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,920
Are you trying to get your dad's money

1148
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,220
and eat it all by yourself

1149
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:26,320
to get along with Yoon Eunseo?

1150
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,020
Think whatever you want.

1151
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:35,920
Hey!

1152
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,520
What?

1153
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,020
Hey, are you going to Seoul?

1154
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,120
Yes.

1155
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,520
There aren't many taxis here.

1156
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,120
Get on the taxi I'll take you.

1157
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,320
I'll catch you.

1158
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,220
Mother.

1159
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,220
Yes?

1160
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,120
Thank you for everything.

1161
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,520
Where are you going?

1162
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,320
You're talking nonsense.

1163
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,320
It's so windy.

1164
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,920
It's so snowy.

1165
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,020
You know you can't do it, right?

1166
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,120
You're going to get hurt.

1167
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,020
You're going to get hurt.

1168
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,020
You're going to get hurt.

1169
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,720
You're going to get hurt.

1170
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,920
You're going to get hurt.

1171
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,620
You're going to get hurt.

1172
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:13,120
But we're not secretive.

1173
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,920
If I ran to Sokcho to catch you

1174
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,620
because you couldn't break up

1175
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,820
because you were my first love,

1176
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,720
it's all a memory now, right?

1177
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,020
If you were having a hard time back then,

1178
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,120
you could've gone to Las Vegas

1179
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,620
and got the drugs...

1180
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,020
So...

1181
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,120
You're going to tell me, right?

1182
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,520
It's a secret that I heard from your wife.

1183
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,020
Who?

1184
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,720
Oh, the chairman of Queens Hong Mandae?

1185
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,320
Oh, the chairman is there.

1186
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,420
Do you know Chairman Hong is here?

1187
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:37,420
I don't think so.

1188
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,420
You got hit by Chairman Hong.

1189
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,420
Where are you going?

1190
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,820
It's an emergency.

1191
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,420
What's going on?

1192
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,220
You don't know yet.

1193
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,520
But you just don't know.

1194
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,320
Welcome back.

1195
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,420
I didn't come here because of that threat.

1196
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:09,420
You're not going to return what you stole from us.

1197
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,320
If you can't find everything you stole,

1198
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,320
you should at least work hard.

1199
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,220
I'm sorry.

1200
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,420
I'm sorry.

1201
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:26,920
I'm sorry.

1202
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,420
I'm sorry.

1203
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:30,420
I'm sorry.

1204
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,820
So keep your promise.

1205
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,520
The meeting will start soon.

1206
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,320
We didn't receive any orders.

1207
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,120
Haeyoon.

1208
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,820
What are you doing here?

1209
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,820
I'm here to see you.

1210
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,820
I'm here to see you.

1211
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,120
How did you get here?

1212
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,320
Why did you come here?

1213
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,420
I told you.

1214
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,120
I'm going to solve my own problems.

1215
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,520
That's how you do it?

1216
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,120
This?

1217
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,920
Yes.

1218
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,720
I like to be sure and fast.

1219
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,220
Let's go. It's time.

1220
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,320
I'm sorry.

1221
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,620
I'm sorry.

1222
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,120
I'm sorry.

1223
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,720
I'm sorry.

1224
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,020
Are you sure this is the place?

1225
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,120
I told you.

1226
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,320
I double-checked.

1227
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,620
I'm sure.

1228
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,520
Oh, no.

1229
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,620
Yes, ma'am.

1230
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,720
You still haven't found it?

1231
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,720
I know.

1232
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,620
I searched everywhere in the capital,

1233
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,620
but I think it's going to the countryside.

1234
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,520
Of course.

1235
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,120
I'll call you as soon as I find it.

1236
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,720
You saw that, right?

1237
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,720
I'm definitely a good girl.

1238
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,120
I'm sorry.

1239
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,120
The condition is the same.

1240
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,120
Yes.

1241
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,420
The main economic and daily lives,

1242
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,620
live live media and overseas telecommunications

1243
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:31,620
are being organized.

1244
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:34,020
The news is on the guidebook through the PR room.

1245
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,420
When we start the meeting,

1246
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,920
we'll release it without an embargo.

1247
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,520
We'll be hosting the forum,

1248
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,020
so you can relax and read the comments.

1249
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,920
The final presentation of the marriage...

1250
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,520
Then don't start the forum.

1251
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,920
I'll take care of it after the meeting.

1252
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,920
Okay.

1253
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:54,320
It's okay, right?

1254
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:03,020
Hello, I'm Yoo Eunsung.

1255
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,820
As PY1 Investments became the second largest shareholder

1256
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:08,120
of the Queens Group,

1257
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,820
I was promoted to the new CEO of the Queens Group

1258
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,320
at a temporary meeting.

1259
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,620
This is the copy of Chairman Jeon's copy

1260
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:16,120
of the original copy.

1261
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,920
I'll be the CEO of the Queens Group.

1262
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,420
I'm Lee Eunsung.

1263
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,620
I'm the CEO of the Queens Group.

1264
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:22,520
I'm the CEO of the Queens Group.

1265
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,620
I'm a representative of the Queens Group.

1266
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,420
I'm the CEO of the Queens Group.

1267
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,420
I'm the CEO of the Queens Group.

1268
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,220
This was an inevitable choice

1269
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,920
to counter the sudden collapse of Chairman Jeon

1270
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,420
of the Queens Group.

1271
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:36,820
I've been through a lot of crisis

1272
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,720
through successful M&A,

1273
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,420
and I've been able to normalize my business.

1274
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:44,520
Despite that, I've been caught up

1275
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,820
in various false news and irresponsible speculations.

1276
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:50,120
I betrayed Chairman Jeon of the Queens Group.

1277
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,820
I kicked out the Queens family.

1278
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:54,420
I raided them. I even imprisoned them.

1279
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,820
I secretly took them to Southeast Asia.

1280
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:02,120
One truth is that all of this

1281
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,420
was Chairman Jeon's intention.

1282
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:07,420
To prove this and to clear up misunderstandings,

1283
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:10,620
I'm going to make a major announcement.

1284
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,620
I'm going to re-elect my old friend

1285
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:18,620
and great manager, Hong Haein,

1286
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:22,220
as the CEO of the Queens Group.

1287
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,620
The Queens Group that was led by Chairman Haein

1288
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:27,820
recorded the highest sales profit in three years.

1289
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,320
I don't need any further explanation.

1290
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,020
Let's hear from Chairman Haein.

1291
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,420
Hello.

1292
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,420
I'm Hong Haein.

1293
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:53,120
As Chairman Yoon Eunseong just said,

1294
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,620
Chairman Yoon and I were old friends since college.

1295
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,820
I was threatened...

1296
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:08,420
By Chairman Yoon.

1297
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,820
I was threatened to send you to prison

1298
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,920
for any kind of offense

1299
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,020
against my husband and legal secretary.

1300
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:27,420
I have the documents to prove this.

1301
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,220
Haein, wait.

1302
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:34,220
And I can't go back to the position

1303
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,820
of CEO of the Queens Department.

1304
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:41,020
Because I was sentenced to...

1305
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,120
A trial because I had little time left.

1306
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:26,620
I need you all the time

1307
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:30,620
You're still in my heart

1308
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:35,620
Filled with longing

1309
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:37,620
I'm waiting for you

1310
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:41,020
I need you all the time

1311
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:44,820
I can't say anything

1312
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:49,820
I'm wandering in time

1313
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:53,420
I hate myself

1314
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:59,020
I'm wandering in time

1315
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:00,220
I like it!

1316
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,020
Why is Chairman Haein doing this again?

1317
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,020
Director Oh!

1318
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:10,020
I told you I wouldn't eat anymore.

1319
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:16,020
Okay. Then let's eat!

1320
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,820
Here, hold this.

1321
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,120
Here, here.

1322
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,220
Here, here.

1323
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:22,020
Here, here.

1324
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,620
What?

1325
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,320
What's going on?

1326
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:28,620
I'm Mr. Hong Haein's black knight.

1327
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,620
What are you doing?

1328
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,220
Let's do it.

1329
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,020
Love shot.

1330
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,020
Wow.

1331
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,020
100% real.

1332
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:05,020
Why are you so angry?

1333
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:07,020
Were you uncomfortable because of me?

1334
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,020
Yes.

1335
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,020
A lot.

1336
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:11,020
No, I...

1337
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,020
You're so cute.

1338
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,020
What?

1339
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,020
Baek Hyunwoo's teeth are so cute.

1340
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,020
But in front of other girls

1341
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:20,020
I'm drunk, cute, and...

1342
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,020
Who said that?

1343
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,020
I won't do that again.

1344
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,020
Remember.

1345
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:30,020
Baek Hyunwoo makes you feel excited when he drinks.

1346
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,020
That's his secret weapon.

1347
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:35,020
So don't use that weapon.

1348
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,020
Okay.

1349
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,020
I won't use it.

1350
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,020
I won't use it.

1351
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,020
I did that back then.

1352
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:13,020
I said I'd feel excited when I drink.

1353
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:15,020
Haein said that.

1354
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,020
Let's go.

1355
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,020
We're going to get drunk.

1356
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:21,020
Who should I choose?

1357
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:24,020
If I'm drunk and cute,

1358
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:26,020
would Haein feel excited?

1359
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:29,020
If so, wouldn't you have not gotten divorced?

1360
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:33,020
But why do I feel excited when I see Haein?

1361
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,020
Do you?

1362
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,020
I do.

1363
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:40,020
I feel excited when I see Haein.

1364
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:42,020
I like him.

1365
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:46,020
I miss him when I don't see him.

1366
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,020
If I do,

1367
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,020
I'm afraid I won't see him again.

1368
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,020
I'm so scared.

1369
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,020
But he...

1370
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:11,020
He says that he doesn't want me to do anything for him anymore.

1371
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,020
He says it's too much.

1372
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:16,020
He must hate you now.

1373
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,020
But he put a bandaid on me

1374
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,020
because I got hurt.

1375
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:22,020
He even gave me medicine.

1376
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,020
Really?

1377
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:26,020
Does he still have feelings for me?

1378
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,020
He's not sure.

1379
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:28,020
Ask him yourself.

1380
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,020
I like you.

1381
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:39,020
I hate you.

1382
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,020
I like you.

1383
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,020
I hate you.

1384
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,020
I like you.

1385
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,020
I hate you.

1386
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,020
I like you.

1387
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,020
I hate you.

1388
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,020
I like you.

1389
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,020
I like you.

1390
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,740
I like you.

1391
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,480
I hate you.

1392
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,480
I like you.

1393
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:17,260
I hate you.

1394
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,620
I don't like you.

1395
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,640
I don't like you.

1396
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,120
I like you.

1397
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,460
I don't hate you.

1398
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,500
What?

1399
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,700
You like me?

1400
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:40,020
Oh, really?

1401
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:49,320
I'm not.

1402
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:53,020
I...

1403
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,720
I love you.

1404
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:17,020
I love you, Hyein.

1405
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:43,020
The tears are falling.

1406
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:56,020
I can't comfort you with too obvious words.

1407
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:05,020
I'm sorry to say this alone.

1408
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:15,020
I'm going crazy over the obvious.

1409
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:25,020
I can't lose my confusing heart.

1410
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:28,020
If you let Hyein take you away,

1411
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,020
we'll be together.

1412
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:34,020
I just need to dry my hair with a broken hairdryer.

1413
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:37,020
I'm going to learn boxing from you.

1414
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,020
What?

1415
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:40,020
Do you want to meet at night?

1416
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:41,020
At night?

1417
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,020
I'm looking for the chairman's visa money.

1418
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,020
I'm going to transfer it.

1419
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:48,020
Please make it easier for me.

1420
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,020
I can't.

1421
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:52,020
I haven't told you yet.

1422
01:25:52,020 --> 01:26:00,020
I love you.

1423
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:14,020
