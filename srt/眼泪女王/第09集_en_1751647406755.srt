00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
Episode 8

2
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,940
What's this?

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,540
We're the ones who are blinded. Why are you all so upset?

4
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,180
It's a huge sum of money.

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,820
If we go over there, it'll be even worse.

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,780
Let's turn the car around.

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,220
But where are we going if we don't go home?

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,580
We can't go to the hotel in the meantime.

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,720
Yes, Grace.

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,920
Madam, there's no one at the back door.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,180
Come this way.

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,180
You're the only one here. Okay?

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,980
Turn the car around. Let's go to the back door.

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,780
What did she say? She's coming?

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,680
Make a work.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,980
A rich family being chased away by beggars.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,880
She's coming!

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,980
What are you doing? Why didn't you open the door?

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,580
Madam, you should get out for a bit.

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,780
What's wrong? I'm tired.

21
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,180
The will that Chairman Hong wrote to Madam Mo

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,980
is that she's threatening to take care of

23
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,780
her own family and Queen's Town.

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,680
So?

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,440
Is that what she's trying to do to drive us all out?

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,580
It's not that she's trying to drive us out.

27
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,040
She's already got reporters and the protestors.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,140
So she's telling us to stay away until things calm down...

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,080
Does Madam Mo have the right to do that?

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,840
We're all living together.

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,140
Will you shut up?

32
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,740
Were you talking to the adults?

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,040
What did you just say, Grace?

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,940
My gosh.

35
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,740
You're so bad at understanding situations.

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,940
The car, driver, phone, and credit card.

37
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,580
That's all.

38
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,220
The company's security key and the security key

39
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,080
won't work either.

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,180
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,120
Why can't you go into my house?

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,980
Call the police right now.

43
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,480
Yes, I will.

44
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,180
The reporters must love you so much.

45
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,280
I've packed my things

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,520
thinking about Junghoo.

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,980
So let's go.

48
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,880
Darn it.

49
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,280
Get in! There's a camera on the other side.

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,020
Is this even possible, Baek Seob-ah?

51
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,480
You're locking up my father's house

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,620
and making us come in here.

53
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,020
Is it even possible for us to leave?

54
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,020
As a co-habitant, I can claim the right.

55
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,620
But we must sue the person who filed the lawsuit.

56
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,680
It will take time.

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,280
More importantly,

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,120
the chairman is using his power as a special agent

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
to support his family.

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,320
So all the assets of real estate, stocks,

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,160
and personal accounts are locked up.

62
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,720
Father.

63
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,060
Is that true, honey?

64
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,360
I just found out. My lips are burning.

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,120
The person with the lip balm...

66
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,960
Stop talking about lip balms.

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,420
It's not good to keep posting photos

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,720
to the press because of the reporters.

69
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,320
It's best to stay in a safe place

70
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,920
and find a way to do that.

71
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,320
Is Sucheol a real estate agent or what?

72
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,020
Hey, Sucheol! What did you say?

73
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,460
So your wife,

74
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,020
the one from the Seonda family, was also a co-habitant?

75
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,960
What did I say?

76
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,560
Geon-woo said Sucheol doesn't look like him at all!

77
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
Auntie.

78
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,560
But where is he going?

79
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,960
Oh...

80
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
What?

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
What is it?

82
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
What?

83
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
What is it?

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
What is it?

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
What is it?

86
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Oh, no.

87
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,860
What is it?

88
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,760
It's a private property.

89
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,060
What?

90
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,660
What?

91
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,700
What?

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
What?

93
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
What?

94
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,800
Hey, Hyeon-u!

95
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,960
What are you doing here at this hour?

96
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,700
Dad, I was in a rush.

97
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,960
Hey, Baek Hyeon-u!

98
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,860
Why aren't you answering your phone?

99
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,800
Hey, you...

100
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
You don't even have money to buy food.

101
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
What's with your face?

102
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,560
No, it's not that...

103
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,460
It's not that.

104
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,500
That crazy jerk's house is a success.

105
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,900
Look. The one you left behind is a failure.

106
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,600
It's a science to be a human.

107
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,500
Wait.

108
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,540
Of course.

109
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,000
I was so upset when I saw the news

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,400
that the house was ruined.

111
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,700
It was so sad.

112
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,100
Anyway, you just have to forget about that

113
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,840
crazy jerk and live your life comfortably.

114
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,800
You're here with me.

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
Crazy jerk.

116
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Oh.

117
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,800
You're here.

118
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,200
You... You're here even more.

119
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
My goodness.

120
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Oh, my.

121
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,200
Is that your ex-husband?

122
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,740
Anyway, how did you get here?

123
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Oh, yes.

124
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,540
How have you been?

125
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,640
Oh, yes.

126
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,540
Yes, say hello.

127
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Hello.

128
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm sorry for the sudden visit, Father.

129
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,280
No, it's okay.

130
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Thank you for coming.

131
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,780
Let's go inside.

132
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,040
I'm going to Seoul.

133
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,840
Call a cab.

134
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Mom.

135
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,040
There's no cab in this neighborhood.

136
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,540
I'll go alone, so you guys can do whatever you want.

137
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740
Honey.

138
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,140
Honey.

139
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,840
Why did you come all the way here?

140
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,840
That's why I told you I wasn't coming.

141
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,340
Gosh, you!

142
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Oh.

143
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
What's wrong with her?

144
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,180
I think she's having an affair.

145
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,940
Don't come near me.

146
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,140
Why is she coming after me?

147
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,240
Look at this.

148
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,080
Look at this.

149
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,580
Young Master.

150
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,140
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:21,140
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:27,140
It's going to get wet.

153
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,140
Hey, Yeon-woo.

154
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,140
It's warm.

155
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,140
We have to rely on this situation.

156
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,140
Why did you drag your family here?

157
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,140
I don't think so.

158
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,140
Even though the man's armor is split,

159
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,140
the Korean Peninsula is shaking in the Olympics.

160
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,140
What do you mean?

161
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,140
It's also a conglomerate.

162
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,140
Then we can put the re-unification in place.

163
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,140
The Korean Peninsula is shaking.

164
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,140
It's not that easy to reunite, Dad.

165
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:13,140
Let's get ready.

166
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,140
What?

167
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,140
Thank you for today.

168
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,140
I'll find out when I go.

169
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,140
I'm going tomorrow.

170
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,140
There's no way the situation will change tomorrow.

171
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,140
I know.

172
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,140
So you can't stay here anymore.

173
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,140
It'll take a while to get better.

174
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:39,140
This is the safest and most comfortable place right now.

175
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,140
I'm not comfortable.

176
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,140
How can a divorced husband's home be comfortable?

177
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:53,140
I'm comfortable with myself.

178
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,140
I'll just think about myself for now.

179
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,140
I have so much to do right now,

180
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,140
but I can't even worry about you.

181
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,140
Don't worry about me.

182
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,140
Divorced people don't do that.

183
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,140
Whether I'm ruined or not,

184
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,140
no matter what happens to my family,

185
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,140
it has nothing to do with you.

186
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:27,140
I don't care when you're doing well.

187
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:37,140
I can't do that right now.

188
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:45,140
So you can look at me.

189
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:55,140
Just stay in front of me.

190
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,140
This is ridiculous.

191
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,140
Would we be happy to be together?

192
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,140
I'm going to be less unhappy.

193
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,140
Let's not think about anything else today.

194
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:13,140
Let's try to be less unhappy.

195
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:23,140
I'm going to be less unhappy.

196
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:31,140
I'm going to be less unhappy.

197
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:53,140
I'm going to be less unhappy.

198
00:11:53,140 --> 00:12:03,140
I'm going to be less unhappy.

199
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,140
What's wrong?

200
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:12,140
You look good.

201
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:22,140
Put this on first.

202
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:41,140
What should I do with those two?

203
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,140
Just throw them away.

204
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
What?

205
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,140
You're going to throw them away?

206
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,140
You're going to keep them?

207
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,140
I think it's going to be expensive.

208
00:12:50,140 --> 00:13:04,140
Isn't it over 50?

209
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:14,140
500.

210
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:20,140
I didn't come here because I wanted to.

211
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,140
No one can tell how fast your son is.

212
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
He's almost like a kidnapper.

213
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,140
My mother, who passed away, didn't say anything wrong.

214
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,140
She said she wasn't always sure about life.

215
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,140
Who knew that she'd meet him after working for a few days?

216
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
Why did my sister go there?

217
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,140
She's telling me to come to the villa right now.

218
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,140
She's going to leave me alone.

219
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
Yes, go.

220
00:13:51,140 --> 00:14:15,140
But don't drink it.

221
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,140
Excuse me.

222
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Are you Seosik?

223
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:30,140
Yes.

224
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,140
It's delicious.

225
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Is it okay to eat?

226
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,140
Yes, it's really good.

227
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Please eat a lot.

228
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,140
I told you to reduce the consumption.

229
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,140
If you know Dr. Yoon, it's going to be a mess.

230
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,140
Stop eating.

231
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
Don't worry.

232
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,140
Dr. Yoon didn't even answer my phone.

233
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:22,140
I think he's looking for me.

234
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Why don't you eat like this?

235
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,140
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,140
I don't have an appetite.

237
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,140
Do you have water?

238
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:44,140
Water, water, water.

239
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,140
I don't drink water that's sealed.

240
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,140
Do you have water?

241
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,140
Hey, just eat it.

242
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
No, no.

243
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,140
I'll bring you the water.

244
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
Thank you.

245
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,140
I'd like mineral water from Alps.

246
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,140
What? Alps?

247
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,140
You're really...

248
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,140
My son is immature.

250
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,140
Oh, no, no.

251
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,140
That's possible.

252
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,140
You don't have to go to Alps.

253
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,140
Germany or Australia is fine.

254
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,140
Switzerland is good, too.

255
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,140
We really don't mind that.

256
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:37,140
I'd like some of that.

257
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:48,140
Just drink the water from the tap.

258
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,140
Give it to me.

259
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,140
Give it to me.

260
00:16:53,140 --> 00:17:00,140
You're not doing that to me.

261
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,140
My sister is beating me up, right?

262
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,140
It was so scary.

263
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,140
What are you talking about?

264
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
You beat me up like that, too.

265
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,140
Hey, my hands aren't that hot.

266
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,140
But Honghae is...

267
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,140
Shall I help you?

268
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,140
No, no.

269
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,140
No, no.

270
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
You don't have to.

271
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:25,140
Go and rest.

272
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,140
But the all-you-can-eat...

273
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,140
I can call it all-you-can-eat.

274
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,140
I don't have a proper name.

275
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,140
Do whatever you want.

276
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
Don't like what I said earlier.

277
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,140
What did you say?

278
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,140
What about the bad guy?

279
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,140
I don't hate bad guys.

280
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,140
I was a bad guy in high school.

281
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,140
I'm a fox.

282
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,140
I'm sorry for saying that earlier.

283
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,140
You're not wrong.

284
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,140
You're screwed.

285
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,140
It's a careful thing to say,

286
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,140
but you two got divorced,

287
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,140
but you came all the way here.

288
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,140
Is it a heart signal?

289
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,140
No, we just came in a hurry.

290
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,140
That's all.

291
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Right, you're a man now.

292
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,140
I can't do better than a man.

293
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,140
But is there something between you two?

294
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,140
There's nothing.

295
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,140
Oh, there's nothing.

296
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,140
If there was something,

297
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,140
we wouldn't have split up.

298
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,140
That's right.

299
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,140
You're right.

300
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,140
So I hope you don't misunderstand,

301
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,140
expect, or make any other mistakes.

302
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,140
I won't.

303
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,140
I told you last time.

304
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,140
Soyeong is the daughter of the principal's teacher.

305
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,140
She's a teacher now,

306
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,140
but she got a V-Met at Eumne Middle School.

307
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,140
You keep asking me for Hyunwoo's number.

308
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,140
It's not like I can tell you.

309
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
Please tell me.

310
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,140
Is that okay?

311
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,140
I don't need permission.

312
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,140
Then good-bye.

313
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,140
I knew it.

314
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,140
I shouldn't have brought her here.

315
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,140
Hey,

316
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,140
you're so rude.

317
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,140
You're so rude that you cut me off.

318
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,140
You're so rude.

319
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,140
Why did you come to my house?

320
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,140
This is my house.

321
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,140
Before my eldest son and daughter got married,

322
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,140
I lived here.

323
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,140
I'll keep the fire going.

324
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
You're paying for this?

325
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,140
Oh, my.

326
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Don't say that.

327
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,140
I know the reason why you're here.

328
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,140
I know it's a problem,

329
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,140
but we were once family.

330
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,140
I heard from Hyunwoo

331
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,140
that you shouldn't tell anyone about this place.

332
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,140
I told the villagers not to work on the Internet.

333
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,140
I told them not to work.

334
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,140
There's no CCTV here.

335
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,140
The phone's battery is at its lowest level.

336
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,140
Don't worry about anything.

337
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
Have a good night's sleep.

338
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
Thank you so much.

339
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,140
Oh, my. You're so cold.

340
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
You can wash here.

341
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,140
Where's the bathtub?

342
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,140
There's no bathtub.

343
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,140
Here.

344
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,140
In the shower booth.

345
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,140
In the shower booth?

346
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,140
Where's the bath tub?

347
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
I don't use it.

348
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
Where's the bath bomb?

349
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,140
I don't use it.

350
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,140
I'll use it as a towel.

351
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,140
Didn't you say your nephew's name was Ho Yeori?

352
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,140
That's right. Baek Ho Yeol.

353
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,140
No way.

354
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,140
The baby Ho Yeol isn't the baby Ho Yeol we saw earlier, right?

355
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,140
Yes, there were times like this.

356
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
He was so cute.

357
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,140
Yes, that's right. Baek Ho Yeol.

358
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,140
It's that Ho Yeol.

359
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,140
How many years has it been?

360
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
What's wrong?

361
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,140
Should I get you a new towel?

362
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,140
Hae Young.

363
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:18,140
What I don't believe more than this towel that's been eight years old is that

364
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:25,140
right now, Da Hae and Geon-woo aren't by my side.

365
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,140
That bastard, Yoon Eun-sung, is going to trick me and make fun of me.

366
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,140
What happened?

367
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
Where did you send the family members of this house?

368
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
You're here.

369
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
Where did Hae-in's family go?

370
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,140
I don't know.

371
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
They probably didn't go anywhere.

372
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,140
Why did you do that?

373
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,140
So you want to live here together?

374
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,140
You can live with people who took everything from you

375
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,140
and look at each other's faces in one house.

376
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,140
It's not over yet.

377
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,140
They're going to try to get this side of the drug somehow

378
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,140
and try to find a secret to attack.

379
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,140
You'd rather leave them...

380
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,140
You just want to leave Hae-in by your side, don't you?

381
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Forget it.

382
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
There's no trace of her after it's over.

383
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
It's a waste of regret.

384
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,140
I've lived in this house for 25 years.

385
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,140
It's the first time I've chosen wine that I want to drink.

386
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,140
Let's enjoy life while enjoying the things we enjoy.

387
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,140
Okay?

388
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,140
You sent me to the orphanage, didn't you?

389
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,140
Don't forget.

390
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,140
I love you the most in the world.

391
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
That's why I'll endure it.

392
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,140
I'll endure it even if I want to see you

393
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,140
and even if I want to be with you.

394
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,140
I'll endure it because I love you.

395
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,140
You kept your promise well.

396
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
You endured it very well, didn't you?

397
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,140
I'm sure you know how a young son

398
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,140
lives after meeting someone in a faraway country.

399
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,140
You didn't even ask or contact me.

400
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,140
But after trying it,

401
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,140
you said you'd endure it because you love me.

402
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,140
That's all a lie.

403
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,140
You can't endure it...

404
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,140
if you really love me.

405
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,140
What do you want to say?

406
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,140
Do you want to come back and blame me?

407
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,140
No.

408
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,140
I'm saying I'll bring you home no matter what.

409
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,140
I'm different from you.

410
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,140
I'm going crazy just imagining

411
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,140
what you're doing with someone.

412
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
I...

413
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,140
can't stand it.

414
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,140
I came all the way here with so much difficulty.

415
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,140
Why did I come all the way here?

416
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,140
I have a different goal from you.

417
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,140
So just like how you abandoned me

418
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,140
and chose this family,

419
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,140
I can also abandon you

420
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,140
and choose something else.

421
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,140
I'm sorry.

422
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,140
Search the hotel and find a place to go.

423
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,140
This is hell.

424
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,140
What kind of hell would you go to to lay a bed?

425
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,140
The floor is warm.

426
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,140
Even if you abandon me,

427
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,140
will you still be able to deceive me?

428
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,140
What?

429
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,140
This is the first time

430
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,140
that Sucheol has slept on the floor.

431
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,140
If it wasn't for the Spanish royal bed,

432
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,140
I wouldn't have been able to lie down.

433
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,140
My blanket looks softer than that of Sucheol's.

434
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,140
Let's change this.

435
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,140
Honey.

436
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,140
Why?

437
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,140
This is my first time too.

438
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,140
This is my first time sleeping on the floor.

439
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,140
I'm also a second generation.

440
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,140
Hello?

441
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,140
Geumhui.

442
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
I saw the news.

443
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
What did everyone say?

444
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,140
It's a mess.

445
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,140
Geumhui, what do we do about my father?

446
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,140
Let's cut the talk about your father.

447
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,140
Why are you doing this to me?

448
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
Don't you remember what he said?

449
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
He told you not to come even if you die.

450
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,140
So don't call me even if he dies.

451
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,140
Geumhui, don't do this to me.

452
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,140
I hated him so much when he was a good father.

453
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,140
But now that things have turned out this way,

454
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
I'm getting into so many things.

455
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
What do you mean?

456
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,140
Geumhui.

457
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,140
If I had been nice to her,

458
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,140
I would've been able to live with her.

459
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,140
Maybe I was too mean to her

460
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,140
and she went crazy.

461
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
About 10 years ago,

462
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,140
I was so mad when my father got married to her.

463
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,140
So my father gave up.

464
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,140
He could've gotten so mad and done this.

465
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,140
I should've given this ring to Geumhui.

466
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,140
Should I just give it to her?

467
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,140
Should I just give it to her now?

468
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,140
Geumhui.

469
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,140
I'm sorry for everything that happened to my father.

470
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
Geumhui.

471
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,140
Why are you crying?

472
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,140
Did your husband leave?

473
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,140
No?

474
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
Then are your parents sick?

475
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,140
Yes.

476
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,140
My father is sick.

477
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,140
When your parents are sick,

478
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,140
I think of all the things I did wrong.

479
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
Cry.

480
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,140
Cry and grow up well.

481
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
Everything will be fine.

482
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,140
Thank you.

483
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,140
Mom.

484
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,140
Mom.

485
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,140
What is it?

486
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,140
There's a crazy guy in my neighborhood.

487
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,140
He keeps following me around saying I'm his mom.

488
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,140
Tell him he's my daughter.

489
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,140
Mom.

490
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,140
Why are you out here all night?

491
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,140
Excuse me.

492
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,140
This is my mom.

493
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,140
So you should go.

494
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,140
What did you say?

495
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,140
I'm his daughter.

496
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
Go.

497
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,140
Isn't she from Seoul?

498
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,140
She's my mom.

499
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,140
She's my mom!

500
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,140
Mom, aren't you going to watch a drama?

501
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
A drama?

502
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,140
I should watch it. I should watch a drama.

503
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,140
Let's go.

504
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,140
What is this?

505
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,140
Baekhyun's taste is pretty similar to mine.

506
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,140
Are you sleeping?

507
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,140
I'm going to sleep now. Why?

508
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,140
I have to leave early tomorrow.

509
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,140
I can't see my face.

510
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,140
I'm going to work early tomorrow.

511
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,140
When do you think you'll be off work?

512
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,140
I don't know.

513
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,140
Aren't you going on a day off tomorrow?

514
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,140
Can't I take a day off tomorrow?

515
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,140
Good night.

516
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,140
I'm going to sleep listening to music at the MPC.

517
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,140
Oh, that? Is it worth listening to?

518
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,140
It's all old songs.

519
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,140
It's just my taste.

520
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,140
I like all the songs.

521
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,140
But that's not mine.

522
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,140
Then?

523
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,140
I gave it to you before, but you didn't find the owner.

524
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
So I got it.

525
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,140
Where did you give it?

526
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,140
At the school playground in high school.

527
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,140
I gave it to you because you didn't find the owner.

528
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,140
I gave it to you because you didn't find the owner.

529
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,140
At the school playground.

530
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,140
Didn't you say you came out of the sky?

531
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,140
I did.

532
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,140
I died on the first day of transfer.

533
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,140
What?

534
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,140
That was this?

535
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,140
Wait.

536
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,140
That was Baek Hyunho?

537
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,140
That's ridiculous.

538
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Wait.

539
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,140
Is Baek Hyunho a guy who likes me?

540
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,140
He fell in love with me in that short moment

541
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,140
and kept this until now.

542
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,140
If he knew that I was the woman he fell in love with,

543
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,140
he would have fainted.

544
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,140
I'm sorry.

545
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,140
I'm sorry.

546
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
Why do you still have this?

547
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,140
I guess she was really pretty.

548
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,140
What?

549
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,140
I...

550
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,140
You don't have it?

551
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,140
Of course not.

552
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,140
It's from a long time ago.

553
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,140
I know.

554
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,140
But the fact that she still has it

555
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,140
means that the impact she gave was that strong.

556
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,140
She must have been really pretty.

557
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,140
What impact?

558
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,140
I don't remember if the owner was a man or a woman,

559
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,140
a teacher, a student, or a man in the water.

560
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,140
I don't remember anything.

561
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,140
Then why did you keep it?

562
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,140
I didn't keep it.

563
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,140
I just left it with the lock.

564
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,140
Okay.

565
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,140
Go.

566
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,140
Go.

567
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,140
Go and sleep.

568
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,140
What now?

569
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,140
I'll sleep with the curtains on.

570
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,140
It's a bit snowy in the morning

571
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,140
because it's the East.

572
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,140
Okay, so get out.

573
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,140
I'm sorry.

574
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,140
I'm sorry.

575
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,140
I'm sorry.

576
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:57,140
I guess I'm left with something that keeps coming to mind

577
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:05,140
I like you more

578
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:11,140
I like you

579
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,140
I like you

580
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
Do you need my help?

581
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
Sure.

582
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,140
I'm going to make japchae.

583
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,140
Cut some carrots.

584
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
Okay.

585
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,140
Baby, you need to cut carrots instead of fingers.

586
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,140
You need to cut them thinly.

587
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,140
How thin?

588
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,140
How exactly do you want me to cut them?

589
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
That's...

590
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,140
So...

591
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
Give it to me.

592
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,140
What?

593
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,140
Mother.

594
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,140
Yes?

595
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,140
You're really good.

596
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,140
What's so great about this?

597
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
What do you mean?

598
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,140
This is like modern art.

599
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,140
Really?

600
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,140
Oh, my.

601
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,140
I've never heard of this before.

602
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,140
You said you were going to make japchae.

603
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,140
What else do I need to do next?

604
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Next, I need to make egg garnish.

605
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,140
How do you do that?

606
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Garnish?

607
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,140
Do you want to see it in action?

608
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,140
I'm looking forward to it.

609
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,140
You're amazing.

610
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,140
You need to do it with both hands.

611
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,140
Oh, my.

612
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,140
Mother, you're so amazing.

613
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,140
Amazing?

614
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,140
Should I make you go crazy?

615
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
Crazy?

616
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,140
Do you really believe in your mother?

617
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,140
What's wrong with you?

618
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,140
You said you were going to make a fortune.

619
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,140
Why?

620
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,140
Do you hate your brother-in-law?

621
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
You're afraid he'll get in trouble if he finds out

622
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
that we're there?

623
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,140
That's funny.

624
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,140
Who helped you when you were in trouble?

625
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,140
I'm a woman too, but how could I do this to him?

626
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,140
Forget it.

627
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,140
You were here.

628
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
I looked everywhere for you.

629
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,140
Why me?

630
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,140
This is clean now.

631
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,140
It doesn't smell and it's fine.

632
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Really?

633
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,140
If it's okay, I'll buy it.

634
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,140
Really?

635
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,140
It's expensive, but how can you buy it for free?

636
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,140
It's really okay.

637
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,140
Take it.

638
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,140
Then should I do your hair?

639
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,140
I'm good at it.

640
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,140
What style would you like?

641
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,140
What style can I do?

642
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,140
Anything.

643
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,140
I used to work at a hair salon in Cheongdam-dong.

644
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,140
Mi Seon, what's going on?

645
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,140
I've never been this upset since the sixth sense.

646
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,140
I'm sweating like crazy.

647
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,140
I heard you were there when I was cursing at you.

648
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,140
Is this a movie or a drama?

649
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,140
It's more fun than the ending of a drama.

650
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,140
So what happened?

651
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,140
You two can talk later.

652
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,140
I heard that crazy woman, Yein's mom, is here.

653
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,140
What are you talking about?

654
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,140
She didn't say anything.

655
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,140
Go away.

656
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,140
Go away.

657
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,140
I don't want to go.

658
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,140
I heard everything from my husband.

659
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,140
He stepped on my poop, yelled, and cried.

660
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,140
He was so upset.

661
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,140
That's amazing.

662
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,140
How could he step on my poop?

663
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:31,140
I'm the one who stepped on your poop.

664
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,140
Right.

665
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,140
You're not my son-in-law, but my son-in-law.

666
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,140
I'm so embarrassed.

667
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,140
I was so embarrassed that I was going to take it.

668
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,140
I heard you were a total beggar.

669
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,140
Your mom is so talkative.

670
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,140
She's so kind.

671
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,140
Okay.

672
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,140
That woman is so mean.

673
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
She did something wrong.

674
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,140
How could she move here?

675
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,140
Right.

676
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,140
I really want to see her face.

677
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,140
Me, too.

678
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,140
What?

679
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,140
Did you get your lips stained?

680
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,140
Look.

681
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,140
Please join us.

682
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,140
AOMG New Peking Entertainment City 772772.

683
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,140
You said you wanted to see my face.

684
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,140
What?

685
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
What?

686
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,140
My fortune is tied to the president for a while.

687
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,140
It's not a lie.

688
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,140
I'm not a wild slave.

689
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,140
It's night now.

690
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
And I'm going to go.

691
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,140
So I'm not a fool.

692
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,140
Do you understand?

693
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,140
Yes.

694
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,140
Yes.

695
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,140
Seriously.

696
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,140
How could you eat me?

697
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,140
Excuse me.

698
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,140
Ko Sik.

699
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
You didn't have breakfast?

700
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,140
I'm going to the washroom at the department store.

701
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,140
The bean noodles are so savory and delicious.

702
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,140
Would you like some?

703
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,140
I didn't eat carbs this morning.

704
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,140
What a jerk.

705
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,140
When did he eat carbs this morning?

706
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,140
You're the president of the world's youngest group.

707
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,140
Please tell us how you feel.

708
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,140
How are you going to lead the group?

709
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,140
Is there any discrimination

710
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,140
or discrimination in the philosophy of the younger generation?

711
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,140
There's a saying that there will be

712
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,140
a global structure.

713
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,140
Is that true?

714
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,140
How is the health of the younger generation?

715
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,140
We're going to establish a Singaporean law firm

716
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,140
by 2025 to establish a national center

717
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,140
for the establishment of the country

718
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,140
by opening up the overseas market

719
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,140
and establishing a national center.

720
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,140
It's a plan to establish a Singaporean law firm

721
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,140
by 2025.

722
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,140
It's a plan to establish a Singaporean law firm

723
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,140
and use the money to run the law firm.

724
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,140
It's a plan to use about $1.4 billion.

725
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,140
I went to see Mr. Song and talked to him.

726
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,140
He didn't know about the non-funds.

727
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,140
He did the non-funds in Korea and overseas,

728
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,140
but he didn't know the final destination.

729
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,140
Does that make sense?

730
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,140
The non-funds were also written in the office

731
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,140
and sent to Mr. Hong.

732
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,140
The money laundering process

733
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,140
was a complicated process that took more than 10 countries.

734
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:52,140
The last one was in the Malaysian Laos.

735
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,140
But it wasn't there.

736
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,140
You called me, Mr. Song?

737
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,140
Isn't that sound too easy to hear?

738
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,140
There's no reason for it to be difficult.

739
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,140
The situation has changed.

740
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,140
I'm no longer the son-in-law of the King's,

741
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,140
and I'm no longer the husband of the CEO of the company.

742
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,140
I see.

743
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,140
But what can I do?

744
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:25,140
I'm uncomfortable with you being the department head.

745
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,140
You can do that. I understand.

746
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,140
Baek Hyeon-woo.

747
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,140
Stop acting.

748
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,140
I think you know everything,

749
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,140
so I won't lie to you anymore.

750
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,140
I'm waiting.

751
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,140
I've put Baek Hwa, Taepung, and Hwang Hyeon-kim

752
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,140
in three places.

753
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,140
I'm negotiating my salary,

754
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,140
but this is the case.

755
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,140
There's a big difference between when I'm working

756
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,140
and when I'm not.

757
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,140
As you know, I didn't get anything

758
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,140
from the negotiation between Hae-in and Lee Hyeon-woo,

759
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,140
so I have to do well this time.

760
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,140
I think it'll take about a month.

761
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,140
Can I ask for your understanding?

762
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,140
So you're preparing for a second term?

763
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,140
Yes.

764
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,140
But I'm not allowed to enter the confidential documents

765
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,140
of the legal team,

766
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,140
so you won't have to worry.

767
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,140
Go ahead.

768
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,140
Where are you?

769
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,140
Hae-in.

770
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,140
Isn't it Baek Hyeon-woo who took you out yesterday?

771
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,140
Where is he now?

772
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,140
I don't know.

773
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,140
You don't know where he went after taking him out?

774
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,140
That's right.

775
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,140
I don't know if he doesn't trust me,

776
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,140
but he just took the car and left.

777
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,140
He's not answering his phone.

778
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,140
If you know where he is,

779
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,140
please share it with me.

780
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,140
Okay.

781
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,140
Hae-in.

782
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,140
But this car is owned by my wife.

783
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,140
You look much better in it.

784
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,140
You look great in that outfit.

785
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:48,140
It's fancy, elegant, and not easy to lose.

786
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,140
This is why I didn't dress up.

787
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,140
It's too obvious if I touch it.

788
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,140
Please come before I clean up the shop.

789
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,140
I'll take care of it for you.

790
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,140
Grace, are you going to clean up the shop?

791
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,140
What?

792
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,140
What?

793
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,140
I thought it was going well.

794
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,140
You have to clean up the shop, of course.

795
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,140
Right?

796
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,140
You've been doing it for a long time.

797
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,140
I know.

798
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,140
I thought I was getting a cold

799
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,140
after giving people a massage.

800
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,140
That's not possible.

801
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,140
Right?

802
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,140
I'm thinking of launching a cosmetic line

803
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,140
with the MD products from the department store.

804
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,140
What do you think?

805
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,140
If we can make the brand image

806
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,140
of the brand

807
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,140
look like the brand of France, Lafayette, or Harold in England...

808
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,140
Wait, wait.

809
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,140
Are you on a leave?

810
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,140
What?

811
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,140
Are you on a leave?

812
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,140
Aren't I going to be the CEO?

813
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,140
Oh, I see.

814
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,140
You're not going to be the CEO from the start.

815
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,140
Then I'll move out.

816
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,140
What is it?

817
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,140
Close the shop

818
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,140
and get ready to move to the US as a former director.

819
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,140
If you get caught here,

820
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,140
there will be too many things for us to do.

821
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,140
If you want to start a cosmetic company,

822
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,140
you can start there.

823
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,140
I'll look for a investor.

824
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,140
Even if you quit your job, move out, and settle down,

825
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,140
you can never move to a Korean branch.

826
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,140
That's the academy.

827
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,140
Your daughter is in the third year of high school.

828
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,140
She's studying cello,

829
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,140
and she's taking a class in the entrance exam.

830
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,140
I filed a lawsuit against her

831
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,140
for fraudulent information and confidentiality,

832
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,140
but she couldn't be found.

833
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,140
It took me a long time to find her.

834
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,140
Wow, she had this.

835
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,140
It's not like she didn't have a copy.

836
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,140
She wouldn't have had a wife.

837
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,140
Who is this?

838
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,140
Hong Sucheol,

839
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,140
I'll tell you the truth about Cheon Dahye,

840
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,140
who was your wife for a while.

841
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,140
It might be a little scary.

842
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,140
You're not a good person

843
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,140
just because you're older and slender, right?

844
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:25,140
But I'm five years older than you.

845
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,140
My parents, my family, my education,

846
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,140
they're all fake.

847
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,140
I'll tell you one more thing.

848
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,140
Geonu isn't your child.

849
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,140
You can't tell, can you?

850
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,140
You're an Arab, but Geonu is a Tofu.

851
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,140
How can you not suspect him?

852
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,140
I'm sorry I broke up with you.

853
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,140
Where else would I meet someone like you?

854
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,140
Are you going to marry me or not?

855
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,140
I told you I wouldn't.

856
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,140
Fine, but give me those gloves.

857
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,140
You're a coward, but you're a coward.

858
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,140
What's my name?

859
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,140
Cheon Dahye.

860
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,140
You're rich, but you're a bad-mannered loser.

861
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,140
You don't have to marry me.

862
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,140
Fine.

863
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,140
But are you warm-hearted?

864
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,140
I'm sorry.

865
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,140
If you gave me everything I asked for,

866
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,140
I should've seen you when we met again.

867
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,140
To start the hope of the two of you,

868
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,140
please give them a round of applause.

869
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,140
You're a good man and a good woman.

870
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,140
Hey.

871
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,140
Don't be so sad.

872
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,140
That woman, Hong Yein,

873
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,140
got so upset because she got married

874
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,140
without listening to me.

875
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,140
You have to seduce Hong Sucheol

876
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,140
and get dressed right away.

877
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,140
I know.

878
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,140
But are you going to use your real name?

879
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,140
Make a name for yourself.

880
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,140
No, I'm going to use Cheon Dahye.

881
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,140
But where is Hong Sucheol?

882
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,140
He's over there.

883
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,140
Don't get married in the first place.

884
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,140
You're going to get in trouble.

885
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,140
Wow.

886
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,140
Did he grow up so well?

887
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,140
Don't be so cute. You're totally my type.

888
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,140
No.

889
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,140
After that...

890
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,140
You're not going to get married?

891
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,140
How can you not get married here?

892
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,140
You're going to get married?

893
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,140
No, no.

894
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,140
That fool.

895
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,140
He's still the same.

896
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,140
Since you're here,

897
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,140
eat something delicious.

898
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,140
Director, nice to meet you.

899
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,140
Where have you been?

900
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,140
I've been looking for you.

901
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,140
Welcome.

902
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,140
Please eat a lot.

903
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,140
You didn't even remember me.

904
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,140
Hello.

905
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,140
I'm Cheon Dahye.

906
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,140
Cheon Dahye?

907
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,140
Wow, what a pretty name.

908
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,140
Of course, your face...

909
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,140
Yes.

910
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,140
Since you didn't come to eat...

911
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,140
I'm here...

912
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,140
As if you didn't remember me,

913
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,140
I'm here to eat.

914
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,140
I'm here to eat.

915
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,140
I'm here to eat.

916
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,140
As if you didn't remember me,

917
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,140
please forget about me.

918
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,140
And Geonu.

919
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,140
It won't be hard.

920
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,140
You're a bad person.

921
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,140
Hey.

922
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,140
Why are you crying?

923
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,140
Where did I find Dahye?

924
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,140
I can't find her.

925
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:11,140
She must've gone to the place where you caught her.

926
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,140
I didn't take her.

927
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,140
I left her there.

928
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,140
What is it?

929
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,140
Let go.

930
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,140
I left her here.

931
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:29,140
I told you that Dahye was the most precious person in the world.

932
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,140
I left her here,

933
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,140
so precious that I could never forget her.

934
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,140
Where did I leave her?

935
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,140
Dahye.

936
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,140
I'm awake.

937
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,140
Look at this, Geonu.

938
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:38,140
The girl that Dahye liked so much.

939
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,140
Hey, what's the point of doing this?

940
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,140
The case is already turned upside down.

941
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,140
We have to turn it upside down again.

942
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,140
How?

943
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,140
Yoon Eunsung didn't go there in a normal way.

944
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,140
I'm going to prove it.

945
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,140
Okay.

946
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,140
Let's say there was an illegal element and we're looking for all the evidence.

947
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,140
Claiming the criminal, trial, and lawsuit.

948
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,140
That's at least five years.

949
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,140
You're going to do that?

950
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,140
I'm going to do it in a shortcut.

951
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,140
What is it?

952
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,140
Investing.

953
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,140
Yoon Eunsung is going to trust a new business

954
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,140
and to steal the owner's shares with a quiz,

955
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,140
he planned to invest in Lee Joowon.

956
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,140
If that's proven,

957
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,140
it's easy to solve the family's family debt.

958
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,140
Above all, we can steal Yoon Eunsung's management rights.

959
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,140
The stolen shares are still the shares of the family debt.

960
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,140
I'm going to steal the way Yoon Eunsung did.

961
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,140
What is it?

962
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,140
We have time.

963
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,140
You should've given us the HR report.

964
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,140
It's uncomfortable to stay at the office.

965
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,140
I felt a bit uncomfortable.

966
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,140
It's my first time rejecting Mr. Hong's call.

967
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,140
There's no need to do that.

968
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,140
In this kind of situation,

969
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,140
a quick decision is the answer.

970
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:41,140
Wasn't Secretary Na close with Mr. Hong?

971
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,140
Who is that?

972
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,140
Wow.

973
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,140
Why are all friendship and loyalty

974
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,140
a abstract idea?

975
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,140
I'm sure you're not going to believe it.

976
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,140
I'm sure you're not going to believe it.

977
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,140
Why are all friendship and loyalty

978
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,140
a abstract idea?

979
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,140
It's not in the world.

980
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,140
Secretary Na doesn't seem to be in touch

981
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,140
with Mr. Hong at all.

982
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:05,140
He said he'd be on vacation until he said goodbye.

983
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,140
He said he'd be taking his kids to a farm stay.

984
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,140
What about that?

985
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,140
He's not busy these days.

986
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,140
He keeps writing his resume during work hours

987
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,140
and goes to interviews.

988
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:19,140
I don't need all of that.

989
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,140
Tell the management to come out!

990
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,140
Yes!

991
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,140
Tell the management to come out!

992
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,140
What are we going to do?

993
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,140
He's being too much.

994
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,140
If he's the director,

995
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,140
he's going to be fired!

996
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,140
He's the son-in-law of Queen's!

997
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,140
No, you don't know.

998
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,140
He's fired.

999
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,140
At home and at work.

1000
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,140
He's nothing now.

1001
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,140
Anyway,

1002
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,140
I'm here to hear your story.

1003
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,140
You think we didn't tell you?

1004
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,140
You promised to give me five times the market price.

1005
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,140
You can't just sell it

1006
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,140
and get double the price

1007
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,140
for a resort or a house.

1008
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,140
I think we have a double contract.

1009
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,140
If you give me the contract...

1010
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,140
What contract?

1011
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,140
You can't answer the phone.

1012
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,140
You can't answer the phone.

1013
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,140
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

1014
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,140
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

1015
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,140
Oh, my!

1016
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,140
What are you doing here?

1017
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,140
You must be working on weekends too.

1018
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,140
I don't sleep on weekends.

1019
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,140
After work in the morning,

1020
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,140
you can have a cold makgeolli and green onion pancake.

1021
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,140
You'll be so jealous.

1022
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,140
Yes.

1023
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:16,140
You live like a human being.

1024
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,140
I envy you.

1025
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:26,140
People laugh when you say you envy me.

1026
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:30,140
Have you tried makgeolli before?

1027
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,140
I have.

1028
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,140
I was curious when I was in college 30 years ago.

1029
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,140
Then try it again when you're in this situation.

1030
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,140
Thank you.

1031
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,140
Here.

1032
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,140
Then...

1033
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,140
I should be drinking.

1034
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,140
What should I say?

1035
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:54,140
Well,

1036
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,140
health is the best.

1037
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,140
I know.

1038
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,140
The chairman, who is the father of my son,

1039
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,140
is sick.

1040
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,140
I'm sorry.

1041
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:08,140
I'm sorry.

1042
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,140
The chairman, who is the father of my son,

1043
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,140
is sick.

1044
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,140
Then...

1045
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,140
Nice to meet you.

1046
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,140
But the situation is...

1047
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:24,140
It's not good to be so clear.

1048
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:27,140
Let's just drink.

1049
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,140
But...

1050
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,140
Oh, my.

1051
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,140
Oh, my.

1052
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,140
Are you okay?

1053
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,140
Yes.

1054
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,140
One more glass.

1055
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,140
What more?

1056
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,140
You should go home.

1057
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,140
No, I'm not going home.

1058
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,140
Is it that uncomfortable?

1059
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:58,140
It's not like you've lived here...

1060
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,140
No, I'm not going home.

1061
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,140
I'm not going home.

1062
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,140
Are you sure?

1063
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,140
I'm sure you're not going home.

1064
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,140
But it's not like you've lived here...

1065
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:11,140
No, no, it's not like that.

1066
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:16,140
I'm the head of the family.

1067
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:20,140
I should be able to tell my family.

1068
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:25,140
They'll be okay and happy.

1069
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,140
I'm going to my house in Seoul tomorrow.

1070
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:31,140
But I can't say that.

1071
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,140
I'm sorry to see my family.

1072
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,140
I'm sure you're going home.

1073
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,140
Oh, my.

1074
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:45,140
I actually called my best friend.

1075
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,140
I've never said this before.

1076
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,140
I don't have money in my pocket.

1077
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:53,140
Please send me 20 million instead of 10 million.

1078
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,140
What about the money?

1079
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,140
I can't.

1080
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,140
There will be a prosecutor's investigation.

1081
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,140
The reporters are looking for us.

1082
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:01,140
I heard you don't think

1083
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:04,140
it's right to put money in your pocket.

1084
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:07,140
I was dumbfounded.

1085
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,140
If your best friend did that,

1086
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,140
you must be dumbfounded.

1087
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:14,140
No, not my friend.

1088
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:18,140
I don't have 20 million in my pocket.

1089
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:22,140
The tax bill I signed a few days ago was 45.6 billion.

1090
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:26,140
I'm so pathetic that I don't have 20 million

1091
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:29,140
in my pocket.

1092
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,140
Excuse me.

1093
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:40,140
I don't know if I can comfort you,

1094
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:46,140
but I don't have any money in my pocket.

1095
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:50,140
You're lying to comfort me, aren't you?

1096
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:52,140
I really don't have any money.

1097
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,140
I've never had any.

1098
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,140
Okay.

1099
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,140
I'll call you back.

1100
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,140
Director.

1101
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,140
Hi.

1102
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,140
I heard everything.

1103
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:11,140
You're in a difficult situation.

1104
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,140
It's nothing.

1105
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,140
That's good.

1106
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:16,140
I heard it's a secret that you're here.

1107
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,140
Don't worry.

1108
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:19,140
At least, we won't tell anyone.

1109
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,140
We won't?

1110
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:24,140
I'll get Yongdori's computer room.

1111
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:27,140
I'm holding onto this place tight.

1112
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,140
Okay.

1113
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:35,140
I look forward to your kind cooperation.

1114
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,140
Oh, my.

1115
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,140
You're awake.

1116
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,140
Geumhui.

1117
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,140
Geumhui, are you okay?

1118
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,140
Here.

1119
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,140
Have some water.

1120
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:10,140
Shouldn't you go to the hospital first?

1121
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,140
I'm fine.

1122
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,140
I'm fine.

1123
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,140
I'm fine.

1124
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,140
I'm fine.

1125
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,140
I'm fine.

1126
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:18,140
I'm fine.

1127
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,140
I'm fine.

1128
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,140
I'm fine.

1129
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:21,140
I'm fine.

1130
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,140
I'm fine.

1131
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,140
I'm fine.

1132
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:24,140
I'm fine.

1133
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,140
I didn't sleep well last night, so I'm dizzy.

1134
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:28,140
Are you taking your meds?

1135
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,140
What meds?

1136
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:30,140
Are you taking something?

1137
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,140
Just an anemia medicine.

1138
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,140
Anemia?

1139
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,140
I didn't hear that when I was testing it.

1140
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,140
How much is anemia?

1141
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,140
Don't be so overreacting.

1142
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,140
I have anemia too.

1143
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,140
I couldn't sleep last night, so I have an anemia.

1144
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:47,140
Geumhui, are you doing this because you're fine?

1145
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,140
It's all the same.

1146
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,140
Geumhui, I'm fine.

1147
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,140
But you're saying that you have a problem

1148
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,140
with losing your mind.

1149
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,140
You should go to a big hospital tomorrow

1150
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,140
instead of following me to Seoul.

1151
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,140
Okay, I will.

1152
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,140
Why? I'm tired.

1153
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,140
Why are you being like this to Hyein?

1154
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,140
What about me?

1155
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,140
She said she was sick.

1156
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,140
She fainted.

1157
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,140
You shouldn't be like this to the neighbor.

1158
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,140
You should take care of your mother-in-law.

1159
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,140
I mean, your mother-in-law takes good care of her.

1160
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,140
Didn't you see her?

1161
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,140
She was so quiet when she was listening.

1162
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,140
Did you see Hyein answer to me so politely?

1163
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:33,140
Geumhui, do you think you know everything about Hyein?

1164
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:35,140
No. How would I know everything?

1165
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,140
I don't know. I don't need to know everything.

1166
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,140
Geumhui, why?

1167
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,140
Oh, my gosh.

1168
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,140
Geumhui!

1169
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,140
What's wrong with you? Stop calling me.

1170
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,140
Hyein...

1171
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:54,140
What about Hyein?

1172
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,140
Please listen to me.

1173
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,140
Don't regret it later.

1174
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:05,140
Be nice to Hyein. Please.

1175
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:08,140
What's there to regret?

1176
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,140
I don't regret anything from the start.

1177
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,140
I'm sorry.

1178
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,140
Oh, my goodness.

1179
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,140
What's wrong with her?

1180
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:50,140
Why don't I have a ex-husband like that?

1181
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,140
I talked to the professor.

1182
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:06,140
I made a medical appointment every day.

1183
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:07,140
Sit down.

1184
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,140
What are you doing?

1185
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,140
Huh?

1186
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:20,140
Well, you're just coming in one day.

1187
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,140
Secretary Na?

1188
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,140
Let's have a meeting in the office.

1189
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,140
Okay.

1190
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:52,140
I think you're meeting the protesters who are protesting.

1191
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,140
Okay, I got it.

1192
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,140
Call me again.

1193
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:57,140
Were you talking to Secretary Na?

1194
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:04,140
Tell me how much you found out about me.

1195
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,140
I'm sorry.

1196
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,140
I'm sorry.

1197
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,140
What is it?

1198
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,140
Tell me.

1199
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,140
It's a typical real estate investment.

1200
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:17,140
They put a businessman in the middle and collect the land owners

1201
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:21,140
to buy five times the market price and contract the company at one-third of the price.

1202
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,140
It's a double contract?

1203
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,140
Then it's an intentional investment.

1204
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,140
I have to prove that.

1205
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:27,140
What about the businessman?

1206
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,140
You said there was a middleman.

1207
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,140
Is he in Korea?

1208
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,140
Isn't he already abroad?

1209
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:40,140
I did leave the office and disappear,

1210
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:44,140
but he got married this weekend.

1211
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:47,140
I thought he was going to go abroad as soon as he turned 17.

1212
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,140
But he can't go.

1213
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,140
He persuaded the land owners and sued them.

1214
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:54,140
And he was suspended today.

1215
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,140
Okay.

1216
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,140
Then it'll be easier if we get him.

1217
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,140
Okay.

1218
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:02,140
But I don't think he's going to go abroad.

1219
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,140
I'm sure he's going to go abroad.

1220
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,140
I'm sure it'll be easier if we get him.

1221
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,140
Okay.

1222
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:10,140
But you don't have to worry about this.

1223
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:13,140
No, why should I?

1224
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:16,140
Look at me.

1225
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,140
I'm a husband-to-be.

1226
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,140
The house is ruined.

1227
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,140
It's not a normal house.

1228
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,140
I sat on the street.

1229
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,140
My grandfather is in a coma.

1230
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,140
My sister went out of her mind.

1231
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:29,140
The worst is that I'm at my ex-husband's hometown.

1232
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,140
That's...

1233
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,140
That's the worst...

1234
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:37,140
But that's mine now, so I have to do something.

1235
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:41,140
I came alone to do something about the high blood pressure index today.

1236
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:44,140
Oh, that's good.

1237
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:50,140
Yeah, if you do something like that, you'll be able to be good one day.

1238
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:54,140
So you can leave without worrying about me.

1239
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:59,140
Then we'll live without seeing each other like a divorced couple.

1240
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:01,140
That's my goal.

1241
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:11,140
To break up with you.

1242
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,140
I'll share whatever it is in the future.

1243
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:21,140
Let's do everything together as far as your health is concerned.

1244
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:26,140
I'll have to achieve your goal as soon as possible.

1245
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:36,140
Yeah.

1246
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:06,140
I'm sorry.

1247
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:36,140
I'm sorry.

1248
01:11:56,140 --> 01:12:06,140
I'll park and go up.

1249
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:36,140
I'm sorry.

1250
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:06,140
I'm sorry.

1251
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:20,140
Mr. Jang, what's your name?

1252
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:23,140
I didn't know the hospital's name.

1253
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,140
I'm glad to see you.

1254
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:37,080
You used to have this kind of

1255
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:47,080
I'm going to the clinic right now.

1256
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,080
I got a call from the professor.

1257
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:58,080
Yoon Eun-seo came to the clinic.

1258
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:08,080
I don't know.

1259
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,080
I don't know what you're doing with your family and guardian.

1260
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,080
I have nothing to say to you.

1261
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,080
Really?

1262
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,080
Oh, my.

1263
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,080
You don't like it, do you?

1264
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:28,080
Please sit down.

1265
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,080
You know what?

1266
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,080
Yes.

1267
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,080
I borrowed a handkerchief from a grandmother.

1268
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:39,080
What grandmother?

1269
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,080
So I had a son.

1270
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,080
Oh, your name?

1271
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,080
I don't know the name.

1272
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,080
Howden is very fine.

1273
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,080
He looks a little like Jang Gukyeong.

1274
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,080
Is there such a person in our neighborhood?

1275
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,080
No, that person.

1276
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,080
Why?

1277
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,080
Because he has a great voice.

1278
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,080
That little...

1279
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,080
I'm sorry.

1280
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,080
I'm sorry.

1281
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,080
I'm sorry.

1282
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,080
I'm sorry.

1283
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,080
I'm sorry.

1284
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,080
I'm sorry.

1285
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,080
I'm sorry.

1286
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:11,080
That little voice.

1287
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:17,080
The person with the voice of Jang Gukyeong is in our neighborhood.

1288
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:22,080
If you didn't see a ghost, there's no such person in our neighborhood.

1289
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,080
It's not.

1290
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:32,080
You look alike.

1291
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,080
Oh, my.

1292
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:39,080
Oh, right.

1293
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,080
Father-in-law.

1294
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,080
Yes.

1295
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,080
Let's eat.

1296
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,080
Come here.

1297
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,080
You guys are just right.

1298
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,080
It's dinner time, so let's eat.

1299
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,080
What's for dinner?

1300
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,080
I made steamed ribs.

1301
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,080
Steamed ribs?

1302
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,080
I know.

1303
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,080
I'm going to the police.

1304
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,080
Mom, put the rice in.

1305
01:15:54,080 --> 01:16:19,080
I'm going to the police.

1306
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:22,080
Grace went to see you, right?

1307
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,080
Did you organize it well?

1308
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,080
Yes, I did.

1309
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,080
Good.

1310
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,080
You have to aim for what you want.

1311
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,080
You don't even know the subject.

1312
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,080
I'm going to be the representative of the department store.

1313
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,080
Give me back the report.

1314
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:38,080
No, that's Hyein's.

1315
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,080
What are you talking about?

1316
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,080
Hyein will come back.

1317
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:46,080
I'm going to get rid of it by then.

1318
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,080
Our chairman won't die easily.

1319
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,080
I'll do my best to cure him.

1320
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,080
I'll do my best to keep him alive.

1321
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,080
I'll do my best to keep him alive.

1322
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,080
I have the power to move 21% of the shares

1323
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,080
that the chairman is in this state.

1324
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,080
Do you understand?

1325
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,080
I'm sorry.

1326
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,080
I'm sorry.

1327
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,080
I'm sorry.

1328
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,080
I'm sorry.

1329
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,080
I'm sorry.

1330
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,080
I'm sorry.

1331
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,080
I'm sorry.

1332
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,080
I'm sorry.

1333
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,080
I'm sorry.

1334
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,080
I'm sorry.

1335
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,080
I'm sorry.

1336
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,080
I'm sorry.

1337
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,080
I'm sorry.

1338
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,080
I'm sorry.

1339
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,080
I'm sorry.

1340
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,080
I'm sorry.

1341
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,080
I'm sorry.

1342
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,080
I'm sorry.

1343
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,080
I'm sorry.

1344
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,080
I'm sorry.

1345
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,080
I'm sorry.

1346
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,080
I'm sorry.

1347
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,080
I'm sorry.

1348
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,080
I'm sorry.

1349
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,080
I'm sorry.

1350
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,080
I'm sorry.

1351
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,080
I'm sorry.

1352
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,080
I'm sorry.

1353
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,080
I'm sorry.

1354
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,080
What are you doing?

1355
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,080
I told you.

1356
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,080
I have different goals from my mother.

1357
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,080
Where did you move the chairman?

1358
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,080
You can't do that now.

1359
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,080
You can't kill Jangji.

1360
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,080
I can't help it.

1361
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:11,860
My的,

1362
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:21,560
RIght now.

1363
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:25,800
Right now.

1364
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:35,800
Let's go.

1365
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:05,800
Let's go.

1366
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:30,800
Where are you going after dinner?

1367
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,800
I'm just going to walk in front of this.

1368
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,800
Huh?

1369
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,800
I think Hyunwoo is coming soon.

1370
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
Yeah, you think so?

1371
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:48,800
Yeah, I'll wait a little bit.

1372
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,800
I think we can eat together.

1373
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,800
Let's go, then.

1374
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,800
Don't go far away.

1375
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:06,800
Yes.

1376
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:28,800
Let's go.

1377
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:58,800
Let's go.

1378
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:28,800
What is it?

1379
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:58,800
What is it?

1380
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,800
Are you Hyun Sungwook?

1381
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,800
I've been looking for you.

1382
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:24,800
Oh, yes.

1383
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,800
I should have been in Boracay by now after the wedding.

1384
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,800
I'm a little tired because of someone.

1385
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,800
Did you get my text?

1386
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:39,800
I replied, but I can't be drunk.

1387
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:49,800
Let's get a judge.

1388
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:19,800
I'm sorry.

1389
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:45,800
I mean, I mean, it's been a while, but you're still keeping this.

1390
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,800
Isn't that how strong the impact that the woman gave you was?

1391
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:54,800
I guess it was really pretty.

1392
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,800
What impact?

1393
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:07,800
I don't remember if the owner was a woman or a man, a teacher, a student, or a security guard.

1394
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,800
I don't remember anything.

1395
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,800
I almost got in trouble.

1396
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,800
As expected, the person who was the CEO of the company is very different.

1397
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,800
How can you hit that in one shot?

1398
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,800
You knew right away as soon as you saw the MP3.

1399
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,800
This is a woman.

1400
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,800
I was so close.

1401
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,800
I almost got caught.

1402
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:33,800
Hey, didn't you say you were like a prince looking for Cinderella with the MP3 in high school?

1403
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,800
I did.

1404
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:44,800
It was really pretty.

1405
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,800
Do you remember?

1406
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,800
It's unique.

1407
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,800
It was my ideal type.

1408
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,800
Do you recognize me when you look again?

1409
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,800
I'll recognize you right away.

1410
01:24:51,800 --> 01:25:00,800
I don't have anything to say to you now, but maybe you were destined to that woman.

1411
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:10,800
What am I doing somewhere?

1412
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,800
What kind of a game is Baek Hyun-woo playing?

1413
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,800
I'm going to kill you.

1414
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,800
I think I would have done that if I knew.

1415
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,800
Now you know.

1416
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,800
I'm a bad guy who knows everything when I want to.

1417
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,800
It's a bad experience to live with money.

1418
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,800
You said you'd kill me.

1419
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,800
Isn't that your class?

1420
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,800
Is she going to come out of there?

1421
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,800
Are you saying we should live in the same house?

1422
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,800
Oh, my.

1423
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,800
She's jealous right now.

1424
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,800
I'm jealous.

1425
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,800
I'm jealous.

1426
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:54,800
I'm jealous.

1427
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,800
I'm jealous.

1428
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,800
I'm jealous.

1429
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,800
I'm jealous.

1430
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:58,800
I'm jealous.

1431
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:59,800
Oh, my.

1432
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,800
She's jealous right now.

1433
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:02,800
I don't know.

1434
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,800
I think I'm just picking it up.

1435
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,800
It's my job to find out that.

1436
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,800
It's something you have to go.

1437
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,800
I'm holding it in a lot.

1438
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:21,800
Dream on and get out of here.

1439
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,800
I'm going to kill you.

1440
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,800
I'm going to kill you.

1441
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,800
I'm going to kill you.

1442
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:32,800
I'm going to kill you.

1443
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,800
I'm going to kill you.

1444
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,800
I'm going to kill you.

1445
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:35,800
I'm going to kill you.

1446
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,800
I'm going to kill you.

1447
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,800
I'm going to kill you.

1448
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:38,800
I'm going to kill you.

1449
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,800
I'm going to kill you.

1450
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,800
I'm going to kill you.

1451
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:41,800
I'm going to kill you.

1452
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,800
I'm going to kill you.

1453
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,800
I'm going to kill you.

1454
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:44,800
I'm going to kill you.

1455
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,800
I'm going to kill you.

1456
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:46,800
I'm going to kill you.

1457
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,800
I'm going to kill you.

1458
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,800
I'm going to kill you.

1459
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:49,800
I'm going to kill you.

1460
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:50,800
I'm going to kill you.

1461
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:51,800
I'm going to kill you.

1462
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,800
I'm going to kill you.

1463
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,800
I'm going to kill you.

1464
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,800
I'm going to kill you.

1465
