1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,402
EPISODE 1

3
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,053
Everyone said
it was the wedding of the century.

4
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,889
The heiress to Korea's
most powerful conglomerate

5
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,557
married a new recruit.

6
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,359
It's been three years already,

7
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,487
but it seems like only yesterday.

8
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,866
People ask me how it feels
to become a part

9
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,035
of a conglomerate

10
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,745
and live with a queen.

11
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,039
I'm not sure.

12
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,208
Would you believe me if I said this?

13
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,417
I'm just

14
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,795
a lucky man

15
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,088
who married

16
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,632
the love of my life.

17
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,261
I know that people gossiped about

18
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,679
how Baek Hyun-woo married me

19
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,888
solely because of my family

20
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,058
and our wealth.

21
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,650
Those rumors only began
because I chose not to reveal my face

22
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,026
for various reasons.

23
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,281
I guess this will put an end
to those rumors

24
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,450
since I'm finally revealing my face.

25
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,836
Our married life

26
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,338
is nothing out of the ordinary.

27
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,178
I wake up next to her.

28
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,140
We have breakfast together.

29
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,643
We go to work together as well.

30
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,481
How does it feel

31
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,358
to be together all day and night?

32
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,032
It makes me happy.

33
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,117
I'm sure some of you already know.

34
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,078
After returning from my studies abroad
five years ago,

35
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,873
I joined Queens Department Store,
which my father owned at the time,

36
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,833
as an intern.

37
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,252
You could say I was working undercover.

38
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,062
Women know these things.

39
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,688
"I see."

40
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,275
"This guy likes me."

41
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,611
"That's why he's flirting with me."

42
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,446
No.

43
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,739
That wasn't the case.

44
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,534
She kept kicking the photocopier.

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,708
-So I was worried.
-What's wrong?

46
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,834
About the photocopier.

47
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,712
What's wrong?

48
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,967
But after helping her a few times,

49
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,177
I started worrying about her.

50
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,681
When sending a fax…

51
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,142
At the time, people were gossiping
about how obnoxious

52
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,894
the new intern was.

53
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,313
So I was sure she'd get fired soon.

54
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,698
You need to stop, Ms. Hong.

55
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,574
I've done my fair share of part-time jobs.

56
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,451
You're going to get yourself fired.

57
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,704
I don't care.

58
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,247
Right. You'll just find another job.

59
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,082
But…

60
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,668
you'll get fired there too.
Do you want to bet on it?

61
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,336
You know what?

62
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,090
My heart jumps every time
your superior scolds you.

63
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,968
You get scolded every single day.

64
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,684
Why does it jump?

65
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,362
-What?
-Why does your heart jump

66
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,448
when I'm the one who's getting scolded?

67
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,449
Why?

68
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,874
Take your time

69
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,042
and think about that.

70
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,229
You can come right now.

71
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,817
Don't you have an umbrella?

72
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,863
No, I don't but…

73
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,324
Take mine.

74
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,538
You always need help, and…

75
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,917
it bothers me.

76
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,044
What is this?

77
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,839
I made your heart jump,
and now I bother you?

78
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,391
Ms. Hong.

79
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,769
Listen carefully.

80
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,732
I didn't tell you this
in case it'd make you feel uncomfortable.

81
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,818
But you know,

82
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,862
I went to Seoul National University.

83
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,198
And law school at that.

84
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,452
My parents live down south,

85
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,871
but the community respects our family.

86
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,541
For example, we own over 30 cows.

87
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,669
Another calf was born
a couple of days ago,

88
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,338
so we have almost 35 now.

89
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,673
As for my studio apartment,

90
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,882
I signed a two-year lease

91
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,426
instead of paying monthly rent.

92
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,971
It just means
I have a good chunk of money on the side.

93
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,140
What are you getting at?

94
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,684
Even if

95
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,437
you get fired and can't find a new job,

96
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,897
I can take care of you.

97
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,524
That's what I mean.

98
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,446
I'll be honest.
I've always wanted my future wife to work.

99
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,655
But if it's you,

100
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,450
I can try being the sole breadwinner.

101
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,912
I mean, don't feel pressured.

102
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,248
It's just that

103
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,042
I like you.

104
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,338
So…

105
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,093
what do you say?

106
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,316
You don't have to answer me today.

107
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,737
Don't get wet.

108
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,242
-I--
-I'm okay.

109
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,119
Take it.

110
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,079
-Mr. Baek--
-I'm really okay.

111
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,623
But I--

112
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,675
I have…

113
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,844
a driver.

114
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,830
Hilarious, right?

115
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,672
It really is.

116
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,257
Anyway,

117
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,801
he's been a romantic ever since.

118
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,971
That's how our love story began.

119
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,558
But he was shocked
after finding out who my family was.

120
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,268
He handed in his resignation letter

121
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,103
and ghosted me.

122
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,063
So…

123
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,485
Baek Hyun-woo, come out.

124
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,082
Are you going to leave me standing here?

125
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,442
She looked like an angel sent from heaven.

126
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,782
-That's how she looked back then.
-But not anymore?

127
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,994
Of course, she's still an angel.

128
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,789
I told you many times

129
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,956
that…

130
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,083
I'm happy.

131
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,417
Well…

132
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,710
She and I

133
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,755
have a happy married life.

134
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,050
We're still very much in love.

135
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,555
Baek Hyun-woo is getting a divorce.

136
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,182
Seriously?

137
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,810
-It's a secret.
-Of course. We're colleagues after all.

138
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,063
Anyway, he'd like one of us
to represent him.

139
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,898
Yes, of course.

140
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,275
You're the number-one divorce attorney
in this country.

141
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,485
You should do it, Yang-gi.

142
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,694
I'd…

143
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,446
love to help him. Really.

144
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,782
But I'm already juggling so many cases.

145
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,242
All right then.

146
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,412
Attorney Choi Cheol-seung
boasts a 90% win rate.

147
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,332
Can you help him?

148
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,084
I'll secretly help you out.

149
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,503
Why secretly? Do it openly.

150
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,213
Afraid of getting on Queens' bad side

151
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,674
and losing your job, you sly scumbag?

152
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,343
That's right.

153
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,095
You're right. That's why.

154
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,638
I'd be crazy to take that job.

155
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,015
Hyun-woo's aunt-in-law
got divorced three times.

156
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,977
You all know the fates
of her ex-husbands' attorneys.

157
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,645
They were all fired.

158
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:13,232
Hyun-woo made a mistake.
Why would he put us in a pickle like this?

159
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,317
-Exactly.
-Let's be honest.

160
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,529
He was the smartest one out of us.
Always the top of our classes.

161
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,613
So why can't he just be

162
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,115
-his own divorce attorney?
-Right.

163
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,200
-That'd be better.
-I bet he'll excel.

164
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,327
By the way, why does he want a divorce?

165
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:30,291
Exactly. He's living the dream life
of all Korean men.

166
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,918
His wife is Hong Hae-in,
the heiress of Queens Group.

167
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,295
So why?

168
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,340
She's a lunatic.

169
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,342
A lunatic?

170
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,396
Right. About that
One Trillion Club group chat…

171
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,732
Yes. Why haven't they invited me?

172
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,776
Our sales are only at 880 billion won so--

173
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,195
That's not a big gap.

174
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,405
-We're only about 100 billion won short.
-I know.

175
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,574
I asked them to just round it up

176
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,202
and be more flexible.

177
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,536
But it was still a hard no.

178
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,954
Why are they so fussy?

179
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,122
By the way, I heard

180
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,833
that Royal Department Store
is bragging about how their CEO

181
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,878
will join the One Trillion Club
by the end of the year.

182
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,380
They're also boasting
that they're going to set up Hercyna

183
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,216
on the first floor next to the fountain.

184
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,425
They must be insane.

185
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,469
Tell me about it.
Department stores in Korea

186
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,514
are divided into those that have Hercyna
and those that don't.

187
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,475
And Hercyna only wants to work
with those who are in that club.

188
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,646
It's about time

189
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,023
we cut off all the brands

190
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,734
that hinder our sales.

191
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,404
This is our periodical evaluation chart.

192
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,322
At the bottom,

193
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,575
we have a list of brands
in the bottom 20% of sales.

194
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,285
How many of them can we shut down?

195
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,622
Those underlined in red
were in the bottom 20%

196
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,748
at least twice.

197
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,501
In principle, they should be shut down.
However…

198
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,797
"However"?

199
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,716
Why is there a "however"?

200
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,429
We should shut them down if we can.

201
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,682
We did ask our Legal Team for advice.

202
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,267
And they said no.

203
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,314
Who said that?

204
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,400
Director Baek Hyun-woo.

205
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,577
Mr. Yu, please wrap up
the contract after confirming

206
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,661
the commission fee.

207
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,037
Yes, sir. Also…

208
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,540
The second-floor manager
submitted a report.

209
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,084
One of our customers fell
and injured herself

210
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,878
while walking in 12 cm heels.

211
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,589
Sir, the CEO would like to see you.

212
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,466
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

213
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,551
Well…

214
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,804
She wants to see you immediately.
She's very upset.

215
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,004
Mr. Baek.

216
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,091
Why can't we shut down brands
that aren't profitable?

217
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:31,180
Many of the brands
invested 500 million in equipment.

218
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,265
We can't just kick them out.

219
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,516
File an eviction suit then.

220
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,101
It's impossible to win.

221
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,104
The law has been revised many times
to prevent large distributors

222
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,522
from abusing their power.

223
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,651
Are you saying

224
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,904
that I'm on a power trip?

225
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,572
Is that it?

226
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,867
-That's not what I--
-Is this a nonprofit organization?

227
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,494
Are we volunteers?

228
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,121
Is it right to let them be
when we're not getting

229
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,749
our money's worth
for those expensive spots?

230
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,087
The sales division
has deliberately excluded

231
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,672
brands with low performance scores

232
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,841
from customer-invitation events
and discounts to hinder additional sales.

233
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:12,221
Those brands could complain
to the media or sue us.

234
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,639
Then we'd really be in trouble.

235
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,600
I believe a more favorable solution
would be to help

236
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,685
improve their sales.

237
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,189
Mr. Baek.

238
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,233
Did I ask for your advice?

239
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,487
I am telling you to shut them down.

240
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,033
If they don't listen,
file a lawsuit and win.

241
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,494
I believe that's your team's job.

242
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
Yes, ma'am.

243
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,422
This meeting's over.

244
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,781
Are you eager to let others know
that we don't get along?

245
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,825
Our relationship
has nothing to do with this.

246
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:15,784
I see.

247
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,539
Is that why you warned the store manager
that I wanted to fire

248
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,834
about the violations beforehand
to help him stay afloat?

249
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,628
That manager has been with us
since the beginning.

250
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,338
And he's still just as hardworking.

251
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:33,093
Fine. You're awfully kind
and caring to others.

252
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,637
Do you want to be a hero or something?

253
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,266
Quit playing the martyr
and treat those close to you better.

254
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,893
Those close to me?

255
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:43,979
As in you?

256
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,690
What?

257
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,775
Do you really think

258
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,610
we're close?

259
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,907
I need to talk to you.

260
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,242
Come to the lounge in an hour.

261
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,786
Fine.

262
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,169
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

263
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,474
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY?
I'M HERE.

264
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,101
WHERE ARE YOU?
FORGET IT. I'M LEAVING.

265
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,185
Come to the family room.

266
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,024
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

267
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,205
What took you so long?

268
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,749
I texted him late.

269
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,084
You don't need to remind him.

270
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,044
He knows we have a family meeting.

271
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,338
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,549
What kind of interview was it?

273
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,343
It was the culture section
of Hanyang Economic Daily.

274
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,180
It's a heartwarming interview
where CEOs and politicians

275
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,890
show their houses and families.

276
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,641
They were both interviewed.

277
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,811
Why show the house?
They're not celebrities.

278
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,273
We had to do something about the tabloids.

279
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,942
I agree. People gossiped about
how they were separated last year.

280
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,945
It's all because
they see you arguing at work.

281
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,989
-You argued?
-Yes, today.

282
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,240
It wasn't a simple argument.

283
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,826
It was quite uncomfortable
for those in the meeting room.

284
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,168
Right, Hyun-woo.
About the Fair Trade Commission…

285
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,086
They keep calling us in
for trivial matters.

286
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,296
Could you take care of that?

287
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,381
You should ask
the Legal Team of Queens Mart.

288
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,716
They're just too dense.

289
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,761
But you're quick-thinking and smart.

290
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,263
And the higher-ups
at the Fair Trade Commission love you.

291
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,933
We have our own jurisdictions--

292
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,935
Why can't you just say you'll do it?

293
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,234
And you two.

294
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,443
I want you to have a baby.

295
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,029
People need to stop gossiping.

296
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,530
Have you contacted Dr. Joo?

297
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,074
Yes, I booked an appointment.

298
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,742
She'll get the prenatal checkup,

299
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,744
then begin the procedure right away.

300
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,537
As for Hyun-woo, after the baby is born,

301
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,956
you'll go to Boston

302
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,083
within the next two years to get an MBA.

303
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,834
I told you this already.

304
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,711
I'm not interested in getting a degree.

305
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,879
And I also said

306
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,631
that it wasn't up to you.

307
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,468
They don't owe us a grandkid,
so stop pressuring him.

308
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,804
Drink your tea, Hyun-woo.

309
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,849
But you see,

310
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,520
I'd prefer to meet Su-bin in May.

311
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,528
Who is Su-bin?

312
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,738
Who do you think?
It's my future granddaughter.

313
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,366
Her name means "remarkably shining."

314
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,369
Not bad, right? Hong Su-bin.

315
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,079
I see.

316
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:30,998
Will she be Hong Su-bin

317
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,166
instead of Baek Su-bin?

318
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,334
What's wrong?

319
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,879
Do you not want her
to have her mom's surname?

320
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,048
We don't need
to follow the patriarchal system.

321
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,385
I think it's quite old-fashioned
to use the father's surname.

322
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,724
But when I asked you about giving
Geon-u his mom's surname,

323
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,767
you said it was nonsense.

324
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,688
This is different.

325
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,940
Isn't it the same? No?

326
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,215
We need to talk.

327
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,308
We're having a baby
despite everything that's going on?

328
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,851
And I'll be going abroad alone?

329
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,227
What's the matter?

330
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,438
Isn't that a good thing?

331
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,984
Don't tell me you want me to come.

332
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,235
Of course not.

333
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,863
Exactly.

334
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,656
Then do your part and go abroad.

335
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,201
We'll have others raise our baby anyway.

336
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,994
It's convenient and nice.
What's the issue?

337
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,079
"Nice"?

338
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,122
Are you happy about this?

339
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,207
Seriously?

340
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,878
Do you really want a baby?

341
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,463
If it's needed.

342
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,596
Yes?

343
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,350
Did you tell them I'd like to sign off
before they publish the article?

344
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,644
Of course.

345
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,728
Also…

346
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,648
Tell them to introduce
Director Baek properly.

347
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,109
Don't forget to mention
that he studied law at SNU.

348
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,864
What?

349
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:31,243
Stop doing these interviews.
I'm done with them.

350
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,410
Do them alone if you must.

351
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,788
How can I
when they're about married couples?

352
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,249
You can tell them all about me.

353
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,876
Tell them how we're so in love

354
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,628
and happily married.

355
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,046
Tell them everything.

356
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,132
It's all a lie anyway.

357
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,148
Hey.

358
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,774
I want the photos first.

359
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,443
I'll pick the one they'll use.

360
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,503
Why do they publish useless articles?

361
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,671
Why didn't they mention

362
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,007
how I anonymously donated 200 million won?

363
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,217
Look.

364
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,594
I know I did it anonymously

365
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,264
because I didn't want anyone to know,
but everyone should know.

366
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,892
Isn't that what the PR Team is for?

367
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,268
I'm so frustrated.

368
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,402
What was that for?

369
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,072
What?

370
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,324
What do you want?

371
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,450
What is it?

372
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,328
Tell me from there.

373
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,246
Use your words.

374
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,331
Gosh.

375
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,626
Gosh.

376
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,212
-Soo-cheol.
-What?

377
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,213
Don't avoid me.

378
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,006
Or you'll get

379
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,133
a black eye and start bawling again.

380
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,011
Wait--

381
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,181
Are you crazy?

382
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,933
Why are you hitting me?

383
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,810
Is Hyun-woo your friend
or someone younger than you?

384
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,020
"Quick-thinking"?

385
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,897
How dare you?

386
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,280
Disrespect my husband again,

387
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,323
and I'll kill you.

388
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,118
-Answer me.
-Fine. I get it.

389
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,041
That crazy witch.

390
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:46,002
Why get mad at me
when she bullies Hyun-woo all the time?

391
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,421
She's seriously a psychopath!

392
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,218
I wasn't talking about you.

393
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,403
Everyone wants you
to reconsider this divorce

394
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,363
and just live with her.

395
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,408
They wanted me to tell you that.
Are you crying?

396
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,537
What? Are you already drunk?

397
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,001
What is this?
You're making my heart flutter.

398
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,127
Am I?

399
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,796
Apparently, I'm cute when I'm drunk.

400
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,965
-She said that was my special move.
-Who said?

401
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,676
Hae-in said that.

402
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,469
She said

403
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,180
I was cute.

404
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,515
Are you bragging?

405
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,143
Why was I like that?

406
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,561
Why was I cute?

407
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,981
Why did I use my special move
and look cute?

408
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,191
Why did I make her heart flutter?

409
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,318
And as a result,

410
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,320
I ruined

411
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,155
my own life.

412
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,034
We wouldn't have gotten married
had I not been so cute.

413
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,163
This lunatic is totally wasted.

414
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,497
Hey, get up.

415
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,792
My wife has been calling me,
asking me to buy diapers for our baby.

416
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,545
No, I'm not going home.

417
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,630
Why would I?

418
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,757
Why won't you go home?

419
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,799
I'm drunk!

420
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,635
I'm too cute when I'm drunk!

421
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:23,224
I've always been known as the cute son
of the pear tree house in Yongdu-ri.

422
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,268
It's in my nature.

423
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,520
I was born like this.

424
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,273
What could I have done?

425
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,364
So you're not going home?

426
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,033
Just leave me here.

427
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,911
I'll be taken home safe and sound.

428
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,162
By whom?

429
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,250
They'll prevent all scandals.

430
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,756
No way.

431
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,882
Want to see?

432
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,270
No way.

433
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,439
Every time…

434
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,443
I tear leaves off a branch

435
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,405
to see if I should get a divorce or not…

436
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,864
You did that?

437
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,075
I always end up with a "no."

438
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,828
Every single damn time.

439
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,204
So it's your fate.

440
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,330
There's no one.

441
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,374
No one in this world

442
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,710
is on my side.

443
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,548
There's not a single leaf
that's on my side.

444
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,718
I don't need anyone on my side.
I just want to own a building.

445
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,096
That building will be on my side forever.

446
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,432
My wife's mood is like a roller coaster.

447
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,684
She'd be smiling in the morning
then raging at night.

448
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,437
Is it my fault we're out of diapers?
Why'd she get mad at me?

449
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,188
I just need a building.

450
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,982
Concrete buildings don't change.

451
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,525
They don't nag or get mad.

452
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,526
Go.

453
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,406
Go get your diapers.

454
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,449
Just leave.

455
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,007
Who said

456
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,802
Love

457
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:28,725
Was beautiful?

458
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,776
Just leave already.

459
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,652
You can go home now.

460
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,696
You're gonna keep watching me cry?

461
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,659
I'm just crying on my way home!

462
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,542
Why are you going that way?

463
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,898
Put me to sleep

464
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,404
With your fair hands

465
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,706
LAWYER IDENTIFICATION CARD
BAEK HYUN-WOO

466
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,376
Hey, isn't he the son-in-law of Queens?

467
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,962
Son-in-law, my foot.
He's pretty much a butler.

468
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,839
I heard he cleans up his in-laws' messes.

469
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,758
Where's his self-respect?

470
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,055
He wouldn't have married
into that family if he had any.

471
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,349
He's an embarrassment to all attorneys.

472
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,017
Goodness.

473
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,822
Oh, my.

474
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,740
Hallelujah, Hyun-woo.

475
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,077
So what if I have 25 billion won
in my account?

476
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,079
I can't even use it
to buy dental floss in here.

477
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,289
By the way,
how did you come up with this idea?

478
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,374
Ma'am.

479
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,794
This is actually illegal, you see.

480
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,921
Hyun-woo.

481
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,090
How long must I be locked up?

482
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,758
I didn't commit that big of a sin.

483
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,094
I thought Seul-hee
was the whistleblower who reported me

484
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,221
for embezzlement, so I grabbed her hair.

485
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,639
Is that a crime?

486
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,600
She had to receive treatment
for four weeks.

487
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,645
Damn it.
I should've hospitalized her instead.

488
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,480
She's the reason why my mom passed away.

489
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,567
Just wait and see.
I'll take my revenge on her.

490
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,653
Hyun-woo.

491
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,364
Taking revenge

492
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,532
is my specialty.

493
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,743
I'm fully aware of that, ma'am.

494
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,579
All three of my ex-husbands
have left this country.

495
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,081
I brought hell to all of them
and their relatives.

496
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,168
Ma'am.

497
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,628
Married couples can eventually separate.

498
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,297
So why did you have to go that far?

499
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,049
Hyun-woo.

500
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,343
Divorce is brutal and messy.

501
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,137
There's no "good" bye in divorce.

502
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,098
The best solution
is for one of them to die.

503
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,101
If I marry and divorce again
in the future,

504
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,728
I'll ask you to take my case.

505
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,938
Why are you

506
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,483
already thinking
about getting another divorce?

507
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,567
Whatever.

508
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,652
For some reason,

509
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,822
I think marriage and divorce
go hand in hand

510
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,657
instead of marriage and happiness.

511
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,659
I agree.

512
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,119
What did you say?

513
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,329
Nothing.

514
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,789
Hey. Look here.

515
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,540
I lost a lot of hair, right?

516
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,168
I really need to get out of here.

517
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,878
This place is teeming with bitches.

518
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,756
I'm going to become like them
if I stay here any longer.

519
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,424
My mom's memorial service is coming up.

520
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,551
My dad will settle this before then

521
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,803
for her sake, right?

522
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,472
I'm currently in front of Queens Town

523
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,974
in Hanil-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul
where the memorial service

524
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,018
of Yang Mi-suk,
the Queens' chairman's late wife,

525
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,436
is taking place.

526
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,314
The family members
are arriving one by one.

527
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,775
This year, Hong Beom-seok,
the chairman's eldest son

528
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,610
and former CEO of Queens Distribution,

529
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,155
flew in from Hawaii.

530
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,615
There is a keen interest

531
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:21,410
in whether or not
the chairman and his son will reconcile

532
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,412
after their long-time feud.

533
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,876
Sir, can you take a look at my pancakes?
Do you think the insides are cooked?

534
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,336
Why would you ask me that?

535
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,046
You studied chemistry in Harvard,

536
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,631
so I thought you'd know.

537
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,509
Yes. Judging by the color,

538
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,469
I'm sure they're well-cooked. Flip them.

539
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,346
Yes, sir. I'll do the plating.

540
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,142
Was it you who graduated
from Parsons School of Design?

541
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,685
No, that's me.

542
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,937
His family
have been architects for generations.

543
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,856
His family made the big sculpture

544
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,816
-in front of the Louvre.
-I'll be honest.

545
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,901
I'm pretty confident
about stacking up food.

546
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,282
What a waste of talent.

547
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,702
My dear brothers-in-law.

548
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,538
This is Mr. Choi.
He married Min-hee, our relative.

549
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,664
My brothers-in-law.

550
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,999
Hello.

551
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,417
Hello.

552
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,920
In the past,
powerful families such as royalty

553
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,090
made the male members prepare
everything for memorial services.

554
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,177
The chairman has great interest
in royal traditions,

555
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,596
so we've been doing this
for a few years now.

556
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,639
I see.

557
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,725
Right.

558
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,603
This must be why traditions
and the future go well together.

559
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,355
This isn't old-fashioned.
It's quite progressive and nice.

560
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,191
It fits the current trend.

561
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,985
If it's so progressive, nice, and trendy,

562
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,028
why don't you join us?

563
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,447
You know me.

564
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,407
I've been going to church since last year,

565
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,159
so this is against my religion.

566
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,744
I was born a Christian.

567
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,831
Ever since I was young,

568
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,875
I've had a condition

569
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,212
where I can't smell oil. It's a shame.

570
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,340
Thank you for your hard work.

571
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,008
Good luck.

572
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,637
-Gosh.
-Seriously?

573
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,680
This is the Hong family's
memorial service.

574
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,017
But no one here has that surname.

575
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,269
They should prepare
their own memorial services.

576
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,938
-Jeez.
-I'm the fifth only son

577
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,273
of the Yu family
in Paechon County, 39th generation.

578
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,777
What would my mother say if she saw me
complete this skewer in ten seconds?

579
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,071
Let's not talk about how precious we are

580
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,447
to our families.

581
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,243
Welcome to Queens.

582
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,078
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

583
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,537
But if I were you,

584
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,290
I'd run away right now.

585
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,005
It's not too late
since it's his first memorial service.

586
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,592
How's the color? Does it look too dull?

587
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,845
Jade green isn't an easy color.

588
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,225
I've only seen two people
who looked good in that color.

589
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,768
You

590
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,980
and Yuna Kim at the London Fashion Show.

591
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,317
Oh, her? Yes, she looked really nice.

592
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,069
And so do you, ma'am.

593
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,321
You know how to please others.

594
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,702
Ms. Moh.

595
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,621
Why aren't you wearing
the hanbok that was sent to you?

596
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,750
I shouldn't be at this memorial service.

597
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,460
The family can do it without me.

598
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,589
You've been with us for over 20 years,
so you're family too.

599
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,966
That's what a family is.

600
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,595
That's very kind of you.
But I'll just stay in my room.

601
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,347
People will talk

602
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,392
about how I shove you around
and mistreat you.

603
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,020
"Shove you around"? Who shoves whom?

604
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,196
Do you shove her around?

605
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,657
Me? Shove her?

606
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,993
No, Father. Never.

607
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,494
Then why would you say that?

608
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,789
You only said that
because that's how you think of her.

609
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,958
That's not why.

610
00:38:56,042 --> 00:39:00,379
She didn't want to wear a hanbok.

611
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,506
-Why not?
-I don't know.

612
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,760
Are you not going to?

613
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,304
Of course, I will.

614
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,268
You heard her.

615
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,645
Let's go.

616
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,783
What a crazy…

617
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,535
Gosh, I'm so stressed.

618
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,373
She's a sly one.

619
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:39,877
She's going to brazenly attend
Ms. Yang's memorial service

620
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,505
because the chairman insisted.

621
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,756
That's her plan.

622
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,553
Who knew a girlfriend-in-law
could be worse than a mother-in-law?

623
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,783
Beom-ja is here!

624
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,714
Hyun-woo.

625
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,932
Why did she get discharged today?

626
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,726
You said she'd get sick
if she stayed locked up in this cold.

627
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,186
Right.

628
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,813
I did say that.

629
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,483
Still, you should've waited to let her out
after the memorial service.

630
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,864
What? Look at that good-for-nothing.

631
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,073
Just look at her.

632
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,285
I was thoughtless, sir.

633
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,251
Mom.

634
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,545
I was locked up.

635
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,007
Dad put
his one and only daughter behind bars

636
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,761
just because I grabbed
his girlfriend by the hair and kicked her.

637
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,054
Hey.

638
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,224
It's the truth.

639
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,686
You're head over heels for her.

640
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,481
Not only are you in love with the woman
who killed your wife,

641
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,483
but you sent your daughter to jail.

642
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,027
You're absolutely heartless.

643
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,030
Beom-ja, this is Mom's memorial service.
Let's talk later. Okay?

644
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,782
You're no different.
Have you forgotten who she is?

645
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,618
Mom died because of her!

646
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,161
Mom died of a heart attack--

647
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:41,081
Exactly! Why do you think she had it?

648
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,542
Her heart stopped
because she was enraged at Moh Seul-hee!

649
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:48,422
So how can you stand
looking at her every day and night?

650
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,673
Are you not upset?

651
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,135
-Beom-ja, I--
-Gosh, Mom.

652
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,096
What's the point of having a son?

653
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,474
You didn't even prepare skate,
her favorite food,

654
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,808
so who are you to talk?

655
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,478
Aunt Beom-ja, we have skate.
The house reeks of it.

656
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,314
Get lost, you bastard!

657
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,692
How could you never visit me
when I raised you myself?

658
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,487
You didn't raise him.

659
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,030
Don't be ridiculous.

660
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,406
Aunt Beom-ja.

661
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,408
We were just serving the alcohol.

662
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,326
Really?

663
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,454
We should continue then. Go on.

664
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,886
What's wrong with you?

665
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,137
Come on.

666
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,431
Hey, turn the glass slowly.

667
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,142
She was a lightweight.
You're going to get her drunk!

668
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,269
Beom-ja.

669
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,271
Mom drank like a fish.

670
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:49,024
That's a fact we both know to be true.

671
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,860
Why do you think she drank so much?

672
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,238
Because that woman stressed her out!

673
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,282
Uncle.

674
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,702
Doesn't it break your heart to know
that your sister passed away

675
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,204
because she was outraged by that woman?
Say something!

676
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,082
Beom-ja, that's not why she died.

677
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,252
She died of a heart attack.
It runs in the family.

678
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,004
-You should be careful too.
-Goodness.

679
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:11,839
Goodness.

680
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,425
Goodness.

681
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,223
Mom.

682
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,684
This family is a total disaster.

683
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,605
Don't bother visiting.

684
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,357
I'll drink the alcohol.

685
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,985
You should make a U-turn.

686
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,990
Mr. Hong, you finally came back
after 19 years. Will you rejoin Queens--

687
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,242
Will you be attending
your mother's memorial service?

688
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,036
Will you be meeting Chairman Hong?

689
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,746
Have you two reconciled?

690
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,134
Please sit. He'll leave eventually.

691
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,510
That's why I despise him more.

692
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,807
That bastard didn't come to see me.

693
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,018
He came to get his photo taken.

694
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,394
Look at him.

695
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,731
He's purposely standing in the rain
for the cameras.

696
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,524
What a bastard.

697
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,697
We're the ones
who cooked all those pancakes.

698
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,032
Do you see my hands trembling?

699
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,242
But they don't even allow us
to attend the service.

700
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,037
These days, I spend a lot of time
on internet forums about mothers.

701
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,748
I can relate to many of their posts.

702
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,210
I don't remember the last time
I visited my parents on the holidays.

703
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,462
They said they'd let us go
once we cleaned up.

704
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,005
-"Wait for your aunt-in-law."
-Right.

705
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,340
"Wait for your uncle-in-law."

706
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,383
"Chop some apples."

707
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,676
"Serve the pancakes."

708
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,803
I mean, what about our families?

709
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,013
Today is Hyun-woo's father's birthday.

710
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,723
It's his 60th birthday.

711
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,434
But he couldn't visit him
because of this memorial service.

712
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,437
Anyway, I pity him the most.

713
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,147
-Me too.
-Me too.

714
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,192
Our wives are their cousins,
but he married the direct line. Gosh.

715
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,276
His in-laws

716
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,153
are all terrifying.

717
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,655
-They are.
-They are.

718
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,532
Director Jo.

719
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,160
You've been attending
the memorial service for 20 years now.

720
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,914
She always treated me well.
Of course I should come.

721
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,291
I know you submitted
your resignation letter,

722
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,544
but I really don't want to accept it.

723
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,547
I thought long and hard
before making that decision.

724
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,632
Soon, I'll be too old
to have a fresh start.

725
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,844
Okay. It can't be helped then.

726
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,639
I'll always be rooting for you.

727
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,391
Thank you so much, sir.

728
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,768
Look into him.
It's odd for him to quit so suddenly.

729
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,228
I'm sure something's up.

730
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,771
I'll look into him discreetly.

731
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,942
No, everyone should know about this.

732
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:40,028
Find out what he did
and let the media see him going to court.

733
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,322
My purpose isn't to punish him.

734
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,533
It's to humiliate him.

735
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,163
Why do you wish to do that?

736
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,171
I never allow those
who turn their backs on me

737
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,297
to leave in one piece.

738
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,216
They need to suffer on their way out

739
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,427
so they won't cause further troubles.

740
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,848
What's with the face?

741
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,559
Do you have something to say?

742
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,770
But he devoted many years to you.

743
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,858
Is it right to cut him off

744
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,819
so brutally?

745
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,703
That's probably what he'll think.

746
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,038
But that's his opinion.

747
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,290
I believe an organization
must follow its rules.

748
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,125
That's exactly right.

749
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,213
It's not just him. I'm after anyone else
who has the same idea.

750
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,715
It's a warning to those
who want to backstab me.

751
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,260
-Yes, sir.
-Keep that in mind.

752
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,180
-Sorry?
-You should never bid farewell

753
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,015
to those who abandon you.

754
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,186
You must stab them in the back.

755
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:56,855
Yes, sir.

756
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,441
Well done.

757
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,401
Go rest up.

758
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,573
Yes, sir.

759
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,658
Goodbye then.

760
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,966
I don't have an appetite.

761
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,720
It feels like my appetite
is completely gone.

762
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,391
It's suffocating to be around many people.

763
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,189
Your stress levels
seem to be extremely high.

764
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,149
Based on your sentence completion test,

765
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,652
you wrote
that your biggest desire right now

766
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,153
is getting a divorce.

767
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,407
-Correct.
-I see. And why is that?

768
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:53,787
I live with my parents-in-law.

769
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,081
And my grandfather-in-law.

770
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,166
And him.

771
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,210
As well as
my recently-discharged aunt-in-law

772
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,878
and my brother-in-law's family.

773
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,046
We all live

774
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,757
under the same roof.

775
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,927
I see.

776
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:13,348
It's rare to see extended families
nowadays. You're blessed.

777
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,059
We're so blessed
that we have dinner together every night.

778
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,271
Then we get together at 9:00 p.m. to talk.

779
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,564
An end-of-day meeting.

780
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,733
The weekends, holidays,
birthdays, and Christmas.

781
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,944
We spend them together all year round.
It's safe to say

782
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,196
that I have no time for myself.

783
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,659
We have 15 memorial services per year.

784
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,494
They say noble families in the past

785
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,205
made their male members
prepare for the services.

786
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,042
So the sons-in-law prepare
for the entire service.

787
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:44,004
But their sons never help.

788
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,341
It feels like

789
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,178
you need a place
where you can be away from them.

790
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,681
Do you have a job?

791
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,767
-Yes.
-Good.

792
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,934
How's your work life?

793
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,144
My wife is my boss.

794
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,314
And my father-in-law is her boss.

795
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,816
Then my grandfather-in-law

796
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,485
is his boss.

797
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,197
My heart races, and my hands tremble

798
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,782
whenever my in-laws call.

799
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,950
I'm anxious
about what they'll ask me to do.

800
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:18,038
Why don't you distance yourself
from this stressful environment?

801
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,539
Then divorce is the only option.

802
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,291
You could move out with your wife.

803
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,627
It's true that I dislike my in-laws.
However…

804
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,046
I despise my wife even more.

805
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,798
Why is that?

806
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:28,965
She doesn't care

807
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,886
at all about me
or how her family treats me.

808
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,472
She only cares about herself.
Isn't she selfish?

809
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,433
I only married
into the family because of her

810
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,310
and endured three years of this treatment.

811
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,854
But she doesn't care.

812
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,316
Before we got married,
she said I could trust her.

813
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,235
I'm the only one you need.

814
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:49,986
Just trust me.

815
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,322
I will never

816
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,783
make you cry.

817
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,294
I was an idiot for believing her.

818
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,380
Are you hurt and upset with her?

819
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,466
No.

820
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,468
I no longer feel that way.

821
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,511
I just despise her.

822
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,388
I hate her

823
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,932
with a passion.

824
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,475
And that's why you want a divorce.

825
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,227
That's the only way I'll live.

826
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,520
Then why haven't you?

827
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,815
Because I could die.

828
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,442
What?

829
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,152
My father-in-law

830
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,070
despises it the most when his people

831
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,824
turn their backs on him.

832
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,576
The moment I divorce her,

833
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,745
he'll stab me in the back.

834
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,829
Stab you?

835
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,789
Of course, that was a figure of speech.

836
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,586
But getting stabbed
might actually be better.

837
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,727
I'll prescribe you something strong,
so take it.

838
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:05,979
Hang in there.

839
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,367
Goodbye.

840
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,466
WIFE

841
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,097
I love you, honey.

842
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,808
I genuinely think I'm happy.

843
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,559
I didn't do anything.

844
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,479
I'm just really grateful--

845
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,563
Hello?

846
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:56,822
I'm so happy.

847
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,700
Wait, Grace.

848
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,036
Why aren't you saying anything?

849
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,121
You should take responsibility for saying

850
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,290
that Jinseong Group's third heir
was the real deal.

851
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,668
Why should I do that?

852
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:12,879
I heard you chose their eldest son.
Go on that blind date then.

853
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,381
But the chairman doesn't like him.

854
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,132
So how can I set my daughter up with him

855
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,052
when I heard that his third son
will inherit everything?

856
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,804
You should've come to me first.

857
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,849
You already set up a blind date
with the eldest son, a rogue.

858
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,141
So what can I do?

859
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,561
You should just go to that matchmaker.

860
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,437
I was in a dilemma.

861
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,732
What choice did I have when I heard
that you were no longer competent?

862
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,407
What did you say?

863
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,534
So what if you serve
the ladies of Queens?

864
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:46,204
You may oversee their household matters,
but your daughter is still single.

865
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,123
That's exactly why

866
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:52,002
Hong Hae-in regrets not listening to me
and marrying her now-husband.

867
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,128
Seriously?

868
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,338
Are they getting a divorce?

869
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,718
You can't be with someone
who's out of your league.

870
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,386
Three years is enough.

871
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,221
Just wait and see.

872
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,890
Even the great Hong Hae-in

873
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:08,059
will listen to me
when she wants to remarry.

874
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,534
Ms. Hong!

875
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,376
Your mother stopped by
our spa this morning.

876
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,795
I told you to come by. Why won't you?

877
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,300
Are you stressed out these days?

878
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,386
Your skin looks dull.

879
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,806
We have some great serums and machines.

880
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,809
I'll empty out our schedule,
so do stop by.

881
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,895
You must be busy,
so you don't need to do that.

882
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,104
We're not busy.

883
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:58,818
You worry so much about me!

884
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,528
No, I don't.

885
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,696
What?

886
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,618
I'm just saying
that I will never visit your spa.

887
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,374
You're so cold.

888
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,044
You're making me feel distant.

889
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,340
You should feel that way.

890
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:22,968
You must be treating me

891
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,553
like a friend
because you think we're close.

892
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:28,723
I hope you'll be more careful.
It's uncomfortable.

893
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:30,475
But--

894
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,025
She has a nasty temper.

895
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,362
She's so obnoxious. Don't you agree?

896
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,658
The third heir of Jinseong Group

897
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,159
is into vegan food these days.

898
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:51,121
A vegan forum will be held
at their hotel next Friday.

899
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,289
Bring your daughter there.

900
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,874
-I'll try to set them up.
-Really?

901
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:56,835
You can go now.

902
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,754
I have something to do.

903
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,589
I knew it.

904
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,675
I trust you, Grace.

905
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,224
You see,

906
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,977
I've been in the beauty industry

907
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,856
and matchmaking wealthy families

908
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,274
all my life.

909
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,901
So I don't know much about legal matters.

910
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,069
I see. What is this about?

911
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,615
I'm sure you heard

912
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,660
that Daegyeong's youngest son
passed away due to a car accident.

913
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,328
I did.

914
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,997
It seems like

915
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,375
his wife won't inherit
any of his fortunes.

916
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,420
Turns out, her husband had written a will

917
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,464
before they got married.

918
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,592
He said his children, nieces, or nephews

919
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,011
should inherit
his fortunes instead if he died.

920
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,096
But that couple never had a child.

921
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:51,973
I see.

922
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,808
In that case, the wife could claim

923
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,269
a legal reserve of inheritance
and file a lawsuit.

924
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:59,064
I can introduce you
to an attorney if you want.

925
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,401
What for? I have you.

926
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,903
You're in the same boat.

927
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,154
Sorry?

928
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,824
Ms. Hong also wrote a will
before she got married.

929
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:12,994
Didn't you know?

930
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,205
You must've thought

931
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,956
the prenuptial agreement was it.

932
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,334
I can't believe she didn't tell you.

933
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:22,087
She's a heartless one.

934
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,963
The will said that Queens

935
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:27,383
would inherit
all her cash, stocks, and real estates

936
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,927
if something happened to her.

937
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,930
She said you wouldn't get anything.

938
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:35,058
She wrote it in such detail.

939
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:39,229
We use that as a template
for all future wills.

940
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,109
What's with that face?

941
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:47,112
Did you really think it was
the marriage of the century

942
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,656
that transcended all backgrounds

943
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,658
like the media claimed it was?

944
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,077
Don't be so naive.

945
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,705
Ms. Hong didn't want a husband.

946
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,708
She wanted a slave
she could add to the family register.

947
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,919
And that's when you appeared.

948
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:07,715
You're handsome and intelligent.
It was the best PR she could have.

949
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,843
You're obedient just to her liking.

950
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,846
The only problem was the wealth dispute,

951
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,473
but that's solved, thanks to the will.

952
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:17,433
That's enough.

953
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,478
Okay.

954
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,689
Hello, Professor.

955
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:28,361
Can you e-mail it to me?
I don't have time to go there.

956
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,300
Why weren't you picking up?

957
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,304
We need to go somewhere.

958
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,224
I know you're free today. I checked.

959
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,101
The car is waiting downstairs.

960
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:03,897
I'm not going.

961
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,651
I didn't even tell you
where we were going.

962
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,861
It doesn't matter.

963
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,780
I refuse to go anywhere with you.

964
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,483
YONGDU-RI'S PRODIGY BAEK HYUN-WOO

965
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,360
"A prodigy"? That was from ages ago.

966
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,493
So…

967
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,745
here's what Yongdu-ri thinks.

968
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,789
They don't mind you serving
consecutive terms.

969
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,333
That's the general opinion.

970
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:08,753
Stop by my shop later for a snack.
The new makgeolli tastes good.

971
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:09,837
Again?

972
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,422
-You're always so generous.
-Gosh.

973
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:16,094
I wish I could give you something better,
but there's

974
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,971
the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.

975
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,639
The village head is also a state job,

976
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,016
so I can't be too generous.

977
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,351
Gosh, I'm always grateful.

978
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,686
You've done enough already.

979
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,145
-You understand, right?
-Of course.

980
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,397
Goodness, Ms. Jeon.

981
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,066
Hello.

982
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,819
-Jeez.
-Hey.

983
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,529
Did it get stuck again?

984
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,073
You idiots.
How can you call yourselves farmers?

985
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,158
How do you manage to get the cultivator

986
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,618
stuck every time?

987
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,078
What took you so long?

988
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,162
I--

989
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,373
I'm not 911.
I can't always come right away.

990
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,672
My wife used to drive a cultivator

991
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,091
and catch small octopuses
in Beolgyo, Jeolla Province

992
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,510
before marrying me.

993
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,220
She's really something.

994
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,142
It's working!

995
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,438
Gosh, what lovely weather.

996
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,606
What? Hey.

997
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,651
Yeong-cheol! How are your mother's knees?

998
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:14,986
They're the same!

999
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,071
That's why she needs to take glucosamine!

1000
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,948
-Sit down!
-Okay.

1001
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,702
Isn't your son taking his midterms soon?

1002
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,954
What's it to me? It's his work.

1003
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,539
What are you saying?

1004
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:30,043
Even still, you should help him memorize!

1005
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,963
When Hyun-woo went to SNU,
I helped him day and night--

1006
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,179
Why did you suddenly speed up?

1007
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,889
I told you to sit, didn't I?

1008
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:47,977
They may just look like normal farmers,
but they're more than that.

1009
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,647
They're all voters.

1010
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,441
The reelection is around the corner.
You know nothing.

1011
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,151
Reelection, my foot.

1012
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,570
We need to take care
of our grove and our shop.

1013
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,739
We're already juggling so much.

1014
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,658
Didn't I tell you countless times

1015
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,242
to give up your position?

1016
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,327
Honey.

1017
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,371
I'm only doing this for balance's sake.

1018
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:07,914
-What balance?
-Hear me out.

1019
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:12,752
Hyun-woo's in-laws may be
the pillars of this country's economy,

1020
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,962
but they don't have much political power.

1021
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,964
Our families can only have balance

1022
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,883
since I'm maintaining

1023
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,927
my important post as the village head.

1024
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,014
Why are you stopping now?

1025
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,183
-Hyun-woo!
-What?

1026
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,442
You didn't even call.

1027
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,777
I just thought I'd visit.

1028
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,320
Where's Hae-in?

1029
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,988
Are you here alone again?

1030
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,993
Have you eaten yet?

1031
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,995
Not yet.

1032
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,039
Okay.

1033
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:00,967
This looks ripe.

1034
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,929
Move aside.

1035
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,848
Let's see.

1036
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,059
Move. My youngest son is here.

1037
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,366
Gosh, you must've been hungry.

1038
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,585
Take your time.

1039
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,470
Is it good?

1040
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,469
Yes, I'm busy. Why?

1041
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,932
Hyun-woo is here?

1042
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,183
One minute.

1043
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,187
QUEEN'S HAIR SALON

1044
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,022
That little scumbag.

1045
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,274
He didn't even come
for Dad's 60th birthday.

1046
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,359
Don't let him leave.

1047
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:48,449
I've been meaning to ask you something.

1048
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,701
I'm disappointed in both you and Hae-in.

1049
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,788
I get that you can't come regularly
or even on the holidays.

1050
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:56,874
But shouldn't you have attended
Dad's 60th birthday?

1051
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,252
-That's so heartless.
-Yes, you're right.

1052
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:01,754
I was heartless.

1053
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,631
At least he knows that he was wrong.

1054
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:05,508
That's why I'm getting a divorce.

1055
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,637
-What?
-Dad. Mom.

1056
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,430
I'm going to divorce Hae-in.

1057
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,476
-I'm sorry.
-Wait.

1058
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,396
Hey, don't tell me

1059
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:21,607
you're getting a divorce
just because of what I said.

1060
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,609
What's with you?
60th birthdays are nothing.

1061
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,236
Birthdays come every year.

1062
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,197
Indeed. Who celebrates
60th birthdays these days?

1063
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,575
Forget 70th too.
We're expected to live longer lives.

1064
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,034
It's not because of that.

1065
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,202
Then?

1066
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,788
What is it? I'm sure you have a reason.

1067
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,251
Don't tell me you're seeing another--

1068
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,627
Come on.

1069
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:43,921
No.

1070
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,339
Then does Hae-in have--

1071
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,966
Can you please stop?

1072
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,928
That's not true either.
It's just too much for me.

1073
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,890
I'm not happy.

1074
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,809
That's an absurd reason.

1075
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,394
Do you think I'm always happy?

1076
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,812
He's right.

1077
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,398
Your dad isn't always happy
in this marriage either.

1078
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:03,858
If anything, I'm miserable.

1079
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:05,610
But I'm only able to endure it

1080
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,528
because of the smallest happiness

1081
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,156
that I feel once in a blue moon.

1082
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,534
-That's marriage. That's life.
-You know what you're talking about.

1083
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,660
I'll be honest.

1084
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,288
Do you think I'm with your mom
because I love her?

1085
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:21,667
What did you say?

1086
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:24,795
I'm not done.

1087
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,381
Of course, I love you.

1088
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,842
But if love is the only thing you feel,

1089
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,011
then that'll be the death of you.

1090
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,347
Sure. I hope you live a long life.

1091
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,641
Look at this.

1092
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:41,062
We still fail to see eye to eye
despite being married for 40 years.

1093
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,271
Not at all.

1094
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,524
Unbelievable.

1095
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,110
I understand.

1096
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:49,820
But…

1097
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,742
I thought long and hard
before making this decision.

1098
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:58,746
I'm going to do it.

1099
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:03,793
I'm sorry.

1100
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,968
Stop!

1101
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,929
Stop! Get out, you scumbag!

1102
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,931
You're so selfish.

1103
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,558
Don't you know
I had to make sacrifices for you?

1104
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,768
What sacrifices?

1105
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:24,105
I couldn't even go to university
because our parents sold

1106
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,940
all of our cows to send you to Seoul.

1107
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,274
How could you forget that?

1108
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,694
How are you so shameless?
You couldn't go to university

1109
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,445
because you failed at attendance.

1110
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,409
This boy is so naive.

1111
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:42,498
Why do you think
Grand Prince Yang-nyeong acted out?

1112
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:43,958
What are you on about?

1113
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,543
It was a sacrifice.

1114
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:48,587
He sacrificed himself and acted out
for his brother Se-jong's sake.

1115
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,172
Do you think I enjoyed acting out?

1116
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,300
I gave up
our parents' expectations, hopes, and cows

1117
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,012
just for you.

1118
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,054
You did?

1119
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,431
Yes, me.

1120
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,516
I had to make sacrifices as the eldest.

1121
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,563
I see, Ms. Baek Mi-seon.
Thumbelina of Yongdu Carriage Gang.

1122
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:06,647
Hey!

1123
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,442
That was ages ago.

1124
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,863
I'm leaving.

1125
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,369
I don't want to pressure you.

1126
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:21,871
You already are.

1127
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,915
-I'm only worried about Dad.
-What about him?

1128
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:28,002
Do you know how happy he was
to marry you off to Queens?

1129
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:30,546
He says he has no appetite
but finishes a bowl of rice soup

1130
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,590
every time Queens' stock prices go up.

1131
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,343
He always enjoyed rice soup.

1132
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,387
Yes, that's true.

1133
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,555
Right. But…

1134
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:42,600
A son from this tiny town gets a divorce?

1135
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:45,352
He'll be humiliated! Wake up, you idiot!

1136
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,646
This isn't Seoul or Hollywood.

1137
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,773
This is Yongdu-ri.

1138
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,941
Your friend Chang-sik
got divorced two years ago,

1139
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,277
and they're still talking about it.

1140
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,653
He's right.

1141
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,239
All the ladies at my hair salon

1142
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,201
still wonder why he got divorced.

1143
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,702
That's right. However…

1144
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,705
no one will talk about him
if you get divorced too.

1145
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:09,168
Is this because of your gym's rent?

1146
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,754
And because of Gyeong-jun
who's studying abroad?

1147
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,339
Since you need to send him money?

1148
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:17,384
Are you using me to live comfortable lives

1149
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:20,096
just like how Sim-cheong
was sold for 300 sacks of rice?

1150
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,223
Gosh. No, I…

1151
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:26,060
I wouldn't use you if it was that much.

1152
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:28,104
-But it's not.
-Damn it.

1153
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,022
Hey, Hyun-woo.

1154
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,440
Hyun--

1155
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:32,483
Hyun-woo!

1156
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,318
-Baek Hyun-woo!
-Hyun-woo!

1157
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,653
Stay the night!

1158
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:32,001
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

1159
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,126
I have

1160
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,921
something to say.

1161
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:20,966
I'll go first.

1162
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,010
What?

1163
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,638
I do too, so let me go first.

1164
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,643
Okay. Go on.

1165
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,437
I'm…

1166
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,484
dying.

1167
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,032
I have three months left.

1168
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,581
What did you say?

1169
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:01,298
I said we had to go somewhere today.

1170
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,549
I went to the hospital.

1171
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,928
And the doctor said I was dying

1172
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,138
and that I had three months.

1173
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:11,225
What…

1174
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,018
are you saying?

1175
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,313
It's exactly what I said.

1176
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:21,360
The doctor said
I only have three months to live.

1177
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,571
That's all.

1178
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,783
-What did you want to say?
-What?

1179
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:30,536
You had something to say. What is it?

1180
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:34,915
I don't think

1181
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,003
that's important right now.

1182
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:47,803
Just say it.
I know you have something to say.

1183
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,848
Well, I…

1184
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,852
-So what…
-Yes?

1185
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:57,646
I wanted to say was…

1186
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:00,899
I…

1187
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,610
Yes?

1188
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:04,903
"I'm sorry."

1189
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,742
"About today

1190
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:14,121
and everything that I did until now."

1191
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:17,583
"It won't happen ever again.
I'll treat you better from now on."

1192
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:21,503
That's what I wanted

1193
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,630
to say.

1194
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:27,634
But you only have three months to live?
How's that possible?

1195
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:30,179
How can I live without you?

1196
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:33,015
How is that possible?

1197
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:35,893
I'm so dumbfounded

1198
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,020
that I don't know what to say.

1199
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,276
Are you serious?

1200
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,695
Yes, you fool.

1201
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,501
I love you, Hong Hae-in.

1202
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:03,420
I love you.

1203
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,314
Please give them a round of applause

1204
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,900
as they begin their new journey.

1205
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:32,366
Please clap and cheer even louder

1206
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:34,660
to wish them the very best.

1207
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,627
Everyone, please look at the camera!

1208
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:46,547
Please laugh on the count of three.

1209
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,006
One, two, three.

1210
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:08,569
Mr. Baek, congratulations on the wedding.

1211
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:10,904
Please say something
to yourself in ten years.

1212
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,240
How are you doing,
Hyun-woo from the future?

1213
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:14,908
Don't tell me you got a divorce.

1214
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,953
Do you have kids?

1215
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,079
One? Two?

1216
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,540
It doesn't matter though.

1217
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,793
Because all I need is Hae-in.

1218
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,672
I hope you still remember

1219
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:31,675
how much you love her

1220
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,178
even to this day.

1221
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:38,307
Don't make her cry.

1222
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:40,517
Make her happy.

1223
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,020
Why must I answer that?

1224
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,857
It'll be something nice to watch
in the future.

1225
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:50,110
I'll be too busy with life
to watch this in ten years.

1226
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:51,612
Do I have to do this?

1227
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,698
Dear Hae-in from the future.

1228
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:59,536
I doubt you're watching this.
But if you are, why are you?

1229
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,996
Turn this off and get to work.

1230
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:04,791
I won't ask how you're doing
since I know you'll be doing fine.

1231
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,835
You'll be just as pretty, healthy,

1232
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,670
and the most successful.

1233
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,549
With Hyun-woo by your side, of course.

1234
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:23,894
QUEEN OF TEARS

1235
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,590
But you only have three months to live?
How's that possible?

1236
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:56,969
If you can't live without me…
Do you want to die together?

1237
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,345
I'm just happy

1238
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:01,223
that I can escape from them
safe and sound.

1239
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:04,935
Put your heart and soul into loving her.

1240
01:16:05,018 --> 01:16:06,311
I'm that materialistic?

1241
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,646
I'll be sitting here.

1242
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,857
-Are you okay?
-They should just argue instead.

1243
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,819
How can we change
after years of living as strangers?

1244
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:15,612
Watch out!

1245
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:18,240
I thought of Hae-in now and then.

1246
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:21,243
So it feels odd to meet her husband.

1247
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:24,788
I don't even like Hong Hae-in.
Why would I feel jealous?

1248
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,086
