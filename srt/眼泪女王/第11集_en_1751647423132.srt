Jihun...?

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
Gosh.

00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,960
Because I received a trial sentence

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,700
saying that I had very little time left.

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,640
When did you receive a trial sentence?

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,940
Did you know about this too, Chairman Yoon?

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320

I haven't...

44
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,160
Said anything yet.

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
Let's go.

Do you need me?

49
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,640
You're annoyed when you see me, right?

50
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,540
Let's stop now.

51
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,540
You only said what you wanted to say.

52
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,280
I'm so grateful that you stayed with me for so long.

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,820

Don't do that.

58
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,740
Don't do that.

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,880

I haven't told everyone yet.

You said you found something.

Yes, that is...

74
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,680
Get off.

75
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Who told you to get off?

76
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Is this hospital yours?

77
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
I'm going to see the director.

78
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,680
I can't see him anyway, so get off.

79
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,680
You got hit in the back by your son and lost him.

80
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Do you think you have the right to be my father's legal guardian?

81
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Do you think I'll just let you go?

82
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
I'll just go with my own feet.

83
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
No touch, please.

84
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
No!

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
I'm sorry, but I can't open it.

Not you. Open it.

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Let go!

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Fine.

100
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Fine? Really?

101
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Really?

102
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Instead, just let me see your face.

103
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Or else, you'll be dragged out.

104

Father, you did a great job!

113
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,680
You did a great job!

114
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Father!

115
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Father!

116
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
What's wrong?

117
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Don't you know me?

118
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Father!

119
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
What? Did he die?

120
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Father!

121
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Father!

122
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
You bitch.

123
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
You're done for.

124
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,680
You were put under the protection of my father.

125
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Father is fine now.

126
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,680
That's why you don't need to be put under the protection of me.

127
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Right?

128
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Yes, you're right.

129
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
Wait.

130
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
I'll call the doctor first.

131
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Shut up!

132
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Call the police first.

133
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Father, I'm sorry.

134
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Call the police first.

136
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Father, it's because of that bitch.

137
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
What did she do?

138
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Who is it?

139
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Father.

140
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Father.

141
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Father.

142
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Why did you...

143
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Father.

144
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,680
What's wrong with him?

145
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Mother.

146
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
What's wrong with him?

147
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
It's a CT scan.

148
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
It's a acute brain failure.

149
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
The brain tumor cells are temporarily brainwashed by suppressing surrounding tissues.

150
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
It's a CT scan.

151
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
It's a CT scan.

152
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
It's a CT scan.

153
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
It's a CT scan.

154
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
It's a CT scan.

155
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
It's a CT scan.

156
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
It's a CT scan.

157
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
It's a CT scan.

158
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
It's a CT scan.

159
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
It's a CT scan.

160
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
It's a CT scan.

161
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,680
It's a CT scan.

162
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
It's a CT scan.

163
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
It's a CT scan.

164
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Did you know about what Haein said?

165
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Honey.

166
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Why didn't you tell me?

167
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
What have you been doing?

168
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
You should've told me you were sick.

169
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
Why didn't you tell me?

170
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
Stop it.

171
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
You lied to us again.

172
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,680
You lied to us until we were diagnosed with the cancer.

173
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
What kind of a search did you do?

174
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Stop it.

175
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,680
Do we have the right to say that?

176
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
We didn't know anything

178
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,680
when we became parents.

179
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Please tell me more...

180
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Please tell me more...

181
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Please tell me more about my daughter's condition.

182
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,680
Currently, Dr. Hong's patient

183
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
has a kind of malignant brain tumor called

184
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
the cloud cell tumor.

185
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
In the case of the cloud cell tumor,

186
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
unlike the normal tumor

187
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,680
which is covered with a clear lump,

188
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
the tumor cells are spread like fog

189
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
between the brain nerves.

190
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
It's a rare case that's not found all over the world.

191
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,680
It's hard to treat it in Korea.

192
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,680
I'm sorry, mother.

193
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,680
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance.

194
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Hyein told you not to do this, right?

195
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,680
You must've had a hard time on your own.

196
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,680
Hyein was worried that

197
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,680
her parents would be heartbroken

198
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,680
and she was treated to some extent.

199
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
I wanted to tell you this

202
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
after she was treated to some extent

203
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,680
in case she would be heartbroken.

204
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Please don't misunderstand.

205
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Dad.

206
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,680
Hyein.

207
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,680
The wide and wide ocean

208
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,680
with a big fish

209
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,680
and the father who catches fish

210
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,680
and the daughter who doesn't know you

211
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,680
My love, my love

212
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,680
The one who came to me

213
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,680
is the one who's always alone

214
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,680
and will never leave you

215
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
The MRI results show

216
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
that the tumor has been hemorrhaged

217
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
due to cerebral hemorrhage.

218
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
The damage to the anterior and rectal cortex

219
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
shows a problem with rational judgment

220
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
and memory recognition.

221
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
We'll have to wait for the damaged area

222
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
to recover.

223
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Let's wait for two weeks.

224
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Are you saying it could get better?

225
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
It depends on the case.

226
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
It's hard to say right now.

227
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Jihun.

229
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
You were shocked, weren't you?

230
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,680
I just heard the news.

231
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,680
You knew Hyein was sick, right?

232
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
I just wanted you to stop regretting it.

233
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,680
I'm sorry, Jihun.

234
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
I'm the only one who didn't know.

235
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
I know everything.

236
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,680
Mom,

237
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,680
I told you that I'm in trouble too.

238
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Aren't you going to ask me what's going on?

239
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
You're so good that you can handle

240
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
big or small things on your own.

241
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Really?

242
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,680
I'll take care of my own business tomorrow.

243
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Why are you overreacting?

244
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm in trouble too.

245
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
I couldn't sleep last night

246
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
and I'm having a headache.

247
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Why are you saying this?

248
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
It's all the same.

249
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Mom.

250
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,680
When I face you

251
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,680
between your two hands

252
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,680
hidden tears

253
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,680
come down

254
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,680
I can't comfort you

255
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,680
I'm sorry to say this alone

256
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,680
I promise I'll be here

257
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,680
I'll gather the moments I missed

258
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,680
and with the heart of the time

259
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,680
I'll erase you

260
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,680
I'll protect you with my heart

261
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
What?

262
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
What happened?

263
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
Is it real? Does it really hurt?

264
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
I don't think the people at the house knew.

265
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
I'm sure the police didn't know.

266
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
They must have been very surprised.

267
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Did you call to tell me that?

268
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
It's nothing.

269
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
He has panic disorder.

270
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
He comes home once a week when he's stressed.

271
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
If he sees that, he'll be in trouble.

272
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
He needs medicine.

273
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
I don't think he took it with him.

274
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
It's at my house.

275
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
Tell him to send it to me.

276
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Hey, tell him.

277
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,680
He might really fall and die.

278
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Then tell him to die.

279
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Hey, what are you saying?

280
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
What are you saying?

281
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Do you want me to kill him?

282
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,680
If you call me again,

283
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
I'll kill him.

284
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Yes.

285
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
I think it's because of this.

286
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
What?

287
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Yes.

288
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
What is this?

289
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
If you carry this around...

290
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,680
I didn't believe you because you said you'd give me some advice.

291
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
I just wanted to beat you once.

292
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
But...

293
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Because of this evil talisman,

294
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,680
I can't help but be sick of you being such a crazy director.

295
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Because of this, I've been a beggar.

296
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
Hae In.

297
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
Hae In.

298
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,680
What are you doing here?

299
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
I'm a little...

301
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
I'm a little drunk.

302
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
I woke up as soon as I tore it.

303
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Si Cheol.

304
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
I'm sorry...

305
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
For all this time.

306
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Why does it feel like I'm not in my right mind?

307
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Go and bring the professor and the adults.

308
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Are you okay?

309
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I love you.

310
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
From the first time I saw you...

311
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Until now...

312
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
I loved you.

313
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,680
I'm sorry I couldn't do it for you.

314
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,680
I'm sorry I left you alone in a strange place like my house.

315
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,680
I think I knew you wanted to get divorced.

316
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,680
I've been holding it in for a long time.

317
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
So...

318
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
It's okay. Don't mind it.

319
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,680
What are you doing?

320
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,680
I couldn't even say this, but if I die...

321
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,680
You won't know my heart at all.

322
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
I don't know when I'll die.

323
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
I'm telling you in advance.

324
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,680
I prayed more than I did last night.

325
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,680
If you die like this...

326
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
I won't do anything...

327
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
I'll cry every day...

328
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
I'll drink a lot...

329
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
I'll sleep on the street...

330
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
And I'll die.

331
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,680
That's what you call praying, right?

332
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,680
I don't care.

333
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
If you die...

334
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,680
I'll be a complete loser.

335
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
How can I leave you when you're dead?

336
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,680
So stop talking nonsense.

337
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
I was serious.

338
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,680
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to say this...

339
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
So I fell asleep.

340
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Don't sleep.

341
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
You won't die.

342
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
You won't die.

343
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
I won't let you go.

344
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,680
I'll sleep on the street...

345
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Mom, I woke up.

346
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
Come on.

347
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Where have you been?

348
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Why didn't you tell me?

349
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,680
It's okay now. I know now.

350
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Forget it.

351
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,680
I have a lot of famous doctors.

352
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,680
They're all over the world.

353
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Really?

354
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
I should've told you sooner.

355
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
I'm sorry.

356
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,680
I'm sorry.

357
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
What are you sorry for?

358
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
You're sick. Why are you sorry?

359
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,680
You should talk to me now.

360
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,680
You've been so lonely.

361
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
It's okay now.

362
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,680
Everything will be okay.

363
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Okay.

364
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
What about you?

365
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
What about you?

366
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Just go.

367
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,680
I'm really sorry for not telling you.

368
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Forget it.

369
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,680
You don't know that your child is sick.

370
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,680
What did I do to my daughter?

371
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,680
You're relieved, right?

372
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,680
I was trying to solve it with my heart.

373
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,680
Every time I touched that child,

374
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,680
he didn't stop.

375
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,680
I can't live with a child like me.

376
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,680
I can't live with a child like me.

377
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,680
It's all because of you.

378
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,680
My father was stressed out

379
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,680
because he met a mother like me.

380
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,680
He's sick.

381
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
I'm sorry.

382
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Is your mother a doctor?

383
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
She doesn't even know.

384
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Does she know everything?

385
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
She doesn't know the cause of my illness,

386
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
she doesn't have a preventive measure,

387
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
and she doesn't look like she's stressed out.

388
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
How can she be like this?

389
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,680
She's so simple.

390
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,680
It's annoying.

391
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
I'm sorry.

392
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
It's annoying.

393
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,680
And

394
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
a daughter like me

395
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,680
must have had a hard time.

396
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,680
So it's not all my fault.

397
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Min.

398
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Min.

399
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Did it hurt a lot?

400
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Well,

401
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
it hurts when it hurts,

402
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
and it hurts when it doesn't.

403
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,680
I didn't know you were like that.

404
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
I'm sorry.

405
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,680
I was wrong.

406
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
I'm sorry.

407
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,680
I was really wrong.

408
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
No.

409
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,680
It has nothing to do with the illness.

410
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,680
I didn't even know you were so simple.

411
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
I didn't even want to tell you.

412
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
I'm sorry.

413
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,680
I was really wrong.

414
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm sorry.

415
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,680
What am I going to do

416
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,680
if you die?

417
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,680
No. No.

418
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
Don't die.

419
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,680
Don't die.

420
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Let's go.

421
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Min.

422
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
Min.

423
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
I'm sorry.

424
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
I'm sorry.

425
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,680
She's so diligent

426
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
that she's avoiding the cliff.

427
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
She's really a bad girl.

428
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
She is.

429
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Do you know where this is?

430
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680
What?

431
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
It's not scary.

432
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,680
It's my house.

433
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,680
Let's go in.

434
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Doctor,

435
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,680
I think you're getting better.

436
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,680
Even though you're busy,

438
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
you can't eat the food that others give you.

439
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,680
I can't stand by you.

440
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
So I had no choice but to ask you to come.

441
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Of course.

442
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
You woke up thanks to your hard work.

443
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Forget about the public opinion.

444
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Explain it to us.

445
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,680
What if a press conference like that is held?

446
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
We didn't know about the press conference.

447
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
President Yoon suddenly...

448
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
It's not like you're bragging.

449
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
You knew about it in advance and got into an accident.

450
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
That's why you're getting paid so much.

451
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Did I say something wrong?

452
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Why should we listen to you?

453
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,680
What do you know about the president

454
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
who feeds and treats you?

455
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
That's not possible.

456
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,680
Or you can get all the plans

457
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,680
that will be sent to you from now on.

458
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Tell the PR team to come here tomorrow morning.

459
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Why would the PR team...

460
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Aren't you reading the article?

461
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
The press is a mess.

462
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
Our management is being cursed

463
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
because of the sympathy for the management.

464
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Am I the only one who cares about the stocks?

465
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
The anchor's LPs are being criticized.

466
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
The stock price is falling too much.

467
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,680
The promised accident is being delayed.

468
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,680
They say we should all stand together.

469
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
We should find the alibis money

470
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,680
and shut them up.

471
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Have you looked into the alibis money?

472
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Yes, through the LCC investment bank

473
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,680
in the Malay-Lavuans,

474
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
we found out that the account was managed

475
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
by the bank manager called Jamal Ibrahim.

476
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
I think he was out of cash and sold it separately.

477
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
What about the money?

478
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
It should be around 9,000 billion.

479
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Send someone to the Lavuans right now.

480
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,680
Find the next alibis quickly.

481
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,680
This is the restaurant where they make kalguksu.

482
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,680
Even if it doesn't taste good.

483
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,680
I don't think I can handle it now.

484
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,680
You should eat well.

485
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
You're the center of the family.

486
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
You should be strong and endure it

487
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
so that the kids can get strength too.

488
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,680
My kids are strong like me.

489
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
I'm not the center of the family.

490
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
My dad was the head of the family

491
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
and not me.

492
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
I was upset about that,

493
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
but I was comfortable.

494
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
You're sad, right?

495
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
You were comfortable that the kids

496
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
didn't rely on me.

497
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,680
Your daughter is going to die soon.

498
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,680
I told them to trust their dad.

499
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,680
But I don't think that would help my daughter.

500
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
No, it's not like that.

501
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,680
Parents are not like that to their children.

502
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,680
My father passed away early.

503
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680
Even at this age,

504
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,680
I think of my father when I make difficult decisions.

505
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,680
What would my father have done?

506
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Parents are like a lighthouse

507
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
to their children,

508
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,680
no matter how bad they are.

509
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
You should eat well,

510
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,680
stand firmly on your feet,

511
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,680
and light the fire.

512
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
Let's eat.

513
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,680
If the kalguksu is good,

514
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
there's no business if it's not good.

515
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
What did I just see?

516
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
A drama.

517
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
Not a husband, but a real love

518
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
for her ex-husband.

519
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,680
I've never seen a love confession

520
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,680
this desperate.

521
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Stop.

522
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
As you can see,

523
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
she's gotten hot while she's lying down.

524
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,680
Hot?

525
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
It's humiliating.

526
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
Why?

527
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
She's turning into a very dramatic character.

528
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
She was a nightclub girl,

529
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
but she got ruined in the morning,

530
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
and now she's a nightclub girl.

531
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
She's a nightclub girl,

532
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
but she's a nightclub girl,

533
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
but she got ruined in the morning,

534
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
and now she's a nightclub girl.

535
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
So I'm a woman

536
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:56,920
who's been

537
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,920
What is it?

538
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
I bought a suit.

539
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
It's not an outlet,

540
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
but it's on sale at a department store.

541
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,920
What do you think this means?

542
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
What is it?

543
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
It means she's excited.

544
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,920
She thinks she's going to make a comeback.

545
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,920
But I should return it.

546
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Why would you do that?

547
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
You'll get a good reputation

548
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
if you wear it with another woman's dress.

549
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
You'll get a good reputation

550
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
if you wear it with another woman's dress.

551
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,920
No.

552
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
Why not?

553
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
You know how shy I am.

554
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
My job is secretary,

555
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
but I have a lot of places to go

556
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
if I don't have a job.

557
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
So you should come back.

558
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
I'll be waiting.

559
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,920
Do as you wish.

560
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,920
But I'll do my best.

561
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,920
You said you don't need to do your best.

562
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,920
You said you wanted me to do my best.

563
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
I'm going to do my best, too.

564
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,920
Come back before the part-time job is over.

565
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
How long is the part-time job?

566
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,920
Six months.

567
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
Six months is a bit...

568
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
Come back.

569
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Okay, okay.

570
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
She's angry.

571
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,920
I'll hug you today.

572
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,920
You worked hard to wake me up.

573
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
Look at this.

574
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
In a moment,

575
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
she became a stone's throw

576
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
at her ex-husband.

577
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Is this funny?

578
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Why would you care about that?

579
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Look behind you.

580
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,920
You're looking at me because I'm not good enough, right?

581
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
I've never seen you like that before.

582
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,920
I've never seen you like that before.

583
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
I can't.

584
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
You...

585
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Act like you're looking at me.

586
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,920
Act like I'm looking at you?

587
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
What do you mean?

588
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
First,

589
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,920
drop some honey from your eyes.

590
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
Honey?

591
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Like this?

592
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
Well...

593
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Well...

594
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,920
It's okay.

595
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,920
It's okay.

596
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
It's okay.

597
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
How long are you going to stare at me?

598
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Huh?

599
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
You're playing with your left arm.

600
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Oh, yeah.

601
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,920
I'm sorry.

602
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,920
I was surprised by your call.

603
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
I'm sorry.

604
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,920
How's your body?

605
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
It's better.

606
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
I'll be discharged tomorrow.

607
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Why already?

608
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
There's nothing special to be treated here.

609
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
Then come home.

610
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
It's better to go to the hospital.

611
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,920
I didn't call you to talk about that.

612
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Tell me.

613
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
You know you're in trouble.

614
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
It'll be hard to respond to the press.

615
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Your fund anchor's LP will be pressured.

616
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
If you want to build a new GP,

617
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,920
it'll be hard to defend your pure family.

618
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,920
I'm in trouble because of you.

619
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,920
So...

620
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,920
Are you worried about me?

621
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
No.

622
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,920
I'm not sorry for what I did.

623
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
And if you mess with me again,

624
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,920
I'll lose something bigger.

625
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,920
That's why I called you.

626
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Yeah.

627
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,920
That's why you called me.

628
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,920
But I thought I'd hear this

629
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,920
and I'm excited to hear this.

630
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
You don't know

631
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
how long it's been in my heart

632
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
and when it started.

633
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
I don't know.

634
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
I don't need to know.

635
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Do you still remember

636
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,920
why I told you to quit college?

637
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,920
I was thankful that you helped me

638
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,920
and it was you who made me suffer.

639
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,920
You should have liked me before I did.

640
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,920
What's wrong?

641
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,920
Did you forget everything?

642
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
I do.

643
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,920
I do.

644
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,920
Next to me.

645
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,920
Do you need more explanation?

646
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,920
Are you done?

647
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,920
Haekyeon.

648
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,920
Why are you still with Hyein?

649
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
Why should I tell you?

650
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
I almost died,

651
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,920
so you're feeling down?

652
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Or do you think you'll get something?

653
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,920
Come to me instead.

654
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
I'll get you everything you want

655
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
if you just leave Hyein.

656
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I've been holding it in, so just go.

657
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,920
Hey.

658
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,920
I don't want to tell you

659
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,920
about my feelings for Hyein,

660
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,920
but I won't leave even if you do something.

661
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,920
I'll be by her side forever.

662
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,920
I'll be with her.

663
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,920
So just wake up and go.

664
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
You're finally here.

665
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
I brought you home.

666
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
You heard, right?

667
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
You look happy.

668
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
I'm happy.

669
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
My son must've been heartbroken

670
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,920
because of the woman he wanted in his life.

671
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
What's wrong with your face?

672
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Are you hurt?

673
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
My heart...

674
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
I don't know.

675
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,920
I've always lived a rough life.

676
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,920
Nothing hurts me more.

677
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
I have nowhere to go.

678
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,920
So I don't want to be like a normal mom.

679
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,920
I don't want to be like a normal mom.

680
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,920
I don't want to be like a normal mom.

681
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,920
Stop it.

682
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
Your guest is here.

683
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
What if he doesn't answer?

684
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
He's just asking if you feel responsible

685
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
for what happened to me.

686
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
I told you not to call.

687
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
Why are you here?

688
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
I barely met him in prison,

689
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,920
but I need to keep him under investigation.

690
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,920
Baek Hyeonwoo won't just sit there!

691
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,920
So?

692
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,920
If the world finds out that he swindled

693
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
the resort property while signing the contract,

694
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
will I be the only one killed?

695
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Will you be able to stay there forever?

696
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,920
Chairman Yoon Eunsung?

697
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
This is the share of the LPs that Yoon Eunsung

698
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,920
manages, right?

699
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,920
I looked it up earlier.

700
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Didn't you say that the LPs were going to

701
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,920
re-establish their GP?

702
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,920
And they succeeded.

703
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,920
They succeeded.

704
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,920
So that means...

705
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Yoon Eunsung hasn't found the money

706
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,920
that he's been looking for yet.

707
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
Did you know?

708
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,920
The money was in the Swiss bank?

709
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,920
The world's law firm is going to be established

710
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,920
in Virgin Island, Moldova, and Singapore.

711
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
And the money from the Swiss bank

712
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,920
will be transferred to the Singapore law firm.

713
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,920
Then Virgin Island's law firm will be

714
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,920
able to make a financial relationship

715
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,920
as if they lent the money to the Moldova firm.

716
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,920
Singapore's law firm will be able to make financial

717
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
contributions to the Moldova firm.

718
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,920
So Moldova will be unable to pay the debt?

719
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,920
That's right.

720
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Then Virgin Island will be charged with

721
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
financial misconduct

722
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,920
and be fined for financial misconduct.

723
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,920
What if the court legally

724
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,920
allows the transfer of the money?

725
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,920
After the work is done,

726
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,640
the firm will have to take a

727
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,920
strike to make it difficult to collect the money.

728
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,920
This is how they will be able to

729
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,920
make money after that.

730
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,920
And at the end,

731
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
the money will be transferred to the

732
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,920
Malaysian law firm.

733
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,920
That's amazing.

734
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,920
So the money is in Malaysia?

735
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
I don't think so.

736
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,920
But Yoon Eunsung sent someone to the lab today.

737
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,920
So Yoon Eunsung doesn't know what happened next.

738
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,920
But how did you know all this?

739
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,920
There are a lot of people who are

740
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
dissatisfied with the company's situation.

741
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
They just can't reveal it.

742
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,920
People who have worked for 30 years

743
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,920
as new employees,

744
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,920
and Secretary Jang, who was

745
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,920
your grandfather's secretary for a long time,

746
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,920
refused to pay the salary several times,

747
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,920
and quit the company.

748
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,920
Secretary Jang,

749
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,920
you're here, right?

750
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,920
They told you all this

751
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,920
for us?

752
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,920
No, for the company

753
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,920
that they've been supporting for their whole lives.

754
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,920
They don't want to see the company

755
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,920
getting ruined anymore.

756
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,920
What about you?

757
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Why are you doing this?

758
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,920
For the company?

759
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,920
Yes, for the company.

760
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,920
Because I know how much you love this company.

761
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,920
The committee has reflected the opinions of the members.

762
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,920
Baek Haenu will be released from the company

763
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,920
without a secret mission.

764
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,920
Who are you?

765
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,920
We are the representatives of the committee

766
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,920
and the lawyers of Baek Haenu.

767
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,920
Look.

768
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,920
Why are there foreign lawyers in the internal audit?

769
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,920
According to the article 11 of the 12th,

770
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,920
1st, and 3rd,

771
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,920
and the 4th,

772
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,920
the parties can appoint lawyers

773
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,920
as their representatives.

774
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,920
We'll continue.

775
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,920
We'll decide on the reason

776
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,920
why we didn't mention it.

777
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,920
According to the report,

778
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,920
Baek Haenu was informed by the competition

779
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,920
that he was on the list of the top three.

780
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,920
He checked the records of his VIP customers

781
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
using his personal ID.

782
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,920
But?

783
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,920
When did he receive the report?

784
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,920
August 6th.

785
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
When did he access the VIP customers?

786
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,920
August 1st and 2nd.

787
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,920
It's two times a day.

788
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,920
That's strange.

789
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,920
Baek Haenu's personal ID was deleted

790
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,920
on July 28th.

791
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,920
Yes.

792
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,920
His ID, card, and laptop

793
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,920
and all the tech equipment were returned.

794
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,920
It could be his personal ID.

795
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,920
It could be someone else's.

796
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,920
Who else?

797
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,920
Someone else's ID.

798
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,920
Or someone else's ID.

799
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,920
Then the VIP customer list

800
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,920
of Queen's Department Store

801
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,920
could be accessed

802
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
only through the personal ID.

803
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,920
Is there a problem?

804
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
Yes.

805
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,920
To make certain information

806
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,920
known as a secret,

807
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,920
it must be managed as a secret.

808
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,920
If the customer or the download

809
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,920
is not restricted,

810
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,920
Queen's Department Store

811
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,920
will not manage the VIP list

812
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,920
as a secret.

813
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,920
The real problem is the environment.

814
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,920
Baek Haenu signed all the documents.

815
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,920
He asked the documents

816
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,920
from the documents

817
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
to the document inspector.

818
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,920
He received the result that

819
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,920
the size of the handwriting

820
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,920
and the details were exactly the same.

821
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,920
This is an unexplainable situation.

822
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,920
The documents were sent

823
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,920
by the inspector's request.

824
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,920
I can't trust you.

825
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,920
Then go to the prosecutor's office

826
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,920
and receive the documents.

827
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,920
For your information,

828
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,920
the seal of the seal

829
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,920
is not a fine.

830
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,920
It's a sentence.

831
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
It's a three-year sentence.

832
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,920
Our Lawyer Group

833
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,920
is looking forward to

834
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,920
your wise judgment.

835
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
It's me.

836
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,920
Yes.

837
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,920
Please get rid of Baek Haenu.

838
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
He's a big trouble to you

839
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,920
and to me too.

840
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,920
Boracay?

841
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,920
I'll send you there.

842
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,920
I'll pay you enough to cover it up.

843
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,920
Yes, sir.

844
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,920
I was careless last time

845
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,920
and made a mistake.

846
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,920
I'll get rid of him this time.

847
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,920
I'm sorry.

848
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,920
It's all a lie?

849
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,920
I'm glad you have a lot of lawyers.

850
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,920
You worked in various fields

851
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,920
and now you're trying to save your friend.

852
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,920
You're like Avengers.

853
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
I'm sorry,

854
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
but I didn't come to help.

855
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,920
I was just asking around.

856
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,920
Are you reuniting with your ex?

857
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,920
Are you reuniting with your ex?

858
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,920
I don't know.

859
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,920
You majored in business administration.

860
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
Yes.

861
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,920
You were good at

862
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,920
fish and charcoal.

863
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,920
When did I say that?

864
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,920
I'm just doing everything I can.

865
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,920
Check this out

866
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,920
and check the flow of the account.

867
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,920
Where did you find all this?

868
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
Hello.

869
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,920
Have some.

870
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,920
I'll take you to the office.

871
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,920
Thank you.

872
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,920
The car is on the second floor.

873
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Hello, Ms. Na.

874
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,920
Here you go.

875
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,920
Thank you.

876
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,920
Here you go.

877
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,920
I'm looking for the chairman's secret fund

878
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
to secure Yun Eunsung's share.

879
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,920
Secret fund? How much is it?

880
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
9,000 won.

881
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,920
I'm going to

882
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,920
take over that.

883
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,920
Ms. Na, you have to be careful of the four-way line.

884
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,920
Why do you keep getting in and out?

885
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,920
I think you got caught

886
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,920
by the red-handed man.

887
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,920
What?

888
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,920
You got me wrong.

889
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,920
The criminal

890
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,920
asked me to let him see

891
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,920
my father's face,

892
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,920
but I didn't get him.

893
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,920
I'm not good at that.

894
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,920
Fine. Go and get caught.

895
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,920
Ms. Na, I'm Grace.

896
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,920
I only get caught

897
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,920
when I have money and power.

898
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,920
The queen is Ms. Mo.

899
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,920
I'm not going to be the owner of the department store anymore.

900
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,920
I'll just be by the queen's side.

901
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:42,600
Like a

902
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,920
bride.

903
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,920
What bride?

904
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,920
Let's see.

905
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,920
Of course.

906
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,920
Amazing Grace will bring it to you.

907
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,920
Ms. Na, do you remember this room?

908
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,920
I came home because I heard that it's good for recovery

909
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,920
to be in a familiar place like this.

910
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,920
It's not a normal thing to get sick,

911
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,920
but I'll just let you go in the therapy room.

912
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,920
How about Frankincense for aroma?

913
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,920
Okay, then.

914
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,920
Thank you.

915
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,920
You should go out

916
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,920
so that our chairman can rest.

917
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,920
Fine.

918
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,920
Is he out of his mind?

919
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,920
Tell me.

920
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,920
Where is my money?

921
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,920
You can't take it.

922
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,920
I'm going to get it.

923
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,920
Are you out of your mind?

924
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,920
Tell me.

925
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,920
Where is my money?

926
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,920
You can't take it.

927
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,920
You can't take it.

928
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,920
Where did you hide it?

929
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,920
Keep an eye on her.

930
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,920
She might do something to my dad again.

931
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,920
Hang up.

932
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,920
My goodness.

933
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,920
My goodness.

934
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,920
My goodness.

935
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,920
She's lying down naked.

936
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,920
Look at them.

937
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,920
I'm getting some.

938
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,920
I'm getting some.

939
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,920
I'm getting some.

940
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,920
I'm getting some.

941
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,920
I'm getting some.

942
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,920
That's what I'm talking about.

943
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,920
What are you doing?

944
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,920
I was just...

945
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,920
I think you were looking at my house.

946
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,920
I wasn't looking.

947
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,920
I was just passing by.

948
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,920
I just saw it.

949
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,920
Do you want this?

950
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,920
What is it?

951
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,920
Where?

952
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,920
Where...

953
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,920
What is it?

954
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,920
Where?

955
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,920
Where...

956
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,920
What?

957
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,920
Right? It's a fruit of the tree.

958
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,920
It's good for women's health.

959
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,920
How much is it?

960
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,920
I'm not selling it.

961
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,920
I'm just giving it to you.

962
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,920
Why are you just...

963
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,920
It's pretty new.

964
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,920
What?

965
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,920
I've never seen anyone work with a fruit of a tree.

966
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,920
But I'll be sure to do it.

967
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,920
I'm just getting an OD.

968
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,920
I'm not getting your heart.

969
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,920
What's your MBTI?

970
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,920
What?

971
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,920
I think it's an ETG.

972
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,920
What?

973
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,920
You're not good at expressing your emotions.

974
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,920
You have a good memory of perfectionism.

975
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,920
You look cold, but you're very affectionate.

976
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
Men are Cha Taeyeon.

977
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,920
Women are Natalie Portman.

978
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,920
That's your type.

979
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,920
What a fool.

980
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,920
Why aren't you working?

981
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,920
Everyone's working at the farm at this hour.

982
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,920
I only work a little bit.

983
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,920
Why?

984
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,920
Life is too short to work a lot.

985
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,920
Just enough to make a living.

986
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,920
What's with the hand-pulled-up-kia?

987
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,920
Did you pick it up for me?

988
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,920
Natalie Portman?

989
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,920
My goodness.

990
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,920
Why are there so many?

991
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,920
It's a young pine tree.

992
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,920
They brought it for me because I had to get a new one.

993
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,920
They said to pick more.

994
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,920
They said it was too many to handle,

995
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,920
so they left it in the house.

996
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,920
Look at you.

997
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,920
You don't even think about selling it.

998
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,920
I was going to give it to them

999
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,920
after all the food I could get.

1000
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,920
What are we going to do with all these?

1001
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,920
What do you mean?

1002
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,920
Why are there so many?

1003
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,920
The Humanity is the Food of the World

1004
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,920
Someone said that when people are in need,

1005
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,920
they eat meat and milk.

1006
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,920
Yes, that's right.

1007
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,920
It's not just about the will of the people

1008
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,920
that makes you eat as much as you want.

1009
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,920
Your body is also very important.

1010
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,920
Just wipe your hands.

1011
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,920
Okay.

1012
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,920
And think about the important days in a person's life.

1013
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,920
It's all about meat.

1014
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,920
Look. It's your birthday, graduation, and your job.

1015
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,920
And on a day like today,

1016
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,920
everyone eats meat.

1017
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,920
I don't have the courage to eat meat.

1018
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,920
I used to go to a Chinese restaurant.

1019
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,920
Is sweet and sour pork a sashimi dish?

1020
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,920
Is mazogi a vegetable dish?

1021
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:48,920
I'll grill it.

1022
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,920
You?

1023
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,920
Who would grill meat and eat it on a plate?

1024
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,920
I'll grill it for all of my family when we eat meat.

1025
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,920
Don't let anyone get to you.

1026
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,920
Here.

1027
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,920
Haein, I heard that the blood pressure is important.

1028
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,920
The doctor said that you need to have the right blood pressure

1029
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,920
to go to Germany and get a new treatment.

1030
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,920
Yes.

1031
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,920
The blood pressure should be around 4,000 to 10,000 microliters.

1032
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,920
Then what was the blood pressure when you went to Germany?

1033
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,920
1,500.

1034
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
That's a lot.

1035
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,920
Why isn't it coming out?

1036
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,920
When I measured last week, it went up a lot,

1037
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,920
so it was around 3,000.

1038
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,920
Good job.

1039
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,920
It's a double.

1040
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,920
You're amazing.

1041
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:39,920
You're even answering.

1042
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,920
There's still more than 1,000 left.

1043
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,920
There's not much left.

1044
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,920
Try to increase the numbers.

1045
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,920
It's not like you're trying hard to get the SATs.

1046
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,920
Then what did you do?

1047
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,920
You got shot and what else?

1048
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,920
I looked into it.

1049
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,920
It's all about stamina and immune system.

1050
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,920
It's important to eat vitamins and high-protein

1051
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,920
and rest well.

1052
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,920
Then high-protein should be eaten with a lot of meat.

1053
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:05,920
Like beans.

1054
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,920
I'm going to make a diet.

1055
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,920
Turn it upside down.

1056
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,920
It's burnt. What should I do?

1057
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,920
You can just cut it.

1058
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,920
Can't you just give me scissors?

1059
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,920
No. I'll do it.

1060
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,920
What else do you like?

1061
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,920
Bananas and nuts.

1062
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,920
This is it.

1063
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,920
Goodness.

1064
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,920
It's really good.

1065
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,920
Here.

1066
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,920
It's cold.

1067
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,920
It's cold.

1068
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,920
It's cold.

1069
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,920
This is it.

1070
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,920
Look at this.

1071
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,920
You should eat a lot of protein.

1072
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,920
It's good.

1073
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,920
Eat up.

1074
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,920
Eat up.

1075
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,920
I'm done.

1076
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,920
This is really good.

1077
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,920
This is better.

1078
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,920
Yes?

1079
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,920
This doesn't work.

1080
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,920
It doesn't work?

1081
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,920
I can just press it down.

1082
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,920
You're good, but I can't do that.

1083
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,920
Do I have to buy a new one?

1084
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,920
Why?

1085
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,920
You're always uncomfortable.

1086
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,920
You can do it for me every time.

1087
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,920
You're good at it.

1088
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,920
I'm going to buy a new one.

1089
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,920
You're good.

1090
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:00,920
I think I'm getting better at it.

1091
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,920
You're right.

1092
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,920
It's pretty tight.

1093
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,920
You must have improved.

1094
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:11,920
Keep doing this.

1095
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,920
Of course. It's not hard.

1096
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,920
What else?

1097
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,920
Tell me what else I can do for you.

1098
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,920
I'll do it for you.

1099
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:25,920
Just dry your hair with a broken hairdryer.

1100
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,920
Barely?

1101
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,920
It's barely.

1102
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,920
You have to be by my side every day to do this.

1103
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:38,920
I don't think I should be more greedy now.

1104
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,920
No, be greedy.

1105
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,920
Why not?

1106
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,920
Don't try too hard to do well in our company.

1107
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,920
I didn't ask you to do better when I said I loved you.

1108
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,920
I just said that's how I feel.

1109
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:58,920
I feel the same way.

1110
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:04,920
I want to do better if I can.

1111
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:12,920
My heart.

1112
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:20,920
I saw your face yesterday and thought, who is it?

1113
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,920
I couldn't remember my name, so I went out for a while.

1114
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,920
I forgot to go back to the hospital room and stood there for a long time.

1115
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,920
When the doctor first explained about the disease,

1116
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,920
I was in a memory loss, a sense loss, and language loss.

1117
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,920
I was in a bad mood.

1118
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:47,920
That's what other people say, and I'm different.

1119
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,920
But it's exactly in that order now.

1120
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,920
So it's terrible to think about the next order.

1121
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:04,920
I don't want to be with you until the next one.

1122
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,920
What do you mean?

1123
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,920
I'm happy right now.

1124
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:19,920
When I get worse later, I want you to be by my side.

1125
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:29,920
That's what I want.

1126
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,920
What?

1127
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,920
When did you leave?

1128
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:46,920
What happened?

1129
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:56,920
It's a doorbell.

1130
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:17,920
Drink it.

1131
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,920
It's bitter.

1132
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:31,920
It's more bitter than my life.

1133
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,920
Master, please let me go.

1134
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,920
Master?

1135
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,920
I'm going to learn boxing from you.

1136
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:49,920
I couldn't even hit Yoon Eun-sung in front of me last time, and I fell so badly.

1137
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,920
That's possible, but if you start working out with a bang, you'll go out of your joints and suffer for the rest of your life.

1138
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,920
My joints?

1139
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,920
You can go out.

1140
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,920
I'm going to lose my mind if I stay like this.

1141
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:05,920
There's a time when I have to protect my people, but I can't do anything?

1142
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:13,920
I don't even want to imagine it.

1143
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,920
Okay, I'll teach you.

1144
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,920
Sit down.

1145
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,920
But since it's a property, there's a limit to learning several things.

1146
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,920
Let's master just one thing.

1147
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,920
What is that?

1148
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,920
A good fighter.

1149
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:39,920
Just one hit.

1150
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,920
There are two key techniques.

1151
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,920
Su-cheol, just hit me once.

1152
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:52,920
Really?

1153
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,920
Is that a two-fist?

1154
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,920
No, this is the first technique.

1155
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,920
Excessive reaction.

1156
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,920
The opponent.

1157
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:02,920
Oh, this guy is nothing.

1158
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,920
Oh, I'm the winner this time.

1159
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,920
Oh, my fist is no joke.

1160
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,920
So that it can be a two-line.

1161
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:15,920
Let's try it.

1162
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,920
You're good.

1163
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:17,920
It really hurt.

1164
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:18,920
I'm sorry.

1165
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:19,920
Are you okay?

1166
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,920
But why are you doing this?

1167
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,920
This is how you let go.

1168
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,920
Su-cheol waits for the moment when the opponent lets go and then he takes a decisive hit.

1169
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,920
You've been getting hit until then?

1170
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,920
That's the second technique.

1171
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:33,920
A few.

1172
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,920
Basic physical strength is essential to raise a few.

1173
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:44,920
But is that possible?

1174
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,920
My mentor, Muhammad Ali, said,

1175
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,920
Impossible?

1176
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,920
That's not true.

1177
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:57,920
It's just one opinion.

1178
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,920
Su-cheol, you can do it.

1179
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,920
Get some money now and become a champion for your life.

1180
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,920
Is this what Ali said?

1181
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,920
I mixed my opinion.

1182
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,920
Now, let's practice.

1183
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:21,920
Here.

1184
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,920
Oh, my God.

1185
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:27,920
You were healing in such a nice place with such a nice view.

1186
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,920
You're talking like a healing.

1187
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,920
Where is this place?

1188
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,920
Mother, I called you.

1189
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,920
Really?

1190
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:40,920
I haven't been able to tell you anything about your debt.

1191
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,920
9 billion won?

1192
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,920
Is that in Malaysia?

1193
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,920
No, I think it's in Korea.

1194
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:46,920
In Korea?

1195
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,920
Yes, it's currently in Korea through the Hong Kong Paper Company.

1196
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,920
The paper company set up in Hong Kong has paid for the investment of five investment companies in Korea.

1197
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,920
The paper company has been closed down since then.

1198
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,920
If it's closed down, the companies in Korea don't have to pay back the money.

1199
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,920
Then the owner of the companies is your father?

1200
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,920
Your father passed away recently.

1201
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,920
He passed away.

1202
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,920
What?

1203
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,920
Then did he eat all of that?

1204
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,920
That's not it.

1205
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:21,920
He's still looking for it.

1206
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,920
Tell me.

1207
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,920
Where's my money?

1208
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,920
How did you hide the money you transferred to my name?

1209
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,920
But can I talk about this in a place where I can?

1210
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,920
Trust me.

1211
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,920
I'm just an ordinary person.

1212
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,920
You know Lee Woong-pyoong in the past, right?

1213
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,920
I'm just a fighter and I'm in the land of freedom.

1214
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,920
Well, that's a secret.

1215
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,920
Let's take a look at a fighter.

1216
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,920
What is it?

1217
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,920
I know someone who's in the real estate industry.

1218
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,920
He was saying something strange.

1219
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,920
The director of Queens Gallery, Jin, borrowed a 5,000-square-foot water bowl in the outskirts of Gyeonggi-do.

1220
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,920
What kind of drama set does he have to build?

1221
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,920
Why do you need such a big water bowl?

1222
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,920
I guess he paid for it while he was walking.

1223
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:00,920
Bingo.

1224
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,460
He took all the postcards

1225
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,860
that came under Chairman Lee's name.

1226
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:10,860
Okay.

1227
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,760
I should've gone in alone.

1228
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,060
I feel like I'm being pushed back too much.

1229
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,900
How can Grace trust you

1230
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,400
and leave the cat with the fish?

1231
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,860
Everyone knows about this on the news.

1232
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,100
What if they find out?

1233
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,520
You came to hide from me.

1234
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,620
We'll take care of it ourselves,

1235
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,820
so you should go.

1236
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,820
I feel so bad for you.

1237
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,320
We're infiltrating the site.

1238
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,720
Have you all done it? Fake?

1239
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,520
No, we haven't.

1240
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,920
I've always been a fake.

1241
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,820
You're leaving me behind in this big operation?

1242
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:47,620
Here, give me your hand.

1243
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,520
I'm the real estate agent.

1244
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,020
You're the real estate agent

1245
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,520
who needs a big warehouse like this.

1246
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,220
I'll take care of everything,

1247
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,620
so don't say anything else, okay?

1248
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,720
I'm going in.

1249
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:07,020
There's no place for a gunfight here.

1250
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:10,420
But why are you sick?

1251
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,620
He's a golf...

1252
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:21,220
This is the golf-use agent.

1253
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,820
He's a clothes salesman at Dongdaemun.

1254
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,720
He's from China.

1255
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,820
He understands Korean,

1256
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,320
but he can't speak Chinese.

1257
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,520
Boss, I'm sorry.

1258
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:37,120
I don't know Chinese.

1259
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,220
I guess the re-housing machine is working.

1260
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,320
You know right away.

1261
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,120
The people who used to rent this place

1262
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,720
were art collectors.

1263
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,720
I know some art, too.

1264
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,020
Who are the artists?

1265
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,320
They're not famous artists. They're all rookies.

1266
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,020
I heard they're really popular these days.

1267
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,620
They're 20 to 30 times more expensive.

1268
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:02,320
This place is nice.

1269
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,120
I'm sure they're really good.

1270
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,420
You're asking if we can see the works?

1271
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,320
Of course.

1272
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,120
I'm sure they're really good.

1273
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,720
The door is open.

1274
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,920
We're going inside, so go to the office.

1275
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,920
Okay.

1276
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,020
What?

1277
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,520
This is a business trip.

1278
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,220
I'll give you the business trip fee.

1279
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,620
But I can't let you get caught

1280
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,120
doing this here.

1281
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,420
What?

1282
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:59,420
You shouldn't keep your works like this.

1283
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:01,420
But this is a painting by artists

1284
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:02,720
who have been painting for decades?

1285
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,620
Yes, I think so.

1286
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:05,820
I don't think it's a good work

1287
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,820
for a young artist.

1288
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,920
It looks like a money laundry using a painting.

1289
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:16,920
This is the laundry room.

1290
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,420
You bought the paintings of the rookies

1291
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,720
with the money you got from Hong Kong?

1292
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,620
About 10 to 20 times.

1293
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,220
Then I think they're going to pay back

1294
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,720
more than 90% of the money they paid in the season

1295
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,820
with cash.

1296
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,820
That's a lot of money.

1297
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:32,020
Where is that money?

1298
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:43,220
We have to go now.

1299
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,520
We don't have time.

1300
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,820
This is crazy.

1301
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:47,320
There's too much money.

1302
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,120
I'll call you as soon as I ask

1303
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,620
about our customers' doctors.

1304
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:56,620
Okay.

1305
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:14,920
What? Is it broken?

1306
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,920
You can't get hit by the rain.

1307
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,220
Stay here for a while.

1308
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,320
I'll go get it.

1309
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,220
Okay.

1310
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:26,020
Eun-ji, you're here already?

1311
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:28,720
What are you doing?

1312
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,720
Get up.

1313
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,120
I'm a little dizzy.

1314
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,820
I'm hungry too.

1315
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,920
Do you want to eat something delicious and go home?

1316
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,420
Let's do that.

1317
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,920
Did I lose for a long time?

1318
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,620
No, I'm at work.

1319
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,220
Ha-in.

1320
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:24,220
What?

1321
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:25,220
Hold on tight.

1322
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,420
Why?

1323
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,220
Is someone else following me?

1324
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:31,220
Don't worry. I'll turn around.

1325
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,120
Eun-ji.

1326
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,120
Eun-ji.

1327
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,120
Eun-ji.

1328
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,120
Eun-ji.

1329
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,120
Eun-ji.

1330
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,120
Eun-ji.

1331
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,120
Eun-ji.

1332
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,120
Eun-ji.

1333
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,120
Eun-ji.

1334
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,120
Eun-ji.

1335
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,120
Eun-ji.

1336
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,120
Eun-ji.

1337
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,120
Eun-ji.

1338
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,120
Eun-ji.

1339
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,120
Eun-ji.

1340
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,120
Eun-ji.

1341
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,120
Eun-ji.

1342
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,120
Eun-ji.

1343
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,120
Eun-ji.

1344
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,120
Eun-ji.

1345
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,120
Eun-ji.

1346
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,120
Eun-ji.

1347
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,120
Eun-ji.

1348
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,120
Eun-ji.

1349
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,120
Eun-ji.

1350
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,120
Eun-ji.

1351
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,120
Eun-ji.

1352
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,120
Eun-ji.

1353
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,120
Eun-ji.

1354
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,120
Eun-ji.

1355
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,120
Eun-ji.

1356
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,120
Eun-ji.

1357
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,120
Eun-ji.

1358
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,120
Eun-ji.

1359
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,120
Eun-ji.

1360
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,120
Eun-ji.

1361
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,120
Eun-ji.

1362
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,120
Eun-ji.

1363
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,120
Eun-ji.

1364
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,120
Eun-ji.

1365
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,120
Eun-ji.

1366
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,120
Eun-ji.

1367
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,120
Eun-ji.

1368
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,120
Eun-ji.

1369
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,120
Eun-ji.

1370
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,120
Eun-ji.

1371
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,120
Eun-ji.

1372
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,120
Eun-ji.

1373
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,120
Eun-ji.

1374
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,120
Eun-ji.

1375
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,120
Eun-ji.

1376
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,120
Eun-ji.

1377
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,120
Eun-ji.

1378
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,120
Eun-ji.

1379
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,120
Eun-ji.

1380
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,120
Eun-ji.

1381
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,120
Eun-ji.

1382
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,120
Eun-ji.

1383
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,120
Are you okay now?

1384
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,320
Should I call the police?

1385
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:00,820
Wait.

1386
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:01,920
I should.

1387
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,320
You said you were attacked last night.

1388
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:37,120
I'm looking at you in the fog one night.

1389
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,320
I'm looking at you in the fog one night.

1390
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:51,520
I remember the time that shined on that side.

1391
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,120
I held your hand tight.

1392
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:00,920
I wish I could have done the same.

1393
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:07,920
I was born to love you, to love you in all my heart.

1394
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:16,920
My heart for you won't stop.

1395
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,620
Still watching all the time.

1396
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:29,620
It's filled with longing in my room.

1397
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,620
I'm waiting for you.

1398
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:35,020
Need you all the time.

1399
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:39,020
I can't say anything.

1400
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:42,420
I'm wandering in time.

1401
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:43,820
Hyein!

1402
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:53,820
I hate myself.

1403
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:03,620
The comments are so...

1404
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:05,620
I think Yoon Eun-sung is investigating the situation

1405
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:07,620
where he took over the company's money before he got divorced.

1406
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,620
He's spreading weird articles.

1407
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:10,620
Don't worry about it.

1408
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:12,620
How can I not worry about it?

1409
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:13,820
Isn't the ex-husband of Hong Hyein

1410
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:16,220
a fraud who's after money and getting married?

1411
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:18,620
That's why handsome guys are worth their faces.

1412
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:20,620
What's wrong with you?

1413
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,020
Let's sue him.

1414
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:23,020
I said no.

1415
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:24,020
Let's go.

1416
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,020
Wait, there's a bad comment from Mr. Hong.

1417
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:28,420
He's been divorced for so long,

1418
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,620
and he's been a bit too much.

1419
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,420
You're talking nonsense.

1420
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,620
Isn't it a lie that he's dying?

1421
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,220
This is too much.

1422
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,220
What's his ID?

1423
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,220
Hey, take a screenshot.

1424
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,220
This is a PDF.

1425
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,220
sue him right away.

1426
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,620
For your information, there's no agreement.

1427
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:46,020
What's wrong with you?

1428
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,020
I'm scared.

1429
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,220
Let's just forget about it.

1430
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:14,220
I smile when I see you

1431
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:18,620
I spend my whole day and day

1432
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:23,220
I think of you as I draw you

1433
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:30,420
I think I'll soon find out where the emergency fund is.

1434
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,220
There! There!

1435
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:34,020
Get a grip.

1436
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:36,420
We now have a movie-like angel.

1437
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:38,620
You're so sweet.

1438
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:40,020
Where is it?

1439
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:42,820
Hey!

1440
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,020
Hey!

1441
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,620
I'll have to go check it out.

1442
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,020
I'm not sure about anything now.

1443
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:50,820
I was the one who liked you first.

1444
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,020
Do you know where it is?

1445
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,420
Is it taken away?

1446
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,420
Is this reality, not a dream?
