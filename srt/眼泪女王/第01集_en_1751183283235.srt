1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,980
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,400
EPISODE 1

3
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,050
Everyone said
it was the wedding of the century.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,890
The heiress to Korea's
most powerful conglomerate

5
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,560
married a new recruit.

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,360
It's been three years already,

7
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,490
but it seems like only yesterday.

8
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,870
People ask me how it feels
to become a part

9
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,040
of a conglomerate

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,750
and live with a queen.

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
I'm not sure.

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,210
Would you believe me if I said this?

13
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,420
I'm just

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,800
a lucky man

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,090
who married

16
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,630
the love of my life.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,260
I know that people gossiped about

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,680
how Baek Hyun-woo married me

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,890
solely because of my family

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,060
and our wealth.

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,650
Those rumors only began
because I chose not to reveal my face

22
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,030
for various reasons.

23
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,280
I guess this will put an end
to those rumors

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,450
since I'm finally revealing my face.

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Our married life

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,340
is nothing out of the ordinary.

27
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,180
I wake up next to her.

28
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,140
We have breakfast together.

29
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,640
We go to work together as well.

30
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,480
How does it feel

31
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,360
to be together all day and night?

32
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,030
It makes me happy.

33
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,120
I'm sure some of you already know.

34
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,080
After returning from my studies abroad
five years ago,

35
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,870
I joined Queens Department Store,
which my father owned at the time,

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,830
as an intern.

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,250
You could say I was working undercover.

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,060
Women know these things.

39
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,690
"I see."

40
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,280
"This guy likes me."

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,610
"That's why he's flirting with me."

42
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,450
No.

43
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,740
That wasn't the case.

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,530
She kept kicking the photocopier.

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,710
-So I was worried.
-What's wrong?

46
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,830
About the photocopier.

47
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,710
What's wrong?

48
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,970
But after helping her a few times,

49
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,180
I started worrying about her.

50
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,680
When sending a fax…

51
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,140
At the time, people were gossiping
about how obnoxious

52
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,890
the new intern was.

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,310
So I was sure she'd get fired soon.

54
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,700
You need to stop, Ms. Hong.

55
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,570
I've done my fair share of part-time jobs.

56
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,450
You're going to get yourself fired.

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,700
I don't care.

58
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,250
Right. You'll just find another job.

59
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,080
But…

60
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,670
you'll get fired there too.
Do you want to bet on it?

61
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
You know what?

62
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,090
My heart jumps every time
your superior scolds you.

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,970
You get scolded every single day.

64
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
Why does it jump?

65
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,360
-What?
-Why does your heart jump

66
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,450
when I'm the one who's getting scolded?

67
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,450
Why?

68
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,870
Take your time

69
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,040
and think about that.

70
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,230
You can come right now.

71
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,820
Don't you have an umbrella?

72
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,860
No, I don't but…

73
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
Take mine.

74
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,540
You always need help, and…

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
it bothers me.

76
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
What is this?

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,840
I made your heart jump,
and now I bother you?

78
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,390
Ms. Hong.

79
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,770
Listen carefully.

80
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,730
I didn't tell you this
in case it'd make you feel uncomfortable.

81
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
But you know,

82
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,860
I went to Seoul National University.

83
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,200
And law school at that.

84
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,450
My parents live down south,

85
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,870
but the community respects our family.

86
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,540
For example, we own over 30 cows.

87
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,670
Another calf was born
a couple of days ago,

88
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,340
so we have almost 35 now.

89
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,670
As for my studio apartment,

90
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,880
I signed a two-year lease

91
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,430
instead of paying monthly rent.

92
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,970
It just means
I have a good chunk of money on the side.

93
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,140
What are you getting at?

94
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Even if

95
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,440
you get fired and can't find a new job,

96
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,900
I can take care of you.

97
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
That's what I mean.

98
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,450
I'll be honest.
I've always wanted my future wife to work.

99
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,660
But if it's you,

100
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,450
I can try being the sole breadwinner.

101
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,910
I mean, don't feel pressured.

102
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,250
It's just that

103
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
I like you.

104
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
So…

105
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,090
what do you say?

106
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,320
You don't have to answer me today.

107
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,740
Don't get wet.

108
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,240
-I--
-I'm okay.

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Take it.

110
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,080
-Mr. Baek--
-I'm really okay.

111
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,620
But I--

112
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,680
I have…

113
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,840
a driver.

114
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,830
Hilarious, right?

115
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,670
It really is.

116
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,260
Anyway,

117
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,800
he's been a romantic ever since.

118
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,970
That's how our love story began.

119
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
But he was shocked
after finding out who my family was.

120
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,270
He handed in his resignation letter

121
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,100
and ghosted me.

122
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,060
So…

123
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,490
Baek Hyun-woo, come out.

124
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,080
Are you going to leave me standing here?

125
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,440
She looked like an angel sent from heaven.

126
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,780
-That's how she looked back then.
-But not anymore?

127
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,990
Of course, she's still an angel.

128
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,790
I told you many times

129
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,960
that…

130
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,080
I'm happy.

131
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,420
Well…

132
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,710
She and I

133
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,760
have a happy married life.

134
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,050
We're still very much in love.

135
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,560
Baek Hyun-woo is getting a divorce.

136
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,180
Seriously?

137
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,810
-It's a secret.
-Of course. We're colleagues after all.

138
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,060
Anyway, he'd like one of us
to represent him.

139
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,900
Yes, of course.

140
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,280
You're the number-one divorce attorney
in this country.

141
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,490
You should do it, Yang-gi.

142
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,690
I'd…

143
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,450
love to help him. Really.

144
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,780
But I'm already juggling so many cases.

145
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,240
All right then.

146
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,410
Attorney Choi Cheol-seung
boasts a 90% win rate.

147
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,330
Can you help him?

148
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,080
I'll secretly help you out.

149
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,500
Why secretly? Do it openly.

150
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,210
Afraid of getting on Queens' bad side

151
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,670
and losing your job, you sly scumbag?

152
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,340
That's right.

153
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,100
You're right. That's why.

154
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,640
I'd be crazy to take that job.

155
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,020
Hyun-woo's aunt-in-law
got divorced three times.

156
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,980
You all know the fates
of her ex-husbands' attorneys.

157
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,650
They were all fired.

158
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,230
Hyun-woo made a mistake.
Why would he put us in a pickle like this?

159
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,320
-Exactly.
-Let's be honest.

160
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,530
He was the smartest one out of us.
Always the top of our classes.

161
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,610
So why can't he just be

162
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,120
-his own divorce attorney?
-Right.

163
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
-That'd be better.
-I bet he'll excel.

164
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,330
By the way, why does he want a divorce?

165
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,290
Exactly. He's living the dream life
of all Korean men.

166
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,920
His wife is Hong Hae-in,
the heiress of Queens Group.

167
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,300
So why?

168
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,340
She's a lunatic.

169
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,340
A lunatic?

170
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,400
Right. About that
One Trillion Club group chat…

171
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,730
Yes. Why haven't they invited me?

172
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,780
Our sales are only at 880 billion won so--

173
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,200
That's not a big gap.

174
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,410
-We're only about 100 billion won short.
-I know.

175
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,570
I asked them to just round it up

176
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,200
and be more flexible.

177
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,540
But it was still a hard no.

178
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,950
Why are they so fussy?

179
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,120
By the way, I heard

180
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,830
that Royal Department Store
is bragging about how their CEO

181
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,880
will join the One Trillion Club
by the end of the year.

182
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,380
They're also boasting
that they're going to set up Hercyna

183
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,220
on the first floor next to the fountain.

184
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,430
They must be insane.

185
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,470
Tell me about it.
Department stores in Korea

186
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,510
are divided into those that have Hercyna
and those that don't.

187
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,480
And Hercyna only wants to work
with those who are in that club.

188
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,650
It's about time

189
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,020
we cut off all the brands

190
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,730
that hinder our sales.

191
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
This is our periodical evaluation chart.

192
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,320
At the bottom,

193
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,580
we have a list of brands
in the bottom 20% of sales.

194
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,290
How many of them can we shut down?

195
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,620
Those underlined in red
were in the bottom 20%

196
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,750
at least twice.

197
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,500
In principle, they should be shut down.
However…

198
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,800
"However"?

199
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,720
Why is there a "however"?

200
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,430
We should shut them down if we can.

201
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,680
We did ask our Legal Team for advice.

202
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,270
And they said no.

203
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,310
Who said that?

204
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,400
Director Baek Hyun-woo.

205
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,580
Mr. Yu, please wrap up
the contract after confirming

206
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,660
the commission fee.

207
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,040
Yes, sir. Also…

208
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,540
The second-floor manager
submitted a report.

209
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,080
One of our customers fell
and injured herself

210
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,880
while walking in 12 cm heels.

211
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,590
Sir, the CEO would like to see you.

212
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,470
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

213
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,550
Well…

214
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,800
She wants to see you immediately.
She's very upset.

215
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Mr. Baek.

216
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,090
Why can't we shut down brands
that aren't profitable?

217
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,180
Many of the brands
invested 500 million in equipment.

218
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,270
We can't just kick them out.

219
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,520
File an eviction suit then.

220
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,100
It's impossible to win.

221
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,100
The law has been revised many times
to prevent large distributors

222
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,520
from abusing their power.

223
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,650
Are you saying

224
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,900
that I'm on a power trip?

225
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,570
Is that it?

226
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,870
-That's not what I--
-Is this a nonprofit organization?

227
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,490
Are we volunteers?

228
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,120
Is it right to let them be
when we're not getting

229
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,750
our money's worth
for those expensive spots?

230
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,090
The sales division
has deliberately excluded

231
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,670
brands with low performance scores

232
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,840
from customer-invitation events
and discounts to hinder additional sales.

233
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,220
Those brands could complain
to the media or sue us.

234
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,640
Then we'd really be in trouble.

235
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,600
I believe a more favorable solution
would be to help

236
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,690
improve their sales.

237
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,190
Mr. Baek.

238
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,230
Did I ask for your advice?

239
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,490
I am telling you to shut them down.

240
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,030
If they don't listen,
file a lawsuit and win.

241
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,490
I believe that's your team's job.

242
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yes, ma'am.

243
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,420
This meeting's over.

244
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,780
Are you eager to let others know
that we don't get along?

245
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,830
Our relationship
has nothing to do with this.

246
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,780
I see.

247
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,540
Is that why you warned the store manager
that I wanted to fire

248
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,830
about the violations beforehand
to help him stay afloat?

249
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,630
That manager has been with us
since the beginning.

250
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,340
And he's still just as hardworking.

251
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,090
Fine. You're awfully kind
and caring to others.

252
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,640
Do you want to be a hero or something?

253
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,270
Quit playing the martyr
and treat those close to you better.

254
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,890
Those close to me?

255
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,980
As in you?

256
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,690
What?

257
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,780
Do you really think

258
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,610
we're close?

259
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,910
I need to talk to you.

260
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,240
Come to the lounge in an hour.

261
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,790
Fine.

262
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,170
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

263
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,470
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY?
I'M HERE.

264
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,100
WHERE ARE YOU?
FORGET IT. I'M LEAVING.

265
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,190
Come to the family room.

266
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,020
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

267
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,210
What took you so long?

268
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,750
I texted him late.

269
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,080
You don't need to remind him.

270
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,040
He knows we have a family meeting.

271
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,550
What kind of interview was it?

273
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,340
It was the culture section
of Hanyang Economic Daily.

274
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,180
It's a heartwarming interview
where CEOs and politicians

275
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,890
show their houses and families.

276
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,640
They were both interviewed.

277
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,810
Why show the house?
They're not celebrities.

278
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,270
We had to do something about the tabloids.

279
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,940
I agree. People gossiped about
how they were separated last year.

280
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,950
It's all because
they see you arguing at work.

281
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,990
-You argued?
-Yes, today.

282
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,240
It wasn't a simple argument.

283
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,830
It was quite uncomfortable
for those in the meeting room.

284
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,170
Right, Hyun-woo.
About the Fair Trade Commission…

285
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,090
They keep calling us in
for trivial matters.

286
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,300
Could you take care of that?

287
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,380
You should ask
the Legal Team of Queens Mart.

288
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,720
They're just too dense.

289
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,760
But you're quick-thinking and smart.

290
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,260
And the higher-ups
at the Fair Trade Commission love you.

291
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,930
We have our own jurisdictions--

292
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,940
Why can't you just say you'll do it?

293
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,230
And you two.

294
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,440
I want you to have a baby.

295
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,030
People need to stop gossiping.

296
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,530
Have you contacted Dr. Joo?

297
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,070
Yes, I booked an appointment.

298
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,740
She'll get the prenatal checkup,

299
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,740
then begin the procedure right away.

300
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,540
As for Hyun-woo, after the baby is born,

301
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,960
you'll go to Boston

302
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,080
within the next two years to get an MBA.

303
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,830
I told you this already.

304
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,710
I'm not interested in getting a degree.

305
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,880
And I also said

306
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,630
that it wasn't up to you.

307
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,470
They don't owe us a grandkid,
so stop pressuring him.

308
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,800
Drink your tea, Hyun-woo.

309
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,850
But you see,

310
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,520
I'd prefer to meet Su-bin in May.

311
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,530
Who is Su-bin?

312
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,740
Who do you think?
It's my future granddaughter.

313
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,370
Her name means "remarkably shining."

314
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,370
Not bad, right? Hong Su-bin.

315
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
I see.

316
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Will she be Hong Su-bin

317
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,170
instead of Baek Su-bin?

318
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,330
What's wrong?

319
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,880
Do you not want her
to have her mom's surname?

320
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,050
We don't need
to follow the patriarchal system.

321
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,390
I think it's quite old-fashioned
to use the father's surname.

322
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,720
But when I asked you about giving
Geon-u his mom's surname,

323
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,770
you said it was nonsense.

324
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,690
This is different.

325
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,940
Isn't it the same? No?

326
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,220
We need to talk.

327
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,310
We're having a baby
despite everything that's going on?

328
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,850
And I'll be going abroad alone?

329
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,230
What's the matter?

330
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,440
Isn't that a good thing?

331
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,980
Don't tell me you want me to come.

332
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,240
Of course not.

333
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,860
Exactly.

334
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,660
Then do your part and go abroad.

335
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,200
We'll have others raise our baby anyway.

336
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,990
It's convenient and nice.
What's the issue?

337
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
"Nice"?

338
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,120
Are you happy about this?

339
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,210
Seriously?

340
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,880
Do you really want a baby?

341
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,460
If it's needed.

342
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,600
Yes?

343
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,350
Did you tell them I'd like to sign off
before they publish the article?

344
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,640
Of course.

345
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,730
Also…

346
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,650
Tell them to introduce
Director Baek properly.

347
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,110
Don't forget to mention
that he studied law at SNU.

348
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,860
What?

349
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,240
Stop doing these interviews.
I'm done with them.

350
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,410
Do them alone if you must.

351
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,790
How can I
when they're about married couples?

352
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,250
You can tell them all about me.

353
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,880
Tell them how we're so in love

354
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,630
and happily married.

355
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,050
Tell them everything.

356
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,130
It's all a lie anyway.

357
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,150
Hey.

358
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,770
I want the photos first.

359
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,440
I'll pick the one they'll use.

360
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,500
Why do they publish useless articles?

361
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,670
Why didn't they mention

362
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,010
how I anonymously donated 200 million won?

363
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,220
Look.

364
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,590
I know I did it anonymously

365
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,260
because I didn't want anyone to know,
but everyone should know.

366
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,890
Isn't that what the PR Team is for?

367
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,270
I'm so frustrated.

368
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,400
What was that for?

369
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,070
What?

370
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,320
What do you want?

371
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,450
What is it?

372
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,330
Tell me from there.

373
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,250
Use your words.

374
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,330
Gosh.

375
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,630
Gosh.

376
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,210
-Soo-cheol.
-What?

377
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,210
Don't avoid me.

378
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,010
Or you'll get

379
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,130
a black eye and start bawling again.

380
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,010
Wait--

381
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,180
Are you crazy?

382
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,930
Why are you hitting me?

383
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,810
Is Hyun-woo your friend
or someone younger than you?

384
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,020
"Quick-thinking"?

385
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,900
How dare you?

386
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,280
Disrespect my husband again,

387
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,320
and I'll kill you.

388
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,120
-Answer me.
-Fine. I get it.

389
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,040
That crazy witch.

390
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,000
Why get mad at me
when she bullies Hyun-woo all the time?

391
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,420
She's seriously a psychopath!

392
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,220
I wasn't talking about you.

393
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,400
Everyone wants you
to reconsider this divorce

394
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,360
and just live with her.

395
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,410
They wanted me to tell you that.
Are you crying?

396
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,540
What? Are you already drunk?

397
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,000
What is this?
You're making my heart flutter.

398
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,130
Am I?

399
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,800
Apparently, I'm cute when I'm drunk.

400
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,970
-She said that was my special move.
-Who said?

401
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,680
Hae-in said that.

402
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,470
She said

403
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
I was cute.

404
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,520
Are you bragging?

405
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,140
Why was I like that?

406
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,560
Why was I cute?

407
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,980
Why did I use my special move
and look cute?

408
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,190
Why did I make her heart flutter?

409
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,320
And as a result,

410
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,320
I ruined

411
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,160
my own life.

412
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,030
We wouldn't have gotten married
had I not been so cute.

413
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,160
This lunatic is totally wasted.

414
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,500
Hey, get up.

415
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,790
My wife has been calling me,
asking me to buy diapers for our baby.

416
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,550
No, I'm not going home.

417
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,630
Why would I?

418
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,760
Why won't you go home?

419
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,800
I'm drunk!

420
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,640
I'm too cute when I'm drunk!

421
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,220
I've always been known as the cute son
of the pear tree house in Yongdu-ri.

422
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,270
It's in my nature.

423
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,520
I was born like this.

424
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,270
What could I have done?

425
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,360
So you're not going home?

426
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,030
Just leave me here.

427
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,910
I'll be taken home safe and sound.

428
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,160
By whom?

429
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,250
They'll prevent all scandals.

430
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,760
No way.

431
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,880
Want to see?

432
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,270
No way.

433
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,440
Every time…

434
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,440
I tear leaves off a branch

435
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,410
to see if I should get a divorce or not…

436
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,860
You did that?

437
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,080
I always end up with a "no."

438
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,830
Every single damn time.

439
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,200
So it's your fate.

440
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,330
There's no one.

441
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,370
No one in this world

442
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,710
is on my side.

443
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,550
There's not a single leaf
that's on my side.

444
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,720
I don't need anyone on my side.
I just want to own a building.

445
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,100
That building will be on my side forever.

446
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,430
My wife's mood is like a roller coaster.

447
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,680
She'd be smiling in the morning
then raging at night.

448
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,440
Is it my fault we're out of diapers?
Why'd she get mad at me?

449
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,190
I just need a building.

450
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,980
Concrete buildings don't change.

451
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,530
They don't nag or get mad.

452
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,530
Go.

453
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,410
Go get your diapers.

454
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,450
Just leave.

455
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,010
Who said

456
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,800
Love

457
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:24,730
Was beautiful?

458
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,780
Just leave already.

459
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,650
You can go home now.

460
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,700
You're gonna keep watching me cry?

461
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,660
I'm just crying on my way home!

462
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,540
Why are you going that way?

463
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,900
Put me to sleep

464
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:19,400
With your fair hands

465
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,710
LAWYER IDENTIFICATION CARD
BAEK HYUN-WOO

466
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,380
Hey, isn't he the son-in-law of Queens?

467
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,960
Son-in-law, my foot.
He's pretty much a butler.

468
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,840
I heard he cleans up his in-laws' messes.

469
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,760
Where's his self-respect?

470
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,060
He wouldn't have married
into that family if he had any.

471
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,350
He's an embarrassment to all attorneys.

472
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,020
Goodness.

473
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,820
Oh, my.

474
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,740
Hallelujah, Hyun-woo.

475
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,080
So what if I have 25 billion won
in my account?

476
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,080
I can't even use it
to buy dental floss in here.

477
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,290
By the way,
how did you come up with this idea?

478
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,370
Ma'am.

479
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,790
This is actually illegal, you see.

480
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Hyun-woo.

481
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,090
How long must I be locked up?

482
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,760
I didn't commit that big of a sin.

483
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,090
I thought Seul-hee
was the whistleblower who reported me

484
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,220
for embezzlement, so I grabbed her hair.

485
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,640
Is that a crime?

486
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,600
She had to receive treatment
for four weeks.

487
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,650
Damn it.
I should've hospitalized her instead.

488
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,480
She's the reason why my mom passed away.

489
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,570
Just wait and see.
I'll take my revenge on her.

490
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,650
Hyun-woo.

491
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,360
Taking revenge

492
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,530
is my specialty.

493
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,740
I'm fully aware of that, ma'am.

494
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,580
All three of my ex-husbands
have left this country.

495
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,080
I brought hell to all of them
and their relatives.

496
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,170
Ma'am.

497
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,630
Married couples can eventually separate.

498
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,300
So why did you have to go that far?

499
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,050
Hyun-woo.

500
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,340
Divorce is brutal and messy.

501
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,140
There's no "good" bye in divorce.

502
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,100
The best solution
is for one of them to die.

503
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,100
If I marry and divorce again
in the future,

504
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,730
I'll ask you to take my case.

505
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,940
Why are you

506
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
already thinking
about getting another divorce?

507
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,570
Whatever.

508
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,650
For some reason,

509
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,820
I think marriage and divorce
go hand in hand

510
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,660
instead of marriage and happiness.

511
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,660
I agree.

512
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,120
What did you say?

513
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,330
Nothing.

514
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,790
Hey. Look here.

515
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,540
I lost a lot of hair, right?

516
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,170
I really need to get out of here.

517
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,880
This place is teeming with bitches.

518
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,760
I'm going to become like them
if I stay here any longer.

519
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,420
My mom's memorial service is coming up.

520
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,550
My dad will settle this before then

521
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,800
for her sake, right?

522
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,470
I'm currently in front of Queens Town

523
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,970
in Hanil-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul
where the memorial service

524
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,020
of Yang Mi-suk,
the Queens' chairman's late wife,

525
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,440
is taking place.

526
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,310
The family members
are arriving one by one.

527
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,780
This year, Hong Beom-seok,
the chairman's eldest son

528
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,610
and former CEO of Queens Distribution,

529
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,160
flew in from Hawaii.

530
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,620
There is a keen interest

531
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,410
in whether or not
the chairman and his son will reconcile

532
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,410
after their long-time feud.

533
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,880
Sir, can you take a look at my pancakes?
Do you think the insides are cooked?

534
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,340
Why would you ask me that?

535
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,050
You studied chemistry in Harvard,

536
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,630
so I thought you'd know.

537
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,510
Yes. Judging by the color,

538
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,470
I'm sure they're well-cooked. Flip them.

539
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,350
Yes, sir. I'll do the plating.

540
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,140
Was it you who graduated
from Parsons School of Design?

541
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,690
No, that's me.

542
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,940
His family
have been architects for generations.

543
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,860
His family made the big sculpture

544
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,820
-in front of the Louvre.
-I'll be honest.

545
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,900
I'm pretty confident
about stacking up food.

546
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,280
What a waste of talent.

547
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,700
My dear brothers-in-law.

548
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,540
This is Mr. Choi.
He married Min-hee, our relative.

549
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,660
My brothers-in-law.

550
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,000
Hello.

551
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,420
Hello.

552
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,920
In the past,
powerful families such as royalty

553
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,090
made the male members prepare
everything for memorial services.

554
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,180
The chairman has great interest
in royal traditions,

555
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,600
so we've been doing this
for a few years now.

556
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,640
I see.

557
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,730
Right.

558
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,600
This must be why traditions
and the future go well together.

559
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,360
This isn't old-fashioned.
It's quite progressive and nice.

560
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,190
It fits the current trend.

561
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,990
If it's so progressive, nice, and trendy,

562
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,030
why don't you join us?

563
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,450
You know me.

564
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,410
I've been going to church since last year,

565
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,160
so this is against my religion.

566
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,740
I was born a Christian.

567
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,830
Ever since I was young,

568
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,880
I've had a condition

569
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,210
where I can't smell oil. It's a shame.

570
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,340
Thank you for your hard work.

571
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,010
Good luck.

572
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
-Gosh.
-Seriously?

573
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,680
This is the Hong family's
memorial service.

574
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,020
But no one here has that surname.

575
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,270
They should prepare
their own memorial services.

576
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,940
-Jeez.
-I'm the fifth only son

577
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,270
of the Yu family
in Paechon County, 39th generation.

578
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,780
What would my mother say if she saw me
complete this skewer in ten seconds?

579
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,070
Let's not talk about how precious we are

580
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,450
to our families.

581
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,240
Welcome to Queens.

582
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,080
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

583
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,540
But if I were you,

584
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,290
I'd run away right now.

585
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,010
It's not too late
since it's his first memorial service.

586
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,590
How's the color? Does it look too dull?

587
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,850
Jade green isn't an easy color.

588
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,230
I've only seen two people
who looked good in that color.

589
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,770
You

590
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,980
and Yuna Kim at the London Fashion Show.

591
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,320
Oh, her? Yes, she looked really nice.

592
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,070
And so do you, ma'am.

593
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,320
You know how to please others.

594
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,700
Ms. Moh.

595
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,620
Why aren't you wearing
the hanbok that was sent to you?

596
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:10,750
I shouldn't be at this memorial service.

597
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,460
The family can do it without me.

598
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,590
You've been with us for over 20 years,
so you're family too.

599
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,970
That's what a family is.

600
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,600
That's very kind of you.
But I'll just stay in my room.

601
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,350
People will talk

602
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,390
about how I shove you around
and mistreat you.

603
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,020
"Shove you around"? Who shoves whom?

604
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,200
Do you shove her around?

605
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,660
Me? Shove her?

606
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,990
No, Father. Never.

607
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,490
Then why would you say that?

608
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,790
You only said that
because that's how you think of her.

609
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,960
That's not why.

610
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,380
She didn't want to wear a hanbok.

611
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,510
-Why not?
-I don't know.

612
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,760
Are you not going to?

613
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,300
Of course, I will.

614
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,270
You heard her.

615
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,650
Let's go.

616
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,780
What a crazy…

617
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,540
Gosh, I'm so stressed.

618
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,370
She's a sly one.

619
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,880
She's going to brazenly attend
Ms. Yang's memorial service

620
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,510
because the chairman insisted.

621
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,760
That's her plan.

622
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,550
Who knew a girlfriend-in-law
could be worse than a mother-in-law?

623
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,780
Beom-ja is here!

624
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,710
Hyun-woo.

625
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,930
Why did she get discharged today?

626
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,730
You said she'd get sick
if she stayed locked up in this cold.

627
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,190
Right.

628
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,810
I did say that.

629
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Still, you should've waited to let her out
after the memorial service.

630
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,860
What? Look at that good-for-nothing.

631
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,070
Just look at her.

632
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,290
I was thoughtless, sir.

633
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,250
Mom.

634
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,550
I was locked up.

635
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,010
Dad put
his one and only daughter behind bars

636
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,760
just because I grabbed
his girlfriend by the hair and kicked her.

637
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,050
Hey.

638
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,220
It's the truth.

639
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,690
You're head over heels for her.

640
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,480
Not only are you in love with the woman
who killed your wife,

641
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,480
but you sent your daughter to jail.

642
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,030
You're absolutely heartless.

643
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,030
Beom-ja, this is Mom's memorial service.
Let's talk later. Okay?

644
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,780
You're no different.
Have you forgotten who she is?

645
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,620
Mom died because of her!

646
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,160
Mom died of a heart attack--

647
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,080
Exactly! Why do you think she had it?

648
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,540
Her heart stopped
because she was enraged at Moh Seul-hee!

649
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,420
So how can you stand
looking at her every day and night?

650
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,670
Are you not upset?

651
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,140
-Beom-ja, I--
-Gosh, Mom.

652
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,100
What's the point of having a son?

653
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,470
You didn't even prepare skate,
her favorite food,

654
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,810
so who are you to talk?

655
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,480
Aunt Beom-ja, we have skate.
The house reeks of it.

656
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,310
Get lost, you bastard!

657
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,690
How could you never visit me
when I raised you myself?

658
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,490
You didn't raise him.

659
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,030
Don't be ridiculous.

660
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,410
Aunt Beom-ja.

661
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,410
We were just serving the alcohol.

662
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,330
Really?

663
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,450
We should continue then. Go on.

664
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,890
What's wrong with you?

665
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,140
Come on.

666
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,430
Hey, turn the glass slowly.

667
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,140
She was a lightweight.
You're going to get her drunk!

668
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,270
Beom-ja.

669
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,270
Mom drank like a fish.

670
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:45,020
That's a fact we both know to be true.

671
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,860
Why do you think she drank so much?

672
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,240
Because that woman stressed her out!

673
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,280
Uncle.

674
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,700
Doesn't it break your heart to know
that your sister passed away

675
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,200
because she was outraged by that woman?
Say something!

676
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,080
Beom-ja, that's not why she died.

677
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:04,250
She died of a heart attack.
It runs in the family.

678
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,000
-You should be careful too.
-Goodness.

679
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
Goodness.

680
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,430
Goodness.

681
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,220
Mom.

682
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,680
This family is a total disaster.

683
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,610
Don't bother visiting.

684
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,360
I'll drink the alcohol.

685
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:28,990
You should make a U-turn.

686
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,990
Mr. Hong, you finally came back
after 19 years. Will you rejoin Queens--

687
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,240
Will you be attending
your mother's memorial service?

688
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,040
Will you be meeting Chairman Hong?

689
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,750
Have you two reconciled?

690
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,130
Please sit. He'll leave eventually.

691
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,510
That's why I despise him more.

692
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,810
That bastard didn't come to see me.

693
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,020
He came to get his photo taken.

694
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,390
Look at him.

695
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,730
He's purposely standing in the rain
for the cameras.

696
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,520
What a bastard.

697
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,700
We're the ones
who cooked all those pancakes.

698
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,030
Do you see my hands trembling?

699
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,240
But they don't even allow us
to attend the service.

700
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,040
These days, I spend a lot of time
on internet forums about mothers.

701
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,750
I can relate to many of their posts.

702
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,210
I don't remember the last time
I visited my parents on the holidays.

703
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,460
They said they'd let us go
once we cleaned up.

704
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,010
-"Wait for your aunt-in-law."
-Right.

705
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,340
"Wait for your uncle-in-law."

706
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,380
"Chop some apples."

707
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,680
"Serve the pancakes."

708
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,800
I mean, what about our families?

709
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,010
Today is Hyun-woo's father's birthday.

710
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,720
It's his 60th birthday.

711
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:43,430
But he couldn't visit him
because of this memorial service.

712
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,440
Anyway, I pity him the most.

713
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,150
-Me too.
-Me too.

714
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,190
Our wives are their cousins,
but he married the direct line. Gosh.

715
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
His in-laws

716
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,150
are all terrifying.

717
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,660
-They are.
-They are.

718
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,530
Director Jo.

719
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,160
You've been attending
the memorial service for 20 years now.

720
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,910
She always treated me well.
Of course I should come.

721
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,290
I know you submitted
your resignation letter,

722
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,540
but I really don't want to accept it.

723
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,550
I thought long and hard
before making that decision.

724
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,630
Soon, I'll be too old
to have a fresh start.

725
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,840
Okay. It can't be helped then.

726
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,640
I'll always be rooting for you.

727
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,390
Thank you so much, sir.

728
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,770
Look into him.
It's odd for him to quit so suddenly.

729
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:27,230
I'm sure something's up.

730
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:28,770
I'll look into him discreetly.

731
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,940
No, everyone should know about this.

732
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,030
Find out what he did
and let the media see him going to court.

733
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,320
My purpose isn't to punish him.

734
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,530
It's to humiliate him.

735
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:45,160
Why do you wish to do that?

736
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,170
I never allow those
who turn their backs on me

737
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,300
to leave in one piece.

738
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,220
They need to suffer on their way out

739
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,430
so they won't cause further troubles.

740
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,850
What's with the face?

741
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,560
Do you have something to say?

742
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,770
But he devoted many years to you.

743
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,860
Is it right to cut him off

744
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,820
so brutally?

745
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,700
That's probably what he'll think.

746
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,040
But that's his opinion.

747
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,290
I believe an organization
must follow its rules.

748
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,130
That's exactly right.

749
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,210
It's not just him. I'm after anyone else
who has the same idea.

750
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,720
It's a warning to those
who want to backstab me.

751
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,260
-Yes, sir.
-Keep that in mind.

752
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,180
-Sorry?
-You should never bid farewell

753
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,020
to those who abandon you.

754
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,190
You must stab them in the back.

755
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,860
Yes, sir.

756
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
Well done.

757
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,400
Go rest up.

758
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:02,570
Yes, sir.

759
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,660
Goodbye then.

760
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,970
I don't have an appetite.

761
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,720
It feels like my appetite
is completely gone.

762
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,390
It's suffocating to be around many people.

763
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,190
Your stress levels
seem to be extremely high.

764
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,150
Based on your sentence completion test,

765
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,650
you wrote
that your biggest desire right now

766
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,150
is getting a divorce.

767
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,410
-Correct.
-I see. And why is that?

768
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:49,790
I live with my parents-in-law.

769
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,080
And my grandfather-in-law.

770
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,170
And him.

771
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,210
As well as
my recently-discharged aunt-in-law

772
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,880
and my brother-in-law's family.

773
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,050
We all live

774
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,760
under the same roof.

775
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,930
I see.

776
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:09,350
It's rare to see extended families
nowadays. You're blessed.

777
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:12,060
We're so blessed
that we have dinner together every night.

778
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,270
Then we get together at 9:00 p.m. to talk.

779
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:16,560
An end-of-day meeting.

780
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,730
The weekends, holidays,
birthdays, and Christmas.

781
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,940
We spend them together all year round.
It's safe to say

782
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,200
that I have no time for myself.

783
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:28,660
We have 15 memorial services per year.

784
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,490
They say noble families in the past

785
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,210
made their male members
prepare for the services.

786
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:36,040
So the sons-in-law prepare
for the entire service.

787
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,000
But their sons never help.

788
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,340
It feels like

789
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,180
you need a place
where you can be away from them.

790
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,680
Do you have a job?

791
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:52,770
-Yes.
-Good.

792
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:53,930
How's your work life?

793
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,140
My wife is my boss.

794
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,310
And my father-in-law is her boss.

795
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,820
Then my grandfather-in-law

796
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,490
is his boss.

797
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,200
My heart races, and my hands tremble

798
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,780
whenever my in-laws call.

799
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,950
I'm anxious
about what they'll ask me to do.

800
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,040
Why don't you distance yourself
from this stressful environment?

801
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,540
Then divorce is the only option.

802
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,290
You could move out with your wife.

803
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,630
It's true that I dislike my in-laws.
However…

804
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,050
I despise my wife even more.

805
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,800
Why is that?

806
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,970
She doesn't care

807
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,890
at all about me
or how her family treats me.

808
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:31,470
She only cares about herself.
Isn't she selfish?

809
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,430
I only married
into the family because of her

810
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,310
and endured three years of this treatment.

811
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:38,850
But she doesn't care.

812
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,320
Before we got married,
she said I could trust her.

813
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,240
I'm the only one you need.

814
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:45,990
Just trust me.

815
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,320
I will never

816
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,780
make you cry.

817
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,290
I was an idiot for believing her.

818
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,380
Are you hurt and upset with her?

819
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,470
No.

820
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,470
I no longer feel that way.

821
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,510
I just despise her.

822
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:12,390
I hate her

823
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,930
with a passion.

824
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,480
And that's why you want a divorce.

825
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,230
That's the only way I'll live.

826
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:19,520
Then why haven't you?

827
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,820
Because I could die.

828
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,440
What?

829
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,150
My father-in-law

830
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,070
despises it the most when his people

831
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,820
turn their backs on him.

832
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,580
The moment I divorce her,

833
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,750
he'll stab me in the back.

834
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:36,830
Stab you?

835
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,790
Of course, that was a figure of speech.

836
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,590
But getting stabbed
might actually be better.

837
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,730
I'll prescribe you something strong,
so take it.

838
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,980
Hang in there.

839
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:15,370
Goodbye.

840
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,470
WIFE

841
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,100
I love you, honey.

842
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,810
I genuinely think I'm happy.

843
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,560
I didn't do anything.

844
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,480
I'm just really grateful--

845
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,560
Hello?

846
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,820
I'm so happy.

847
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:56,700
Wait, Grace.

848
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,040
Why aren't you saying anything?

849
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,120
You should take responsibility for saying

850
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,290
that Jinseong Group's third heir
was the real deal.

851
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,670
Why should I do that?

852
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,880
I heard you chose their eldest son.
Go on that blind date then.

853
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,380
But the chairman doesn't like him.

854
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,130
So how can I set my daughter up with him

855
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:15,050
when I heard that his third son
will inherit everything?

856
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,800
You should've come to me first.

857
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,850
You already set up a blind date
with the eldest son, a rogue.

858
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:21,140
So what can I do?

859
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,560
You should just go to that matchmaker.

860
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,440
I was in a dilemma.

861
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,730
What choice did I have when I heard
that you were no longer competent?

862
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:36,410
What did you say?

863
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,530
So what if you serve
the ladies of Queens?

864
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,200
You may oversee their household matters,
but your daughter is still single.

865
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,120
That's exactly why

866
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:48,000
Hong Hae-in regrets not listening to me
and marrying her now-husband.

867
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:49,130
Seriously?

868
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,340
Are they getting a divorce?

869
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,720
You can't be with someone
who's out of your league.

870
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,390
Three years is enough.

871
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,220
Just wait and see.

872
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,890
Even the great Hong Hae-in

873
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:04,060
will listen to me
when she wants to remarry.

874
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,530
Ms. Hong!

875
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,380
Your mother stopped by
our spa this morning.

876
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,800
I told you to come by. Why won't you?

877
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,300
Are you stressed out these days?

878
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:39,390
Your skin looks dull.

879
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:42,810
We have some great serums and machines.

880
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:45,810
I'll empty out our schedule,
so do stop by.

881
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,900
You must be busy,
so you don't need to do that.

882
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,100
We're not busy.

883
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:54,820
You worry so much about me!

884
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:56,530
No, I don't.

885
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,700
What?

886
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,620
I'm just saying
that I will never visit your spa.

887
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,370
You're so cold.

888
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,040
You're making me feel distant.

889
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:16,340
You should feel that way.

890
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,970
You must be treating me

891
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,550
like a friend
because you think we're close.

892
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,720
I hope you'll be more careful.
It's uncomfortable.

893
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,480
But--

894
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:35,030
She has a nasty temper.

895
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:38,360
She's so obnoxious. Don't you agree?

896
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:42,660
The third heir of Jinseong Group

897
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,160
is into vegan food these days.

898
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,120
A vegan forum will be held
at their hotel next Friday.

899
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,290
Bring your daughter there.

900
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:50,870
-I'll try to set them up.
-Really?

901
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:52,840
You can go now.

902
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,750
I have something to do.

903
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:57,590
I knew it.

904
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,680
I trust you, Grace.

905
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,220
You see,

906
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,980
I've been in the beauty industry

907
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,860
and matchmaking wealthy families

908
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,270
all my life.

909
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,900
So I don't know much about legal matters.

910
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,070
I see. What is this about?

911
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:23,620
I'm sure you heard

912
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,660
that Daegyeong's youngest son
passed away due to a car accident.

913
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,330
I did.

914
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,000
It seems like

915
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,380
his wife won't inherit
any of his fortunes.

916
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:36,420
Turns out, her husband had written a will

917
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,460
before they got married.

918
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:41,590
He said his children, nieces, or nephews

919
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,010
should inherit
his fortunes instead if he died.

920
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:46,100
But that couple never had a child.

921
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:47,970
I see.

922
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,810
In that case, the wife could claim

923
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:52,270
a legal reserve of inheritance
and file a lawsuit.

924
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:55,060
I can introduce you
to an attorney if you want.

925
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:59,400
What for? I have you.

926
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,900
You're in the same boat.

927
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,150
Sorry?

928
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,820
Ms. Hong also wrote a will
before she got married.

929
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,990
Didn't you know?

930
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:11,210
You must've thought

931
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,960
the prenuptial agreement was it.

932
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,330
I can't believe she didn't tell you.

933
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,090
She's a heartless one.

934
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,960
The will said that Queens

935
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,380
would inherit
all her cash, stocks, and real estates

936
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:24,930
if something happened to her.

937
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,930
She said you wouldn't get anything.

938
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:31,060
She wrote it in such detail.

939
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:35,230
We use that as a template
for all future wills.

940
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,110
What's with that face?

941
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:43,110
Did you really think it was
the marriage of the century

942
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,660
that transcended all backgrounds

943
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,660
like the media claimed it was?

944
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,080
Don't be so naive.

945
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,710
Ms. Hong didn't want a husband.

946
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:56,710
She wanted a slave
she could add to the family register.

947
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,920
And that's when you appeared.

948
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,720
You're handsome and intelligent.
It was the best PR she could have.

949
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,840
You're obedient just to her liking.

950
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,850
The only problem was the wealth dispute,

951
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:11,470
but that's solved, thanks to the will.

952
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:13,430
That's enough.

953
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,480
Okay.

954
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:18,690
Hello, Professor.

955
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:24,360
Can you e-mail it to me?
I don't have time to go there.

956
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,300
Why weren't you picking up?

957
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,300
We need to go somewhere.

958
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,220
I know you're free today. I checked.

959
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:56,100
The car is waiting downstairs.

960
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,900
I'm not going.

961
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,650
I didn't even tell you
where we were going.

962
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:05,860
It doesn't matter.

963
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,780
I refuse to go anywhere with you.

964
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,480
YONGDU-RI'S PRODIGY BAEK HYUN-WOO

965
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,360
"A prodigy"? That was from ages ago.

966
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:54,490
So…

967
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,750
here's what Yongdu-ri thinks.

968
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,790
They don't mind you serving
consecutive terms.

969
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:01,330
That's the general opinion.

970
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:04,750
Stop by my shop later for a snack.
The new makgeolli tastes good.

971
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,840
Again?

972
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,420
-You're always so generous.
-Gosh.

973
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,090
I wish I could give you something better,
but there's

974
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,970
the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.

975
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,640
The village head is also a state job,

976
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,020
so I can't be too generous.

977
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,350
Gosh, I'm always grateful.

978
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:20,690
You've done enough already.

979
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:22,150
-You understand, right?
-Of course.

980
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,400
Goodness, Ms. Jeon.

981
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,070
Hello.

982
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:28,820
-Jeez.
-Hey.

983
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,530
Did it get stuck again?

984
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,070
You idiots.
How can you call yourselves farmers?

985
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,160
How do you manage to get the cultivator

986
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,620
stuck every time?

987
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,080
What took you so long?

988
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,160
I--

989
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,370
I'm not 911.
I can't always come right away.

990
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,670
My wife used to drive a cultivator

991
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,090
and catch small octopuses
in Beolgyo, Jeolla Province

992
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:53,510
before marrying me.

993
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:55,220
She's really something.

994
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,140
It's working!

995
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:04,440
Gosh, what lovely weather.

996
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,610
What? Hey.

997
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:09,650
Yeong-cheol! How are your mother's knees?

998
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,990
They're the same!

999
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:13,070
That's why she needs to take glucosamine!

1000
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,950
-Sit down!
-Okay.

1001
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,700
Isn't your son taking his midterms soon?

1002
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:20,950
What's it to me? It's his work.

1003
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,540
What are you saying?

1004
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:26,040
Even still, you should help him memorize!

1005
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,960
When Hyun-woo went to SNU,
I helped him day and night--

1006
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,180
Why did you suddenly speed up?

1007
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,890
I told you to sit, didn't I?

1008
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:43,980
They may just look like normal farmers,
but they're more than that.

1009
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,650
They're all voters.

1010
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,440
The reelection is around the corner.
You know nothing.

1011
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,150
Reelection, my foot.

1012
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,570
We need to take care
of our grove and our shop.

1013
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,740
We're already juggling so much.

1014
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,660
Didn't I tell you countless times

1015
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,240
to give up your position?

1016
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,330
Honey.

1017
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,370
I'm only doing this for balance's sake.

1018
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,910
-What balance?
-Hear me out.

1019
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,750
Hyun-woo's in-laws may be
the pillars of this country's economy,

1020
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,960
but they don't have much political power.

1021
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,960
Our families can only have balance

1022
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,880
since I'm maintaining

1023
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,930
my important post as the village head.

1024
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,010
Why are you stopping now?

1025
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,180
-Hyun-woo!
-What?

1026
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,440
You didn't even call.

1027
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:33,780
I just thought I'd visit.

1028
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,320
Where's Hae-in?

1029
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,990
Are you here alone again?

1030
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,990
Have you eaten yet?

1031
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,000
Not yet.

1032
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,040
Okay.

1033
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,970
This looks ripe.

1034
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:00,930
Move aside.

1035
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:02,850
Let's see.

1036
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:06,060
Move. My youngest son is here.

1037
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,370
Gosh, you must've been hungry.

1038
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:31,590
Take your time.

1039
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,470
Is it good?

1040
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,470
Yes, I'm busy. Why?

1041
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,930
Hyun-woo is here?

1042
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,180
One minute.

1043
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,190
QUEEN'S HAIR SALON

1044
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,020
That little scumbag.

1045
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,270
He didn't even come
for Dad's 60th birthday.

1046
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,360
Don't let him leave.

1047
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:44,450
I've been meaning to ask you something.

1048
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:46,700
I'm disappointed in both you and Hae-in.

1049
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,790
I get that you can't come regularly
or even on the holidays.

1050
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:52,870
But shouldn't you have attended
Dad's 60th birthday?

1051
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,250
-That's so heartless.
-Yes, you're right.

1052
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:57,750
I was heartless.

1053
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,630
At least he knows that he was wrong.

1054
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,510
That's why I'm getting a divorce.

1055
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:05,640
-What?
-Dad. Mom.

1056
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,430
I'm going to divorce Hae-in.

1057
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,480
-I'm sorry.
-Wait.

1058
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,400
Hey, don't tell me

1059
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,610
you're getting a divorce
just because of what I said.

1060
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,610
What's with you?
60th birthdays are nothing.

1061
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:21,240
Birthdays come every year.

1062
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,200
Indeed. Who celebrates
60th birthdays these days?

1063
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,580
Forget 70th too.
We're expected to live longer lives.

1064
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,030
It's not because of that.

1065
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,200
Then?

1066
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:31,790
What is it? I'm sure you have a reason.

1067
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,250
Don't tell me you're seeing another--

1068
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:37,630
Come on.

1069
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,920
No.

1070
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:41,340
Then does Hae-in have--

1071
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,970
Can you please stop?

1072
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:46,930
That's not true either.
It's just too much for me.

1073
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,890
I'm not happy.

1074
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:52,810
That's an absurd reason.

1075
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,390
Do you think I'm always happy?

1076
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,810
He's right.

1077
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,400
Your dad isn't always happy
in this marriage either.

1078
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,860
If anything, I'm miserable.

1079
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,610
But I'm only able to endure it

1080
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:03,530
because of the smallest happiness

1081
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:06,160
that I feel once in a blue moon.

1082
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,530
-That's marriage. That's life.
-You know what you're talking about.

1083
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:10,660
I'll be honest.

1084
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,290
Do you think I'm with your mom
because I love her?

1085
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,670
What did you say?

1086
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:20,800
I'm not done.

1087
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:23,380
Of course, I love you.

1088
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:25,840
But if love is the only thing you feel,

1089
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,010
then that'll be the death of you.

1090
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:30,350
Sure. I hope you live a long life.

1091
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:32,640
Look at this.

1092
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:37,060
We still fail to see eye to eye
despite being married for 40 years.

1093
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,270
Not at all.

1094
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,520
Unbelievable.

1095
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,110
I understand.

1096
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:45,820
But…

1097
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:50,740
I thought long and hard
before making this decision.

1098
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,750
I'm going to do it.

1099
01:04:58,750 --> 01:04:59,790
I'm sorry.

1100
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:07,970
Stop!

1101
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:10,930
Stop! Get out, you scumbag!

1102
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,930
You're so selfish.

1103
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,560
Don't you know
I had to make sacrifices for you?

1104
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,770
What sacrifices?

1105
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,110
I couldn't even go to university
because our parents sold

1106
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,940
all of our cows to send you to Seoul.

1107
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,270
How could you forget that?

1108
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,690
How are you so shameless?
You couldn't go to university

1109
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,450
because you failed at attendance.

1110
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:32,410
This boy is so naive.

1111
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:38,500
Why do you think
Grand Prince Yang-nyeong acted out?

1112
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:39,960
What are you on about?

1113
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,540
It was a sacrifice.

1114
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,590
He sacrificed himself and acted out
for his brother Se-jong's sake.

1115
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,170
Do you think I enjoyed acting out?

1116
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,300
I gave up
our parents' expectations, hopes, and cows

1117
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:52,010
just for you.

1118
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,050
You did?

1119
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:54,430
Yes, me.

1120
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,520
I had to make sacrifices as the eldest.

1121
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,560
I see, Ms. Baek Mi-seon.
Thumbelina of Yongdu Carriage Gang.

1122
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,650
Hey!

1123
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:05,440
That was ages ago.

1124
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:09,860
I'm leaving.

1125
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,370
I don't want to pressure you.

1126
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:17,870
You already are.

1127
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:20,920
-I'm only worried about Dad.
-What about him?

1128
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Do you know how happy he was
to marry you off to Queens?

1129
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:26,550
He says he has no appetite
but finishes a bowl of rice soup

1130
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,590
every time Queens' stock prices go up.

1131
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,340
He always enjoyed rice soup.

1132
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,390
Yes, that's true.

1133
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:35,560
Right. But…

1134
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,600
A son from this tiny town gets a divorce?

1135
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,350
He'll be humiliated! Wake up, you idiot!

1136
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,650
This isn't Seoul or Hollywood.

1137
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:44,770
This is Yongdu-ri.

1138
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,940
Your friend Chang-sik
got divorced two years ago,

1139
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:49,280
and they're still talking about it.

1140
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,650
He's right.

1141
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,240
All the ladies at my hair salon

1142
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,200
still wonder why he got divorced.

1143
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,700
That's right. However…

1144
01:06:57,790 --> 01:07:00,710
no one will talk about him
if you get divorced too.

1145
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,170
Is this because of your gym's rent?

1146
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:07,750
And because of Gyeong-jun
who's studying abroad?

1147
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,340
Since you need to send him money?

1148
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,380
Are you using me to live comfortable lives

1149
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:16,100
just like how Sim-cheong
was sold for 300 sacks of rice?

1150
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,220
Gosh. No, I…

1151
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:22,060
I wouldn't use you if it was that much.

1152
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,100
-But it's not.
-Damn it.

1153
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:26,020
Hey, Hyun-woo.

1154
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,440
Hyun--

1155
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,480
Hyun-woo!

1156
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:30,320
-Baek Hyun-woo!
-Hyun-woo!

1157
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,650
Stay the night!

1158
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,000
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

1159
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:10,130
I have

1160
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:12,920
something to say.

1161
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,970
I'll go first.

1162
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,010
What?

1163
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,640
I do too, so let me go first.

1164
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,640
Okay. Go on.

1165
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:29,440
I'm…

1166
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,480
dying.

1167
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:41,030
I have three months left.

1168
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:48,580
What did you say?

1169
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,300
I said we had to go somewhere today.

1170
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,550
I went to the hospital.

1171
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:01,930
And the doctor said I was dying

1172
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,140
and that I had three months.

1173
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:07,230
What…

1174
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,020
are you saying?

1175
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:12,310
It's exactly what I said.

1176
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:17,360
The doctor said
I only have three months to live.

1177
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,570
That's all.

1178
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,780
-What did you want to say?
-What?

1179
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:26,540
You had something to say. What is it?

1180
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:30,920
I don't think

1181
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:35,000
that's important right now.

1182
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,800
Just say it.
I know you have something to say.

1183
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:46,850
Well, I…

1184
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:50,850
-So what…
-Yes?

1185
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,650
I wanted to say was…

1186
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:56,900
I…

1187
01:10:58,570 --> 01:10:59,610
Yes?

1188
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:00,900
"I'm sorry."

1189
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:05,740
"About today

1190
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:10,120
and everything that I did until now."

1191
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,580
"It won't happen ever again.
I'll treat you better from now on."

1192
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,500
That's what I wanted

1193
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,630
to say.

1194
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:23,630
But you only have three months to live?
How's that possible?

1195
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,180
How can I live without you?

1196
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:29,020
How is that possible?

1197
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:31,890
I'm so dumbfounded

1198
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,020
that I don't know what to say.

1199
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,280
Are you serious?

1200
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,700
Yes, you fool.

1201
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,500
I love you, Hong Hae-in.

1202
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:59,420
I love you.

1203
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:18,310
Please give them a round of applause

1204
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,900
as they begin their new journey.

1205
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,370
Please clap and cheer even louder

1206
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:30,660
to wish them the very best.

1207
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:39,630
Everyone, please look at the camera!

1208
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:42,550
Please laugh on the count of three.

1209
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,010
One, two, three.

1210
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:04,570
Mr. Baek, congratulations on the wedding.

1211
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:06,900
Please say something
to yourself in ten years.

1212
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:09,240
How are you doing,
Hyun-woo from the future?

1213
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,910
Don't tell me you got a divorce.

1214
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:13,950
Do you have kids?

1215
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,080
One? Two?

1216
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,540
It doesn't matter though.

1217
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:20,790
Because all I need is Hae-in.

1218
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:24,670
I hope you still remember

1219
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,680
how much you love her

1220
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,180
even to this day.

1221
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,310
Don't make her cry.

1222
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,520
Make her happy.

1223
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:39,020
Why must I answer that?

1224
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,860
It'll be something nice to watch
in the future.

1225
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:46,110
I'll be too busy with life
to watch this in ten years.

1226
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:47,610
Do I have to do this?

1227
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,700
Dear Hae-in from the future.

1228
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,540
I doubt you're watching this.
But if you are, why are you?

1229
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,000
Turn this off and get to work.

1230
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:00,790
I won't ask how you're doing
since I know you'll be doing fine.

1231
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,840
You'll be just as pretty, healthy,

1232
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,670
and the most successful.

1233
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:08,550
With Hyun-woo by your side, of course.

1234
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,890
QUEEN OF TEARS

1235
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:49,590
But you only have three months to live?
How's that possible?

1236
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:52,970
If you can't live without me…
Do you want to die together?

1237
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:54,350
I'm just happy

1238
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:57,220
that I can escape from them
safe and sound.

1239
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:00,940
Put your heart and soul into loving her.

1240
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:02,310
I'm that materialistic?

1241
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,650
I'll be sitting here.

1242
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:06,860
-Are you okay?
-They should just argue instead.

1243
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,820
How can we change
after years of living as strangers?

1244
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:11,610
Watch out!

1245
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,240
I thought of Hae-in now and then.

1246
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,240
So it feels odd to meet her husband.

1247
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:20,790
I don't even like Hong Hae-in.
Why would I feel jealous?

1248
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,090
