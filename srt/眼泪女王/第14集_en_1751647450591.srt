1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,940
We're on our honeymoon.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,740
Why are you leaving all the good places

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,440
and going to a cemetery?

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,840
I like having a cemetery in the middle of a park.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,580
I don't go to the top of the mountain or the sea

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,780
but I go to the side of Seoldam Road.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,780
I don't think dying is a big deal.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,220
Is that so?

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,820
Is it a cemetery for married people?

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,820
What?

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
What do you mean?

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,380
That old man.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,580
There's no one there.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,580
What?

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,980
He was there just now.

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,380
Why are you so scary?

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,520
There's this guy in the movie.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,020
He brings a new flower to his wife's grave every day.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,220
He looked like that.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,420
I know.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,520
I won't do that even if you die first.

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,260
You won't?

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,360
If you die first,

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,760
I'll live one more day

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,760
and die with you.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
What?

28
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,660
I mean,

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,160
would living without you mean anything?

30
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,720
I said no.

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,360
I mean it.

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,720
Stop it.

33
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,060
People live in the moment of happiness.

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,760
But no one knows

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,760
what will happen on the next page.

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,460
So I made promises that I couldn't keep

37
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,360
and laughed as if the bright moments would last forever.

38
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,160
But life hides many things behind brilliant happiness.

39
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,120
When good things disappear like magic

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,720
and when the hard times come to the point

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,460
that I want to tear the pages apart,

42
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,620
I thought about it.

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,220
Yes.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,660
I had many unhappy things,

45
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,120
but you were there too.

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,120
That's what made me endure.

47
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,820
But

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,280
the cruelest decision was waiting for me on the next page.

49
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
So?

50
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
I'm your...

51
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,620
I'm your choice?

52
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,820
If I do surgery, I'll lose all my memories

53
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,320
and die if I don't.

54
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,220
Which is worse?

55
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,820
Choose one.

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,720
No...

57
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,920
Then what?

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Forget it.

59
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,820
Just a few days.

60
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,420
I'll make a good dream come true.

61
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,620
I'll make a good dream come true.

62
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,420
Let go of me. Let go of me.

63
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,020
Don't make a choice.

64
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,620
Don't even think about it.

65
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,420
Just listen to me.

66
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,020
You live.

67
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,420
Please.

68
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,620
Let's live.

69
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,220
Okay?

70
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Eun,

71
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,820
please live.

72
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,620
We didn't know at all then.

73
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,620
We didn't know what was waiting for us on the next page.

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
What?

75
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,620
Where are you going?

76
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,420
To Hyein.

77
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,620
I heard you went to Germany for surgery.

78
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,620
Is that why you're going?

79
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,020
Baek Hyeonu is there as your guardian.

80
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,120
Why are you here?

81
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,720
I thought I had something to do.

82
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,420
You have things to do here.

83
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,720
You have things to protect.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,920
Why are you so obsessed with me,

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,620
who's already dead?

86
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,020
Who's dead?

87
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
I'll live after the surgery.

88
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Forget about the bad things before.

89
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,020
I'll start over.

90
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,220
Then do you think you can start over with me?

91
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,320
Don't you think so?

92
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
The PR agency in the US

93
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,020
set up a place for you to sleep.

94
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,220
And as soon as you come to Seoul,

95
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,820
you meet the executives of the Wu family.

96
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,220
But that Ju Ju Chung

97
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,120
will ruin everything because of one Hong Hyein.

98
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,820
What's wrong with you?

99
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,620
So why did you leave me?

100
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,420
You wouldn't have left me alone.

101
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,720
You wouldn't have wondered

102
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,020
how great that house was

103
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,720
and wouldn't have liked the girl

104
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,520
who lived there.

105
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,020
How can you stop me?

106
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,220
I can't stop you.

107
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,820
Until I die.

108
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
Okay.

109
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,720
Then I'll help you.

110
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,720
Okay.

111
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,520
Are you going to the German Frankfurt?

112
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,220
Yes.

113
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,620
Sang Hyeon?

114
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,320
How did you get here?

115
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,020
I followed you everywhere at dawn.

116
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,920
We have to pray hard to get to heaven.

117
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,420
That way, we can live and die together.

118
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,820
Is it true that you're going to heaven?

119
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,020
Isn't that obvious?

120
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,820
I wasn't praying to go to heaven.

121
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Then?

122
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,520
I won't ask you to get surgery

123
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,520
or save your memory.

124
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,720
I just want you to live.

125
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,420
I prayed for something useless.

126
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,420
Let's go.

127
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,520
Should we write this too?

128
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,920
What useless thing are you going to write?

129
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,020
Let's go.

130
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Let's go.

131
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,620
The time we thought of is over.

132
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,220
We can't postpone the surgery anymore.

133
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,720
We have the test time, so let's go to the hospital after breakfast.

134
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Go somewhere.

135
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,220
Where else?

136
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Let's go.

137
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,920
You know this place, right?

138
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,220
We came here on our honeymoon.

139
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,320
We did.

140
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,220
We took 100 pictures of you saying you were pretty.

141
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,220
We had a pub a little further.

142
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,620
We had a beer there and then we fought.

143
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,920
We fought.

144
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,420
You said I was too cute when I was drunk.

145
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,620
You kept telling me not to be cute.

146
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,420
No.

147
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
I remember it clearly,

148
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,420
but I only said I was cute.

149
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,720
The women at the pub were looking at you.

150
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,020
I didn't know.

151
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,920
Why? Because I only saw you.

152
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Really?

153
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,320
I was angry at that time too.

154
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,120
You weren't angry right away.

155
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,420
You were sulking for two hours.

156
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Anyway,

157
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,420
I walked back to this place on my way back to the hotel.

158
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,320
There was a beautiful full moon.

159
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Right.

160
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,720
It was a very big and pretty moon.

161
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,920
There must be a photo of it.

162
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,020
The scent of that night,

163
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,720
the moon, the wind...

164
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,820
They were all clear.

165
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,820
That's what I remember.

166
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,220
I remember that I was alive.

167
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,220
I'm moving with the memories in my mind.

168
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,220
So those memories are me and my life.

169
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,220
But it's all disappearing.

170
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
To me, here too...

171
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,220
I won't be getting that surgery anymore.

172
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm alive now,

173
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,020
so I want to die.

174
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,880
Pick it up.

175
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,020
Oh, my. Oh, my, Prosecutor Ho.

176
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,420
Are you crazy?

177
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,720
What are you doing?

178
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,220
Where are you going?

179
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,620
Are you going to go back to Yongduri?

180
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,320
Get your act together and go home.

181
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,820
I'm not going out.

182
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,060
It's really not like this.

183
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,420
Why don't you go shopping while I'm out?

184
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,680
Let's go to the department store.

185
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,420
Hi, Dixby.

186
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,480
I'm listening.

187
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,460
Yongdol.

188
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,860
Are you crazy?

189
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,480
Why are you here?

190
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,660
Is it Kim Yujin?

191
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,520
I'm going to punch the car tires.

192
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,560
Aren't you going to come?

193
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Oh, my gosh.

194
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,620
Oh, my gosh.

195
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,620
Oh, my gosh.

196
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,220
You scared me.

197
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,920
What are you doing here?

198
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,360
You.

199
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,820
You like walnut bread.

200
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,620
Me?

201
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,620
Yeah, I saw the walnut bread and I bought it because I thought of you.

202
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,620
But why are you here?

203
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,620
This is Youngseong's house.

204
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,620
Oh, really?

205
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,620
I heard it wrong.

206
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,620
Oh, Ms. Kwon.

207
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,620
Oh, my.

208
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,620
How did you...

209
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,620
Oh, he came because he thought of me.

210
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,620
He's so in love with his nephew.

211
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,620
Then would you like a cup of tea?

212
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,620
My plum tea is delicious.

213
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,620
Then...

214
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,620
No, no.

215
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,620
Aunt came to see me, so she took the wrong way.

216
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,620
Then I'll see you again.

217
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,620
Aunt, let's go.

218
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
Here.

219
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Oh, but...

220
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,620
Even if you're not here to see me,

221
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,620
let's have a cup of tea together.

222
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,620
Thank you.

223
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,620
Have some madeleines.

224
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,620
I just baked them.

225
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Oh, my brother.

226
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,620
You're such a hipster.

227
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,620
You think I only work enough to eat and live?

228
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,620
You don't need to do more than you think.

229
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,620
How about the rest of the time?

230
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620
I read the book and listen to music.

231
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,620
I think I found it.

232
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,520
When I was in Seoul, I always felt so frustrated and wanted to run away.

233
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,920
But I wish I could live happily here with Dahye and Geon-woo.

234
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,020
You?

235
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,920
You're giving up?

236
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,520
It must be hard for you.

237
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,720
Unlike me, you're a materialist.

238
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,720
Hey, what are you talking about?

239
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,220
My aunt makes a few thousand won worth of bags.

240
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,920
One ring is worth an apartment.

241
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,520
Oh, there's a ring like that?

242
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
It's a luxury. It's endless when you start to be rich.

243
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
How much is the watch I bought last year? 200 million?

244
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,320
Hey!

245
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
What?

246
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,020
I like this kind of thing too.

247
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,120
I like to drink tea with the plum tea I grew myself,

248
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,720
eat madeleines, read books and listen to music

249
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
without worrying about the world.

250
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Oh.

251
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,320
Yes? What's wrong?

252
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,020
Okay, I got it.

253
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,920
Auntie, Mom and Dad are here.

254
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,420
Why do you keep coming? Dahye is sick.

255
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,220
I'll call you later.

256
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,320
Hurry up!

257
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,720
I'll get going.

258
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Okay.

259
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,920
Come again.

260
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,020
My Aunt

261
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,120
Come again.

262
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

263
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,120
Come again.

264
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

265
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,120
I'll bake you madeleines.

266
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

267
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,120
I'll bake you madeleines.

268
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

269
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,120
I'll bake you madeleines.

270
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

271
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,120
I'll bake you madeleines.

272
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

273
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,120
I'll bake you madeleines.

274
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

275
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,120
I'll bake you madeleines.

276
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

277
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,120
I'll bake you madeleines.

278
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

279
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,120
I'll bake you madeleines.

280
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

281
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,120
I'll bake you madeleines.

282
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

283
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

284
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,120
I'll bake you madeleines.

285
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,620
I'll bake you madeleines.

286
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,320
Let's go to a hotel.

287
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,220
The professor is waiting for you.

288
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,020
We should have a talk about it.

289
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,120
The parents are also waiting.

290
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,620
They'll talk on video with you.

291
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,620
Where's Dahee?

292
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,220
She went out for a walk with her baby.

293
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,320
It's cold.

294
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,260
I think she went out because her parents were there.

295
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,160
Excuse me. Can't you see us?

296
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,120
What's going on?

297
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,360
Your sister said she won't be getting the surgery.

298
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
What?

299
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,960
She won't be getting it?

300
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,820
Why don't you try to be emotional?

301
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,520
Emotional?

302
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,620
You're just taking it in.

303
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,420
If you die, I die too.

304
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,420
You still don't know.

305
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,780
My sister is someone who can do whatever she wants.

306
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,220
No way.

307
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,420
She knows it won't happen anyway.

308
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,420
She doesn't know how to act.

309
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,620
She looks like me, so she's smart.

310
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,080
Then why don't you try to make her understand?

311
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,180
How?

312
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,920
When you're a farm owner,

313
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,580
if you have severe complications,

314
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,920
you can't get the expensive medicine

315
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,820
and it's hard to get it.

316
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,320
If you don't get the medicine,

317
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,920
you could die.

318
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,280
It's a long choice.

319
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,020
Right.

320
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,120
Farmers can get hurt a lot,

321
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,720
so they choose to play the game.

322
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
We need to save the roots and make a contract next year.

323
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,920
It's good to see the damage,

324
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,120
but let's just live with it.

325
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,620
Then let's go in this order.

326
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,420
Let's try to convince her logically first.

327
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,820
If it doesn't work,

328
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,120
her father will come to the rescue and scold her.

329
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
They're Suji's parents.

330
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,680
You're not Suji, but I'm your father.

331
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,220
Then you can say,

332
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,120
let's die together.

333
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,420
And then... Okay.

334
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,020
Hey.

335
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,220
Yes, Mother.

336
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,520
Mother, your stomach.

337
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,320
Your stomach. The pesticide.

338
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,420
Come on.

339
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,520
I keep getting runny nose.

340
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,920
You should do it first.

341
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,520
I'll do it.

342
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,720
Hey, Haeyoon.

343
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Think about it.

344
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,120
This is a good thing.

345
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,320
Of course, good memories will disappear,

346
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,720
but bad memories will disappear too.

347
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,320
Why would I drink?

348
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,720
I drink a lot to forget

349
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,120
the painful memories I had.

350
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
But I think of them again when I wake up.

351
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
But if you disappear,

352
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,620
isn't that good?

353
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,920
You're trying to convince me.

354
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,320
Haeyoon.

355
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,720
You're upset, right?

356
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,520
Don't be too harsh on Mr. Baek.

357
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,120
I asked you to do it.

358
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.

359
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
I was afraid you'd say no.

360
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,120
It's okay.

361
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,620
I would've done the same.

362
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,620
After I found out you were sick,

363
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,020
I contacted all the hospitals in Korea and abroad.

364
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,720
Every time, they gave me the same answer.

365
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,520
They all said Baek Hyunwoo was in contact with them.

366
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,320
Hyunwoo sent hundreds of emails

367
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,220
and called every morning to find out

368
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,920
the hospital and the lab that could treat you.

369
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,620
That's how they found the hospital you were in.

370
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,020
So think about it, Haeyoon.

371
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,820
I don't have to think about it.

372
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,520
I should just live.

373
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,020
Don't you think?

374
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,620
What's the use of remembering when you die?

375
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,620
At least...

376
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,220
A daughter who looks at her mom's face

377
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,820
and smiles at her.

378
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,820
You could have a daughter like that.

379
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,820
But after the surgery,

380
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,020
I could be someone else.

381
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,220
The Hong Haeyoon who fought with you so much.

382
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
The Hong Haeyoon who was crying and angry

383
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,320
will now disappear

384
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,620
and you'll become someone I don't know.

385
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,420
I'm sorry.

386
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,820
Please forgive me.

387
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,020
I'm sorry.

388
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,820
Why?

389
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,220
It's okay.

390
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,620
Let's take a break and talk again.

391
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,620
Why turn it off?

392
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,620
You should listen to me.

393
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,220
If you don't get the surgery,

394
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,620
you'll be responsible for it.

395
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,820
You really turned it off?

396
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,320
I was going to say something.

397
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,220
Why are you talking about it?

398
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,020
You're too busy thinking about it.

399
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,920
Is Dad crying?

400
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,220
He's crying.

401
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,020
He's crying, so I'm crying too.

402
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,220
I'm the one who's crying.

403
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,620
I'm sorry.

404
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,220
Please talk to me again.

405
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,220
I'm sorry.

406
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,620
It's okay.

407
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,220
Please stop crying.

408
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,820
I'm sorry.

409
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,820
It's okay.

410
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,020
Eunhye, let's take another round.

411
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,220
What are you doing here?

412
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,420
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,620
You should apologize first.

414
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,220
You're not sorry, are you?

415
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,020
I'm sorry for Ms. Kim.

416
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,420
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,820
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,420
You're not sorry, are you?

419
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,420
I'm sorry for Ms. Kim and my family.

420
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
Family?

421
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
You're making a big mistake.

422
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,920
Dahee, just live your life.

423
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,820
I want to live a different life.

424
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,220
No. You just have to live your life

425
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,720
as a child.

426
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,520
Or else, those people who call you family

427
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,820
will get hurt.

428
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,620
What do you mean?

429
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,020
If you're curious, stay here.

430
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,620
I came to warn you about the affection

431
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,020
I've had for you since I was young.

432
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,520
But I won't give you much time to think about it.

433
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,220
Give me Junho's USB that you took.

434
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,820
And you take good care of your son.

435
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,820
Why did you come here?

436
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,620
You should know why you ran away.

437
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,220
I know what you mean.

438
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,120
So don't touch my family or Sucheol.

439
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,920
Then I won't stay still.

440
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,220
If you don't stay still...

441
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,820
I'll take the USB and go to the police or the prosecutor

442
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,520
with my own feet. We'll die together.

443
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,520
That's not what I'm saying.

444
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,120
Who will raise you if you disappear?

445
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,020
Should I raise the family

446
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,520
who are not even related to me?

447
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Hey!

448
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,120
Why are you taking the kid outside

449
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
when it's so cold?

450
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,920
Gunhoo will catch a cold.

451
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,020
Sucheol.

452
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,220
Do you know what kind of a person Dahee is?

453
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,920
What if I do?

454
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,320
I'm telling you, my son would die if it wasn't for her.

455
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,920
Well...

456
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,220
Before considering surgery, I must advise against delaying any further,

457
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,720
as it may become less effective, or even unnecessary if postponed.

458
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Hina.

459
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Hina.

460
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Hina.

461
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,520
When I look back at the life you gave me,

462
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,920
there are only two things that are precious to me.

463
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,820
My memories of love and the memories of being loved.

464
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,520
I can't lose all of them.

465
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,020
The memories of you who saved me

466
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,520
and the memories of me who loved you.

467
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,420
I can't lose them all.

468
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,220
The memories of you who saved me

469
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,520
and the memories of you who loved me.

470
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,720
I won't beg you to save me.

471
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:03,220
Just let me leave with these memories.

472
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,520
Hina.

473
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Hina, I'm sorry.

474
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm sorry.

475
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,120
Don't do this to me.

476
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,720
Don't make me want to live anymore.

477
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,220
I won't be able to recognize you.

478
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,920
I'll be a different person.

479
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,420
If you were born as a different person,

480
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,420
you'd be the first person I met.

481
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,520
So if you love me again,

482
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,220
and if I get drunk and wake up, you'll be excited again.

483
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
That's how you can love me again.

484
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
I'm sorry.

485
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,920
You never loved me at all,

486
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,920
and you didn't see me, and you said I was bad.

487
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,920
But I'll still be by your side.

488
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,420
I promised you.

489
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,220
Even if I have to go through a lot,

490
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,220
I'll be by your side

491
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,620
if there's one more thing.

492
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,220
So don't worry.

493
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,220
Please stay here.

494
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,420
Don't pray that you'll leave.

495
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,620
I'm afraid it'll come true.

496
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,220
I'm so anxious.

497
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,620
Hina.

498
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,620
Hina.

499
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,220
Hina.

500
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,220
Hina.

501
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,620
I need to use the restroom.

502
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,220
You go ahead and eat.

503
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,220
What are you doing?

504
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,220
What?

505
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
You don't drink coffee on an empty stomach.

506
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,820
But espresso?

507
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,720
You're trying to make an intelligent image with a 0-character newspaper,

508
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,620
and you're trying to show off your body with your arms and arms.

509
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
I'm sorry.

510
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,220
I'm sorry.

511
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,020
I'm sorry.

512
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,020
You're right.

513
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,620
You're right. That's the kind of trick.

514
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,620
Wait.

515
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,620
Are you saying that you haven't reported your marriage

516
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,420
and you're just going to do whatever you want?

517
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,620
If you're a married man,

518
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,320
why don't you stop doing that and just put your hands down

519
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,520
and close your buttons and eat it with ketchup?

520
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
I don't want to.

521
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Why not?

522
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,920
I'm going to make you mad.

523
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
What?

524
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,720
You said I was a waste.

525
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,320
You're the worst.

526
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
I'm sorry.

527
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,120
Did you hear that?

528
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,420
I'm going to make you feel so bad

529
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,420
that you don't want to eat with me.

530
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,020
I should eat some fruit.

531
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,620
What?

532
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,020
I...

533
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,420
I'm going to go out.

534
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,120
The DNA test results have been released.

535
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,320
The blood on the car seat and the crime tool

536
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
is the victim's.

537
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,020
What about the fingerprints on the crime tool?

538
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,920
It's out. This is the person.

539
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,420
Put your sleeves down and close your buttons.

540
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,820
It's not like a man

541
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,820
is going to put his arms out like that.

542
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,020
My sleeves are my heart.

543
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,620
Hey, put them down.

544
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,820
Put them down.

545
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,520
Put them down.

546
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,520
Is the treatment going well?

547
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Can you make a comeback?

548
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,320
Of course.

549
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,220
If you look back, can you change your regime?

550
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,520
I'm not sure.

551
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,820
I'm not sure about that.

552
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,020
There are so many rumors going around.

553
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,520
Where is the first place the company is going to go bankrupt?

554
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,840
It's the cafeteria and the

555
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,440
sugar-coated room.

556
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,420
It was a real shock to get rid of the coffee machine.

557
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,120
Did you go to the cafeteria today?

558
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,620
They even got rid of the yakult that was served as dessert.

559
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,320
The bathroom?

560
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,420
They're going to stop caring about the staff's health.

561
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,720
They say they follow the secretary's and the boss's footsteps,

562
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,220
but can we just let go of our hands like this?

563
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,220
But can we say that

564
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,320
in front of Secretary Kim?

565
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,520
Why me?

566
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,620
Because you could say you're the key member of the current regime.

567
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,620
That's a misunderstanding.

568
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,020
I just did my job.

569
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,320
So you sold the honey.

570
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,920
I did.

571
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,020
But it didn't taste sweet.

572
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,420
Why?

573
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,220
You're so annoyingly nice to me.

574
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,120
You keep forgiving me.

575
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,420
You even paid my sister for her tuition.

576
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,620
So I used the honey.

577
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,920
That must be the taste of conscience.

578
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,220
If you sell too much honey, it'll be bitter.

579
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,120
Someone's calling.

580
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,520
Hello?

581
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,320
Yes, that's me.

582
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,120
What?

583
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,920
Where?

584
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,020
I'm here.

585
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,720
The person who was the chief of staff

586
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,920
died.

587
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,120
He was murdered.

588
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,220
Really?

589
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,320
The news was about to release you.

590
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
I just found out.

591
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,220
Alright, fine.

592
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,920
Sir, we found the suspect.

593
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,420
What?

594
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,320
He left for Frankfurt right after the incident.

595
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,820
We also found out where he is.

596
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,020
Okay.

597
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,620
Send him to the court

598
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,220
and get him out of there.

599
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,420
It's a pain to see him disappear from abroad.

600
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,020
Okay.

601
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Hey, hey.

602
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,520
You take care of the security.

603
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,820
Don't go to the press before you get caught.

604
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,220
Yes, sir.

605
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,920
I'm here to see Da-hye.

606
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,320
What?

607
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,920
Why did you send me?

608
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,520
I thought she was smart.

609
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,120
I told you.

610
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,020
I was angry.

611
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,220
So I called Jun-ho.

612
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,220
You're such a jerk.

613
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,720
Oh, to clean up?

614
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,220
It's a problem now that you're making me feel bad.

615
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,520
I'll clean up one by one.

616
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,620
Did the people who sent you to Germany

617
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,220
go to clean up something?

618
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,420
They won't come to Korea.

619
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,620
If they call, send them money through an overseas account.

620
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,720
And find out if they're hiding for a while.

621
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,420
Okay.

622
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,020
What?

623
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,420
Why isn't he coming in?

624
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,220
What kind of a big accident is this

625
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,720
that he won't come to Korea?

626
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,420
Hey, Ko Jeong-ja.

627
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,220
Why are you pretending to be innocent?

628
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,820
You know it's a lie.

629
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,220
I think I'm going to do something about Hong Hye-in.

630
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,820
Wake up.

631
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,020
You're the one who's the best at holding back from the truth.

632
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,220
Are you done?

633
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
Forget it.

634
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,220
Hello?

635
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,220
Hello?

636
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,020
It's me, Grace.

637
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,720
Yes, what's up?

638
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,220
Nothing.

639
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,820
How are you?

640
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,020
What?

641
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,220
You must be doing well.

642
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,520
That's good.

643
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,720
Take care and be safe.

644
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,820
I'll get going then.

645
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,620
One year later

646
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,820
One year?

647
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,200
One year!

648
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,820
Hey, truth...

649
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,820
The whole car fell down.

650
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,820
It looks like a car accident.

651
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,820
Help!

652
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,820
Hey! I called the police!

653
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,820
Oh my god! Are you crazy? Are you crazy?

654
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,820
The car can explode!

655
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,820
Are you crazy?

656
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,820
Take it away!

657
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,820
Oh my god!

658
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,820
What are you doing?

659
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,820
Wake up!

660
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,820
Did you have an accident?

661
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,820
What happened?

662
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,820
Are you crazy?

663
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:19,820
The most exciting game on the line.

664
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,820
The horse is down.

665
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,820
The horse is down.

666
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,820
The queen of the prize pool.

667
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,820
The king of the prize pool.

668
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,820
The king of the prize pool.

669
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,820
The king of the prize pool.

670
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,820
The king of the prize pool.

671
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,820
The king of the prize pool.

672
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,820
The king of the prize pool.

673
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,820
The king of the prize pool.

674
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,820
Why are you breaking the glass? What's all this?

675
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,820
What is this?

676
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,820
I knew it.

677
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,820
I knew it.

678
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,820
It's okay.

679
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,820
It's okay.

680
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,820
It's okay now.

681
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,820
It's okay now.

682
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,820
Are you okay?

683
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,820
Does it hurt?

684
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,820
I know. Why don't you run in like a crazy person?

685
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,820
I was crazy.

686
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,820
I saw a car in front of me.

687
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,820
I thought you were there.

688
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,820
But when did you get out of the car?

689
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,820
I guess I was lucky.

690
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,820
Look. I bought it again today.

691
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,820
It's still a bag of money, but thanks to you,

692
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,820
I'm alive.

693
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,820
Will you cry like you did before I die?

694
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,820
Of course.

695
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,820
I couldn't.

696
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,820
Why?

697
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,820
It's too...

698
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,820
It stimulates my sexual desire.

699
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,820
I want to hug someone.

700
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,820
If I take the sleeve off, I make a sound,

701
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,820
but when I drink, it's cute, and when I cry,

702
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,820
I want to hug someone.

703
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,820
Women are too much.

704
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,820
I can't stand it anymore.

705
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,820
I'm so angry that I'm going to stand up from the grave.

706
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,820
What do you mean?

707
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,820
I'm going to get surgery.

708
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,820
Really?

709
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,820
I'm so anxious that I don't know if I'll lose my memory

710
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,820
or even myself if I get surgery,

711
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,820
but I don't want to lose you.

712
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,820
I don't want to make a sound anymore,

713
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,820
and I don't want to make a sound in your eyes either.

714
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,820
I don't want to be a burden to you.

715
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:56,820
I'm married to you because I said I'd never make you cry.

716
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,820
I'll keep that promise from now on.

717
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,820
Thank you.

718
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,820
I know what you're feeling.

719
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,820
It's so scary and scary.

720
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,820
But you won't lose you.

721
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,820
I won't let you.

722
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,820
I'll protect you so that you can be yourself.

723
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,820
Okay.

724
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,820
I'll believe you.

725
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,820
Okay.

726
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,820
You're eating so well.

727
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,820
Is it good?

728
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,820
Let's talk.

729
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,820
You're good at this.

730
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,820
What's wrong with you?

731
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,820
The building used to be my area,

732
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,820
but this could be a problem for your siblings.

733
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,820
I think I'm getting divorced.

734
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,820
What?

735
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,820
Why?

736
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,820
Are you tired of your mom?

737
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,820
I am.

738
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,820
I don't know when my husband will get a doctor.

739
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,820
My son sent me to study abroad to see the world,

740
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,820
but I think I forgot my mom's number.

741
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,820
Then go away. Don't stay here.

742
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,820
Who's going to make money?

743
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,820
I can't be indebted to you forever.

744
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,820
So you're getting divorced?

745
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,820
Is that why?

746
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,820
Then why?

747
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:21,820
I think I'm getting a cold.

748
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:22,820
What?

749
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,820
I called, and an American woman answered.

750
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,820
That was overnight.

751
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,820
Why did you say, I'm fine?

752
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,820
I don't know.

753
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,820
It was because I was in Hawaii.

754
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,820
He's so stubborn.

755
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,820
He knew you were a loser

756
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,820
and he's dating an American woman.

757
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,820
He can't argue with you.

758
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,820
I can't argue with him because I'm a loser.

759
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,820
I can't go to the States either.

760
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,820
I have to work alone here.

761
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:09,820
I have to.

762
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,820
So please help me, Deok-seon.

763
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,820
Okay.

764
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,820
Do what you have to do.

765
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,820
Do everything.

766
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,820
Thank you.

767
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,820
Don't cry.

768
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,820
I won't let you go if you see him.

769
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,820
You're cheating on me with an English woman.

770
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,820
My gosh.

771
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,820
Hello.

772
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,820
Hi. Where is your brother?

773
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,820
He went to the shipyard.

774
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,820
He's been busy lately, so I said I'd take over.

775
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,820
Is he a part-timer?

776
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:48,820
A part-timer?

777
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,820
No.

778
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,820
He's a part-timer.

779
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,820
Do you know I was the owner of a mart chain in Seoul?

780
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,820
So you're the owner of a mart chain.

781
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,820
What do you mean?

782
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,820
You know the ones on TV.

783
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,820
Cha Tae-won and Jo In-seong.

784
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,820
Right.

785
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,820
That's it.

786
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,820
Look at this.

787
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,820
Isn't this too much?

788
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,820
I worked really hard to get this.

789
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,820
It's pretty expensive.

790
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,820
Can I get the same amount of money as before?

791
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,820
It's not something you can leave behind.

792
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,820
What if I don't?

793
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,820
This is the title of my first chapter in the book,

794
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,820
Don't Be Loved by Money in the Neighborhood.

795
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,820
You wrote a book?

796
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,820
I'm going to write it based on this experience.

797
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,820
My gosh, this looks amazing.

798
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,820
There's abalone inside.

799
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,820
Oh, my gosh.

800
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,820
Oh, my gosh.

801
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,820
I heard about it.

802
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,820
How did you come to our neighborhood?

803
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,820
Did In-seong come?

804
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,820
No, it's not that.

805
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,820
I heard abalone in the snow crab ramen.

806
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,820
I heard that you can get 3,500 won worth of abalone without any of these.

807
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,820
Then I'll have a double.

808
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,820
I'll have a bite.

809
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,820
Thank you.

810
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,820
I have to go to the hospital with my mom.

811
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,820
I told my kids to come after school.

812
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:16,820
What?

813
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,820
What?

814
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,820
Hey, Jo In-seong.

815
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,820
Don't film me.

816
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,820
Why are you so embarrassed?

817
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,820
Thank you.

818
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,820
Thank you.

819
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,820
Thank you.

820
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,820
Thank you.

821
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,820
Thank you.

822
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,820
Thank you.

823
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,820
Thank you.

824
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,820
Thank you.

825
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,820
Father, you should rest.

826
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,820
I know.

827
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,820
I can't rest.

828
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,820
What's going on?

829
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,820
You're exhausted, Father.

830
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,820
I didn't know it would be this bad.

831
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,820
Let's take a look.

832
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,820
The ramen is sold out.

833
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:51,820
I'm watching.

834
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,820
It's a big hit.

835
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,820
There are three people who ate it while sitting down.

836
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,820
There's a person who ate it while sitting down.

837
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:00,820
Jun-sik's family came and ate it all.

838
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,820
Jun-sik, you bastard.

839
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,820
What?

840
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:04,820
I'll give you a ride.

841
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,820
If you eat this crab, abalone, shrimp, and shrimp,

842
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,820
you'll be losing more and more money.

843
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,820
It's a minus.

844
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,820
It's not a minus.

845
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,820
It's marketing.

846
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,820
I'm sorry for everything.

847
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,820
I'm sorry for leaving this guy behind.

848
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:27,820
It's like carrying a garbage bag while leaving.

849
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,820
That was a kind of warning.

850
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,820
We're not making money with ramen.

851
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,820
Our goal is to make the customers who come to eat ramen spend more money.

852
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:39,820
The most expensive stock in this store is ramen.

853
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,820
Oh.

854
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:54,820
I was the one who neglected that part.

855
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,820
So you got fired?

856
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,820
I retired from the responsibility.

857
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:04,820
Don't be a burden to the adults and go to Seoul.

858
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:13,820
No, I'm here to face the consumers and find a way to revive this farm and large mart.

859
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:23,820
I'm going to find a way.

860
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:27,820
Hey, did you think I wouldn't be able to come to Korea if you went to the airport early?

861
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,820
Where are you?

862
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,820
I heard everything from Ms. Mo.

863
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,820
You said I'm Baek Hyo-ne's parent.

864
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,820
Shall we make a bet now?

865
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,820
Okay, don't do that.

866
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,820
I'm sorry.

867
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,820
If you want to save Hong Soo-cheol, bring all the addresses I took and the ones you ran away with.

868
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:46,820
I won't say anything.

869
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,820
There's an amusement park nearby.

870
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,820
Do you want to go tomorrow?

871
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,820
Okay, I'll go.

872
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,820
I'm going to the amusement park next to Geon-woo.

873
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:03,820
I'm going to the amusement park.

874
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,820
Where's mom?

875
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,820
Mom's here.

876
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:16,820
Hi, mom.

877
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:22,820
Hi, mom.

878
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,820
It's delicious.

879
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:29,820
Is it good?

880
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,820
Geon-woo, look at me.

881
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,820
You're so good.

882
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,820
Geon-woo.

883
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,820
I'm a little tired.

884
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,820
Can you get me some coffee?

885
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,820
Coffee?

886
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,820
I'll be here for a second and get it for you.

887
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:55,820
It's a little cold because it's the sun, right?

888
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:05,820
Hand.

889
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:15,820
I'll be right back.

890
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:21,820
Wait for me.

891
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:31,820
I'll be right back.

892
00:54:51,820 --> 00:55:01,820
I'm going to the bathroom.

893
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:11,820
Is it the bathroom?

894
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:21,820
I'm going to the bathroom.

895
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:31,820
I'm going to the bathroom.

896
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:41,820
Tae-hee.

897
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:47,820
Tae-hee.

898
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,820
Tae-hee.

899
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,820
Tae-hee.

900
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:57,820
Tae-hee.

901
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:07,820
What should I do?

902
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:11,820
I'm giving you a warning.

903
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:15,820
31-year-old Hong Socheol is looking for his wife.

904
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,820
If you're a wife, please come to the care center as soon as you hear the broadcast.

905
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,820
What?

906
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,820
The adult is in the care center?

907
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,820
I'll give you another warning.

908
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:31,820
Tae-hee, don't go.

909
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,820
I'll do better.

910
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,820
I'll do really well.

911
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,820
Please don't go.

912
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,820
Did your wife run away from her husband at the amusement park?

913
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,820
Awesome.

914
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,820
What are you trying to do with your husband?

915
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,820
If a man was a weird guy, he wouldn't have left me in a place like this.

916
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,820
He's not a weird guy.

917
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,820
What?

918
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,820
He's not a weird guy.

919
00:56:54,820 --> 00:57:07,820
My husband is the coolest guy in the world.

920
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:17,820
It's okay. Let's go.

921
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:33,820
Where have you been?

922
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:43,820
Why are you doing this in a place like this?

923
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:50,820
I can't go anywhere like this.

924
00:57:50,820 --> 00:58:00,820
Why are you doing this to me?

925
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,820
Come closer.

926
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,820
Come by luck.

927
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:20,820
Pick it with your own hands.

928
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:30,820
Come by luck.

929
00:58:50,820 --> 00:59:00,820
Come by luck.

930
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:30,820
Come by luck.

931
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:40,820
Come by luck.

932
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:50,820
Come by luck.

933
00:59:50,820 --> 01:00:00,820
Come by luck.

934
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:10,820
It's the last night.

935
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,820
Don't be so meaningless.

936
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:17,820
You're Hong Hae-in tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

937
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,820
Anyway, this is an opportunity.

938
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:21,820
What?

939
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,820
An opportunity to talk about it.

940
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,820
Now that I'm under surgery, I'm going to forget everything.

941
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,820
So?

942
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,820
Disappointments about me?

943
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:33,820
Things you were upset about.

944
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,820
Things you wanted to say but couldn't say?

945
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,820
Something like this.

946
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:45,820
Tell me everything, honestly.

947
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,820
It's okay.

948
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:51,820
I was honest and said it, and I got a reaction.

949
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,820
What are you talking about?

950
01:00:52,820 --> 01:01:01,820
I'm going to forget everything anyway.

951
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:06,820
It's done.

952
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,820
I mean, it's done.

953
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:13,820
It's not that it's not there.

954
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:19,820
Don't question me.

955
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:20,820
It's a two-way game.

956
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,820
I'm about to get a knife in my head.

957
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,820
What can I not listen to?

958
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,820
Tell me.

959
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,820
What is it?

960
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,820
You don't have that?

961
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:35,820
I'm choosing.

962
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:36,820
I guess there's a lot.

963
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:46,820
It's not that.

964
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:52,820
I'll do it because you told me to.

965
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,820
You're a little back and forth.

966
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,820
What's back and forth?

967
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:08,820
For example, if you give me a gift and I do it, I get angry and say, don't do this.

968
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,820
I'm telling you to do it moderately.

969
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,820
That's your standard.

970
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,820
I can't get into your head.

971
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:15,820
How do you know that's moderately?

972
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,820
No, that's...

973
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:20,820
And if you say something, I want you to listen to me instead of getting angry.

974
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,820
I listen to others well.

975
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,820
I think you're still angry.

976
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:26,820
No, I'm listening.

977
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,820
I usually frown when I listen.

978
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,820
And then...

979
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,820
You have endless complaints.

980
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:38,820
I love you.

981
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,820
What?

982
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:43,820
I love you.

983
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:49,820
You said you wanted to say it, but you said you couldn't.

984
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,820
Well, I did.

985
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,820
Try more.

986
01:02:53,820 --> 01:03:01,820
I don't think you can.

987
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:06,820
Thank you for making such a difficult decision.

988
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:17,820
From now on, don't be sick or hurt, and stay by my side for a long time.

989
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:25,820
Let's go on a trip together, go for a walk, exercise, fight, and make up.

990
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:35,820
Let's grow old doing something that's not that special.

991
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,820
Oh, right.

992
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:42,820
I'm going to forget all these sweet words.

993
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,820
It's okay.

994
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,820
I'll tell you again.

995
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:55,820
I'll tell you every day.

996
01:03:55,820 --> 01:04:12,820
I wrote about myself, you, and the times I've lived.

997
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:17,820
I hope you'll be my compass in my next life.

998
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,820
But I'll forget that I have this.

999
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:30,820
I'll write it down, so you keep it and give it to me.

1000
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,820
But when did you finish writing this?

1001
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,820
Don't read it in advance.

1002
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:36,820
Yeah.

1003
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:44,820
You can wait for me to wake up after the surgery.

1004
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:45,820
Okay.

1005
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,820
Don't think about fixing it.

1006
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:50,820
I'm going to make you do something.

1007
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,820
Okay.

1008
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:27,820
I'm going to make you do something.

1009
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:43,820
I heard you're going to have surgery at 10 a.m. in the morning.

1010
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,820
I have 10 minutes left. What should I do?

1011
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,820
It's going to be fine, right? Don't worry.

1012
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,820
Okay, don't shake your legs.

1013
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:57,820
Yeah.

1014
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:02,820
Honey, Peng-jun is alive.

1015
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:03,820
What?

1016
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:04,820
Really?

1017
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:06,820
The snail that peeled off the shell?

1018
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,820
You said you wanted to take the test.

1019
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,820
It's a miracle, right?

1020
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:14,820
What about this?

1021
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:18,820
Oh, my sister. This is a really good sign.

1022
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,820
Is that so?

1023
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:25,820
Then it will be fine.

1024
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:35,820
Our Hye-in.

1025
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:43,820
I'm here, I'm here.

1026
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,820
You're not going, are you?

1027
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,820
Where are you going?

1028
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:50,820
I have to be in front of you when I open my eyes.

1029
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,820
You know, the effect of the engraving.

1030
01:06:52,820 --> 01:07:00,820
I'm going to be rude to someone I've never seen like a little boy who just woke up from the egg.

1031
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,820
Don't worry.

1032
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:07,820
I'll be in front of you until you get tired of me as soon as I open my eyes.

1033
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:17,820
What if I don't remember anything and act like you don't know anything and act like I'm mean?

1034
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:21,820
You're mean for a day or two.

1035
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,820
That doesn't matter.

1036
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:29,820
Just get the surgery and come back safely.

1037
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:34,820
I'll be back.

1038
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:41,820
I'll be in your care then.

1039
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:51,820
I'll be back.

1040
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:09,820
I'll be back.

1041
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:39,820
I'll be back.

1042
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:09,820
I'll be back.

1043
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:19,820
I'll be back.

1044
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:29,820
I'll be back.

1045
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:35,820
Mr. Baek.

1046
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,820
Who are you?

1047
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:38,820
What's going on?

1048
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:41,820
You're under arrest for murdering Mr. Baek.

1049
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:44,820
What kind of murder?

1050
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:47,820
You can take action against him and get help from the attorney.

1051
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:52,820
If you think this arrest is unfair, please request for arrest.

1052
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:53,820
Wait a minute.

1053
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,820
I think there's a mistake.

1054
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:56,820
Give me a minute.

1055
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:58,820
You can talk to me when you get the investigation.

1056
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,820
Let's get it.

1057
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:01,820
Wait a minute.

1058
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:02,820
Wait a minute.

1059
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:04,820
My wife is in the process of surgery.

1060
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,820
I have to be there when she wakes up.

1061
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,820
Give me an hour or 30 minutes.

1062
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,820
I said I was supposed to be there when she woke up.

1063
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:21,820
I have to be there.

1064
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:24,820
Don't worry and go.

1065
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:27,820
I'll take care of Hyein.

1066
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:29,820
Is this your plan?

1067
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,820
What plan?

1068
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:32,820
What plan?

1069
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:50,820
I'm trying to protect my woman from the criminal.

1070
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:53,820
Hyein, Hyein, Hyein.

1071
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:59,820
Hyein, Hyein, Hyein.

1072
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:09,820
Hyein, Hyein, Hyein.

1073
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:19,820
Hyein, Hyein.

1074
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:29,820
Wait a minute.

1075
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:37,820
Wait a minute.

1076
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:45,820
If Mr. Baek is arrested, who's in Hyein's hospital right now?

1077
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,820
Where's the number Mr. Baek gave me?

1078
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,820
Wait a minute.

1079
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:54,820
Hey, stay here.

1080
01:11:54,820 --> 01:12:02,820
This number.

1081
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,820
Yes, I heard from the hospital.

1082
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,820
Don't worry. I'm here.

1083
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:11,820
After the surgery, Hyein will be recovered soon.

1084
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,820
We'll be there soon.

1085
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:16,820
Oh, I don't think you can do that.

1086
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,820
What do you mean I can't?

1087
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:20,820
I don't think you've been contacted yet.

1088
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:25,820
I did that because I thought it was best to wait until the funeral of Mr. Baek.

1089
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:29,820
But I can't keep up with the actions of the former members and the AM's charges.

1090
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:33,820
The prosecution will start soon, so it's probably banned from leaving the country.

1091
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:34,820
You bastard.

1092
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:37,820
I'll bring Hyein back safely.

1093
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:47,820
So leave Hyein to me now.

1094
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:57,820
I'm not asking you to confess.

1095
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:07,820
Request for a divorce.

1096
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:19,820
It's a good time. October 31st.

1097
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:23,820
The whole universe helped us.

1098
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:27,820
I'm sorry to hear that.

1099
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:39,820
Are we getting married?

1100
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:43,820
You're saying we're together?

1101
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:53,820
With you.

1102
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:58,820
I won't ask you if you're doing well or not.

1103
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:01,820
You'll still be pretty and healthy.

1104
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,820
You'll be doing well.

1105
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:13,820
Of course, with Baek Hyunwoo.

1106
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:43,820
Are you awake?

1107
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:04,820
Don't talk, it's hard.

1108
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:08,820
I'll talk.

1109
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:10,820
I don't know what's what.

1110
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,820
I don't know who you are.

1111
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:13,820
Of course.

1112
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:16,820
You just woke up after a big surgery.

1113
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:22,820
But the surgery was to remove the tumor in your head, so I don't remember the old days.

1114
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:25,820
You asked me before you went into the operating room.

1115
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,820
When I wake up, I want you to be next to me.

1116
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:32,820
So I couldn't go anywhere and stayed here.

1117
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:42,820
Baek Hyunwoo?

1118
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:19,820
Why?

1119
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:21,820
Do you remember that name?

1120
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:26,820
I only remember that name.

1121
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:30,820
I'm not Baek Hyunwoo.

1122
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:37,820
Your name is Hong Hyein, I'm Yoon Eunseong.

1123
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:44,820
We've been dating since college, and we've been hanging out, but we still love each other.

1124
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:47,820
Baek Hyunwoo is the man you married.

1125
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:52,820
I'm married?

1126
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:58,820
I don't want to tell you this, but you were betrayed by him.

1127
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,820
That's why you got divorced.

1128
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:03,820
I got divorced?

1129
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:08,820
He stalked you until recently, but he's been arrested for intercourse.

1130
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:11,820
He's a murderer.

1131
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:12,820
You were surprised, right?

1132
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,820
I'm sorry.

1133
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:20,820
Maybe the name that was left in your head was because of him.

1134
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:23,820
That's probably why.

1135
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,820
Don't think about anything and rest.

1136
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:35,820
I'll bring the teacher.

1137
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:53,820
I thought I wouldn't be able to see winter anymore.

1138
01:17:53,820 --> 01:18:15,820
I thought I wouldn't be able to see the first snow, but I can see it now.

1139
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:20,820
Of course, I thought I wouldn't be able to see the first snow, but I can see it now.

1140
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,820
Then?

1141
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:27,820
This is what happens when the first snow comes before the nail is gone.

1142
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,820
What?

1143
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:39,820
First love?

1144
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:55,820
I'm sorry.

1145
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:25,820
I'm sorry.

1146
01:19:46,820 --> 01:20:00,820
What is it?

1147
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:10,820
Is it the first snow?

1148
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:25,820
What's wrong with you?

1149
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:35,820
What's wrong with you?

1150
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:37,820
What's wrong with you?

1151
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:47,820
What?

1152
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:57,820
I'm scared.

1153
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:17,820
I'm scared.

1154
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:47,820
I remember you memorizing the law.

1155
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,820
What?

1156
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,820
You said you weren't a master of the dark.

1157
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:51,820
But?

1158
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:54,820
What was the secret to your good at memorizing?

1159
01:21:54,820 --> 01:22:02,820
Well, I just memorized it once I saw it.

1160
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:08,820
Did you eat it by tearing it up when you memorized it?

1161
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,820
A goat girl?

1162
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:20,820
I just couldn't memorize everything, so I picked out the important things and repeated them over and over again.

1163
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:24,820
Then when I take the test, I remember that voice.

1164
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:28,820
I remember it unconsciously.

1165
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:31,820
But why?

1166
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:36,820
Just.

1167
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:46,820
What is it?

1168
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:16,820
Baek Hyunwoo.

1169
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:26,820
Baek Hyunwoo.

1170
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:36,820
Baek Hyunwoo.

1171
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:42,820
Don't forget, Lee Ilhoon.

1172
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:48,820
Baek Hyunwoo.

1173
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:59,820
Baek Hyunwoo.

1174
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:28,820
Baek Hyunwoo.

1175
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:38,820
Baek Hyunwoo.

1176
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,820
I was worried.

1177
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:43,820
I'm going to protect you now.

1178
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:53,820
I'm going to protect you.

1179
01:24:53,820 --> 01:25:03,820
I'm going to protect you.

1180
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:13,820
Thank you.
