1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,740
slowly

2
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,740
count from one to ten.

3
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,740
Thank you.

4
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,740
Count from one to ten.

5
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,740
Count from one to ten.

6
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Count from one to ten.

7
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
Count from one to ten.

8
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,740
You know,

9
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
I'm not a bad guy.

10
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,740
I've been threatened many times.

11
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,740
So how do you live

12
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,740
against a truck?

13
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,740
We were both in the car.

14
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
I thought you were in the car.

15
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,740
I was trying to save you.

16
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,740
I was in a hurry.

17
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,740
Are you okay?

18
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,740
It's okay.

19
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,740
I just want to see you stop

20
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,740
suffering because of Baek Hyunwoo.

21
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,740
When Baek Hyunwoo tried to divorce you

22
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,740
because of another woman,

23
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,740
you even tried to die.

24
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,740
He tried to die because of a cheating guy?

25
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,740
You were pathetic.

26
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
I was pathetic.

27
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,740
You were too tender and kind.

28
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
You were married back then,

29
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,740
so I couldn't do anything for you.

30
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,740
But now you're different.

31
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
I'm going to protect you now.

32
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
No matter what you do.

33
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,740
This is the bus stop at Seonbang.

34
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
You're Baek Hyunwoo, right?

35
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,740
Why were you here

36
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
during the victim's trial?

37
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
I promised to meet him.

38
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,740
But I couldn't.

39
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
Why was Baek Hyunwoo's hair

40
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,740
found in the victim's car?

41
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,740
I think someone could have left it there.

42
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,740
Then what about this?

43
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,740
This knife was found near the crime scene.

44
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,740
Your fingerprints and victim's blood came out.

45
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,740
The victim's assets and knives were exactly in the same place.

46
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Are you going to use them?

47
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,740
If the weapon was my fingerprints,

48
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,740
would I have left it near the crime scene?

49
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
That's not an attack.

50
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,740
This was an accident in Germany.

51
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,740
These are the wounds from breaking the glass.

52
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
If the hand that was holding the knife

53
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,740
had slipped and was attacked,

54
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
it would have been the back of the hand

55
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,740
or the bottom of the hand.

56
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
I don't know.

57
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
You're the one who's making the claim,

58
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
but the evidence is so clear.

59
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,740
It won't be easy to escape.

60
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,740
Confessing is better than your own imagination.

61
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Isn't that what the lawyer knows best?

62
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,740
Baek Hyeon-woo, if this happens again,

63
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
don't save me.

64
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,740
Baek Hyeon-woo even tried to die

65
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,740
when he tried to divorce you

66
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,740
because of another woman.

67
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,740
Baek Hyeon-woo

68
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Baek Hyeon-woo

69
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
Hye-in!

70
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Hye-in!

71
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,740
Mom!

72
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,740
Mom, can you recognize me?

73
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
Oh my god!

74
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,740
Are you okay?

75
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
Are you not sick anymore?

76
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,740
Sister, you must be tired.

77
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
Hello.

78
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Father, mother, auntie...

79
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,740
I'm Hong Su-cheol.

80
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,740
I've heard a lot about you.

81
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,740
Let's have a meal later.

82
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
Hye-in!

83
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,740
Hye-in is a little tired

84
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,740
after the flight.

85
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,740
I think we should go and rest.

86
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
I don't think you're fit to be here.

87
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,740
Hong Su-cheol,

88
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,740
I hope you don't overreact to Yoon Eun-sung.

89
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Who?

90
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
Hye-in, do you know what this person

91
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,740
did to my family?

92
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
I think I left all your family

93
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
and took over the Queen's.

94
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,740
But in fact,

95
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,740
the chairman who was tired of the

96
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,740
property dispute of his children died

97
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
and handed over the position to me.

98
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
He left the management of the property to his mother.

99
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,740
The chairman wanted to give it all to you,

100
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
but your parents and brother

101
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
couldn't leave it.

102
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
If it was not enough,

103
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
would the people in your family

104
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,740
like the news that you were going to die?

105
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
Of course.

106
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,740
I know about it.

107
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,740
I've read a lot of newspaper articles.

108
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,740
I don't think we were

109
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,740
so happy to see each other

110
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
while we were so happy.

111
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Did you have any contact with your family?

112
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
No.

113
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
That's what I'm talking about.

114
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
I'm a red pepper.

115
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740
Can you give me your will?

116
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,740
I told you to get back together,

117
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,740
so you're being wary.

118
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,740
I stopped him from talking to you in person.

119
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
He asked me to do it before the surgery.

120
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
I can't imagine what kind of relationship

121
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
it was just because no one came with me

122
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,740
when I had such a big surgery.

123
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Before, you must have been lonely.

124
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,740
I was lonely.

125
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,740
I was always alone.

126
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,740
But I was like that too.

127
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,740
That's why we were

128
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,740
the only ones for each other.

129
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,740
Don't believe your family.

130
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,740
I don't want to see you

131
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,740
being used anymore.

132
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,740
No, I don't know what he was talking about.

133
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,740
Don't believe him.

134
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,740
We're family.

135
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,740
Who are you listening to?

136
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
I heard that you put a charm

137
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,740
in your wallet that could break my ear.

138
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,740
Did you say that?

139
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
It's true.

140
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
My mom gave it to me.

141
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,740
I don't think that's important.

142
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Ha-in.

143
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,740
Your mother was sued

144
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,740
for being a part of the department store.

145
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
She was immediately arrested.

146
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
That's not what I'm talking about.

147
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
Don't think that the bad past

148
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,740
will disappear

149
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,740
just because I lost my memory.

150
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,740
Ha-in, as you said,

151
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,740
our family had a lot of problems.

152
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
But it's a misunderstanding.

153
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,740
Right.

154
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,740
And that's not next to him.

155
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,740
It should be next to your husband.

156
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,740
Oh, my ex-husband?

157
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
He got caught writing a divorce paper

158
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
and got divorced without me knowing.

159
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
That's true.

160
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
But he's a bad guy

161
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,740
because he's so weak.

162
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,740
But that's not all.

163
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
You're in the detention center

164
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
for murder.

165
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
You're not going, are you?

166
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
You have to be there

167
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,740
when I open the door.

168
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
Why are you going home?

169
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
I've prepared a place

170
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
for you to live comfortably.

171
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
I used to live there,

172
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,740
so I'm going to live there.

173
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
I'm going to live there.

174
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
I used to live there,

175
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,740
so I'm going to live there.

176
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
You might think of something

177
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,740
at least a little bit.

178
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
I'll do that.

179
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
I'm worried that I'll be caught

180
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
by your family

181
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
and be a weak point.

182
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
It was so hard for your parents

183
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
to get you back to work.

184
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
The directors kept asking about

185
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
your health, so...

186
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
I know.

187
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

188
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Thank you for worrying about me.

189
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
Thank you is enough for me.

190
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
Now keep your promise.

191
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
We'll get married after the surgery.

192
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
We promised each other.

193
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,740
I'll take care of the wedding.

194
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
You're here.

195
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
It's been a while.

196
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
I have something to ask you.

197
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Before Hyein got the surgery in Germany,

198
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
there was an accident.

199
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Is that your mother?

200
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,740
Yes.

201
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,740
She's not dead.

202
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,740
What's the problem?

203
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Why are you looking at me like that?

204
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
Didn't you know?

205
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,740
I told you everything.

206
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
As long as you're with Hyein,

207
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
you don't know what will happen again.

208
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
It's the same for the rest of your life.

209
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
Are you done threatening me?

210
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Then I'll do it too.

211
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
This room.

212
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
Right?

213
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,740
Where Chairman Hong Man-do collapsed.

214
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,740
I saw everything you did

215
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,740
in front of this painting I gave you.

216
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,740
I left enough evidence.

217
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,740
So you're doing something to Hyein

218
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,740
just once again.

219
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,740
I can send you to jail like Baek Hyun-woo.

220
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,740
You dare to...

221
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
You dare to...

222
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
You dare to...

223
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
Yes.

224
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
I'm your nuisance now.

225
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,740
You can get rid of me.

226
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,740
What if I say I'm going to marry Yoon Eun-sung?

227
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
No way.

228
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
He was like that a hundred times earlier.

229
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
He's like a different person.

230
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,740
Hyein won't do that.

231
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,740
I've been following you.

232
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,740
You're from the Hong Gil-dong Detectives' Office?

233
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,740
Yes.

234
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
Gil-dong is our family's elder.

235
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,740
People have been asking me for help.

236
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
They're very talented.

237
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,740
I'm a detective.

238
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,740
I'm a detective.

239
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,740
I'm a detective.

240
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,740
They have been asking me for help.

241
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,740
They've been asking me for help.

242
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
They're very talented.

243
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
I'm still using that name.

244
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,740
What?

245
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,740
Take out $10 million.

246
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
Give me the rest of the $1 million.

247
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
Forget about the building.

248
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,740
I bought it to go out.

249
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,740
That's enough.

250
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,740
You're a detective too.

251
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,740
I'm a mistress.

252
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,740
Nam Yoon-won, get out.

253
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,740
I'm a mistress.

254
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,740
They're friends like a self-proclaimed Wu Baek-goo.

255
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,460
I can't find any other place to look at these

256
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,460
Detective Hong is the brain of our office

257
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
He's the type who doesn't let go of his books

258
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,460
He used to run a book business

259
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,460
What kind of business?

260
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
He used to run a comic book store

261
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Comic books are the database of all the cases in the world

262
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
It became the source of my detective life

263
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,460
Then what kind of case did you make as a detective?

264
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Any case you know of?

265
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,460
You should find out yourself

266
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,180
If you're a good detective, you don't need to ask me

267
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,180
How much do you charge for the receipt?

268
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,180
Detective, I'll ask you that question

269
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,180
How much do you charge for the meal?

270
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,180
It's 8,000 won per meal, but it's a little hot

271
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,180
Jjajangmyeon is 12,000 won in my neighborhood

272
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,180
What?

273
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,180
The price is a big deal

274
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,180
We should be paying the price instead of catching the culprit

275
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,180
You have a heavy mouth

276
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,900
Who is that?

277
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,900
Oh, it's you

278
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
Wait a minute

279
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Good job

280
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Who are they?

281
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,900
They followed us when Hae-in was in Germany

282
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,900
We're the detective office that takes out one sheet

283
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,900
regardless of how much you've seen

284
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
We provide full package of information on the case

285
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
such as the case's details, the source of the case,

286
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
the psychological analysis, the solution, and the AS

287
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
We're a total human follow system

288
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Oh, they're pretty good

289
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,620
So, what did you follow in Germany?

290
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,620
Listen to me

291
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,620
You can put down your worries in one go

292
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
What's so empty?

293
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
I wrote a new book

294
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
This is it, right?

295
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
You have the same taste in music

296
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Yeah, we can have the same taste

297
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
What kind of person is he?

298
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,900
I mean, if he knows me, he's a 100% sure-to-be

299
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
But he doesn't know me

300
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Then...

301
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
shouldn't he know at least him?

302
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Yeah

303
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
If we have to meet, where else would it be as safe as this place?

304
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
He's such a vicious man

305
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
He stalked the ex-wife who cheated on him

306
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
and even killed someone to come here

307
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
How low-minded was Hae-in in his previous life?

308
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,900
Why would he do this to someone like this?

309
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

310
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
I'm sorry

311
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
I'm sorry

312
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
I'm sorry

313
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
I'm sorry

314
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
I'm sorry

315
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,900
I'm sorry

316
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
I'm sorry

317
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
I'm sorry

318
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm sorry

319
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,900
I'm sorry

320
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,900
I'm sorry

321
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,900
I'm sorry

322
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
I'm sorry

323
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
I'm sorry

324
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,900
Hae-in

325
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
Have a seat, Baek-hyun

326
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,900
What are you doing there?

327
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
I think it's because you're okay

328
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,820
How's the surgery going?

329
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
The treatment is going on, and where you're sick...

330
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,380
Are you worried about me now?

331
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,940
A lot

332
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,180
I was worried a lot

333
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,180
It's funny

334
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,180
You really think I don't know anything because I don't remember?

335
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
I wanted to see you

336
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,620
I knew everything

337
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,620
What your goal was to marry me

338
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,620
How you prepared for divorce

339
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,620
What you did to me after the divorce

340
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
I heard everything and checked everything

341
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
Hyein

342
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,940
Even if you don't know what you heard from Yoo Yoon-sung

343
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,940
That's not true

344
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,860
It's confusing now

345
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,860
But trust me

346
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,860
I only believe what I see

347
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,860
The divorce application you wrote without me

348
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
And you who is now a murderer

349
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,860
I saw it with my own eyes

350
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
Then why are you here today?

351
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,860
I checked everything

352
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,860
You said you knew everything

353
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,860
What do you want to know?

354
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,860
Didn't you come because you couldn't believe it?

355
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
The reason I came here

356
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,780
I came

357
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,780
Because

358
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,780
I don't want to

359
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,780
See you again

360
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,780
I don't want to see you again

361
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,780
I was curious

362
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,780
But I saw it

363
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,780
I won't see you again in my life

364
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,780
No

365
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,780
We will meet again

366
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,780
I won't get tired

367
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,780
I will be by your side

368
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
I won't get tired

369
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
How can a person who has a dream say that?

370
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
When you woke up

371
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
I promised to be by your side

372
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
I'm sorry I kept talking alone

373
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
I'm sorry I made you come here

374
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
I'm really sorry

375
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
But

376
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,700
I'll be out soon

377
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,700
I'll keep this promise

378
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
So you

379
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Jin-hwan, it's time

380
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,700
Eat well

381
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Don't worry about anything else

382
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
I'm getting treated well

383
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Jin-hwan, stay healthy

384
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
Stay healthy

385
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Stay healthy

386
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Jin-hwan

387
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
I should have answered

388
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,620
This is

389
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,620
Not a normal person

390
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,620
He's got a number plate on his jacket

391
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
He knows why he was bullied

392
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,620
He knows

393
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,620
He's very sly

394
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
Not normal

395
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,620
Give me a pill

396
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,620
My heart is

397
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,540
My heart is pounding

398
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,540
I'm out of my mind

399
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,540
Wait

400
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,540
I'm getting dizzy

401
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,540
I'm going to cry

402
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,540
Thank you

403
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,540
Where have you been?

404
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Why are you here?

405
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,540
Answer my question

406
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,540
Where have you been?

407
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,540
I don't want to answer

408
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,540
Can you leave?

409
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,540
And no matter what

410
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,540
It's unpleasant to be in the house without a owner

411
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,540
I'm sorry

412
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,540
But you're still being treated

413
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,540
I told you there were a few accidents that targeted you

414
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,540
Yeah

415
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
You said it was all Baek Hyun-woo's doing

416
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,460
He's in the detention center right now

417
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
Am I still in danger?

418
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,460
I'm just

419
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
I'm nervous

420
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
If you're not by my side

421
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Something will happen

422
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
I'm sorry

423
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,460
For making you worry

424
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,380
Yeah

425
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,380
I'm sorry

426
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,380
I'm sorry

427
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,380
Oh my god

428
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,380
I think the rumor is true

429
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,300
It's over with Mr. Baek

430
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Be careful

431
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
We all wrote a secret note

432
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Especially with Ms. Na

433
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,300
There's nothing to be careful about

434
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
He's not my boss anymore

435
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
What's the matter

436
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Boss

437
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,300
Hello

438
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
I heard about it

439
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
Are you okay now?

440
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
Yes

441
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,300
I'm so glad

442
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
You paid for the surgery and the hospitalization

443
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,220
And Chul-young

444
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,220
Now I have a name

445
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
So-yul

446
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,220
So-yul is healthy now

447
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,220
That's good

448
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,220
Thank you so much

449
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
Did I do that?

450
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,220
Yes

451
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,140
It was before I came

452
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,140
Thank you for keeping your promise

453
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,140
Promise?

454
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,140
What?

455
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,140
You promised me that you would be back

456
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,140
Before the part

457
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,140
You were a secretary before?

458
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,140
Yes

459
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,140
You must know a lot about me

460
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,140
Right

461
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,140
You can think of me as a human's nephew

462
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,140
So

463
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,140
Oh, the boss...

464
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,140
Boss!

465
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,140
Boss, I was so happy to hear that you came back.

466
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
You're healthy now, right?

467
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,140
I'm an employee that you knew from the past.

468
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
Nice to meet you.

469
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:46,140
Thanks to you, I was able to get treated and go to my mother's last.

470
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,140
You sent me flowers at the funeral hall, and even supported the funeral fee.

471
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,140
I won't forget it even if you don't remember it.

472
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Thank you.

473
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,140
You're welcome.

474
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,140
You sent flowers to the funeral hall of the employee's family.

475
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,140
I was a delicate person.

476
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140
That was... Mr. Baek...

477
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,140
Huh?

478
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,140
No, you were a good person.

479
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:22,140
So, you came to the store once to buy the bugs that eat the sales.

480
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,140
You're warm.

481
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,140
Is this new? Where are you going? How?

482
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,140
I'm really curious.

483
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,140
Tell me.

484
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,140
Where are you going? How? Why?

485
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,140
You're kind.

486
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,140
Was I really like Mother Teresa?

487
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,140
Yes.

488
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,140
I knew it. I thought so.

489
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:49,140
I saw a stray cat on the way here today, and I wanted to feed it.

490
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,140
So I bought it for you.

491
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,140
I think you're the kind of person who doesn't want to do good deeds.

492
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:01,140
The memory has been erased, but the nature remains the same.

493
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,140
Let's do it well.

494
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,140
Huh?

495
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,140
You said it was a human external hard drive.

496
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,140
I'm like a reset main board, so I need an external hard drive with data saved, right?

497
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,140
But I'm in another department right now.

498
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,140
I'll take care of that.

499
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,140
First, contact the prosecutor's evidence record.

500
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,140
Why?

501
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
It's a murder case.

502
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
The prosecutor's going to have a lot of evidence.

503
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:35,140
But if there's a report that hasn't been reported as evidence, it's going to help us.

504
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:45,140
So the prosecutor's record was removed from the fine evidence found at the crime scene.

505
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,140
Yes, it's a green fiber piece.

506
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,140
So that's not the case of the prosecutor's record?

507
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,140
That's why it was taken away.

508
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,140
I'm sure Jinbeom fell off the bus.

509
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,140
We have to find that.

510
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,140
The kitchen knife used as a crime is the one I used in my house in Seoul.

511
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,140
But why is that there?

512
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,140
Did someone steal it?

513
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,140
I don't think I saw it for a few days before I went to Germany.

514
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,140
I didn't care much then.

515
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
Did you steal it?

516
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,140
I'll look at the building's CCTV.

517
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
One more thing.

518
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,140
Please investigate the black box of the bus that was driving near the crime scene.

519
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,140
There could have been a suspicious car.

520
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,140
Jinbeom could have been on that bus.

521
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,140
Hello, how many days do you get?

522
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,140
Sir, I'd like to ask you something.

523
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,140
Is there any CCTV on the fishing ground?

524
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,140
Father, I chased after the guy on the roof.

525
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,140
What are you chasing?

526
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,140
A crow cried early in the morning.

527
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,140
I chased him well in the trial today.

528
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,140
No, I believe that today's trial will go well.

529
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,140
I believe that, but the crow crying is a little...

530
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,140
Oh, my God, let's eat.

531
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,140
Honey, don't eat too much.

532
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,140
What's wrong?

533
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,140
It's a wrap.

534
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,140
Hey, don't do all the wrapping, rolling, and mixing today.

535
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,140
Don't drop anything.

536
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,140
I feel a little bad if I drop anything.

537
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,140
Hello, sir.

538
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,140
Daya said she's tired and she'll rest more.

539
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,140
Oh, no.

540
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,140
This is not a drop.

541
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,140
Our Sujin's master...

542
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,140
The floor is...

543
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,140
This is...

544
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
It's melted.

545
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,140
That's right.

546
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,140
It's melted here, right?

547
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,140
I dropped it.

548
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,140
But I can just eat it.

549
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,140
I'll wrap it up and eat it.

550
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,140
The meat is so good.

551
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
I'm full.

552
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,140
It's true, but the victim didn't show up.

553
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,140
Therefore, I have never met him.

554
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
Please start the defendant's argument.

555
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,140
I respect you, Mr. Judge.

556
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,140
The defendant claims that he has never committed murder.

557
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,140
If this is true, there must be a real culprit.

558
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:48,140
First, please pay attention to the crime tool, which is the most decisive evidence from the prosecution.

559
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,140
In the kitchen knife, the victim's fingerprints and blood were...

560
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Green acrylic fiber.

561
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,140
As you can see, it's different from the defendant's clothes on the day of the incident.

562
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,140
But there is no evidence that it is the real culprit.

563
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,140
That's right.

564
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,140
But the person in that clothes...

565
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,140
He stole the crime tool from the defendant's house.

566
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,140
What if he was found near the crime scene on the day of the incident?

567
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,140
It's a knife.

568
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,140
It's the same knife as the crime tool.

569
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,140
The clothes he's wearing are green.

570
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,140
Next video.

571
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:44,140
The same person was burning shirts and gloves on the same day of the crime.

572
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,140
I tried to compare the fiber and the fiber on the crime tool.

573
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,140
I tried to compare the fiber and the fiber on the crime tool.

574
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,140
The results of the comparison were the same.

575
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,140
The victim's blood and DNA were also detected.

576
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,140
It's just indirect evidence.

577
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,140
Only the defendant's fingerprints were detected on the crime tool.

578
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,140
What if there is more clear evidence than fingerprints?

579
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,140
Like the video and the picture of the crime scene that the real culprit took?

580
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,140
There must be a picture or video of this person.

581
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,140
We need to secure his cell phone.

582
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,140
You left evidence of the crime scene?

583
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:26,140
If he was a professional investigator, he would have done that.

584
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,140
You need to leave evidence to get money.

585
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,140
You just need to click this URL.

586
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,140
Done!

587
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,140
His cell phone is being copied here!

588
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,140
From the anonymous informant,

589
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,140
I received a picture and video of the crime scene in the real culprit's cell phone.

590
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,140
I submit it as evidence.

591
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,140
There is a reason.

592
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
This is evidence that was not corroborated before.

593
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,140
It could also have been collected illegally.

594
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
Please note.

595
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,140
This is decisive evidence that will have a huge impact on the trial.

596
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
I admit.

597
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
This is the real culprit.

598
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,140
The real culprit of the murder in the reservoir in Yeongjin-gun is arrested.

599
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:42,140
The Busan Coast Guard arrested the real culprit, Yoo Mo, who tried to escape from the Nambam Buyeori Beach last night.

600
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,140
It is known that Yoo is claiming to be the only criminal without accomplices.

601
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,140
Meanwhile, Baek Mo, who was arrested as the suspect of this case,

602
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,140
was acquitted in the first trial today and was released immediately.

603
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Why isn't it coming out?

604
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
Isn't it wrong?

605
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
It will come out when it comes out.

606
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
But why are you here?

607
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,140
I can't do it myself.

608
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
The dangerous guy who stalked me was released.

609
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,140
Not the stalker?

610
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,140
Honestly, the boss is more like a stalker.

611
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,140
I'm scared.

612
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,140
Come down!

613
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
Our Mak Dong-ae!

614
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
What's going on?

615
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
Are you okay?

616
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,140
I'm fine.

617
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,140
You were worried, right?

618
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,140
I think there's a rule of the general.

619
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,140
I always made small mistakes, but I didn't make big ones.

620
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,140
What kind of mistake is that?

621
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,140
You're right.

622
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,140
Are you all right?

623
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,140
What is it?

624
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,140
I think there's a lot of misunderstanding.

625
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,140
Family relationships.

626
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,140
No, no.

627
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,140
It's okay.

628
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,140
But I don't think you two eat.

629
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,140
You don't eat tofu.

630
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,140
But do you hate tofu?

631
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,140
Why do you hate it? It's delicious.

632
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,140
What are you doing?

633
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,140
I'm going to eat it.

634
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,140
I'm going to eat it.

635
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,140
I'm going to eat it.

636
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,140
It's delicious.

637
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,140
What are you doing?

638
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
What are you doing?

639
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,140
Did you see me?

640
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,140
Did you see me?

641
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,140
Did you see me?

642
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,140
I went.

643
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
Did you go?

644
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,140
I went.

645
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
It's good.

646
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,140
Let's follow him.

647
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,140
What?

648
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,140
Are you really going to stalk him?

649
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,140
What are you talking about?

650
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
I'm just going to follow him.

651
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,140
I'm not going to do anything weird.

652
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,140
I'm going to read it and see if he's going to do something weird.

653
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
That's exactly what stalking is.

654
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,140
No, I don't have time to talk about that.

655
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,140
Let's go.

656
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,140
You have to align the horizontal line.

657
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,140
I'm doing it.

658
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,140
You can go down if you're scared.

659
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
I have to help you.

660
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
Brother, are you okay?

661
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,140
It's okay.

662
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,140
Let me go because I want to.

663
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,140
The boss is crazy.

664
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
Please take this.

665
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,140
My sister likes dumplings.

666
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,140
I'll do it.

667
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,140
This is for you.

668
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,140
Thank you.

669
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,140
Congratulations.

670
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,140
Thank you.

671
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,140
Have a nice day.

672
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,140
Yes, go in.

673
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Do you understand my marketing philosophy?

674
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,140
It's not about getting money from customers, it's about getting love.

675
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
I'm sorry.

676
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,140
I'll also manage that philosophy when I make a comeback.

677
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,140
Fighting.

678
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,140
Director, is the hopang half the price?

679
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,140
Hopang?

680
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,140
Hey, how much is the half price?

681
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
It's free.

682
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,140
Take it all.

683
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,140
This is free too.

684
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,140
You'll regret it tomorrow, right?

685
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
Tomorrow?

686
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,140
You'll regret it tonight.

687
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,140
I think Bae Young-woo is coming.

688
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,140
Dad, I'm here.

689
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,140
Good job.

690
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,140
I'm sorry, dad.

691
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,140
Hey, I'm sorry.

692
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
I didn't do anything wrong.

693
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
What are you sorry about?

694
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,140
Brother, you did a great job.

695
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,140
Congratulations.

696
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,140
Congratulations.

697
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,140
Congratulations.

698
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,140
Thank you.

699
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,140
Thank you.

700
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,140
Congratulations.

701
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,140
Isn't that Hong Suk-cheol?

702
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:30,060
Yes, he's been avoiding us because of the

703
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,060
I guess he's comfortable.

704
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:37,060
They're really weird people.

705
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,060
Honey, it's Bong-hye.

706
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,060
Mom.

707
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,060
Hey, I made your favorite sweet red bean porridge.

708
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,060
You were worried, right?

709
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,060
Hey, I'm not worried at all.

710
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,060
Is it a life-saving rule?

711
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,060
No, no.

712
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,060
I was really worried.

713
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,060
Me too.

714
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,060
You did a great job.

715
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,060
Your parents have a good impression.

716
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,060
You don't like tofu, but you like sweet red bean porridge.

717
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,060
It's a child's taste.

718
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,060
Sweet red bean porridge?

719
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,060
I like it.

720
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,060
It's like seeing me in the past.

721
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,060
I did it before I became a fan of BTS.

722
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,060
The real person is...

723
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,060
I love him so much.

724
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,060
No, no.

725
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,060
What is it?

726
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,060
What is he?

727
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,060
He's starting here.

728
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,060
Secretary Na, did you always say everything you wanted to your boss?

729
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,060
Yes.

730
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,060
I was a cool boss.

731
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,060
I can't think of anything.

732
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,060
Then, give me 100 million won.

733
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,060
100 million won?

734
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,060
100 million won?

735
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,060
100 million won?

736
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,060
100 million won?

737
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,060
That's impossible.

738
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,060
You don't remember, but you have a clear judgment.

739
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,060
But why don't you know?

740
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,060
What?

741
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,060
Who your boss really likes.

742
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,060
Who?

743
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,060
I can't say more because I'm in a hurry.

744
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,060
I'll just talk about this.

745
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:26,060
You have a heart where your body goes.

746
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,060
What is this?

747
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,060
Mr. Ivan found it in the trash.

748
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,060
He thought we should give it back to his owner.

749
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,060
Does it say your name on it?

750
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,060
No, it's written in your foreign language.

751
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,060
That's why I can't understand the content.

752
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,060
Then we have to give it back?

753
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,060
Are you going to throw it away?

754
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,060
Could that be?

755
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,060
A lawyer from Korea called Mr. Baek's notebook.

756
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,060
He said if we find it, we have to give it back to him.

757
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,060
Then we have to give it back to him.

758
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,060
Then we have to give it back to him.

759
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,060
Then we have to give it back to him.

760
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,060
He said if we find it, we have to give it back to him.

761
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,060
He said if we find it, we have to give it back to him.

762
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,060
He said if we find it, we have to give it back to him.

763
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,060
Boss, I'm going to pee.

764
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,060
Where are we going?

765
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,060
I'm going to get some rest.

766
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,060
I'll be back in a minute.

767
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,060
Aunt, do you live here?

768
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,060
We are here to congratulate Mr. Baek.

769
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,060
The catering company will arrive soon.

770
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,060
We can set up the food for the village, right?

771
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,060
Did you come, Ms. Han?

772
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,060
Oh, my God, you're here, too.

773
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,060
I'm in great mood, so I prepared a lot of gifts.

774
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,060
See you later.

775
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,260
I'm done. See you later.

776
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,060
What's so cool about it?

777
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,660
It's got all the health products and the massage machine.

778
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,260
The first prize is the latest drum washing machine.

779
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,460
Oh, the washing machine?

780
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,060
Oh my gosh! A washing machine?

781
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,060
I was going to change my washing machine.

782
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,860
Is this what you call a flex of the rich?

783
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,660
I want to live like a criminal when I'm born again.

784
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,460
Like me? Like what?

785
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,860
A pig. A pig.

786
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,660
I want to get married three times.

787
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,260
That's what I'm most jealous of.

788
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,260
Stop talking about that.

789
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,860
Why not? I need to be able to do that.

790
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,860
Of course.

791
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:57,060
What can a life without a washing machine change?

792
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,260
You're not going to say that in front of a guy who's never been there.

793
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,260
Are you really not going to get married?

794
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,860
The kindergarten teacher is really nice.

795
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,660
Yeah, he's the first one to make it hard for you.

796
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:14,260
Everyone, you should hurry up and get married.

797
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,660
How about next week?

798
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,860
Excuse me! Where is the village council?

799
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:31,860
Everyone, congratulations!

800
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:41,860
Everyone, thank you for spending your precious time with your younger brother Baek Hyunwoo.

801
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:49,260
Now, let's start the highlight of the day, the tofu cutting ceremony.

802
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,260
Let's go!

803
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,260
Together.

804
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,260
One, two, three.

805
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,260
Oh, that's neat.

806
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,260
Thank you!

807
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,260
Congratulations!

808
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,260
Congratulations!

809
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,260
The next gift is a health product.

810
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:17,260
This is from my sister, Ms. Baek.

811
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,260
Please come out.

812
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,260
The number of the lucky person is...

813
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,260
Number 17!

814
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,260
It's a room!

815
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,260
It's a room!

816
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,260
It's a room!

817
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,260
Congratulations, sister.

818
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,260
Thank you, Hyunwoo. I'll be prettier.

819
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:02,260
Now, we're just about to start the first prize.

820
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:07,260
Today, we have a prize sponsor, Mr. Hong Beomja.

821
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,260
Applause!

822
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,260
Applause!

823
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,260
The prize is...

824
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,260
Number 5! Congratulations!

825
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,260
Who is it?

826
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,260
It's Youngsuk!

827
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,260
It's yours!

828
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,260
It's yours!

829
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,260
It's yours!

830
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,260
It's yours!

831
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,260
It's yours!

832
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,260
What are you doing?

833
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,260
What?

834
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,260
Why?

835
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,260
I don't need it. I needed you guys.

836
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,260
Really?

837
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,260
Really?

838
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,260
Excuse me, Mr. Kim Youngsuk.

839
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,260
Yes, Ms. Beomja.

840
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,260
Don't you have any greed?

841
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:29,260
You got a washing machine. You should have it.

842
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,260
My washing machine is still usable.

843
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,260
It's been a long time. I've seen it all.

844
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,260
But it's still easy to wash.

845
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,260
This is the latest model.

846
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,260
It's AI, it can wash blankets and shoes.

847
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,260
Oh, okay.

848
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,260
Oh, okay?

849
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,260
If you get good things, you should get them.

850
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,260
Why don't you get it?

851
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,260
I won't come back here if I go to Seoul.

852
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,260
But you won't get me?

853
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,260
What if I go to Yeongnyeong?

854
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,260
I can't get married three times.

855
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,260
Are you getting married again?

856
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,260
That's not what I meant.

857
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,260
I'll tell you just once.

858
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,260
I like you.

859
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,260
I mean, I like you.

860
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,260
Are you going to let me leave like this?

861
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,260
I'm not going to come back here if I go.

862
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:38,260
I'm not going to come back here if I go.

863
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,260
Oh, auntie.

864
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,260
Oh, wait.

865
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,260
I have something to ask you about Kim Young-seo.

866
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,260
I'll be right there.

867
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,260
Oh, no.

868
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,260
Huh?

869
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,260
Why?

870
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,260
Yes, yes.

871
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,260
Yes, it's wireless.

872
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,260
It's connected to the speaker in there.

873
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,260
I'm going to get married.

874
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,260
Why don't you get it?

875
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,260
I won't come back here if I go to Seoul.

876
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,260
But you won't get me?

877
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,260
What if I go to Yeongnyeong?

878
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,260
I can't get married three times.

879
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,260
That's cool.

880
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,260
Are you getting married again?

881
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,260
Are you stupid?

882
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,260
That's not what I meant.

883
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,260
That's not what I meant.

884
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,260
I'll tell you just once.

885
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,260
I like you.

886
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,260
I mean, I like you.

887
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,260
I'm not going to leave you.

888
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,260
I'm not going to come back here if I go.

889
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,260
Oh, my God.

890
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,260
It's a shame.

891
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,260
Hey, Young-seo, answer me.

892
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,260
It's okay.

893
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,260
It's okay.

894
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,260
It's okay.

895
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,260
It's okay.

896
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,260
Where are you going?

897
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,260
No, no, no.

898
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,260
Where are you going?

899
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,260
No, no.

900
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,260
You have to push it.

901
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,260
Go, go, go.

902
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,260
Go, go, go.

903
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:23,260
Chairman, Baek Hyun-woo applied for a job at the board of directors.

904
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,260
He was found innocent in the first round,

905
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,260
so he cannot legally refuse a job.

906
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,260
He's not a zombie.

907
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,260
He's a little bit of a pain.

908
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,260
I know.

909
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,260
There's a bigger problem.

910
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,260
There's going to be an LP hearing in New York.

911
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,260
They're going to discuss the CEO's dissatisfaction.

912
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,260
What are you talking about?

913
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:49,260
If the CEO doesn't give the funds to investors,

914
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,260
the LPs can collect the documents and discuss the CEO.

915
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,260
No, no, no.

916
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,260
Who gave the documents to the LPs?

917
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,260
Baek Hyun-woo?

918
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,260
Is that right?

919
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,260
That's not it.

920
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,260
What do you think?

921
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,260
I'm going to wear it at the inauguration ceremony.

922
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,260
Oh, the inauguration ceremony.

923
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,260
What are you talking about?

924
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,260
It suits you so well.

925
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,260
It suits me, right?

926
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,260
I should have gone to a place that really suits me.

927
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,260
Call the bank.

928
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,260
Ask them to proceed with the CD transaction twice,

929
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,260
up to 4.2%.

930
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,260
At once?

931
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,260
We don't have time.

932
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,260
We need to secure as much shares as possible.

933
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,260
How dare they cut me off?

934
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,260
Oh, okay.

935
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,260
They bought 4.2% at once.

936
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,260
I guess they're in a hurry.

937
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,260
I guess so.

938
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,260
The debt is slowly being paid off.

939
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:48,260
Have you found the information that the CEO was going to give at the end?

940
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,260
Yes, but I got another piece of information.

941
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,260
It's evidence that the Yuen Sung family

942
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,260
was trying to steal the Queen's business card

943
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,260
and committed a fraud in the second half of the year.

944
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,260
Oh, my. Who did you get this from?

945
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,260
Did you bring it?

946
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,260
I got it from the US.

947
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,260
This is all I have.

948
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,260
What's wrong with you?

949
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,260
What's wrong with me?

950
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,260
I gave you all the money I got from Osu-ri,

951
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,260
and now I don't have it.

952
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,260
You should have brought the money returned from that house.

953
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,260
That's the money from that house.

954
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,260
Where's the USB?

955
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,260
Did Dahee give you that?

956
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,260
Yes.

957
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,260
I told you.

958
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,260
That's my life's money.

959
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,260
I'm going to give it to you.

960
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,260
What?

961
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,260
I told you.

962
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,260
That's my life's money. I hid it.

963
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,260
Your life's money?

964
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,260
Oh, you idiot.

965
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,260
You're going to die because of that.

966
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,260
What?

967
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,260
Mrs. Mo doesn't want to see you anymore.

968
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,260
I let you go because you're pretty.

969
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:01,260
You know that Mrs. Mo hates pretty girls more.

970
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,260
Hey, stay still.

971
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,260
Stay still.

972
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,260
I said stay still.

973
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,260
I said stay still.

974
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,260
You bastard.

975
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,260
Hey, hey.

976
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,260
Stay still.

977
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,260
Stop the car.

978
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,260
Stop the car.

979
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,260
Stop the car.

980
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,260
Put our arms on it.

981
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,260
Mr. Kito.

982
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,260
What are you doing?

983
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,260
Shit.

984
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,260
What's going on?

985
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,260
Did you see that?

986
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,260
I told you, I told you.

987
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,260
I told you.

988
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,260
I told you.

989
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,260
What's going on?

990
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,260
What's going on?

991
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,260
What are you doing?

992
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,260
What are you doing?

993
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,260
You bastard!

994
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,260
Let go of my daughter!

995
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,260
Stay still!

996
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,260
Mr. Su! Run!

997
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,260
Mr. Su! Mr. Su!

998
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,260
Oh, shit!

999
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,260
Sir, you should go when they let you go.

1000
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,260
Huh?

1001
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,260
Don't let go of me!

1002
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,260
Why are you here?

1003
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,260
Run!

1004
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,260
Stay still!

1005
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,260
Oh, shit!

1006
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,260
Oh, shit!

1007
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,260
Mr. Su!

1008
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,260
Oh, shit!

1009
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,260
You bastard!

1010
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,260
You bastard!

1011
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,260
Oh, shit!

1012
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,260
Come out!

1013
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,260
Dahye! Geon-woo!

1014
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:37,260
I have to protect my people someday, but I can't do anything?

1015
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,260
I can't even imagine.

1016
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,260
Oh, shit!

1017
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,260
An exaggerated reaction.

1018
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,260
The opponent is like, oh, this is nothing.

1019
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,260
Oh, this is the game I won.

1020
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,260
Oh, my fist is no joke!

1021
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,260
So that I can get a tight grip.

1022
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,260
Let's go.

1023
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,260
Oh, shit!

1024
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,260
The opponent is waiting for the moment to let go.

1025
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,260
And then he takes a decisive shot.

1026
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,260
Hey, let's go.

1027
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,260
Hey, put the bicycle away.

1028
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,260
Oh, shit!

1029
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,260
Oh, shit!

1030
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,260
Hey, hey!

1031
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,260
What are you doing?

1032
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,260
Mr. Su!

1033
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,260
Mr. Su!

1034
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,260
Get up!

1035
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,260
Mr. Su!

1036
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,260
Oh, shit!

1037
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,260
Oh, shit!

1038
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,260
The dragon is going to eat Geon-woo!

1039
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,260
Mr. Su!

1040
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,260
Get a grip!

1041
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,260
Mr. Su!

1042
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,260
Are you going to die?

1043
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,260
Mr. Su!

1044
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,260
Mr. Su!

1045
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,260
No, Mr. Su!

1046
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,260
Geon-woo!

1047
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,260
Geon-woo, I can't love you!

1048
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,260
Geon-woo!

1049
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,260
Geon-woo!

1050
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,260
Me too.

1051
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:53,260
Oh, shit!

1052
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,260
Oh, shit!

1053
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,260
What's wrong with me?

1054
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,260
I'm sorry, mom and dad.

1055
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,260
What?

1056
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,260
Why am I the victim?

1057
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,260
I'm the boss.

1058
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,260
It's so funny.

1059
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,260
Who is he?

1060
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,260
I'm going to ask him.

1061
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,260
I think we need to talk.

1062
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,260
I'm going to ask him.

1063
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,260
I have one, too.

1064
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,260
You did a welfare?

1065
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,260
Yes.

1066
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,260
Why?

1067
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,260
Because of me?

1068
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,260
It's my job.

1069
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,260
Don't you have a lot of places to go?

1070
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,260
I think that's my choice, but...

1071
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,260
I'm uncomfortable.

1072
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,260
I'm uncomfortable.

1073
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:16,260
So please quit the company.

1074
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,260
Go somewhere else.

1075
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:19,260
I really...

1076
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,260
I don't want to see you.

1077
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,260
Why do you look at me like that?

1078
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,260
I was the most difficult person in my life.

1079
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,260
I'm the dumbest person in my life.

1080
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,260
I'm going to be too much if I seduce you.

1081
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,260
Did I?

1082
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,260
I said I liked you.

1083
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,260
I said I trusted you.

1084
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,260
I said it out loud.

1085
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,260
I thought you'd recognize me soon.

1086
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,260
But...

1087
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,260
But I'm fine.

1088
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,260
I think it's natural.

1089
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,260
You're more shameless than I've ever heard.

1090
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:59,260
You're going to take a bite of my family and get something?

1091
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,260
Why are you working so hard?

1092
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,260
Don't call my name.

1093
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:06,260
I don't know if it's because of the way you looked at me before.

1094
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,260
It's not anymore.

1095
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,260
Let's really stop seeing each other.

1096
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,260
What are you doing?

1097
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,260
Don't do this, Baek Hyunwoo.

1098
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,260
No...

1099
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,260
No, change.

1100
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,260
I don't like this kind of thing.

1101
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,260
Let go of me.

1102
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,260
I'm sorry.

1103
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,260
Haeng-ah!

1104
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,260
It's me.

1105
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,260
Grace.

1106
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,260
Oh, my God.

1107
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,260
You really forgot everything.

1108
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:35,260
You're the one who liked and trusted me more than anyone in the world.

1109
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:37,260
I'm sorry.

1110
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,260
I'm sorry.

1111
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,260
I'm sorry.

1112
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:43,260
I'm sorry.

1113
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:47,260
You're the one who liked and trusted me more than anyone in the world.

1114
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,260
What?

1115
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,260
I'm sorry.

1116
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:59,260
I don't think we're the kind of relationship to talk and touch.

1117
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,260
What's wrong with you?

1118
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,260
It's me.

1119
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,260
I'm sorry.

1120
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,260
How did you know?

1121
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,260
What?

1122
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,260
How dare you?

1123
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,260
Why are you being fooled by Yoon Eun-sung?

1124
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,260
What is this?

1125
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,260
It's me?

1126
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:39,260
I sent you an invitation?

1127
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,260
I'm sorry.

1128
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,260
I'm sorry.

1129
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,260
I'm sorry.

1130
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,260
Please come in.

1131
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,260
Okay.

1132
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,260
Please come in.

1133
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,260
Why is there no one inside this big place?

1134
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,080
I'll help.

1135
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:51,320
I'll take care of him.

1136
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:05,340
My friends in Harvard are in your ride.

1137
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:11,160
I hope my friends today are inmate.

1138
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,060
Now, we will begin the wedding of bride Hong Hyein

1139
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:17,000
and groom Baek Hyeonwoo.

1140
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,100
Bride, enter.

1141
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,160
Bride, enter.

1142
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,560
How are you doing, Hyeonwoo?

1143
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,560
You didn't get divorced, did you?

1144
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,560
Do you have children?

1145
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,560
One? Two?

1146
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,560
It doesn't matter if you don't have children.

1147
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,560
I only need Hyein to be by my side.

1148
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,560
Don't make Hyein cry.

1149
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,560
Make her happy.

1150
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,560
10 years later, Hyein,

1151
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,560
I know you won't be able to see this,

1152
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,560
but if you are,

1153
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,560
why would you?

1154
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,560
Do what you have to do.

1155
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,560
I won't ask you if you're doing well.

1156
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,560
You'll still be pretty and healthy.

1157
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,560
You'll be the most popular.

1158
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,560
Of course, I'll try with Baek Hyeonwoo.

1159
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,960
I'll come with Baek Hyeonwoo.

1160
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,960
Are you Baek Hyeonwoo?

1161
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:24,960
Yes.

1162
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,960
As you were the whole family,

1163
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,960
we made a reservation for the bouquet.

1164
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,360
I left this place as a whole?

1165
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,360
When?

1166
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,360
About a month ago?

1167
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,360
You left four years ago.

1168
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,360
Then...

1169
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,360
I saw it because it was the best date course.

1170
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,360
Why isn't there anyone?

1171
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,360
Ms. Hong,

1172
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:53,360
I think the whole universe

1173
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,360
is helping us these days.

1174
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,760
I know.

1175
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,760
I see.

1176
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,760
It wasn't the universe that made us stay,

1177
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,760
but you did.

1178
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,760
I didn't know that.

1179
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

1180
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,760
I'll go now.

1181
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,760
Baek Hyeonwoo, don't think about living together

1182
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,760
without getting married because you don't remember me.

1183
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,760
I'll have to wear a wedding dress again.

1184
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,760
I wouldn't have bought this.

1185
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,760
I would've wanted to marry another man

1186
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,760
who cheated on me and cheated on another woman.

1187
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,760
I wouldn't have done that.

1188
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,760
Yes, you wouldn't have.

1189
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,760
If I were that kind of person,

1190
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,760
you wouldn't have done this.

1191
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,760
So, you should doubt me.

1192
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,760
It's okay if you don't believe me,

1193
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,760
but don't believe what Yoon Eunseong says.

1194
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,760
Don't believe anything and doubt me.

1195
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,760
Yoon Eunseong

1196
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,760
hasn't been the one who's been protecting you.

1197
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,760
He's been isolating you from your family and me.

1198
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,760
Fortunately, we were both in the car.

1199
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,760
But I thought you were in the car

1200
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,760
and tried to save you.

1201
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,760
What happened?

1202
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,760
What happened?

1203
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,760
It's so nice.

1204
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,760
You're asking me what happened.

1205
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,760
I came because I had something to ask you.

1206
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,760
Wait.

1207
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,760
I'm going to have another drink.

1208
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,760
Do you want to drink?

1209
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:39,760
I'm fine.

1210
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,760
I'm fine.

1211
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:25,760
What?

1212
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,760
Haein,

1213
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,760
let's go to the States together.

1214
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,760
What?

1215
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,760
You and I were abandoned by our families.

1216
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,760
So, let's go together

1217
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,760
with the people who were abandoned.

1218
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,760
Let's go and live happily.

1219
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,760
Are you sure I was abandoned too?

1220
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,760
Why?

1221
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,760
Do you think I'm lying?

1222
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,760
It's not like that.

1223
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,760
Let's talk about it later.

1224
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,760
Let's talk about it when you're sober.

1225
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,760
You said you had something to ask me.

1226
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,760
I don't think I need to ask you.

1227
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:45,760
I'll go.

1228
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,760
Okay.

1229
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,760
It's me, Navi.

1230
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,760
I don't have my old phone.

1231
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,760
You know, Baek Hyunwoo.

1232
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,760
Tell me his phone number.

1233
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,760
Send it to me.

1234
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:47,760
I'll send it to you.

1235
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,760
Baek Hyunwoo?

1236
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,760
It's me, Haein.

1237
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:07,760
I need to talk to you.

1238
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,760
Where are you?

1239
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,760
Okay.

1240
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,760
I'll be there soon.

1241
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,760
Hello?

1242
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,760
I'm sorry.

1243
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,760
I'm sorry.

1244
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,760
I'm sorry.

1245
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,760
I'm sorry.

1246
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,760
I'm sorry.

1247
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,760
I'm sorry.

1248
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,760
I'm sorry.

1249
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,760
I'm sorry.

1250
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,760
I'm sorry.

1251
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,760
I'm sorry.

1252
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,760
I'm sorry.

1253
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,760
I'm sorry.

1254
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,760
I'm sorry.

1255
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:00,760
I'm sorry.

1256
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,760
I'm sorry.

1257
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,760
I'm sorry.

1258
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,760
I'm sorry.

1259
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,760
I'm sorry.

1260
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,760
I'm sorry.

1261
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,760
I'm sorry.

1262
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,760
I'm sorry.

1263
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,760
I'm sorry.

1264
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,760
I'm sorry.

1265
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,760
I'm sorry.

1266
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:11,760
I'm sorry.

1267
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,760
I'm sorry.

1268
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,760
I'm sorry.

1269
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,760
I'm sorry.

1270
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:15,760
I'm sorry.

1271
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,760
thin

1272
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:39,760
rides up and down.

1273
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,760
I don't want you to be a bad person.

1274
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,760
Instead,

1275
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,760
you should miss me in spring, summer, fall, winter,

1276
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,760
and even four seasons.

1277
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,760
You should call my name after drinking.

1278
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,760
But from then on,

1279
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:56,760
forget everything and live happily.

1280
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,760
Have a great relationship, get married,

1281
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,760
and have a good family.

1282
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,760
I won't play with you.

1283
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:11,760
I'm already sick.

1284
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,760
And write down the property of my life

1285
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,760
in a good place.

1286
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:23,760
I'm worried because I think I might die.

1287
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,760
Can I go to heaven for good things?

1288
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,760
That way, I'll see you again later.

1289
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:35,760
I'm a little sad just thinking about this.

1290
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:41,760
But if I live well and get surgery,

1291
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,760
and forget you,

1292
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,760
if I treat strangers,

1293
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,760
if I lack that and make them ugly,

1294
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:58,760
so you get tired of me,

1295
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,760
what should I do?

1296
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,760
But don't get tired of me.

1297
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:11,760
Don't get tired and keep loving me.

1298
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,760
I'm a pine tree anyway,

1299
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,760
so I'll love you again.

1300
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,760
I said I was a pine tree,

1301
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,760
so I could trust you,

1302
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,760
and I thought you'd recognize me soon.

1303
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,760
Please hold on until then.

1304
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,760
We'll never see each other again.

1305
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,760
We'll meet again.

1306
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,760
I won't get tired and I'll be by your side.

1307
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,760
And when I recognize you,

1308
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,760
come to me three times.

1309
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:02,760
And Hong Hae-in.

1310
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,760
The surgery was successful

1311
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,760
because you were watching this.

1312
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,760
You're saying you don't remember anything, right?

1313
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,760
Then I'll introduce this man.

1314
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:20,760
Baek Hyun-woo fixes things well.

1315
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,760
It's a tray.

1316
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,760
It just opens when you pull it.

1317
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,760
But he's a bit nagging.

1318
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,760
If you get a paper, take it out.

1319
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,760
Why did you take out the copy machine?

1320
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,760
I got a paper,

1321
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:42,740
so I'm trying to get it out with some kind of a

1322
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:47,760
Don't kick me.

1323
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,760
Does it hurt?

1324
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:57,760
It just hurts a little.

1325
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:11,760
Should I go see if it hurts?

1326
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,760
It's easy to fool.

1327
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,760
Baek Hyun-woo, do you know?

1328
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,760
There's a black knight in the basement of our company.

1329
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,760
His name is Young-sook.

1330
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,760
Young-sook.

1331
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,760
There's a special move that makes people excited when they drink,

1332
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,760
so you have to be careful.

1333
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,760
I'm the black knight of Hong Hae-in.

1334
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:37,760
Did you feel uncomfortable because of me earlier?

1335
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,760
I'm so embarrassed.

1336
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,760
Don't cry when you're crying.

1337
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,380
If you get a sleeve, you'll hear a sound, so you should be careful not to get a

1338
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:51,760
handkerchief.

1339
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,760
If you still don't know, just memorize it.

1340
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:02,760
That man is the reason I didn't want to lose my memory.

1341
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:09,760
And even if I lose my memory, it's the only reason I wanted to live.

1342
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:26,760
Baek Hyun-woo is a name I don't want to forget until the end.

1343
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:32,760
I was happy to be with him in this life.

1344
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:42,760
I'll pray that he's by your side in your life that will begin now.

1345
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,760
I'm sorry, Baek Hyun-woo.

1346
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:57,760
I'm so sorry.

1347
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:12,760
I'm sorry.

1348
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:22,760
I'm sorry.

1349
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:52,760
I'm sorry.

1350
01:22:52,760 --> 01:23:02,760
I'm sorry.

1351
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:12,760
I'm sorry.

1352
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:42,760
I'm sorry.

1353
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:12,760
I followed Yoon Eun-sung and Hong Hae-in's German life.

1354
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:28,760
First of all, Yoon Eun-sung was very dedicated to his liver disease.

1355
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:38,760
I'm sorry.

1356
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:48,760
I'm sorry.

1357
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:58,760
It's okay.

1358
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,760
I'll do it.

1359
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,760
It's okay.

1360
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:02,760
You can do it alone.

1361
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,760
Women never say to their favorite man, it's okay, I'll do it alone.

1362
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,760
They try to turn it around somehow.

1363
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,760
But Hong Hae-in was firm.

1364
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,760
Even if you don't remember, you know your heart.

1365
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,760
Oh, I'm not attracted to this guy.

1366
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:24,760
I'm sorry.

1367
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:34,760
I'm sorry.

1368
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:54,760
I'm sorry.

1369
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:24,760
I'm sorry.

1370
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:34,760
I'm sorry.

1371
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:44,760
I'm sorry.
