00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
The

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,880
the

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,880
the

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,880
the

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,880
the

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,880
the

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,880
the

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,880
the

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,880
the

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,880
the

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,100
the

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,100
the

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,100
the

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,100
the

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,100
the

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,100
the

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,120
the

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,120
the

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,120
the

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:12,700
S¡¶¡¶

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,080
Mr. K.護士, come out!

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,240
Please come out!

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,120
I'm a 35-year-old man, T.A. patient.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
I'm unconscious.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Excuse me.

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Yes, we're passing by.

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,120
Do you want to get married?

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,120
If we get married,

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,120
I might become a stranger than you think.

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,120
I'm not sure yet,

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,120
but our house is different from Baek Hyunwoo's house.

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,120
People live differently.

33
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
No, it's because you don't know.

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Our house is very different.

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,120
So you might be embarrassed and have a hard time.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,120
But even if you're alone,

37
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,120
I can't listen to you.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
Excuse me.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Are you refusing to propose?

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
No.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Why are you saying this?

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120
If you don't want to, then it's okay.

43
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm not going to propose.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
What do you know about marriage?

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
If it's not, then it's okay.

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
That's not something to think about so easily.

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
I'm fine.

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,120
If you're really okay with it,

49
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,120
I want to marry you.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,120
I want to live with you.

51
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,120
I want to live with you.

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,120
I want to live with you.

53
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
If we live together,

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,120
even if you don't support me,

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,120
I can support you.

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Then we'll be sharing the same bed anyway.

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
That's how marriage is.

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Sharing the same bed,

59
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,120
and getting on the same boat.

60
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,120
If you get caught in the boat, you die together.

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,120
So you're saying I'm living the way you live.

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Isn't that right?

63
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Is that right?

64
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
I don't know about you yet,

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,120
but the world isn't as easy as you think.

66
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
I was scammed the other day.

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
By a lawyer?

68
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Exactly.

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,120
The person who's scammed the other day

70
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,120
is smarter than the lawyer.

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,120
I was fooled.

72
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
But in life,

73
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,120
there are so many things that are more eerie

74
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,120
and unfair than scammed.

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Even then, if I'm on the boat

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,120
and you're with me,

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,120
I think it'll be great.

78
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Even if I spend the night

79
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
and get old,

80
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,120
I think I'll feel more secure.

81
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,120
Isn't marriage supposed to be with someone like that?

82
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:35,120
That's why I proposed to you today.

83
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Here.

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Here.

85
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,120
My son is in the hospital.

86
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Baek Hyeon-woo.

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Our Baek Hyeon-woo?

88
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Yes, the one in the living room.

89
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
What?

90
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
A car accident.

91
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Oh, Baek Hyeon-woo?

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Is he alive?

93
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Yes.

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
He has a lot of late-stage fracture and a damaged liver.

95
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,120
We need a search test because we suspect late-stage fracture.

96
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Yes.

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Is he alive?

98
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Sir.

99
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
Thank you for your concern.

100
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Honey, where is our Hyeon-woo?

101
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Over here.

102
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Let's go to the hospital.

103
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
What is this?

104
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Are you awake already?

105
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
What is all this?

106
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Did you do this?

107
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Did you bring me here like that?

108
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
I told you I'd protect you.

109
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
I'll do anything to protect you.

110
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
You're doing this to protect me?

111
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Yes.

112
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,120
I can't stand you being fooled and hurt by Baek Hyeon-woo.

113
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
So...

114
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,120
I had to stop you.

115
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
So where are we?

116
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Answer me first.

117
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Why did you go to see Baek Hyeon-woo?

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
I can't answer you.

119
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,120
How long do I have to understand you,

120
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,120
be patient with you, and forgive you?

121
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,120
I don't want to hate you either.

122
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Actually, I saw the note.

123
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Someone sent it to me in Germany.

124
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,120
I think I wrote it before the surgery.

125
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
The handwriting looked similar.

126
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
But the content was different from what you said,

127
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
so I wanted to check it.

128
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,120
That's why I wanted to meet Baek Hyeon-woo and ask him.

129
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Really?

130
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,120
But in fact, the handwriting can be imitated

131
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
and I don't even know if I really wrote it.

132
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,120
It could be a dream if I wanted to.

133
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
So?

134
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
You're right.

135
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,120
I shouldn't have asked you first.

136
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
You'll never be sorry for misunderstanding

137
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,120
and getting angry.

138
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,120
So let's go home first.

139
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
I'm right.

140
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,120
I heard everything I said.

142
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,120
If you think it's too short, listen to me.

143
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Go with Ha-ran.

144
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,120
And get married.

145
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Ha-ri will pick us up at dawn.

146
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
I'll send the next bus.

147
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,120
You just have to follow me.

148
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,120
I just have to go home.

149
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I barely went back to the department store.

150
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,120
You can leave it to the professional manager for a while

151
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,120
and come back later.

152
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Okay?

153
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Answer me.

154
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Okay, let's do that.

155
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,120
It's snowing a lot today and it's not registered.

156
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
It's hard to track down the location.

157
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,120
It's the same with calling the police.

158
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Did you sleep well?

159
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Why are you here?

160
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
You said it was an emergency room.

161
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Did you find it?

162
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
You're a newbie.

163
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Go to the hospital.

164
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Go.

165
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Did you come here because it's an emergency room?

166
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,120
I just got a call from Baek Hyun-woo.

167
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
He said Hong Hye-in disappeared.

168
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Disappeared?

169
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,120
She just disappeared like smoke.

170
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,120
I told him to secretly find her

171
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
but I thought he should know.

172
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
What did you tell her?

173
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
That Hye-in disappeared.

174
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,120
It'll be faster for you to find her.

175
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,120
I think it's about CEO Yoon.

176
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
I'm worried that she might cause trouble

177
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,120
before the inauguration ceremony.

178
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Okay, you can leave.

179
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Okay.

180
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,120
There's no good evidence.

181
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,120
AOMG New Peking Entertainment City 772772.com

182
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,120
The most exciting PG game on the line.

183
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
The mahjong is over.

184
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,120
The mahjong is over.

185
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
The queen of the prize pool.

186
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,120
The gold-guaranteed city.

187
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
The talented cat.

188
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
The gold captain.

189
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
The super high odds.

190
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
The high reward rate.

191
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

192
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Hurry up and join.

193

AOMG New Peking Entertainment City 772772.com

194
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Come.

195
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Let's go.

196
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Let's go.

197
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,120
The real culprit of the murder case has finally changed his mind.

198
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
He hasn't called his actor Yoon Eun-sung yet,

199
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
but he said he wasn't the only culprit.

200
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Yoon Eun-sung must have heard the news.

201
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
That's why he's trying to make a big scene.

202
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Hey.

203
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Are you sleeping?

204
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Hyun-woo.

205
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Hyun-woo.

206
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Hey.

207
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
Sit down.

208
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,120
If you don't sleep, don't be so scary and talk.

209
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,120
If you sleep, you'll be snoring.

210
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
If the guy who ran out of the emergency room is quiet,

211
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
how scary would I be?

212
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
I'm not going to die. Don't worry.

213
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Oh, I'm going crazy.

214
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Hyun-woo, I'm a divorce lawyer.

215
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Who doesn't know?

216
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Divorce is not a good thing, but anyway,

217
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
people who come to me are all like that.

218
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,120
You're getting divorced to live your remaining life better?

219
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,120
So I have the pride of helping people who want to live their lives better.

220
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
So?

221
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
But you're not.

222
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
You don't have any guts to live.

223
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
You're like a man who's dying to die.

224
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Yang-gi.

225
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Do whatever you want.

226
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Don't call me sweetly with a low voice.

227
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Thank you for always being by my side.

228
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
Don't say anything.

229
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
You're a good guy.

230
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Don't talk to me like that.

231
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Are you really going to die or what?

232
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Where are we?

233
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,120
It's where the family's dormitory and villa are.

234
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Call the police.

235
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,120
If I go in and check and call them, they'll move.

236
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Hey, you're going in alone?

237
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Ah.

238
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,120
If you go this way, you'll see the door that leads to the kitchen.

239
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
When we came to the chairman's office,

240
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,120
we went back and forth and handed out the materials.

241
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Thank you.

242
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
But what happened?

243
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,120
What did you go back and forth to carry out before you left?

244
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Don't worry too much and go in.

245
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,120
I'll explain when the situation is settled.

246
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Hello.

247
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Where's my money?

248
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Is it here?

249
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I thought you came to see me because I was going far away.

250
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,120
I'll do whatever you want, but I'll give you the money and the file number.

251
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
What file?

252
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Ah.

253
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Are you really worried that your mother killed the chairman?

254
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Are you really afraid that I'll really expose it?

255
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
You know that.

256
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
I didn't tell you that.

257
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Since a long time ago.

258
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Ah.

259
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,120
I left something behind.

260
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
You go ahead.

261
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Why are you here?

262
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
To see my mother.

263
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
What if someone sees you?

264
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,120
I'll be there soon. Wait.

265
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Take a taxi.

266
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Mom.

267
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Don't get caught.

268
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Jo-han!

269
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
No!

270
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Jo-han!

271
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Jo-han!

272
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Jo-han!

273
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Jo-han!

274
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Jo-han!

275
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Jo-han!

276
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Yes!

277
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
What happened?

278
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
It's an accident.

279
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
What should we do? What should we do with my children?

280
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Yes.

281
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Please save my children.

282
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Jo-han!

283
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
Why haven't you left yet?

284
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Are you dead?

285
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
I saw everything.

286
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
You're the one who broke the boat.

287
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,120
But mom, they have to die quickly to live with me.

288
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
That's why I didn't tell anyone.

289
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
If I did that,

290
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
I thought you'd come to me soon.

291
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
I waited.

292
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
You don't know that, do you?

293
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,120
It's really hell to live while waiting for someone who doesn't come.

294
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Yes.

295
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
I don't know.

296
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,120
If I had died with Hong Hae-in then,

297
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,120
I wouldn't have ruined this.

298
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
I just feel sorry for that.

299
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Where's Ha-il?

300
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
He's in my drawer.

301
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
The password is your mother's.

302
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
What about the money?

303
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Why?

304
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,120
You said you'd protect me with that one day.

305
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,120
That's how your mother loves me!

306
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Wait.

307
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Hae-in!

308
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Hae-in!

309
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Hae-in!

310
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Where are you?

311
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
What's wrong?

312
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
What's wrong with your face?

313
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Are you hurt?

314
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
I'm fine.

315
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
You're not fine.

316
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Hold me.

317
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Don't do that.

318
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,120
If you keep running,

319
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
you'll find the front door.

320
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
My friend is there.

321
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Go ahead. I'll follow you.

322
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
How can you see me?

323
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,120
You left me alone and went away.

324
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,120
Was I that kind of person?

325
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
It's not that...

326
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
And I knew it.

327
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,120
I don't know what kind of person you were to me.

328
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,120
I regret what I did wrong.

329
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
I'll apologize to you later.

330
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Hold me.

331
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,120
We'll take the same boat tonight.

332
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
We'll go together.

333
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Hae-in!

335
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Go!

336
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Hae-in!

337
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Why are you there?

338
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Come here.

339
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,120
If you come now,

340
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
I'll let you go.

341
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
We agreed to go together.

342
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
I'm sorry,

343
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
but that will never happen.

344
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
I know why you were uncomfortable

345
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,120
and hateful when you didn't remember anything.

346
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Why am I uncomfortable?

347
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Tell me why you hate me.

348
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,120
My life is ruined because of you.

349
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
I'm trying, but why?

350
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Stop it!

351
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
It's over!

352
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
It's not over yet!

353
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
It's okay.

354
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
It's not too late.

355
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
Let's go.

356
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Please wake up!

357
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,120
I don't want to go with you.

358
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Okay.

359
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Even if I die?

360
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
Really?

361
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Yoon In-seok!

362
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Stop! Stop!

363
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
I'll let you go if you come tomorrow!

364
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
I'm sorry, Hae-in.

365
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,120
I can't let you go.

366
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
I'll take you...

367
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
I'll take you.

368
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Even if I kill you.

369
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
I'll let you go.

370
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Hae-in!

371
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Mr. Baek!

372
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Mr. Baek, wake up.

373
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Mr. Baek, what should I do?

374
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Wake up!

375
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Please help me!

376
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Mr. Baek!

377
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Baek Hae-in!

378
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Baek Hae-in!

379
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
We're moving the patient to the hospital.

380
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Tell the doctor that we need a emergency room.

381
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Yes, sir.

382
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
The bleeding continues.

383
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Please tell the doctor.

384
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
The blood pressure is 80 to 50.

385
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
It keeps dropping.

386
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
The patient will be pressed for blood pressure.

387
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Baek Hae-in,

388
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
wake up.

389
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,120
It's okay. We'll be going to the hospital soon.

390
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
Hang in there.

391
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
It's okay.

392
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Don't cry.

393
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Don't go.

394
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Where should I go?

395
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
Are you going to stay here?

396
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Don't worry about useless things.

397
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Just go get the surgery.

398
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
You're not going to go, are you?

399
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
I don't remember anything.

400
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
What if I pretend to be someone you don't know

401
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
and act like a bad person?

402
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
You act like a bad person for a day or two.

403
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
It doesn't matter.

404
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Just get the surgery.

405
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
And come back.

406
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Please.

407
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
I'll be back.

408
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
I'll be back.

409
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
I'll be back.

410
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Come back.

411
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I'll be back.

412
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
I'll be back then.

413
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Please take care of me.

414
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
I just did it.

415
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
I don't remember anything.

416
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
I pretend to be someone you don't know.

417
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,120
I acted like a bad person.

418
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
I don't remember anything.

419
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I just did it.

420
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
I'll be back.

421
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
I'll be back.

422
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
I'll be back.

423
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
I'll be back.

424
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
I'll be back.

425
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
I'll be back.

426
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
I'll be back.

427
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
I'll be back.

428
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
I'll be back.

429
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
I'll be back.

430
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
I'll be back.

431
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
I'll be back.

432
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
I'll be back.

433
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
What's going on?

434
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
It was noisy earlier.

435
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
You know Eunseong, right?

436
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
Yes, I do.

437
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
She died just now.

438
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
What's going on?

439
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
What's going on?

440
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
What's going on?

441
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
What's going on?

442
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
What's going on?

443
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
What's going on?

444
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,120
What's going on?

445
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
What's going on?

446
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
What's going on?

447
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Mom, when are you coming?

448
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, wait for me! Mom! Mom! I'll wait for you!

449
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,120
Mom! Mom! Mom, wait for me! Mom! Mom! I'll wait for you!

450
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Mom, don't go.

451
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Mom!

452
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
You're not sleeping?

453
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,120
I can't sleep. I'll stay a little longer and take some sleeping pills.

454
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
What are you looking at?

455
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
I liked it back then.

456
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,120
I know. I didn't know it was such a good time.

457
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Let's stop looking and go in.

458
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,120
It's okay now.

459
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,120
My family liked the beach here, so we went to play every year.

460
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,120
Since that day, I've never been there.

461
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
It's a good place.

462
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Right.

463
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
Wait.

464
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Why?

465
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
He's a great swimmer.

466
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,120
He did a lot of things like children's beach.

467
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
He even saved a baby who fell into the water.

468
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Why?

469
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,120
I think I saw this beach a lot somewhere.

470
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,120
Right. It was here that day.

471
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
Why didn't I recognize it?

472
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
What?

473
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
No!

474
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Brother!

475
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
It's a mess.

476
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Baby.

477
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
We are...

478
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
We are...

479
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,120
Hyun-woo's mom and dad.

480
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
I'm sorry.

481
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,120
I'm sorry.

482
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
I'm sorry.

483
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
What are you saying?

484
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,120
The police said you were shot.

485
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
Yes, it was me.

486
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,120
Hyun-woo was shot instead of me.

487
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,120
I'm sorry.

488
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
It's okay. Don't cry.

489
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,120
You won't do it to your father, will you?

490
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Don't cry. Don't cry.

491
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,120
I'm sorry.

492
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,120
I had another son.

493
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
He died when he was young.

494
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,120
I thought he died saving Hae-in.

495
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,120
It wasn't Hae-in's fault.

496
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,120
I hated my daughter all the time.

497
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,120
She was a terrible and pitiful mother.

498
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,120
But you did the same thing last time.

499
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,120
When you were young, you went to a camp and saved someone.

500
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
Yes, I did.

501
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,120
A port accident happened and I saved a girl who fell into the water.

502
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
I thought it was strange,

503
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,120
because of the scenery and the date.

504
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,120
I'll report it.

505
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,120
The patient's blood pressure is dropping.

506
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,120
Please prepare a sedative.

507
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
I'll give it to the patient.

508
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
Okay.

509
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,120
I think I was in the sea that day.

510
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
No, dad!

511
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
Are you going to save Hae-in?

512
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
I'm going to save Hae-in.

513
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,120
Please save Hae-in.

514
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
I'm going to save Hae-in.

515
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Please save Hae-in.

516
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Hae-in!

517
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Hae-in!

518
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
Hae-in!

519
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Hae-in!

520
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
There! There!

521
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
There! There!

522
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,120
There!

523
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Hae-in!

524
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,120
The person who saved Hae-in was

525
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,120
Hyun-woo.

526
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,120
What's going on?

527
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
What's going on?

528
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Hae-in!

529
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
How could this happen?

530
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
How could this happen?

531
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
I mean,

532
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,120
I didn't know how hard it was for Hae-in

533
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,120
to lose her son,

534
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,120
and I didn't think there would be anyone who saved Hae-in.

535
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,120
But that thankful person

536
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,120
didn't even know that she came to our house

537
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,120
to hate, to torture, to hurt him.

538
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,120
I was like that.

539
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
It's all in the past.

540
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,120
What's in the past is nothing.

541
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
Now,

542
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,120
all we have to do is pray for Hyun-woo

543
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,120
to wake up safely.

544
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,120
And when Hyun-woo wakes up,

545
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,120
we just have to be thankful.

546
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Yes.

547
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,120
I will.

548
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
The frequency is high.

549
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
There are many opportunities for revenge.

550
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
Hurry up and join.

551
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Macau New Beijing Entertainment City 772772.com

552
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,120
Madam, how could this happen?

553
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,120
How much is the house that Eun-seo has been saving?

554
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
It's 15.9%.

555
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
Go to the property management.

556
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
What?

557
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
I just checked.

558
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,120
My son is dead.

559
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,120
So all my son's is mine, right?

560
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,120
Yes, I understand.

561
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,120
And

562
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,120
how much is the remaining money

563
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,120
that you have to buy the house?

564
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,120
It's 7% off.

565
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,120
But the company will try to get on the same boat with us.

566
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,120
What's their goal?

567
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,120
They're just selling everything

568
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,120
and making money from the exit.

569
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,120
Tell them that you're not going to refuse them

570
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
for three years, but for a year,

571
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,120
and that you'll let them escape.

572
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,120
Yes.

573
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,120
The problems you just found out

574
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,120
were done by the former CEO of Yun Eun-seo.

575
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,120
It has nothing to do with me.

576
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
Then I'll be the chairman.

577
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,120
There's no legal problem.

578
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,120
Yes.

579
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,120
My position is very

580
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,120
I'll make it clear.

581
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,120
The damaged part is well-compatible.

582
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,120
There was a lot of bleeding.

583
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,120
There were injuries such as a fracture in the back bone

584
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,120
and a late bone fracture.

585
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,120
There was an emergency, so the surgery took a long time.

586
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,120
The patient endured it well.

587
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,120
However, the time when consciousness recovers is important.

588
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,120
Let's watch it for now.

589
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
I'm sorry.

590
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,120
I'm sorry.

591
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,120
I'm sorry.

592
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,120
I'm sorry.

593
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
I'm sorry.

594
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,120
I'm sorry.

595
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
I'm sorry.

596
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
I'm sorry.

597
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
I'm sorry.

598
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,120
I'm sorry.

599
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
Where's the file?

600
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,120
It's in my drawer.

601
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,120
It's my mother's birthday.

602
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,120
I'm sorry.

603
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,120
No.

604
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,120
Why don't you wake up?

605
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,120
What if I don't wake up?

606
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,120
I was very worried.

607
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,120
I missed you.

608
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,120
I'm uncomfortable.

609
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,120
I'm uncomfortable.

610
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,120
So please stop seeing the company.

611
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,120
Go somewhere else.

612
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,120
I really don't want to see it.

613
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,120
Why are you looking at me like that?

614
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,120
I'm the most difficult subject in my life.

615
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,120
I've become a fool who can't remember anymore.

616
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,120
If you seduce me, I'll fall for it again.

617
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,120
Did I?

618
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,120
I haven't apologized yet.

619
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,120
I don't remember everything yet.

620
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,120
I think I know.

621
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,120
Why my heart hurt so much as soon as I saw you.

622
00:45:54,120 --> 00:46:00,120
Why I wanted to see your face with all the excuses.

623
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,120
Whatever happened to us,

624
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,120
we're back together.

625
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,120
So make some money.

626
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,120
Listen to me.

627
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,120
Just tell me you're okay.

628
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,120
I'm so worried about you right now.

629
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,120
I miss you so much.

630
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,120
I miss you.

631
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,120
I drank water for 24 hours.

632
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,120
I'm serious.

633
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,120
I didn't eat anything.

634
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,120
Of course I didn't sleep.

635
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,120
Wait and see.

636
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,120
I'll be like this until you wake up.

637
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,120
You got shot instead of me to save me.

638
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,120
I was lying down like this and I couldn't get a grip.

639
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,120
How can I eat comfortably and sleep comfortably?

640
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,120
But you know, I'm still in treatment and I have to be careful.

641
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,120
I was so worried,

642
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,120
I can't help it even if I faint.

643
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,120
I'm crying so much right now.

644
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,120
I'm a little dizzy.

645
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,120
You're not going to get up?

646
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,120
Hyuna, are you awake?

647
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,120
Hyuna.

648
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,120
Good job.

649
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,120
You did so well. Thank you so much.

650
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,120
No, don't say it because it's hard.

651
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,120
Wait, I'll call the teacher.

652
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,120
I'm sorry.

653
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,120
Wait a minute. I'll call the teacher.

654
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,120
Are you okay?

655
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,120
No, you keep making me feel sorry.

656
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,120
You're going to worry about me even though you're sick and almost dead?

657
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,120
I'm fine.

658
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,120
I'm sorry.

659
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:23,120
I'm so sorry.

660
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,120
I didn't recognize you and I don't remember anything.

661
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,120
I didn't say anything.

662
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,120
I didn't remember either.

663
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:40,120
I don't know how much I wanted you.

664
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:50,120
I promised you that I would be with you no matter what.

665
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,120
I forgot everything.

666
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,120
I did it for you.

667
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,120
I'm sorry.

668
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,120
And I love you.

669
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,120
Thank you.

670
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,120
Thank you.

671
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,120
Thank you.

672
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,120
I'm sorry.

673
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,120
Oh my goodness.

674
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,120
Hyuna.

675
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,120
You're awake.

676
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,120
Oh my goodness.

677
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,120
Are you up?

678
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,120
Hyuna, you're okay.

679
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,120
You're okay. You're talking so well.

680
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,120
Am I?

681
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,120
What did you say?

682
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,120
I love you.

683
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,120
Hyuna, I love you too.

684
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,120
I love you, Hyuna.

685
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,120
I love you.

686
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,120
I love you too.

687
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,120
She's still sick.

688
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,120
No, no.

689
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,120
I'm sorry.

690
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,120
You did a good job.

691
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,120
I'm sorry.

692
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,120
A gunfight in the Korean Peninsula?

693
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,120
Am I going to work or filming a media show?

694
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,120
I'm so embarrassed.

695
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,120
It's more like a drama than a media show.

696
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,120
What do you mean?

697
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,120
Am I from the department of history?

698
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,120
I think this is a situation where we take everything away.

699
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,120
We kill each other and it's a bloodbath.

700
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,120
No, this is a melodrama.

701
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,120
Batman Dark Knight.

702
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,120
Batman is a melodrama?

703
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,120
He's a melodrama.

704
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,120
Batman worked so hard to protect his beloved woman

705
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,120
and the city.

706
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,120
Or Titanic.

707
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,120
He risked his life to save my woman.

708
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,120
I'm not really interested in that.

709
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,120
What do you think will happen?

710
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,120
Do you think the Queen's family will get back at Wang Yi?

711
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,120
Why? Are you nervous?

712
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,120
You gave the head of the Hong Su-cha company a message of goodwill, right?

713
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,120
It's probably too late now.

714
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,120
It's too late.

715
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,120
Anyway, I knew for sure this time.

716
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:41,840
Love, friendship,

717
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,120
support, loyalty.

718
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,120
These abstract terms.

719
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,120
It's not that you can't see it,

720
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,120
but it's not that you can't see it,

721
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,120
but it's that you're the strongest.

722
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,120
I couldn't say hello properly because I wasn't in the mood that day.

723
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,120
I'm Hyun-woo's friend, Kim Yang-gi.

724
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,120
I know.

725
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,120
You know?

726
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,120
I wrote it on my notebook.

727
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:15,120
Introducing a line about people around you.

728
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,120
What about me?

729
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,120
You're a lawyer for Baek Hyun-woo when you get divorced.

730
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,120
It's not an excuse,

731
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,120
but I was Hyun-woo's lawyer,

732
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,120
but I didn't do much as a lawyer.

733
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,120
I was rather a snitch.

734
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,120
I was told not to do this to you.

735
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,120
Okay.

736
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,120
But why did we get divorced?

737
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,120
What?

738
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,120
I thought you would know the most accurate divorce case.

739
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,120
We got a good friend because we got a wish

740
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,120
because of our busy schedule.

741
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,120
We got a good friend because we got a wish

742
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,120
because we got a busy schedule.

743
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,120
I know.

744
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,120
But do you need to know the exact reason now?

745
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,120
What?

746
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,120
I don't think it's meaningful to dig into the past.

747
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,120
It's more meaningful to think of the person who's lying down

748
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:05,120
because of the past.

749
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,120
You have a good friend.

750
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,120
I didn't know I was such a great friend.

751
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,120
Truth seems to be revealed in front of danger.

752
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,120
I think Hyun-woo is the same.

753
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,120
He realized how much he loved you.

754
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,120
He realized it very smartly.

755
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,120
Don't be so generous.

756
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,120
Are you really going to die?

757
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,120
What is it?

758
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,120
You really don't know anything.

759
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:40,120
I'm going because I want to live well.

760
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:45,120
If something happens to him or something goes wrong,

761
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,120
I can't sleep.

762
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,120
I don't know the front of life.

763
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,120
You said you couldn't live a day with Hong Ye-in.

764
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,120
Now you say you can't live without her.

765
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,120
Yes.

766
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,120
It's like that.

767
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,120
Hong Ye-in, if you don't want to regret it,

768
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,120
you should catch Baek Hyun-woo.

769
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,120
Look at how he wrote it.

770
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,120
He was in a hurry.

771
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,120
He's good at surgery.

772
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,120
He must have been worried about something.

773
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,120
I'm sure.

774
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,120
I'm sure.

775
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,120
I'm sure.

776
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,120
I admit it.

777
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,120
I'm sure.

778
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,120
I didn't do anything, but I got caught.

779
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,120
When did I see this?

780
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,120
This box.

781
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,120
Baek Hyun-woo.

782
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,120
Get up.

783
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,120
I think there's a misunderstanding.

784
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,120
I didn't write this red letter.

785
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,120
It's Hong Ye-in from my previous life.

786
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,120
I think I wrote it in a hurry.

787
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,120
Why are you replying to me?

788
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,120
Yes.

789
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,120
I just laughed.

790
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,120
I saw everything. Get up.

791
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,120
Yes.

792
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,120
Why?

793
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,120
Baek Hyun-woo, who told you to do this?

794
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,120
Where did you learn this?

795
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,120
Don't laugh.

796
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,120
I'm sick when I'm tired.

797
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,120
You can answer without laughing.

798
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,120
Let's go home.

799
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,120
I think we should.

800
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,120
Honey.

801
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,120
Why?

802
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,120
We should eat first.

803
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,120
I just ate a sandwich.

804
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,120
That's bread, not rice.

805
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,120
Really?

806
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,120
I left my bag inside.

807
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,120
The blue bag in the bed.

808
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,120
The blue bag is important.

809
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,120
This room is pink.

810
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,120
I'll go to the south.

811
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,120
I'll eat in my room.

812
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,120
I'm sorry.

813
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,120
Isn't it far?

814
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,120
It's a metropolitan area.

815
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,120
I went to church every day.

816
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,120
I was worried about that.

817
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,120
Good job.

818
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,120
Give me the hospital address.

819
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,120
We don't have to do anything.

820
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,120
Let's have some side dishes.

821
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,120
Yes.

822
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,120
Mr. Hong is sick.

823
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,120
He's sick.

824
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:55,120
I envy the nurse who took care of me.

825
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,120
He's even handsome.

826
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,120
Forget it.

827
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,120
Hyun-woo can't remember this.

828
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,120
He's just a new guy.

829
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,120
I envy him.

830
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,120
I envy him the most.

831
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,120
What?

832
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,120
He lived with my husband for 30 years.

833
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,120
When was the best time?

834
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,120
When we were dating.

835
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,120
When he was the coolest.

836
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,120
When he was the most unknown man.

837
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,120
I love him the most.

838
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,120
I don't think I know you.

839
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,120
You keep lying to me.

840
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,120
What do you mean?

841
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,120
I mean,

842
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,120
if you put it in a word,

843
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,120
you look like...

844
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,120
You look like him.

845
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,120
You graduated from a law school.

846
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,120
You even got a championship in boxing.

847
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,120
You were in the Marine Corps...

848
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,120
Not just the Marine Corps.

849
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,120
The Special Forces.

850
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,120
So you're a man with everything,

851
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,120
from head to toe?

852
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,120
Look at this, Baek Hyun-woo.

853
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,120
Yes, I'm looking.

854
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,120
No, no matter how much you want to look good,

855
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,120
this is too much. It's too perfect.

856
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,120
No, no. Is that all?

857
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,120
That's all.

858
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,120
I just picked out the points that would suit my taste.

859
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,120
Really?

860
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,120
I picked out your taste.

861
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,120
I know you want to get back at me

862
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,120
because you like me.

863
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,120
But you should at least tell me the truth.

864
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,120
Don't exaggerate.

865
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,120
Say it again.

866
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,120
I'm serious.

867
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,120
Honestly,

868
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,120
champion is a lie.

869
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,120
What?

870
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,120
I think it's my taste to laugh like that.

871
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,120
You know too much about me, Baek Hyun-woo.

872
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,120
I don't remember.

873
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,120
I'm too unfaithful.

874
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,120
Father, I'm here.

875
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,120
Did you forgive me now?

876
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,120
I'm sorry.

877
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,120
Father, my three siblings.

878
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,120
Now we're all here.

879
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,120
Don't worry about anything.

880
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,120
We're all here now.

881
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,120
I'll get back everything I lost.

882
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,120
I'll pay you back.

883
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,120
Over the past week,

884
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,120
we've bought 7% of the shares from other law firms.

885
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,120
So that's 45.1% in total?

886
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,120
We're selling the same shares, so that's 39.3%.

887
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,120
Will the members of the parliament

888
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,120
continue to be the 5% share?

889
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,120
I think so.

890
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,120
Their goal is to sell the company

891
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,120
as soon as possible without any problems.

892
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,120
I'll make sure of that.

893
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,120
Then there's no legal fight.

894
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,120
They're the top.

895
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,120
The total share we bought

896
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,120
is 13.3%.

897
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,120
But the non-legal amount is illegal.

898
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,120
It's money that should be returned to the government.

899
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,120
So we'll have to make a financial settlement.

900
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,120
Hey!

901
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,120
What are you talking about?

902
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,120
Why are we doing a charity?

903
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:33,120
Hey, I've done enough.

904
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,120
Hyunwoo said that

905
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,120
this is the music of your taste.

906
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,120
You're listening to this

907
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,120
and you're thinking of something?

908
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,120
You've watched too many dramas.

909
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,120
I'm doing it until I do it.

910
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,120
And there's going to be a news in Germany.

911
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,120
Please make sure that the boss

912
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,120
delivers it to you.

913
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,120
Why do I have to do that?

914
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,120
Is this from Germany?

915
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,120
Yes.

916
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,120
The CEO told me to bring

917
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,120
what Mr. Hong brought.

918
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,120
Are these all for Mr. Yoon?

919
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,120
I'll bring them to him.

920
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,120
I have something to tell him.

921
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,120
I've done all the work

922
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,120
to make sure they love each other.

923
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,120
I've done enough.

924
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,120
Didn't you hear what I said?

925
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,120
If we want to solve the frozen money,

926
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,120
we have to prove that

927
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,120
this is all a scam and a fraud.

928
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,120
We're the witnesses.

929
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,120
You do it then.

930
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,120
Hey, you.

931
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,120
I'm sorry.

932
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,120
I'm sorry.

933
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,120
Hey.

934
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,120
Hey.

935
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,120
It's a waste of time

936
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,120
to die together.

937
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,120
You have to live at least one person

938
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,120
to at least be with him.

939
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,120
Hey.

940
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:58,120
I don't want to live like Yoon Eunseong.

941
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,120
Don't you feel sorry for her?

942
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,120
She struggled to be loved for the rest of her life,

943
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,120
but she never did.

944
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,120
Look at the end.

945
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,120
Who was there for her?

946
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,120
I want to live a good life.

947
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,120
Without hiding anything,

948
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,120
without being stabbed,

949
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,120
without feeling sorry,

950
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,120
I want to live a comfortable life,

951
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,120
with love,

952
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,120
and with a good life.

953
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,120
Hey.

954
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,120
Even if you go to jail,

955
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,120
they'll take you in.

956
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,120
Who's going to jail?

957
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,120
I'm sorry.

958
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,120
Just answer me.

959
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,120
I'm not going anywhere.

960
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,120
Don't do anything useless.

961
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,120
This is where we first met.

962
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,120
I don't even remember.

963
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,120
I was too young.

964
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,120
I was really bored when I lived here.

965
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,120
I was waiting for my mom

966
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,120
to come home.

967
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:04,120
But I didn't have anyone to wait for me.

968
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,120
My parents didn't leave any letters

969
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,120
or any notes written on them.

970
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,120
They left me in the box.

971
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,120
That was in the middle of winter.

972
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,120
They wouldn't come to find me.

973
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,120
But one day,

974
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,120
you showed up.

975
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,120
I waited for you to come

976
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,120
once every few months.

977
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,120
So that's when you started to like me?

978
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:33,120
No, I could only eat on the day you came.

979
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,120
Strawberry whipped cream cake.

980
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,120
Da-hye, it's me, Cheon Da-hye.

981
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:43,120
So I was your first love?

982
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,120
Is that it?

983
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,120
I was waiting for the cake.

984
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,120
And...

985
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,120
You don't remember this, right?

986
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,120
This was also yours.

987
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,120
Really?

988
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,120
But for so long,

989
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:05,120
did you keep this as a token of our love?

990
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,120
What a cruel destiny.

991
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,120
You fool.

992
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,120
I was the one who cheated on you.

993
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,120
I really liked this doll.

994
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,120
When I carried this around,

995
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,120
I felt like I became a rich kid

996
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,120
with my parents.

997
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,120
When I held it in my hand,

998
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,120
it was so soft and soft.

999
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,120
I could sleep well even on a cold day.

1000
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,120
So I wanted to thank you,

1001
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,120
but that was the last time.

1002
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,120
You didn't come after that.

1003
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,120
So did you wait for me?

1004
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,120
I waited.

1005
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:47,120
After that, I gave you the whipped cream cake.

1006
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,120
It was strangely bad.

1007
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:00,120
I guess I waited for you.

1008
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,120
I waited for you a lot.

1009
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,120
So please wait for me this time.

1010
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,120
I'll be back.

1011
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,120
That way, I'll feel proud.

1012
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,120
Da-hye.

1013
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,120
No.

1014
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,120
Please take care of Gun-woo.

1015
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,120
I'll be good to you forever.

1016
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,120
I'll be a good wife to you.

1017
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,120
Don't be ridiculous.

1018
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:33,120
Do you think I'll just let you go?

1019
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:37,120
I'll get the best lawyers in Korea.

1020
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,120
I'll get all my assets

1021
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,120
and make sure you don't go in.

1022
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,120
I can't break up with you.

1023
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,120
I don't want to.

1024
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:49,120
Let go of me, Hak-bong.

1025
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,120
I'm sorry.

1026
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,120
I'm sorry.

1027
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,120
Stop talking.

1028
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,120
The defendant's son, Ko Yoon Eun-sung,

1029
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,120
used the extra money that was saved

1030
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,120
to acquire the Queens Group shares.

1031
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,120
The defendant's son, Sam-hang-woo,

1032
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,120
was sentenced to 13.3%

1033
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,120
because he was too young

1034
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,120
to have any assets.

1035
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,120
Therefore, the plaintiff is going to

1036
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,120
file a claim for the 13.3%

1037
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,120
of the shares he has illegally.

1038
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,120
The defendant, please respond to the plaintiff.

1039
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,120
The defendant is a defendant of the law.

1040
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,120
According to the legal process,

1041
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,120
he was sentenced to the shares and cash

1042
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,120
that his son had.

1043
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,120
The plaintiff has been suing the defendant

1044
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,120
for being too young

1045
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,120
to have any assets.

1046
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,120
The defendant is trying to steal

1047
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,120
the management rights.

1048
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,120
The defendant, Mo Seul-hee,

1049
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,120
used the investment fraud

1050
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,120
that happened during Lee Jung-won's time

1051
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,120
to buy the land with problems.

1052
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,120
The construction of the resort

1053
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,120
was a high-level issue

1054
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,120
and the public investors

1055
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,120
were to be blamed.

1056
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,120
The company proposed a research

1057
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,120
that would raise the profit

1058
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,120
of the resort's annual sales

1059
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,120
and the land owners would sue

1060
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,120
the land owners for the rent.

1061
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,120
The court will also submit

1062
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,120
a meeting with the military

1063
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,120
and the government

1064
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,120
and a report on the consulting

1065
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,120
and research.

1066
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,120
All of this has nothing to do

1067
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,120
with the defendant's son,

1068
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,120
Mr. Go Yoon-seong.

1069
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,120
There is no evidence that it has anything to do

1070
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,120
with the defendant.

1071
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,120
How could I have known that

1072
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,120
the son who had been away for 20 years

1073
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,120
would be the one who lost his son?

1074
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,120
I am so sad

1075
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,120
that I can't tell you

1076
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,120
what I've been through.

1077
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,120
Please, let me know.

1078
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,120
We request a witness report

1079
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,120
to prove the defendant's false testimony.

1080
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,120
I have been deceived

1081
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,120
by the defendant's order

1082
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,120
and married to the plaintiff,

1083
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,120
Hong Soo-chul.

1084
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,120
I gave the evidence to the defendant

1085
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,120
and persuaded him to sign a contract

1086
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,120
with Hong Soo-chul and Yu Nun-sung

1087
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,120
and to sign a wrong investment contract.

1088
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,120
Is there any evidence

1089
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,120
that the defendant made such an order?

1090
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,120
No.

1091
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,120
The defendant is very economic

1092
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,120
and he didn't contact the court

1093
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,120
and he sent the order

1094
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,120
to other people.

1095
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,120
The witness is being investigated

1096
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,120
for fraud.

1097
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,120
Please consider the possibility

1098
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,120
of a court hearing.

1099
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,120
Please make your final statement.

1100
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,120
Your Honor, what is the need

1101
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,120
for a mother to lose her child?

1102
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,120
The company that you trusted

1103
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,120
and entrusted me with

1104
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,120
is a company that no one

1105
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,120
can trust

1106
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,120
and I want to protect

1107
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,120
the company that you asked me to protect

1108
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,120
in the right way.

1109
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,120
Your Honor,

1110
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,120
please give the last chance

1111
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,120
to Hong Hae-in,

1112
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,120
one of the plaintiffs in my family.

1113
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,120
I allow it.

1114
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,120
Three weeks ago,

1115
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,120
I was kidnapped and imprisoned

1116
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,120
by the defendant's son, Yu Nun-sung.

1117
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,120
I heard the conversation

1118
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,120
between the defendant and Yu Nun-sung.

1119
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,120
Evidence that your mother killed the president?

1120
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,120
If Hong Hae-in had died

1121
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,120
with him, I wouldn't have

1122
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,120
ruined my life.

1123
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,120
I feel sorry for her.

1124
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,120
And I found out that both the boat accident

1125
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,120
and the death of my grandfather

1126
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,120
are related to the defendant, Mo Seul-hee.

1127
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,120
Oh my God.

1128
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,120
What the...

1129
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,120
Hae-in, what are you talking about?

1130
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,120
It's unfair, Your Honor.

1131
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,120
Your Honor,

1132
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,120
this is a statement based on the memory

1133
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,120
of the plaintiff who recently had a brain surgery.

1134
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,120
There is no evidence.

1135
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,120
There is.

1136
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,120
This is evidence to support

1137
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,120
the statement of the plaintiff, Hong Hae-in.

1138
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,120
Your Honor,

1139
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,120
this is not a request for a statement.

1140
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,120
You asked for evidence.

1141
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,120
I'm withdrawing.

1142
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,120
No, it's...

1143
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,120
Why?

1144
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,120
Why?

1145
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,120
I don't know.

1146
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,120
This is it, right?

1147
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,120
They copied it exactly the same

1148
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,120
and put it back in the same place.

1149
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,120
They don't know that it was changed.

1150
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,120
I'm sorry.

1151
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,120
I'm sorry.

1152
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,120
I'm sorry.

1153
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,120
I'm sorry.

1154
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,120
I'm sorry.

1155
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,120
I'm sorry.

1156
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,120
I'm sorry.

1157
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,120
What's going on?

1158
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,120
What's going on?

1159
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,120
Your Honor, please stop.

1160
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,120
Are you okay?

1161
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,120
That's what they say.

1162
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,120
You're in a coma for 90 minutes.

1163
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,120
What is this?

1164
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,120
I'm going to kill myself.

1165
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,120
Don't worry.

1166
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,120
You're not going to die.

1167
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,120
If you go back right away,

1168
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,120
this is no use.

1169
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,120
When you're in a coma,

1170
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,120
I can be your legal guardian

1171
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,120
and your attorney.

1172
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,120
So,

1173
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,120
please lie down

1174
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,120
for a couple of months

1175
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,120
and then go back.

1176
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,120
Can you do that for me?

1177
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,120
Are you okay?

1178
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,120
No.

1179
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,120
It's not my fault.

1180
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,120
It's not my fault.

1181
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,120
Tell me!

1182
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,120
The defendant is an같ed

1183
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,120
and has experience in the police.

1184
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,120
You have to be prepared

1185
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,120
so you can arrest her immediately.

1186
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,120
Ms. Mo.

1187
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,120
We arrest you because you're a murderer.

1188
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,120
If you're too much to be arrested,

1189
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,120
you have to be careful.

1190
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,120
Why me?

1191
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,120
Catch me if you can.

1192
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,120
I don't deserve this.

1193
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,120
What did I tell you?

1194
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,120
What did I do wrong?

1195
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,120
What did I do wrong?

1196
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,120
It's unfair!

1197
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,120
I'm so unfair!

1198
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,120
What did I do wrong?

1199
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,120
I'm so unfair!

1200
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,120
What did I do wrong to my children?

1201
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,120
No!

1202
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,120
Stop it!

1203
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:39,120
The owner of the Queen's Group is returning to the first round of management.

1204
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:49,500

Where are they?

1242
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,500
Hyein went out to see the documents before going to work.

She went out to see the documents before going to work.

1244

I'm going on a plane.

1249
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,500
You're eating well, my son.

1250
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,500
Let's both grow up well.

Let's both grow up well.

1252
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,500
Until mom comes.

1253
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,500
What about the criminal?

1254
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,500
I don't know. I suddenly saw a text message and he went out like crazy.

1255
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,500
I suddenly saw a text message and he went out like crazy.

1256
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,500
This guy really comes in.

1257
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,500
If you suddenly ask me to meet,

1258
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,500
I drank too much last night.

1259
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,500
I'm really swollen.

1260
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,500
Where did the double eyelids go?

1261
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,500
Was it hard to find the way?

1262
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,500
I chose the tallest building on purpose to make it easier to find.

1263
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,500
I know.

1264
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,500
I can see the building, but I couldn't find the way, so I was a little lost.

1265
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,500
I'm sorry I called you all of a sudden.

1266
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,500
I felt good.

1267
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,500
I was excited.

1268
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,500
I came because I had something to hear.

1269
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,500
I came because I had something to hear.

1270
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,500
Tell me.

1271
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,500
Thank you.

1272
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,500
Thank you.

1273
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,500
You know, you and I are very different.

1274
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,500
You know, you and I are very different.

1275
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,500
Are you trying to tell me something obvious?

1276
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,500
Are you trying to tell me something obvious?

1277
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,500
I got a confession from you,

1278
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,500
but you're a rich daughter,

1279
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,500
and we're very different,

1280
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,500
so we don't get along.

1281
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,500
Beom-ja, I'll say it all the way.

1282
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,500
Okay, go ahead.

1283
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,500
Beom-ja, you've been married three times.

1284
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,500
Beom-ja, you've been married three times.

1285
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,500
Oh, that's it.

1286
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,500
I don't think it's right to say

1287
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,500
that a woman who's been married three times is like that.

1288
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,500
I don't think it's right to say that a woman who's been married three times is like that.

1289
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,500
It's possible.

1290
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,500
That's not it.

1291
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,500
You've done everything.

1292
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,500
You've met someone, you've liked someone, you've dated someone,

1293
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
you've been married, you've done everything.

1294
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,500
But I've never done anything like that.

1295
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,500
What?

1296
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,500
I'm not even old enough to date someone.

1297
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,500
Oh my god.

1298
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,500
Really?

1299
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,500
Yes.

1300
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,500
So I find it hard to keep up with Beom-ja.

1301
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,500
I'm sorry.

1302
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,500
I was waiting for someone

1303
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,500
for the first time

1304
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,500
and I wanted to see you.

1305
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,500
But

1306
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,500
I don't know what happened next.

1307
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,500
I don't know the way

1308
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,500
to come here.

1309
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,500
Then

1310
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,500
what should I do?

1311
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,500
What should I do?

1312
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,500
I'm good at

1313
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,500
grilling meat.

1314
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,500
When you're tired, I grill meat for you.

1315
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,500
When you're bored, I grill madeleines for you.

1316
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,500
I want to do that.

1317
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,500
When you're tired or bored,

1318
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,500
why don't you come to me?

1319
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,500
Okay.

1320
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,500
I'll go.

1321
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,500
If you don't know the way, I'll go.

1322
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,500
Kim Young-seong

1323
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,500
comes slowly.

1324
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,500
What kind of challenge is divorce these days?

1325
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,500
You said you were going to get divorced.

1326
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,500
Money, women, violence.

1327
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,500
If you don't fit into these three categories,

1328
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,500
just bear with it.

1329
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,500
I'm sure of it.

1330
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,500
What?

1331
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,500
Chun-sik met his first love at the reunion.

1332
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,500
Oh, sister.

1333
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,500
There's no reunion without a first love in Korea.

1334
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,500
That's what I have in mind.

1335
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,500
That woman can't be insured.

1336
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,500
I don't know if she can live with life insurance.

1337
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,500
I'm going crazy.

1338
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,500
You used violence?

1339
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
I'm the one who used violence.

1340
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,500
I was angry and hit him.

1341
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,500
He can't live without life insurance.

1342
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,500
So when are you going to get divorced?

1343
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,500
I want to do it right now.

1344
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,500
He's going to take the midterm soon.

1345
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,500
It's an important time.

1346
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,500
I was going to do it after the test.

1347
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,500
I made a travel contract.

1348
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,500
It's a little vague.

1349
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,500
If you make a contract, he'll take the midterm again.

1350
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,500
That's true.

1351
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,500
You can't get divorced forever.

1352
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,500
Do it now. Right now.

1353
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,500
I'm going to do it, too. Let's do it together.

1354
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,500
Together?

1355
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,500
Scandals should be broken up here and there.

1356
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,500
Let's do it at the time of the announcement.

1357
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,500
I'll do it first.

1358
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,500
You can do it in two days.

1359
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,500
Are you serious?

1360
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,500
I'm sorry.

1361
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,500
I thought about it a lot, too.

1362
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,500
But I can't help it.

1363
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,500
What's her name?

1364
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,500
I don't know. Her name is Jenny.

1365
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,500
She's my wife.

1366
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
She's your wife?

1367
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
Yes.

1368
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,500
I don't know.

1369
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,500
My husband told me

1370
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,500
that you can't talk to her.

1371
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,500
Jenny is a bad person.

1372
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,500
What?

1373
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,500
Is that what you like?

1374
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,500
It's not what I like.

1375
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,500
He left his phone in the lab.

1376
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,500
The professor took it.

1377
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,500
Really?

1378
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,500
Jenny is a professor?

1379
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,500
He didn't even call you.

1380
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,500
He asked me to tell you.

1381
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,500
What?

1382
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,500
The alarm.

1383
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,500
He should have told me

1384
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,500
that important thing.

1385
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,500
Why did he tell you?

1386
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,500
He told me that.

1387
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,500
That's why he turned off his phone.

1388
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,500
Do you know why there's a war?

1389
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,500
It's because we can't talk.

1390
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,500
Why do we talk to each other?

1391
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,500
Oh, my.

1392
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,500
Let's go.

1393
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,500
What is it?

1394
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,500
It's a gift from your parents.

1395
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,500
Go to see your husband.

1396
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,500
Look into his eyes and talk to him.

1397
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,500
I love you.

1398
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,500
Me too.

1399
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,500
Mom.

1400
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,500
Dad.

1401
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,500
Why are you crying?

1402
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,500
Go away.

1403
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,500
Go away.

1404
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,500
Mr. Na.

1405
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
I just came up with an idea.

1406
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,500
Let's remove

1407
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,500
the pop-ups and remodel them.

1408
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,500
Let's do it like a square.

1409
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,500
Let the kids play too.

1410
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,500
Right.

1411
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,500
And we're preparing

1412
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,500
a lot of rest areas.

1413
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,500
The boss told me before the surgery.

1414
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,500
Me?

1415
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,500
I don't think everything will disappear

1416
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,500
even if you lose your memory.

1417
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,500
It's good.

1418
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,500
Did you have lunch?

1419
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,500
I'm going to eat now.

1420
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,500
Enjoy your meal.

1421
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,500
Enjoy your meal.

1422
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Do you know what marriage is?

1423
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,500
Marriage?

1424
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,500
No.

1425
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,500
No?

1426
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,500
You're right.

1427
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,500
You're the same as the guy

1428
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,500
I just met.

1429
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,500
Of course, I'm grateful.

1430
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,500
But you're different from me.

1431
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,500
Am I different?

1432
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,500
Of course, you're different.

1433
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,500
You're 180 degrees

1434
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,500
that can fry chicken.

1435
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,500
If you're boiling it,

1436
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,500
I'm a little weak

1437
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,500
to drink mixed coffee.

1438
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,500
So of course,

1439
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,500
marriage is a little weird.

1440
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,500
But why?

1441
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,500
Is that what you're doing?

1442
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,500
No.

1443
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,500
No?

1444
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,500
You never said that.

1445
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,500
It was just a guess.

1446
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,500
But you got a proposal, right?

1447
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,500
I don't remember,

1448
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,500
but I got it before.

1449
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,500
I have a letter at home.

1450
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,500
You don't even remember the previous one.

1451
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,500
Why did you do it?

1452
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,500
Really?

1453
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,500
That's bad.

1454
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,500
Director, I have something to tell you.

1455
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,500
What? Why?

1456
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,500
Director Baek has a restaurant.

1457
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,500
It's a famous restaurant.

1458
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,500
I'm going crazy.

1459
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,500
I'm not ready yet.

1460
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,500
Why am I so ahead?

1461
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,500
How do I get there?

1462
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,500
I don't want to hurt someone

1463
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,500
who got shot because of me.

1464
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,500
I'm sorry.

1465
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,500
What?

1466
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,500
If I had a restaurant,

1467
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,500
I wouldn't have called someone.

1468
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,500
I'm hungry.

1469
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,500
Oh, my.

1470
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,500
Hello?

1471
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,500
Hello?

1472
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,500
No,

1473
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,500
where are you?

1474
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,500
I'm having a dinner at the restaurant.

1475
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,500
What's going on?

1476
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,500
Are you sick?

1477
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
No, I'm not sick.

1478
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,500
I'm fine.

1479
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,500
Enjoy your dinner.

1480
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,500
Dinner?

1481
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,500
What?

1482
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:19,500
What?

1483
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,500
What?

1484
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,500
She's not a kid.

1485
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,500
Take it all off.

1486
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,500
The one you put up there.

1487
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,500
Take it all off.

1488
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,500
And throw away your stuff.

1489
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,500
You didn't even tell me.

1490
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,500
You're going to take all your stuff?

1491
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,500
Did you tell me to do it?

1492
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,500
I want to tell you.

1493
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,500
I want to tell you that the baby

1494
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,500
disappeared because of me.

1495
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,500
What are you talking about?

1496
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,500
I never thought that.

1497
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,500
Don't be so nervous.

1498
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
You want to tell me, too.

1499
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,500
It's all because of me.

1500
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,500
Let's quit.

1501
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,500
What am I going to say to you?

1502
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,500
I'm going to tell you.

1503
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,500
I'm going to tell you that the baby

1504
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,500
disappeared because of me.

1505
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,500
I want to tell you that the baby

1506
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,500
disappeared because of me.

1507
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,500
I'm going to tell you that the baby

1508
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,500
disappeared because of me.

1509
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,500
I'm going to tell you that the baby

1510
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,500
disappeared because of me.

1511
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,500
I'm going to tell you that the baby

1512
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,500
disappeared because of me.

1513
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,500
I'm going to tell you that the baby

1514
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,500
disappeared because of me.

1515
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,500
I'm going to tell you that the baby

1516
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,500
disappeared because of me.

1517
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,500
I was waiting for you.

1518
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,500
You reserved a restaurant.

1519
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,500
I heard that it was a Propose restaurant.

1520
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,500
I wondered if you were going to

1521
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,500
propose to me.

1522
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,500
I was so surprised.

1523
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,500
I didn't know how to say no.

1524
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,500
I got a lot of thoughts.

1525
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,500
So you wanted to say no

1526
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,500
when I proposed to you?

1527
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,500
Yes.

1528
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,000
But I didn't.

1529
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,900
I couldn't refuse.

1530
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

1531
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,000
But why?

1532
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,100
Why did you refuse?

1533
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,300
I was scared.

1534
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,600
We're in a good relationship.

1535
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,700
I was scared that I might ruin it.

1536
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,900
But it was too late.

1537
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:12,100
If I proposed yesterday, I would've refused.

1538
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,300
I changed my mind.

1539
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,100
Last night,

1540
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,500
I had the worst memory.

1541
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,500
I was very sad and hurt,

1542
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,200
but I was relieved.

1543
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:31,600
I was less afraid than when I didn't know.

1544
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:39,100
That's not because of a big reason.

1545
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:42,000
I was able to tell you

1546
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:46,000
that I was being selfish and made stupid misunderstandings.

1547
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,000
Rather than being brave and knocking,

1548
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:53,700
it would've been easier to close the door and go into your room alone

1549
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,100
and hate you.

1550
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,000
But

1551
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,000
I won't do that anymore.

1552
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:05,200
Then, wouldn't it be worth it?

1553
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,200
I was like that too.

1554
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,500
If someone shoots you again,

1555
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,700
you'll be able to run 12 more times.

1556
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:25,300
But other than that,

1557
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,700
I was afraid that I'd get tired, fight, and be disappointed

1558
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:33,600
in my everyday life.

1559
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I was afraid that I'd be twisted, broken,

1560
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,200
and not hate you.

1561
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,300
I couldn't be confident.

1562
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,200
But one thing I'm sure of is...

1563
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,700
I can be with you.

1564
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,900
No matter what happens,

1565
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:20,500
if you're broken, you fix it. If you get a hole, you fill it.

1566
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:25,000
Even if it's a bit rough and not perfect,

1567
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:29,500
just like that.

1568
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:34,900
If you're okay with it, will you marry me?

1569
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,300
Of course.

1570
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,100
But I need time.

1571
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:52,900
I'm still in the process of getting over you.

1572
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:58,200
Please keep your promise.

1573
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,200
Okay.

1574
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:08,200
You can hug me after you hold my hand at least five times.

1575
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,200
Five times?

1576
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:23,900
I want to have breakfast with you every day.

1577
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:28,400
It's good for your health to eat breakfast.

1578
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,100
I think bread is okay.

1579
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:32,300
What about taking a walk every day?

1580
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,800
Vitamin D is important.

1581
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,100
That's a good idea.

1582
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,600
I'll go on a trip every time the season changes.

1583
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:42,900
I'll work harder if I get a good rest.

1584
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,300
It's a plan that went down.

1585
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:52,700
We'll have to keep our heads straight.

1586
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,700
Why?

1587
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:57,700
Life never goes as planned.

1588
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:10,900
Geon-woo, shall we go to Mom?

1589
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:11,900
Yes.

1590
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,200
Geon-woo, why are you looking at me?

1591
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,200
Do you remember?

1592
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,200
Yes.

1593
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,400
Geon-woo, I'm sorry.

1594
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,300
I'm sorry. I love you.

1595
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,300
Mom.

1596
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:31,900
Geon-woo, I'm sorry.

1597
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,900
Geon-woo,

1598
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:35,900
I love you.

1599
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:42,700
I taught Geon-woo how to ride a three-wheel bike.

1600
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,700
I'll show you at home.

1601
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:57,900
Good job.

1602
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:01,400
Come back soon. I'll give you a seat.

1603
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,900
Bye.

1604
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:08,700
I'm so tired.

1605
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:13,200
It's colder here than in Jeong-an.

1606
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,200
Where are you going?

1607
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,700
Mom wants you to bring everyone.

1608
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:26,200
Let's eat.

1609
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,200
Me too?

1610
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:32,200
Really?

1611
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,700
Come back soon.

1612
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:36,500
My mother-in-law is the best.

1613
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,700
Geon-woo, you're so good.

1614
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:41,200
I like you.

1615
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,700
Go.

1616
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:46,700
I sometimes forgive people I used to hate.

1617
01:37:46,700 --> 01:38:15,380
June 19° SCIENCE

1618
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,700
I can hear it on my knees today.

1619
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:20,700
I'll do Omega 3 once.

1620
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,700
That's not it.

1621
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:24,700
How far are you going to go slowly?

1622
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:26,700
I can't go this slow.

1623
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:36,700
I'm going to kiss you when you make a mistake.

1624
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,700
Is it that fun?

1625
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:50,700
Chara, you cannot go with us.

1626
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:52,580
You could fall asleep.

1627
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:55,580
Do tell her about our ничего.

1628
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,700
We did it.

1629
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:00,700
butts

1630
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:02,700

black

1632
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:10,540
you

1633
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,620
kanske

1634
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:41,700
Visit us today!

1635
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:47,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1636
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1637
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:51,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1638
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:53,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1639
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:55,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1640
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:57,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1641
01:39:57,620 --> 01:39:59,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1642
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1643
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1644
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1645
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:07,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1646
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1647
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:11,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1648
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:13,620
You can't just leave it like that.

1649
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:15,620
I lived my days in a cruel way.

1650
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:27,620
I gave you a good seat as the chairman

1651
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:29,620
and you're eating ramen here.

1652
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:33,620
I like it.

1653
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:35,620
It's the perfect seat for me.

1654
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:37,620
Now when you break up with someone,

1655
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:39,620
you don't need to put a knife on your back.

1656
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:41,620
You can just laugh and shake your hands.

1657
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:43,620
I'm heaven.

1658
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:47,620
What heaven?

1659
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:49,620
Ramen is kimchi.

1660
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:55,620
Is it coming out?

1661
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,620
It's coming out.

1662
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:59,620
I've been looking for you.

1663
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,620
Don't forget to bring kimchi.

1664
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,620
Ramen is ready.

1665
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:05,620
Welcome.

1666
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,620
Hello.

1667
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:09,620
Hello.

1668
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:11,620
No, no.

1669
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:13,620
You're not supposed to drink.

1670
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,620
Brake!

1671
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:17,620
Where are you going?

1672
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:19,620
Stop and look at the scenery.

1673
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:21,620
Stop and look at the scenery.

1674
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:27,620
Time will pass by.

1675
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:35,620
We can't catch it.

1676
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:37,620
We'll spill it all.

1677
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:41,620
We'll spill it all.

1678
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:53,620
We lived our lives together.

1679
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:55,620
We lived our lives together.

1680
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:09,620
We enjoyed the happiness life gave us.

1681
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:11,620
We enjoyed the happiness life gave us.

1682
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:25,620
We enjoyed the happiness life gave us.

1683
01:42:53,620 --> 01:43:14,620
Jae eth ma

1684
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:28,620
The memories that I remember

1685
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:34,620
They face me with their scent

1686
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:41,620
How was your day today?

1687
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:48,620
After asking you for your hand in marriage

1688
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:55,620
I feel like you're flying to me

1689
01:43:56,620 --> 01:44:01,620
And answering me

1690
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:09,620
I've waited for so long

1691
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:17,620
Will you listen to my heart again?

1692
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:23,620
The only miracle in my life

1693
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:31,620
The times we shared together

1694
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:37,620
One day, if only one person is left

1695
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:44,620
I heard it, I came back

1696
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:50,620
The days we walked together

1697
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:54,620
All the footsteps

1698
01:44:55,620 --> 01:45:04,620
There was no moment without you

1699
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:10,620
I've waited for so long

1700
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:15,620
Will you listen to my heart again?

1701
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:21,620
The only miracle in my life

1702
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:27,620
The times we shared together

1703
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:34,620
The times we shared together

1704
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:39,620
After a long journey

1705
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:47,620
When I meet you again

1706
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:53,620
Hold my hands tight

1707
01:45:54,620 --> 01:46:01,620
I want to go to our house

1708
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:06,620
Hmm

1709
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:39,620
The wind blows

1710
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:45,620
The wind blows

1711
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:51,620
The wind blows

1712
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:57,620
The wind blows

1713
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:02,620
The wind blows

1714
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:06,620
Breathe in

1715
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:10,620
Stop the clock

1716
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:15,620
I'm close to you

1717
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:20,620
I'm here with you

1718
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:24,620
Let go

1719
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:35,620
Of all the bad times

1720
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:47,620
And I see the one I can't replace

1721
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:52,620
Sorry I'm late

1722
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:57,620
Sorry I'm late enough

1723
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:06,620
And I love you

1724
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:15,620
I can't

1725
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:27,620
And I'm here to throw away

1726
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:34,620
As long as you stay with me

1727
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:38,620
I'm giving you all my heart

1728
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:43,620
I'm giving you all my love

1729
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:48,620
I love you

1730
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:52,620
And I'm telling you I

1731
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:56,620
Love you

1732
01:48:57,620 --> 01:49:00,620
Love you

1733
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:05,620
Love you

1734
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:10,620
Love you
