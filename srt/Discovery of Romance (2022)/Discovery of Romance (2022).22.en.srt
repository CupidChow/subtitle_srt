Yes.

21
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,160
I came to see you.

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,520
how is the design of our new home going?

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,960
I haven't been thinking straight.

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,919
So there's no good proposal.

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,119
It's okay.

Don't hurry.

28
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,119
I brought you milk tea.

Did you design all of these?

Well...

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,119
Ah.

00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:22,559
Yes.

34
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,200
They were done a long time ago.

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,520
I just wanted
to take them out for inspiration.

I'll put them away now.

What was your ex like?

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,159
Why are you asking?

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,360
Because I don't think

42
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,760
we've ever talked about it before.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,559
He's

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,080
quite different from you.

45
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,439
But it's been a long time.

46
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,119
Well, if we ran into him on the street,

47
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,040
you can just point him out to me.

48
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,559
I'll say hello to him.

49
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,520
Why?

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,439
To show him how happy you are now.

51
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,119
I want to keep him up at night

52
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,999
and be regretful.

I am so sorry.

91
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
I did a little research
on your schedule.

I know you will fly to Suzhou
early tomorrow morning.

just give me half an hour.

Thank you.

Thank you for taking the time to see me.

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,839
Tell me.

00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,719
What's the matter?

100
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:17,440
Ah.

101

Here.

This is...?

103
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,200
This is the portfolio
from a friend of mine.

104
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,120
She's been a fan of yours for years.

105
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,000
She knows all your works well,

106
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,520
including the coffee
with original taste

107
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,919
and Muguang Bookstore in early years,

108
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,399
and the Cave Roof Tent Festival

109
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,320
and West Ancient Alley in recent years.

110
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,799
A lot of her own works

111
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:43,279
were inspired by your work.

112
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,760
Of course, it also includes
her own creative ideas,

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,919
integrating a lot of nature,

114
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,919
wood, human and space elements.

115
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,799
She is a person
who likes wood and trees very much.

116
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
She really likes the primitive texture.

117
00:06:57,239 --> 00:07:00,000
She even knows
the language of thousands of trees.

118
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,479
She once said

119
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,560
that her biggest dream

120
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,479
was to create a warm urban forest

121
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,320
in a concrete city.

122
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:11,520
I know.

123
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,000
Well,

124
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:13,279
is she the one who designed the chair?

125
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, yes.

126
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:15,320
So,

127
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
what do you want with me?

128
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,680
Oh.

129
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,399
I would like to recommend her

130
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,640
to participate in bidding for
the Old Block Creative Market Project.

131
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,359
Maybe she doesn't
have a very large team,

132
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,640
but I believe
she is the best person for the job.

133
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,719
Since

134
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,680
you know so much about her,

135
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,120
and she likes me so much,

136
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,359
why doesn't she come herself?

137
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,520
She doesn't know about it yet.

138
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,159
But I want to help her
fulfill her greatest dream.

139
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,359
She

140
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,919
quit the ADA for me once.

141
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,799
I want to make up for her.

142
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,359
And what makes you so sure

143
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,520
I'll help you?

144
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
I'm not sure, to be honest.

145
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,200
But I want to give it a try.

146
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,039
She's the most talented designer
I've ever met.

147
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,279
I'm sure when you get to know her,

148
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,479
you'll appreciate her very much.

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,399
Huh.

150
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,640
Sounds like you two have a story.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is she your girlfriend?

152
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:14,960
A friend.

153
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,359
Fine.

154
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,039
First of all,

155
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,799
I really like her design style.

156
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,760
Secondly,

157
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,680
I appreciate your courage and sincerity.

158
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,239
But,

159
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:30,880
the project of Old Block Creative Market

160
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,999
has high requirements
for the team's capital, size,

161
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:33,759
work profile,

162
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,160
and even experience.

163
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,280
So,

164
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:39,960
I need to think it over.

165
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,320
I understand.

166
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,440
But you can rest assured.

167
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,040
I will try my best

168
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,280
to help her

169
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
with the experience and team size.

170
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,960
I'll send you

171
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,560

for the non-spicy ones this time.

213
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,040
I ordered the extra spicy ones.

214
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,960

344
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,079
As soon as I contact her

345
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,680
or see her,

346
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
I would be just bothering her.

347
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,319
But this project

348
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,200
is really great for Xia Tian.

349
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,920
She can't be idle

350
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,600
after she gets married, right?

351
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:06,759
Besides,

352
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,960
Xia Tian is not that kind of people.

353
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:35,304
(Unbounded Space Design Firm)

354
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
How much is the registered capital
of Xia Song Studio?

355
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,640
I think it's one million.

356
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
Then this one will be fine.

357
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,680
Oh.

358
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,600
I asked you to find

359
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,239
the information of 100 creative markets
around the world.

360
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:55,999
Did you get it?

361
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:57,519
All here.

362
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,039
For this,

363
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,440
I only slept three hours last night.

364
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,840
That's pretty much.

365
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,360
The deadline is the end of this month.

366
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,200
We don't have much time

367
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:09,920
to prepare for the bidding.

368
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,039
So,

369
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,799
do you still want to go to see Xia Tian?

370
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,960
This bid has demanding requirements.

371
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,719
It's not just about talent,

372
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,400
but also capital,

373
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,319
team experience,

374
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,400
and team members.

375
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,400
These are all
within the scope of assessment.

376
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,680
Xia Tian's studio is small in size,

377
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,400
with little experience

378
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,680
and not enough members.

379
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,600
We have to offer a little help here.

380
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,440
We have to work hard for it
for a little longer time.

381
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,519
Go for it.

382
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:40,600
Yeah.

383
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:44,759
Give me that file.

384
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,319
OK.

385
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:22,600
Ay.

386
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,799
Are you tired?

387
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:39,079
I bought you your favorite cake.

388
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:39,999
Have a taste.

389
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,880
There was a long line to get it.

390
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:50,920
Is it good?

391
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
What do you say

392
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,920
if we choose this store
for the wedding souvenir?

393
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,479
Okay.

394
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:01,880
Oh.

395
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,479
Why did you call me yesterday?

396
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:05,920
After you.

397
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,440
Don't you have
something to tell me too?

398
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,799
I was thinking

399
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,479
whether we shall go to an island

400
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:12,999
for our wedding ceremony.

401
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,559
There will be few people there

402
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,279
and it's private.

403
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
We can invite some friends and family.

404
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:21,920
Yesterday,

405
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:23,319
when you called me,

406
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,719
I was making a wedding plan.

407
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,880
Look.

408
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,200
I picked out a few places
to shoot our wedding pictures.

409
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:29,920
Here.

410
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,600
This little cabin.

411
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,160
You're going to love it.

412
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,719
Let's take our wedding pictures here.

413
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,160
And,

414
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,680
these wedding dresses
are for you to choose.

415
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,120
But, Guan Xin,

416
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,680
is there really enough time?

417
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,640
Yes.

418
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,239
Let's start preparing next week.

419
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,400
Guan Xin,

420
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,600
I think that planning you just said

421
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,279
is great.

422
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:02,160
We should go to an island
for our wedding ceremony

423
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,279
and invite some friends and family.

424
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,200
There will be few people there.

425
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,279
And it is quiet.

426
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,160
I love that fishtail wedding dress

427
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,200
you just picked out for me.

428
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,479
I'll wear it
to walk you along the beach.

429
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,239
Actually, I've thought about

430
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,360
all of these many times.

431
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,759
But...

432
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,039
But what?

433
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,319
I got a project recently.

434
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,999
I might have to postpone the wedding.

435
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:30,079
Oh.

436
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:30,719
You

437
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,600
were so anxious just now

438
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
because of this?

439
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,640
This opportunity
is really important to me.

440
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,799
Alex is my favorite designer

441
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,400
since college.

442
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,840
It's like a dream

443
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,600
for me

444
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,559
to work with him.

445
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,400
If...

446
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,960
If I miss this chance,

447
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,680
I might not have
another one in this life.

448
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,719
Mr. Yu.

449
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
Are you looking for Song?

450
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,120
Well, no.

451
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,559
Yes.

452
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,799
I got something for you.

453
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,239
Here are some bidding cases

454
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,719
and a reference to Alex's style.

455
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,400
They will be very helpful to you.

456
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:43,920
Please take your time.

457
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:44,680
Ah.

458
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,999
So,

459
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,279
for the next project,

460
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,880
you have to keep in touch with Xu Zehao?

461
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,279
How was it?

462
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,680
Xia Tian's fiance was there.

463
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,960
You don't have to tell me that way.

464
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,640
Do you know that?

465
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,759
What about the thing?

466
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:16,600
Have you been clear with her?

467
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,960
I guess

468
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,079
that's clear.

469
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,120
Hehe.

470
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,239
Let's go.

471
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:29,920
Okay.

472
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,039
As you all know,

473
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,400
our company

474
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,719
has taken on a very amazing project.

475
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,279
So let's raise our glasses
for celebration,

476
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:50,920
friends.

477
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,880
Right.

478
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,360
Xia Tian.

479
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
How wonderful!

480
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,840
You got both the love and career.

481
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,239
You can make money
and get married at the same time.

482
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,360
Bottoms up.

483
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,759
Come on.

484
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,239
Cheers!

485
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,880
About the project,

486
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,440
I haven't thought it through yet.

487
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:07,640
Why?

488
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,279
Because it coincides with our wedding.

489
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,360
If we have to postpone the wedding,

490
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
it might be a bit of a hassle.

491
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,719
And it happens quite suddenly.

492
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,880
Guan Xin and I may need to
think more about it.

493
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,079
Is it necessary?

494
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:27,960
We've had a hard time
getting to where we are today.

495
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,559
We've taken on so many bad projects.

496
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,479
Those clients

497
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,999
don't understand our design.

498
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:34,360
This is the best chance we've ever had.

499
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,600
And it is Alex!

500
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:36,880
You've admired him

501
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,519
since college.

502
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,360
He's your idol.

503
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,559
Don't you always
look forward to working with him?

504
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,079
Right.

505
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,759
You said it was in college.

506
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,200
The point is that there's no way
to guarantee the outcome.

507
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,960
What if we invest a lot of

508
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,640
money, labor, time, and materials,

509
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,319
but there is still no way

510
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,440
to guarantee the result?

511
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,079
So are you sure

512
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,039
