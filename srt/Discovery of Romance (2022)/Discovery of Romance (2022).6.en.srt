How did this happen?

19

Why did you hit him?

20
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:30,360
I hit him?

21
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:31,839
You didn't even ask me why

22
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:32,960
but hit me with your heels.

23
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,919
If I didn't,
he would end up in the hospital.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,759
You pissed me off.

I hit him first.

Do not act coquettishly.

I'm really pissed off right now.

You're home.

Go home.

Don't be like this, Xia Tian.

38
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,960
Nothing you do now
will make me feel better.

39

Oh, don't cry.

40
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,760
Don't cry.

41
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,399
You have no reason to cry.

42
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,320
Remember to boil an egg and rub it
when you get home.

43

Remember to drink milk
before going to bed,

44

just call me.

49
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,800
You know I can't see you crying.

50
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,679
You know I don't want you to be mad.

51
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,439
Then why did you two fight?

He...

53

He said you're stupid

54
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,399
and you don't work hard.

55
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:19,880
Alright.

56
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,039
Don't cry.

57
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,880
Don't cry.

58
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,560
Hey.

59
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:37,880
Are women all like this?

60
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,880
Cunning, capricious and ruthless.

61
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,359
After all, I am the one

62
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:43,039
she used to love so much.

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,399
How could she be like this now?

64
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,880
Do you know what she did to me?

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,440
Ah.

66
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,239
Oops.

67
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,560
How did this happen?

68
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,080
Ah!

69
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,440
I'll be gentle.

70
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,039
Sorry.

71
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,440
I bought a very good batch

72
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,080
of African Padauk yesterday.

73
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,440
Five whole log segments.

74
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
I hurt myself when I was moving them.

75
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,799
African Padauk is very expensive.

76
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:07,799
Why did you need it?

77
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,120
I want to save it for you.

78
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,239
It's so rare that there is a merchant

79
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,960
who sells them cheaply.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,960
Save it for me?

81
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:16,799
Yes.

82
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,080
They don't know how good that wood is.

83
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,640
They wouldn't believe it
even if you tell him.

84
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,399
So I thought I might keep it for you

85
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,120
to make some furniture pieces.

86
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,680
Is that wood
more important than your body?

87
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:31,520
What could be
more important than your body?

88
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,159
And is your body yours anyway?

89
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,399
Then whose?

90
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,799
Mine.

91
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,279
Okay.

92
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,440
I'll be careful in the future.

93
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,919
The wood is yours

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,320
and my body is yours too.

95
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,760
OK?

96
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,159
Oops.

97
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:45,880
Ah!

98
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,479
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,159
I...

100
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,279
Sorry.

101
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:52,440
Does it hurt?

102
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,399
Yes.

103
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,159
It hurts so much.

104
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:57,479
It might help if you give me a kiss.

105
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
It still hurts.

106
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,839
Isn't it nostalgic
when thinking of the ex?

107
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,479
It is great to think of something nice
from time to time.

108
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,039
Right?

109
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,919
Even if we broke up,

110
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,239
we are not enemies, right?

111
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,320
I think we should be

112
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,640
closer than ordinary friends.

113
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,159
You...

114
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:16,760
Just look at her attitude today.

115
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,000
She...

116
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
She hit me pretty hard.

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,520
Ah!

118
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,760
I just don't under...

119
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,399
I know it.

120
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,000
Calm down!

121
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:22,760
Calm down!

122
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,479
I just don't understand.

123
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,279
Did I hurt her

124
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,239
or cheat on her?

125
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,919
This man is definitely
the bane of my life.

126
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,719
Huh!

127
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,440
So now you know

128
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,320
why we call them EX, right?

129
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:35,520
Why?

130
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,880
Because EX is short for E Xin.
[*E Xin is a pinyin for Disgusting in Chinese.]

131
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:39,960
So,

when your ex comes to you again,

133
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:43,640
it means...

134
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,640
Means what?

135
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,560

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,200
Mr. Xu wants to demonstrate his power.

174
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,599
Isn't it just a project?

175
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,279
Why does he make it like a game?

176
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,399
Why didn't they

177
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,760
tell me why they fought?

178
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,200
Both men like you.

179
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,919
Isn't it normal to fight?

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,799
What's so strange?

181
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,279
But I didn't really tell that.

182
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,159
These two neatly dressed men

183
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:26,599
would start a fight
with a slight disagreement.

184
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:27,320
Hey.

185
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,120
Are you men all so violent?

186
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,960
Have you ever seen Wild Life?

187
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,239
It's the male animal instinct.

188
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:34,800
I told you not to
take on Xu Zehao's project.

189
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:35,639
See?

190
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,080
When we took on the project,

191
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,440
we didn't know those two adults

192
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,839
would do something so childish.

193
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,519
You have 19 min 13 sec.

194
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,839
Be careful on the way.

195
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,560
What can make two men so childish?

196
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,040
I guess,

197
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,040
it can only be love.

198
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,800
Women

199
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:01,800
are so scary.

200
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,719
The core concept and basic setting

201
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:06,960
are something like this.

202
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,839
We will keep
the original layout of the Old House.

203
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
We'll only make some simple renovation.

204
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,080
The furniture would be

205
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,719
mainly made of old elm.

206
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,560
For each room,

207
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
we will add different healing themes

208
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,040
to meet the needs
of different customers.

209
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:21,599
Is that all?

210
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:25,920
It's showy but not practical at all,

211
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
just some paper talks.

212
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,999
You only consider the material,
but not the price.

213
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:30,999
Do you know

214
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,160
how many times the price
of raw timber has gone up in the market?

215
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,200
To the theme of healing,

216
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,359
if the material is inferior,

217
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,879
it will make people
feel cheap and low-end.

218
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:37,800
And

219
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,639
if each room is with a theme,

220
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,440
how do we mass-produce?

221
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,080
I have inquired about
the price of raw materials.

222
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,119
It can be totally controlled
within the budget you gave me.

223
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,280
What about the labor cost?

224
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,320
The labor cost is twice as high as usual

225
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,759
for the precision I require.

226
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,680
Will the cost

227
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,560
be subsidized by your studio?

228
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,239
You two still have time to adjust,

229
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,200
but if it's at this level next time,

230
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,280
I can only assume

231
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,839
that your studio's capacity is limited

232
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,719
and we have to consider
terminating the cooperation.

233
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,759
(All capitalists are the same.)

234
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,280
(He said we were ingenious
when we accepted the project.)

235
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,160
(When it comes to execution,)

236
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,359
(all they think about is money,)

237
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,560
(cost and profit.)

238
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,200
(If your project is perfect,)

239
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,599
(then there is no flaw to be found.)

240
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,400
Don't waste our time.

241
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,080
Report to me in my office
when you're done.

242
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,839
Why did you fight like this?

243
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:31,920
Oh, my God.

244
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,960
And your hands.

245
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,519
I didn't fight.

246
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,400
It's a misunderstanding!

247
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,239
But Xu Zehao

248
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,680
was hit by Xia Tian.

249
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,280
What?

250
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,239
Wei,

251
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,999
two cups of coffee,

252
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:41,680
Americano and latte.

253
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,280
No sugar.

254
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,719
Okay.

255
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,519
Do you think

256
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,519
this will affect Xia Tian's work?

257
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,560
No.

258
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,639
Xu Zehao may get Xia Tian
some trouble for a few days,

259
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,800
but he wouldn't fire Xia Tian.

260
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:50,680
Why?

261
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,680
Think about it.

262
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,960
The contracts are all signed.

263
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,839
Can he fire her?

264
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,800
If so, the project would be dead.

265
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,440
Right?

266
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,200
If Xu Zehao keeps
getting Xia Tian trouble,

267
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,080
I wonder

268
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,400
if what I did is counterproductive.

269
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,119
No.

270
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,200
Xu Zehao,

271
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
although normally he's kind of annoying,

272
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,960
he takes his work seriously.

273
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:07,960
Do you know each other well?

274
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,080
No.

275
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,839
I heard it from Song.

276
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,119
He and I are just online friends.

277
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:15,920
We'll just like the posts of each other.

278
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:17,320
Wait.

279
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:18,680
What's going on with your scar case?

280
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,879
Did you find the girl?

281
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,639
I'm not sure yet.

282
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,920
Let's get back to work.

283
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,320
Two cups of coffee are ready.

284
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,280
Thank you.

285
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,680
Wait,

286
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,200
if Xu Zehao gets Xia Tian
trouble on work,

287
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,200
you have to tell me.

288
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
I don't want Xia Tian to be upset.

289
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,239
You don't know who would be upset.

290
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,040
I remeasured it on the scene.

291
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,160
The dimension is basically right.

292
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,519
I also replaced the wood.

293
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:49,920
Then...

294
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,359
Comfortable.

295
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
About parts and components,

296
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,160
I've

297
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:03,519
listed

298
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,920
the cost, retail price,

299
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,839
and wholesale price.

300
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,560
So we can...

301
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
Comfortable.

302
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,759
Nice.

303
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,999
We can make a reduction of 20%.

304
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,519
Is that the best you can do?

305
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,639
Just one question

306
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,639
can make you change everything.

307
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:28,879
Comfortable.

308
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,359
Mr. Xu.

309
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,080
Don't fool us.

310
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,839
All the modifications now

311
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,960
are everything you asked for.

312
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,359
I'm not happy about it.

313
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,080
Redo it.

314
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:38,920
Oops.

315
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,239
Nice.

316
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,800
Great.

317
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,839
There are few people in our studio.

318
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:46,920
You are too respected for us to serve.

319
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,839
You were the one
who said our costs were high.

320
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,160
Now we lowered the cost,

321
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,160
and you said we didn't insist on it.

322
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,639
Who cares this nasty job!

323
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,639
Song.

324
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,239
Pack things up.

325
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,359
Change your ideas
when you get questioned?

326
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,119
If you really insist on it,

327
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:02,879
you should

328
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,119
try to convince me from the start.

329
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,239
Just a minor problem.

330
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,879
Didn't we have a disagreement

331
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,680
before Miss Xia came?

332
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,920
Didn't that all work out?

333
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:15,920
Calm down.

334
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,479
OK?

335
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,680
Harmony brings wealth.

336
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,479
Okay?

337
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,719
The old rule.

338
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,119
Table tennis.

339
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,200
One game to decide the winner.

340
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,759
You're not so foolish

341
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,320
to think you can beat me

Why are you here?

I heard there's
a table tennis game today.

Are you afraid of failure?

You called somebody

to help?

354
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:41,879
You think too much.

I'm

good enough to beat you.

I'll play for Xia Tian.

358

Let's have a good game.

359
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:48,759
Sure.

360
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,359
Dr. Guan.

361
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,400
Don't be that polite.

362
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,680
You played in such a gentle way.

363
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
You're giving me the scores.

364
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,680
Although I am the client of Xia Tian,

365

rest assured.

366
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,080
I wouldn't blame her.

367
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:51,759
Mr. Xu.

368
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,200
Don't tell me

369
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,560
you only know such a simple smash.

370
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,479
You might not be able to

371
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,719
catch the gentle ball.

372
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,920

Mr. Xu.

376
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,960
You look a little nervous to me.

377
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,920
Weird.

378
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,160
Why is there so much sweat in my hand?

379
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,400
If it's serious,

380
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,560
you can come to our hospital.

381

Hyperhidrosis can also
be treated in our hospital.

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,640
Yeah.

383

Yeah.

384
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,160
Yeah.

385
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:16,840
Yeah.

386
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,120
Yeah.

Yeah.

Match point.

392
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,479
Fighting!

393
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Yeah.

394

395

It's okay.

398
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,360
It's okay.

399
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,999
A deal is a deal.

400
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,160
One game to decide the winner.

401
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:39,719
Admit defeat for bet.

402
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,440
Mr. Xu.

403
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:43,960
I can accept your proposal,

404
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,039
but you'd better make it perfect.

405
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,239
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

406
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,360

You're great.

Xu Zehao.

409
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:10,680
What?

410
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,799
I don't want you
to take personal grudge to work.

411
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,880
A game is a game.

412
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,960
Business is business.

413
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,759
Don't mix them up.

414
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,479
That makes sense.

415
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:19,960
But I don't want to hear it.

416
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,559
And,

417
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,120
do it again sometime.

418
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,840
If you want to lose again,

419
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:25,880
then let's do it.

Don't we go to Xu Zehao's company today?

425
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,039
Just some daily work.

426
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,200
Why do we have to go?

427
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,079
It's happier here in my own house.

428
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Didn't he say we should work there?

429
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,960
We do whatever he says?

430
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,160
Since when you became so obedient?

431
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,120
Besides,

432
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,440
it was just a whim.

433
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:17,960
What can he do if I don't go?

434
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,360
Later,

435
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,360
we'll go there
at the time of results report.

436
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,440
Huh?

437
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,600
You have the guts.

438
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,360
Oops.

439
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:26,519
You play well.

440
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:26,759
Hey.

441
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,079
Come on.

442
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:27,559
Drink some water.

443
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:29,680
By the way,

444
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,120
the new budget Xia Tian made is so high.

445
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,479
Are you sure about it?

446
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,440
One game to decide the winner?

447
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,559
Isn't that a little hasty?

448
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:38,640
I'm sure about it.

449
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,759
I've made the calculation.

450
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,319
The budget is going to be way over.

451
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:43,840
The extra budget

452
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,719
will be covered by us.

453
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,319
What?

454
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,479
Are you sure?

455
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,759
Yes.

456
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:49,920
Let's begin.

Why are you here?

460
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,079
Look in the mirror first.

461
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
What is it?

462
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,319
Certainly,

463
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,120
even if I've stayed up a long night,

464
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,840
I still can't hide my charm.

465
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,999
Just some dark circles.

466
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,200
Did you stay up all night?

467
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,279
Don't always do so.

468
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,279
Staying up late makes one age.

469
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,640
Be careful, or you'll be like me.

470
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,759
What's wrong with you?

471
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:13,400
I...

472
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:14,960
I need hair transplant.

473
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,400
So you know it's bad to stay up late.

474
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,600
I thought you didn't have
that much conscience.

475
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,559
What are you doing here so early?

476
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:29,239
As a client,

477
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,200
can't I inspect the progress

478
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,200
of your work?

479
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,600
Take your time.

480
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,640
But didn't we make a deal

481
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,719
to have meetings at my company?

482
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,799
Why do you suddenly
break your promise again?

483
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,600
When do you see

484
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,160
a Party A keeps running to Party B?

485
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,960
If I do the drawings,

486
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,279
I have to see the wood sample.

487
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,840
You see, all of these.

488
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,360
Here.

489
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,279
Your company doesn't have them.

490
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,079
I can't always run back and forth.

491
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,120
I'll be there for the results report.

492
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:57,719
Um.

493
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,039
I thought about it all night.

494
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,479
We may not be able to
avoid those intelligent things.

495
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,400
Or we make it a little ingenious,

496
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,239
and more invisible,

497
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,120
like adding some wood veneer,

498

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,680
I mean he shouldn't be there.

683
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,400
I'd let you win
even if he didn't show up.

684
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,960
Thank you.

685
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:05,200
But what do you take me for?

686
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,600
You can do whatever you want to me to.

687
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:07,759
Besides,

688
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,920
the rules of the game
have been laid down.

689
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,880
When you lose, just admit it.

690
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,120
I admit it.

691
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,400
I admit it.

692
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,400
You know who I am, don't you?

693
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,999
I don't know.

694
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,519
By the way,

695
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,239
the last time
I slept over at your house,

696
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:23,640
that's more than enough for both of us.

697
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,239
I don't want him
to get suspicious again.

698
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,519
So please

699
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:27,400
be careful.

700
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:27,880
Thank you.

701
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,479
Oh, my God.

702
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:37,719
Come here.

703
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,759
What's wrong?

704
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,920
Your boyfriend.

705
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,440
