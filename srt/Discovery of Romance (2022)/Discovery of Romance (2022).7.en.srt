Hey.

Actually...

21
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,279
Actually, we don't have to be so scared,

or feel guilty.

23
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,000
We didn't do anything wrong.

Forget it.

In order to avoid unnecessary trouble,

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,559
you get there first.

27
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:51,559
I'll find a way in the back later.

Guan Xin.

You are here.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,440
Take a seat.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,320
Hello.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,800
Good to see you again.

37
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:27,599
Guan Xin.

38
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:28,679
Sorry.

39
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,839
I was too busy today,

40
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:33,040
so I was so confused

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,480
that I sent him the message

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,559
I wanted to send to you.

43
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,200
Sorry.

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,080
If that's an excuse,

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,119
that's pretty clumsy.

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,159
How could you
make such a stupid mistake?

47
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,279
Right.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,119
She made me, the client,
look like a fool.

49
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:50,760
Well,

50
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,200
it's because a client like him
is so hard on us,

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,399
giving us too much to do every day,

52
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,999
so I got so confused.

53
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:57,559
And there's been
a lot of messages lately,

54
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,760
so I sent out
the wrong messages all the time.

55
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Maybe you should eat mine first.

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,439
Are you hungry?

57
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:08,679
I'll go get some more.

58
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:10,399
Okay.

59
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:15,839
I am sorry.

60
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,279
There's been
a lot of coincidences lately, huh?

61
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,760
Haven't you heard the old saying?

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,960
If there are many coincidences,
then they might not be coincidences.

63
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,640
Maybe they're driven by fate.

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,520
You like Xia Tian, right?

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,640
I've told you,

66
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:32,399
yes.

67
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,719
You are free to like her.

68
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
And I don't want
to keep my eyes on her all the time.

69
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,320
But I do hope you

70
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,399
to restrain yourself.

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,839
What is it?

72
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:39,800
Are you afraid she'll waver?

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,439
No.

74
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:41,599
Not at all.

75
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,599
And?

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,320
I am afraid it would affect her.

77
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,879
As a client,

78
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,080
if you pursue a partner, Party B,

79
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,200
it will bring

80
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,640
great inconvenience to her work.

81
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,040
I just want her
to be comfortable doing her job.

82
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,360
You don't have to worry about that.

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,879
I just came here

84
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,480
to find out

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,960
what kind of person you are.

86
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,040
After all, you haven't explained

87
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,200
the thing that happened in the hospital.

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,559
I don't have to explain it to you.

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,760
It was just a misunderstanding.

90
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,599
What?

91
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,839
Did you tell Xia Tian?

92
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,999
Am I that nosy?

93
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,599
- Recently, the hospital...
- How is your work?

94
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,359
- Busy?
- Busy?

95
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,760
By the way,

96
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,880
I found a timber mill
for the main material.

97
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,960
They have a good stock of timber there

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,839
and have already sent
the sample pictures to the chat group.

99
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,120
We can go and check it sometime later.

100
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,080
Okay.

101
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,919
I am full.

102
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,880
I'll go first.

103
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,599
Xia Tian.

104
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,200
Can you stay away from him

105
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,159
when you're off work?

106
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,320
Don't be mad today.

107
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,080
Sorry.

108
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,000
Have you ever done anything wrong to me?

109
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:56,719
That's it.

110
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,760
If you are not mad,

111
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,200
kiss me.

112
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:05,640
Go on eating.

113
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,039
(Why can't I be cool)

114
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
(when this guy shows up?)

115
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:25,760
Give me some stomach medicine.

116
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,159
What is your condition?

117
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:27,560
Gastric acid?

118
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,080
Or diarrhea?

119
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,799
Or stomach bilges?

120
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:29,680
Just eating too much.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
For adults or kids?

122
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,000
For me.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,880
Just a moment.

124
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
38 yuan in total.

125
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,359
Hello, sir.

126
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,880
What can I do for you?

127
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,839
Give me some stomach medicine.

128
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,080
Oh.

129
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,320
Okay.

130
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,359
Please wait.

131
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,440
Did you eat too much?

132
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,640
I bought it for my friend.

133
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,520
What about you?

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,599
I...

135
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,239
Make a guess.

136
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,599
Give me a box

137
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,359
exactly like his.

138
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,479
Are you still in pain?

139
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,440
Why are you here?

140
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,719
Didn't you have
a stomachache last night?

141
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,479
I called you and you didn't pick up.

142
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:26,200
I brought you some medicine.

143
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:26,960
Take it.

144
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,320
That painful, huh?

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,799
What's wrong?

146
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:43,880
Alright.

147
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,440
You're so dirty.

148
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,239
Does it still hurt?

149
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,159
The pain has gone away since you came.

150
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,080
Um.

151
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:19,520
What's wrong?

152
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,239
Are you sleepy?

153
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,239
This shoulder helps me sleep.

154
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,839
Actually,

155
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:35,280
that little head of yours
helps me sleep too.

156
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:14,999
Hello.

157
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,359
Dr. Guan.

158
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,119
(Will you be free
at 5 o'clock tomorrow?)

159
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,599
I want to discuss with you about

160
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,080
that cleft lip and palate boy
you mentioned.

161
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,639
Yes, I am.

162
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,280
Okay, email me the pictures

163
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,519
when you're free.

164
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:27,320
Okay.

165
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,440
I'll send you now.

166
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,119
Thank you, Dr. Guan.

167
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,320
(I'll hang up and send it to you.)

168
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:31,879
Okay.

169
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,800
The surgery

170
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,119
is going to be done in three times.

171
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,759
After the first two surgeries,

172
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,800
these scars

173
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,560
will be gone.

174
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,280
I'll give him a lift
above the upper lip.

175
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,359
This raised part right here,

176
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,999
I might need
to use the cartilage in the ear.

177
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,359
How long will the surgery last?

178
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,519
Well,

179
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,040
normally 2 hours,

180
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:00,719
and maybe 3 hours if it takes longer.

181
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,200
I'll see how it recovers after 6 months.

182
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,719
I might need the laser therapy.

183
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,759
I'll try

184
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,800
to eliminate them all.

185
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,239
Okay.

186
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,599
I'll be with him through this surgery.

187
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,800
Thank you, Dr. Guan.

188
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:34,359
Thanks for your hard work today.

189
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:35,800
Never mind.

190
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,920
You work for several jobs,

191
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,680
and help these kids run around.

192

Don't you get tired?

193

No.

194

I'm happy doing these things.

195
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,440
So,

196
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,599
I'm extremely motivated.

I don't think
I can afford to treat you this.

It's too expensive here.

I was planning to take you

Really?

If you are being so polite to me,

Right?

how can you explain?

We've never had a fight before,

That's better than not saying anything.

If it keeps going like this,

339
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,999
the problem between us will be bigger.

And you've been playing dumb.

341
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,519
It will make me think you are gullible.

Don't give me that chance.

00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,039
I won't give you that chance, either.

344
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,200
So I don't want you

345
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,559
to have dinner with that deer.

346
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,200
Do you know you're being super selfish?

347
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,039
So what?

348
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,120
I'm not going to change.

349
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,680
If I won't change,

350
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,640
will you be bad to me?

351
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,640
I won't.

352
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,559
But you

353
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,880
cannot work with Xu Zehao anymore.

354
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,479
Would it be inappropriate to say so?

355
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,719
Super selfish.

356
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,960
That's why I didn't say it.

357
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:13,559
Don't worry.

358
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,079
We are really just partners.

359
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,200
When the partnership is over,

360
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,920
we'll never see each other again.

361
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,479
(Unbounded)
The main material is fine.

362
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,120
But

363
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,759
the design of this table

364
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:31,799
is too cold,

365
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,479
not mild enough.

366
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,200
And what's wrong with the couch fabric?

367
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,920
It's so showy.

368
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:35,360
So...

369
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,559
So is this screen.

370
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,640
You did a great job in designing,

371
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,239
but why is it here?

372
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:41,200
All the sunlight from the southeast
is blocked out.

373
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,880
Can't you see
these problems on your own?

374
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,920
Redo it.

375
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,559
Mr. Xu.

376
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,840
All these proposals

377
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,559
were voted through at the last meeting.

378
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Now you're just going to tell us

379
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,120
to do it all over again?

380
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,799
Just redo it twice
and you cannot stand it.

381
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,319
As long as the client is not satisfied,

382
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,319
you'll have to modify it
no matter how many times.

383
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,999
What you've designed right now

384
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,479
is just like something
that a college graduate would do.

385
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,600
The professionalism and specialization
are far from sufficient.

386
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,400
There's a huge difference

387
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,840
between an ethereal concept

388
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,440
and a complete design proposal.

389
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,360
Five years ago, you...

390
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,759
Mr. Xu.

391
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,479
I'll modify the proposal

392
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,120
until you're satisfied.

393
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,079
But don't doubt my work attitude.

394
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,640
Because even as Party B,

395
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,079
I also need respect.

396
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,920
You go tell her.

397
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
The next time when the client speaks,

398
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,239
don't interrupt.

399
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:29,479
The client also needs respect.

400
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,279
Go and get her back.

401
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,279
I have something for her.

402
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,120
Miss Xia.

403
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:37,719
Hey.

404
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:39,640
Well.

405
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:40,880
Both of you,

406
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,319
what's going on now?

407
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,160
After the table tennis game,

408
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:44,880
I thought he was already

409
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,239
sold on your proposal.

410
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,880
But there's

411
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,640
something wrong now.

412
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,600
I really admire you.

413
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,960
How did you manage to

414
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,880
work with a person
like that for so long?

415
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,799
I got used to it.

416
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,920
I'll discuss with Song when I'm back.

417
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,840
What he just said does make sense.

418
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:02,680
Yes.

419
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,039
That's just the way he is.

420
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,319
He talks so harsh.

421
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:06,200
But sometimes,

422
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,120
it makes sense.

423
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,600
Today they

424
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,960
called him again

425
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,999
and said there are a lot of questions.

426
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:12,479
So he's actually
under a lot of pressure.

427
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,319
He just carries all by himself

428
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,319
without telling you.

429
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,719
He's just anxious

430
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,640
and hopes you can
make something to prove yourself.

431
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,719
Oh.

432
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,799
He said he had
an important document for you.

433
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,239
You still owe me an apology.

434
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,440
You sent me the wrong message
to go to the restaurant.

435
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,600
I can't get over it.

436
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,440
Apologize to me first.

437
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,400
I am sorry.

438
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,039
Next time, don't embarrass me
in front of your boyfriend.

439
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,600
I'm not obligated to act with you.

440
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,680
Take this back.

441
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,719
There are some pictures

442
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,840
you can refer to.

443
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:42,360
Hello.

444
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:43,719
Here.

445
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,120
Take a look.

446
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,640
(Coffee menu)

447
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,920
It's so expensive.

448
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:52,640
It's okay.

449
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,999
Isn't that
what hanging out is all about?

450
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,640
Order whatever you want.

Isn't that what will happen
when working with an ex-boyfriend?

522
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,120
He knows

You can see that

531
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,559
I changed the color of the carpet,

532
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,079
and removed the screen here

533
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,920
