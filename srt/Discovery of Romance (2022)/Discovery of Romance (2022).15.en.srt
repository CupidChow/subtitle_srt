I thought you'd be rational about this.

But now I see that it only got worse.

Just look at her design sketch.

in the market at all.

Before you say anything,

let's forget that
she's my ex-girlfriend.

Okay.

The works are fine.

87
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,640
I never said there's
anything wrong with her works.

88

But,

according to the financial statements,

90
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,320
it's not convincing enough
that it has to be her.

91
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,279
We only need an executive designer

92

better choices.

96
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,240
Then I can only say

97
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,520
that all the overruns
are still reasonable.

that we should be able to

00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,439
establish priority.

109
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,480
I did it as you said.

or isn't important,

113
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,599
you don't get the answer

114

from other people

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
or from conventional values.

116
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,799
Instead, you should listen to
what your heart tells you.

117
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,560
You are so naive.

118
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:25,960
You would say this

119
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,039
all because you already got

120
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:28,719
what you wanted before.

123
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,399
It's impossible

124
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,080
to have everything you want

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,000
without any sacrifice.

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,039
From the moment you made the choice,

127
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,120
you've lost the right
to choose another life.

Do you understand?

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,479
Then take me as greedy.

130
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,839
Perhaps I'm seeing this in hindsight,

131
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,120
or just coming to awareness.

132
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,680
Maybe I'm being full of myself,

or only self-sentimental.

134

I didn't have a choice back then.

135

But now that I have the ability

136

and the opportunity,

00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,799
I know how hard you worked.

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,680
You shouldn't quit now.

175
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:42,520
I asked you not to go

176
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,200
accept the materials

177
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,599
only because of

178
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,719
my personal reason.

179
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,200
I wanted to avoid you.

180
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,640
I really didn't know

181
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,159
about An Ye's visit.

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,320
I didn't handle it right.

183
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:01,200
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,479
And,

185
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,880
I dug up

186
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,080
your graduation project.

187
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,560
And I sent it

188
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,760
to your favorite designer, Alex.

189
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:14,880
After he is back,

190
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,799
I want to

191
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,200
find an opportunity

192
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,159
to introduce you two.

193
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,919
You withdrew from the ADA competition
because of me.

194
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,279
This time,

195
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,919
I want to make up for my mistakes.

196
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
I hope you won't give up.

197
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,479
You should carry on your work.

198
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,800
Take a look.

199
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,400
I...

200
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,440
I went to see your dad.

201
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,759
Why did you go?

202
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,320
I wanted to apologize.

203
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:24,400
For not attending the funeral,

204
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,359
and not taking good care of you.

205
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,040
I promised him

206
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,239
to protect you

207
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:37,999
and indulge you.

208
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:41,800
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,719
I didn't keep the promise.

210
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,560
When he passed away,

211
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,160
why didn't you just tell me?

212
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,879
I thought you could sense it

213
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,680
and feel it.

214
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,479
We were together for five years.

215
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,639
I thought

216
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,160
we understood each other well enough.

217
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,800
I thought as long as I said

218
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,200
that I need you,

219
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,759
you would come to me no matter what.

220
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,519
I always thought

221
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,879
you were just being emotional

222
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,320
because you were sensitive.

223
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,599
I've never thought of

224
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,519
you being in trouble.

225
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,519
I didn't even have the patience

226
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,560
to try to understand you

227
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,400
and ask you if you were really sad.

228
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:06,999
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,320
I'm sorry, Xia Tian.

230
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,440

231
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960

Actually, I didn't even know
that my parents had divorced

00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,519
until my dad had the accident.

250
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,040
I always thought my parents

had the most perfect marriage.

252
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,960
They didn't communicate much,

but I always thought

254
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:18,879
that was just

255
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,680
the way they lived together.

256
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:22,999
Only until that day,

257
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,320
my dad had the accident

258
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
with another woman,

259
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,920
I found out that the love had long gone

260
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,280
in their marriage.

261
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,719
Perhaps I never acknowledged the fact,

262
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,800
so I didn't have the courage to face it,

263
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,440
let alone talking about it.

264
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,639
When we went camping
by the sea that day,

265
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,800
he told me a lot

266
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,960
and also requested a lot.

267
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,800
He asked me not to argue with you,

268
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,639
and to always lose to you unconditionally

269
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,680
after we get married.

270
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,560
He asked me to see you

271
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
as the last woman I ever loved.

272
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,879
But,

273
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,040
I don't think I've done any of that.

274

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,879
But...

276
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,599
It wasn't hopeless to solve them, right?

277
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:37,719
Well then...

278
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,400
Let's leave that opportunity
to Guan Xin.

Thank you.

Why are you being so polite to me today?

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,160
Ah.

371
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,479
Can you order something
less spicy next time?

372
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,120
This is too spicy.

373
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,799
You said you wanted something spicy.

374
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,160
This is way too much.

375
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,920
Ugh.

376
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,400
You are so hard to please.

377
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,160
What's wrong?

378
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,319
Can you finish crying first?

379
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,519
How are you going to
eat anything like this?

380
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,279
Yeah.

381
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,079
What happened?

382
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,400
Why can't you tell us?

383
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,640
Xu Zehao came to me.

384
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,120
What?

385
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,239
What did he want?

386
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,079
To break up with me.

387
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,600
Didn't you two break up

388
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,479
five years ago?

389
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,200
Yeah.

390
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,640
He said,

391
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
he didn't know why I broke up with him

392
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
five years ago.

393
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,719
So he never accepted it.

394
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,440
And I never stopped hating him.

395
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,239
So it didn't count.

396
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,440
But he just accepted it.

397
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,160
So...

398
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,319
We officially broke up.

399
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,200
He wished me happiness.

400
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,360
This is a good thing.

401
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,200
Why are you crying?

402
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,880
Right.

403
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,600
Here.

404
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,319
Don't cry.

405
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,160
Wishing each other happiness

406
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,200
and living one's own life.

407
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,600
There's nothing better.

408
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:53,799
Yeah.

409
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,880
I shouldn't cry, right?

410
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,239
This is a good thing.

411
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,279
Why would you cry?

412
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,360
Here. Have some meat.

413
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,279
I don't want to cry.

414
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,400
But I can't control it.

415
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,440
The tears just keep running down.

416
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,319
I don't want to.

417
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,239
But I just can't help it.

418
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,200
Then cry if you want.

419
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:11,680
Crying all the bad things out.

420
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,440
Don't they say it in the show

421
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,999
that people who cry while eating

422
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:17,920
can smile while living?

423
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,920
Now you finished crying.

424
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,880
You can have a nice meal.

425
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,479
Here.

426
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:21,640
Xia Tian.

427
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,600
No one is mighty.

428
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,680
Cry if you want.

429
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:26,279
At least you have us at home.

430
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:26,840
Yeah.

431
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,799
Don't worry about

432
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,479
the guesthouse project.

433
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,039
Yu Hui and I

434
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,079
will take care of it.

435
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,880
You should see each other less.

436
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:35,400
Yu Hui?

437
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,519
What?

438
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,440
What's it got to do with him?

439
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,079
What's going on?

440
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,680
I have to...

441
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,440
I owe you an apology.

442
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,319
I'm not a good friend.

443
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,039
There are so many things
I can't even face myself.

444
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:46,440
So,

445
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,160
I can't share with you.

446
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,640
Be quiet.

447
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,319
Is she okay?

448
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,239
I don't know either.

449
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,880
Should I go wake her up or not?

450
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,319
Don't.

451
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
She's definitely not awake yet.

452
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,600
The way she cried last night
just broke my heart.

453
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,079
Morning!

454
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:22,479
It's all...

455
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:23,719
Morning.

456
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:24,920
We made breakfast.

457
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,319
Do you want to have some first?

458
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,719
I'm going out.

459
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,680
Got a date with Guan Xin.

460
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:32,920
Why is she so happy?

461
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,840
It's terrifying.

462
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,600
Is this what people in love do?

463
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,400
Love?

464
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:39,600

We're having more and more of a rapport.

487
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,999
But the longer it gets,

488
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,759
the more problems
we'll find on each other,

489
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,319
and the more tiring
the relationship will become.

490
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,120
I don't think so.

491
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,360
The more memories we have together,

492
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,640
the better and more natural

493
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,039
our relationship will become.

494
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,600
But in this world,

495
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
people always change,

496
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,479
and relationships too.

497
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,360
Even if others do,

498
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,840
we won't change.

499
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,479
Look.

500
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:16,200
We had so many misunderstandings,

501
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,600
and so many fights.

502
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,360
But no one said a word
about breaking up.

503
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:21,039
But no matter how hard you try,

504
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:21,680
and how much you love each other,

505
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:23,920
you still get into fights inevitably.

506
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,559
You get tired

507
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,200
and you change.

508
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,440
That's probably just what people do.

509
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,479
They get tired.

510
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,920
Have you

511
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,759
loved anyone like that?

512
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:42,319
Ah.

513
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,279
Guess I'm right.

514
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,519
You got hurt deeply?

515
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,319
No.

516
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:54,200
Just giving out my opinion.

517
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:56,759
Xia Tian.

518
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,999
I don't know what you've been through.

519
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,319
But I won't change.

520
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,239
If there's any problem between us,

521
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,200
I'll solve it.

522
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,960
As long as you trust me

523
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,840
and love me,

524
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,279
I'll always have
the motivation to love you.

525
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,360
Trust me.

526
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,440
Okay?

527
00:26:58,999 --> 00:26:59,519
Lili.

528
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,840
The operation went very well.

529
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
You can go home in a couple of days.

530
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,759
I'll take you to a nice meal after that.

531
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:04,279
Okay?

532
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,920
Lili is so brave.

533
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,440
After we take off the bandage,

534
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,120
you will be the most beautiful girl
in the world.

535
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,039
What is it, Lili?

536
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,519
Is your forehead hurting?

537
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:21,719
Lili.

538
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:23,319
What is it?

539
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,680
You can tell me.

540
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,880
I miss my mom.

541
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:34,840
Lili.

542
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,239
I am

543
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,279
your family.

544
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,840
I'll always be with you.

545
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,319
Do you trust me?

546
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,479
Don't cry.

547
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,039
Be good.

548
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,680
When I get back,

549
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,120
I'll bring some snacks here

550
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,319
for you, okay?

551
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,120
Don't cry.

552
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:54,960
Good girl.

553
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:58,680
(Xia Tian)
(How is it going?)

554
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:00,120
(Did it go well?)

555
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,479
(It did.)

556
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,960
(I just finished the operation.)

557
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,640
(Coming over right away.)

558
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:09,799
Dr. Guan.

559
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,479
I'll go home to get something.

560
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,759
We rushed here today.

561
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,600
I forgot something.

562
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,039
I'll send you back.

563
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:15,920
Don't bother.

564
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,279
I can ride the electric bike.

565
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:18,920
It's inconvenient to ride a bike

566
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,440
to get those stuff.

567
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,640
Let me give you a ride.

568
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,519
Okay.

569
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,360
Thank you, Dr. Guan.

570
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,719
Up there.

571
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,039
Here we are.

572
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:54,880
This is my home.

573
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,920
So Lili and you...

574
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,200
You live here?

575
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:08,840
Yeah.

576
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,840
It's a small place.

577
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,559
But we can live comfortably here.

578
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,440
How do you sleep?

579
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,600
Lili sleeps here.

580
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:17,319
And me here.

581
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,640
This is really convenient.

582
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,600
It can be a bed at night.

583
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,920
And you can fold it

584
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,400
and put a little table here in the day.

585
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,479
Can you sleep well in this?

586
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Of course.

587
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:30,840
I sleep very well here.

588
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,200
Pack your clothes

589
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,039
and everything you need.

590
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,559
I'll take you to a hotel.

591
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,079
No need.

592
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,640
That's too expensive.

593
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,319
It's a waste of money.

594
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,960
Lili just had an operation.

595
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
This place...

596
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,600
I mean

597
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,600
it's better for her recovery

598
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,840
if you live
in a hotel near the hospital.

599
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,200
Just go.

600
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,840
I'll wait for you.

601
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,799

What did I say?

Lili is at the hospital.

671

Be careful when you pick her up.

672

That was my first time
being honest with Xia Tian about this.

673
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,200
Actually, it was not
completely the truth.

674

Maybe 70 percent.

675
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,759
Because I haven't told her

676

about Lu Xi.

677
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,519

what she's thinking.

680
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,319
Maybe she wants me to be more honest.

681

Actually,

682

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,400
I'm not a person who's used to lying.

686
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,120
Because...

687
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,600
It feels really bad

688
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,680
when you can't sleep after you lie.

689
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,799
So this time,

690
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:03,880
you really decide to give her up?

691
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,719
I'm not giving up.

692
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,039
I'm just letting go of

693
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,599
my possessiveness

694
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,039
and unwillingness.

695
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,320
I want her to have a better life.

696
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
So what did she say?

697
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,679
I...

698
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:40,840
It seems

699
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,159
I only realized now

700
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,199
how to love someone.

701
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,199
Another one, please.

702
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,960
Thank you.

(Unbounded Space Design Firm)

704
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:24,479
Do you know

705
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:25,880
that a pig can do a better job than you?

706
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,760
Do it again!

707
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:27,360
I'm sorry.

708
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,360
Sorry, boss.

709
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:33,960
Are you full?

710
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,479
Should I order another one for you?

711
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:37,159
Didn't I say

712
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,479
you can't eat on the working table?

713
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:42,039
I...

714
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:42,999
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

715
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:43,840
I'm late.

716
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:44,880
For how long?

717
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,840
One...

718
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,320
One hour.

719
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:46,880
Why?

720
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,199
The traffic

721
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:48,960
in the morning...

722
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:49,960
So it's my fault

723
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,920
for having a meeting in the rush hour.

724
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:51,999
No, no.

725
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:53,440
It's my fault.

726
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,960
Buy coffee for everyone.

727
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,360
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

728
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:00,320
This...

729
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,679
Whose drawing is this?

730
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:02,880
Boss.

731
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,079
It's mine.

732
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:06,479
Why did you put the socket here?

733
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,479
After the bedstand comes in,

734
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:10,159
are you going to dig a hole through it?

735
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,320
Do it again.

736
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,559
Which smart guy did this?

737
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,479
You put a table

738
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,639
next to the radiator.

739
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,519
Can't you see that?

740
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,199
The wood is going to crack

741
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,400
next to the radiator.

742
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:22,679
Everyone, please.

743
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,199
The thing above your shoulder.

744
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,800
It's not an ornament.

745
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:26,599
So use it.

746
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:27,720
Think with your brain.

747
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:28,920
Um...

748
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,519
Mr. Xu.

749
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,559
The placement of furniture

750
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,440
and the look of the whole place

751
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,280
are supposed to be arranged

752
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,639
by Miss Xia on the site.

753
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,599
She's more familiar with

754
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,599
the details and...

755

Yes.

Call Xia Song Studio.

758
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,479
Okay.

759
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:52,599
Dismissed.

760

Boss.

761
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,079
I'm calling them now.

762
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:09,599
Hello.

763
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,320
Mr. Yu.

764
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:10,720
What is it?

00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:11,360
(Oh.)

about the placement of the furniture.

771
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,679
Xia Tian ordered all the furniture.

772
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,639
Wait a second.

773
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,960
I'll ask Xia Tian to talk to you.

774
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:23,479
Boss.

775
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Should I talk to Miss Xia?

776
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,519
What?

777
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:33,800
Um.

778
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,159
We'll do the talking.

779
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:37,760
Okay.

780
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:38,720
Go ahead.

781
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:40,479
Where do we put the desk?

782
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,800
Where do we put the desk?

783
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,079
The desk.

784
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,199
The desk should be near the window

785
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,479
in the home office area.

786
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,720
The desk should be in the home office

787

near the window.

788
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,039
The bedstand?

789
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,079
One or two?

790
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,519
One.

791
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,199
She said,

792
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,240
one bedstand.

793
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,840
The dining table?

794
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,920
Do we have to use elm wood?

The elm wood.

796
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:08,999
Yes.

797
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:09,840
The elm wood.

798
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,599
Sectional couch

Sectional.

Sectional couch.

802
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,159

Anything else?

805
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Ask how she's been doing lately.

806
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:30,960
I won't.

807
