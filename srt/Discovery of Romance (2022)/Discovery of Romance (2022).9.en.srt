There's no cheesecake today.

Perhaps...

Can I get you something to drink?

What do you offer here?

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,720
We have Americano,

Okay.

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,240
Soymilk?

We don't have soymilk here,

39
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,000
but we have milk,

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,559
both hot and cold.

41
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:56,960

I'm sorry.

We don't have soymilk here.

Thanks.

It's shiny.

00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,599
I have to alert her later.

Hello.

55
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,240
Hey.

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,439
It's you.

57
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:55,080
Ah.

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,960
You do manicure too?

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,719
I have a lot of jobs around here.

60
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:00,760
But you can rest assured.

61
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
I'm pretty good at it.

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,279
Here.

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,520
See if you like

64
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,480
any of the colors first.

65
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,800
I

66
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,399
usually do some woodworking.

67
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,040
Do you have the right manicure for me?

68
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,399
What?

69
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,760
You do woodworking,
but you still want manicure?

70
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,640
Can't I?

71
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,360
Ah.

72
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,559
Okay.

73
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,999
Let me cut them short for you,

74
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,399
and trim the dead skin

75
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,159
and nail fringe.

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:20,800
And then I'll do a nail care for you.

77
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,119
Is that it?

78
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:23,679
Um...

79
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,119
I'll just go home and do it myself.

80
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,240
Let me put on some hand cream for you.

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,320
This is really good.

82
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,480
The grease

83
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,640
may destroy my wood.

84
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,719
Thank you very much.

85
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:42,800
Um.

86
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:43,999
She's very cute.

87
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,960
There's only one merit on her.

88
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,399
She's nicer than me.

89
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,200
There's

90
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,480
no threat at all.

91
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:55,480
This kind of girl
can really give the boys

92
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,399
the impression
of being gentle and harmless.

93
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,760
But as a member of them,

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,800
I can see right through their ambition.

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,800
So she's

96
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,080
still a bit too naive.

97
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,520
I really don't want to be the woman
who checks boyfriend's phone,

98
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,279
checks his GPS

99
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,679
and insults the other woman.

100
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,320
To tell the truth,

101
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,439
I would never allow myself

102
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,640
to be curious about
this sort of thing before.

103
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,760
But probably because of Guan Xin's

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,359
attitude.

105
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,279
He seems to be hiding something,

106
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,239
but I don't want to blame him

107
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,279
for my discomfort.

108
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,159
After all, he is such a nice guy

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,320
and would be kind to everyone.

110
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,039
But there are still some places
that are inaccessible.

111
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
What are they?

112
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,200
What's happening?

113
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,359
Do you know the other day Xia Tian

114
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,239
suddenly asked me something?

115
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,039
She's like thunder,

116
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:41,599
slashing at me.

117
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,599
I almost got killed.

118
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,239
When?

119
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,960
The day you had dinner with Lu Xi.

120
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:47,839
What's happening between you two?

121
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,159
What?

122
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,560
She and I are only friends.

123
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:52,599
I don't care if you're friends,

124
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:53,560
or a doctor and a patient.

125
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:55,320
Xia Tian knows about it now anyway.

126
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,399
Xin,

127
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,200
you take care of yourself.

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,239
Well...

129
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,599
When she asked you,

130
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:04,960
what did you say?

131
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,599
Of course
I said something nice about you,

132
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,560
saying you are so kind

133
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,960
that you donate to people in poor areas

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,960
and care for small animals.

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,159
I didn't say anything

136
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,479
about you and Lu Xi.

137
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,159
You should be careful.

138
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:14,880
Okay?

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,520
Come in, please.

140
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,120
It's lunch time.

141
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:23,440
Hello.

142
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:24,080
Lisa.

143
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,080
Are you here?

144
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,479
Yes, it's time for you
to have the double-eyelid surgery.

145
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,239
I'm coming right away.

146
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:27,960
Hey.

147
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,640
You're here.

148
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,359
I'll do the double-eyelid surgery.

149
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:29,760
Okay.

150
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,440
Xia Tian.

151
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Why are you here today?

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,640
I guess you haven't had lunch yet.

153
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,599
I was just passing by this store.

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,719
I remember last time
someone said you liked it,

155
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,599
so I bought it for you.

156
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:43,200
This is...

157
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,760
Um.

158
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,159
Skewered food?

159
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:51,440
I waited in line for a long time.

160
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,680
Don't you want to try it?

161
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,839
I'm not very hungry.

162
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,839
Do I really have to eat it?

163
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
You've been working all morning.

164
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,359
How can you not be hungry?

165
00:05:58,719 --> 00:05:59,120
Well...

166
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,080
Xia Tian.

167
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:00,599
I...

168
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:01,760
I...

169
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,399
Try it.

170
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:04,760
Um.

171
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,399
I made it extra spicy for you.

172
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:11,719
Okay, this one.

173
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:12,880
Come on.

174
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:14,039
Ah.

175
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,359
Ah.

176
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,039
Right.

177
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,399
And this one.

178
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,960
Right.

179
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:22,880
Have a try.

180
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,919
I am okay.

181
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:25,760
Just have one.

182
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,640
I waited in line for a long time.

183
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,399
Um.

184
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,239
Good.

185
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,359
How is it?

186
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,239
Is it good?

187
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,520
Well, Xia Tian,

188
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,799
maybe you should have some too.

189
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,039
I don't eat spicy food.

190
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,120
You know that.

191
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,320
And

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,760
I hate street stalls.

193
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,200
Ms. Wu.

194
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,960
Heehee.

195
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:02,960
Hey.

196
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:05,960
Let's go hiking.

197
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:07,719
No.

198
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
At our age,

199
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,440
hiking is good for us.

200
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,159
We can get vitamin D in the sun.

201
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,919
Is it okay if I don't like hiking?

202
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,880
Hiking helps you sleep.

203
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,719
After getting sweaty by hiking,

204
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:18,839
you can get asleep soon.

205
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:20,120
Unfortunately,

206
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:21,359
Director,

207
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,560
I sleep soundly every night.

208
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,039
Hey.

209
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:28,200
You are a relationship expert.

210
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,799
Do you mind if I ask you
a question about relationship?

211
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,320
Okay.

212
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:32,479
There is a woman in the hiking group

213
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:33,640
who is

214
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,279
younger than you

215
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,239
and...

216
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,839
Haha!

217
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Prettier than me.

218
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,039
And then?

219
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,359
Recently, she

220
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,479
always bothers me.

221
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,479
She makes eyes at me,

222
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,440
and brings me beef in sauce

223
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,359
and cookies.

224
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,200
Congratulations.

225
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,760
Well.

226
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,159
I'd like to ask you

227
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,000
how can I say no to her?

228
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,279
Director.

229
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:52,719
Um.

230
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,039
I've been writing about
relationships for half my life.

231
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,960
What you're doing right now

232
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,560
is the most naive

233
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,359
and simple way

234
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,159
in relationship games.

235
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
What does it matter to me

236
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,799
if she likes you or you like her?

237
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,320
I don't like old men.

238
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,440
Do you get it?

239
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
Didn't you say I'm naive?

240
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,839
Just go.

241
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,000
No way.

242
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,320
I like climbing now.

243
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
And you

244
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
are a mountain

245
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,919
I must climb in this life.

246
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:23,919
I'll keep at it.

247
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,359
Alright.

248
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,080
I'll come again tomorrow.

249
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,160
I'll get you some clothes for hiking.

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,160
See you tomorrow.

251
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,680
Psycho.

252
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:41,400
(Unbounded Space Design Firm)

253
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,800
The beams are a little loose.

254
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,200
Remember to have the workmen
reinforce them.

255
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,160
Then repaint

256
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,999
the entire interior wall.

257
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:49,080
Because I want it to be beige.

258
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,280
I'm sorry, guys.

259
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,040
I'm late.

260
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,440
Do you know how late you are?

261
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,960
20 minutes.

262
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,400
Everyone is waiting for you.

263
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:07,800
I won't be late again.

264
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:08,920
Take a seat.

265
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,200
Yu Hui.

266
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,800
Yes?

267
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,599
Don't schedule the meeting
so early next time.

268
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,599
After the beams are reinforced,

269
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:17,040
you can have your original design

270
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,119
for the hanging chair back.

271
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,599
Ah.

272
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,320
Um.

273
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,839
But it's best
not to put it at the entrance,

274
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,280
because I think it would destroy

275
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,400
the structure of the whole space.

276
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:30,800
Xia Tian.

277
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,599
Miss Xia.

278
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,239
What do you think?

279
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:39,719
No problem.

280
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,119
Perfect.

281
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,239
Do you know what I said?

282
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,719
Oh.

283
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:44,599
Well,

284
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,800
I talked about this before
with Xia Tian,

285
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:47,960
about the hanging chair.

286
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,040
It cannot be placed at the entrance.

287
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,999
This way,

288
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,839
it may look like a scenery,

289
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,479
and

290
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,599
it's quite nice.

291
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,200
But it actually affects
people's comings and goings,

292
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,639
right?

293
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,080
Right, about this,

294
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,359
I checked with Song

295
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:00,999
last night.

296
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:01,359
Um.

297
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,879
Please focus at the meeting.

298
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,599
Okay.

299
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,560
We need to purchase the tiles
for the floor again...

300
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:16,384
(Guan Xin)

301
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,599
We have to

302
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,119
purchase a new batch of tiles.

303
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,519
Because...

304
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,200
Let's take a break.

305
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,080
What's wrong with you today?

306
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,320
Got in a fight with your boyfriend?

307
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,999
I'm sorry I disturbed everyone

308
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,359
at the meeting just now.

309
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,839
As your client, I want to remind you.

310
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,680
Don't bring your personal feelings
to work.

311
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
It won't happen again.

312
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,200
Xia Tian.

313
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,960
Did you find out about that girl?

314
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
You know it too?

315
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:18,519
Ah.

316
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:20,680
I just happened to see it.

317
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,639
So you really found it out.

318
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,200
I have figured it out.

319
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,599
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

320
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,560
Stop that.

321
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,200
If you have any doubt in your mind,

322
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,560
you'd better ask Guan Xin all about it,

323
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,200
instead of just thinking about it.

324
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,999
Of course,

325
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,560
if you think things
really aren't working out

326
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
between you two...

327
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,280
Not at all.

328
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,359
Just some misunderstanding.

329
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,160
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

330
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,599
Auntie, how is it?

331
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,719
It feels okay, right?

332
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,879
Quite natural.

333
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:50,519
Haha!

334
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,119
Ah.

335
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:51,759
Right.

336
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,719
I can't tell at all.

337
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:53,519
Auntie, I'm telling you.

338
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,599
These non-surgical treatments

339
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:55,960
are tailored to your skin,

340
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,040
especially safe and effective.

341
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,960
Besides,

342
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,440
your skin was pretty good.

343
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,719
Look at your skin.

344
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,560
It's rosy, glossy,

345
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
and bright.

346
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,680
You're just like a young girl.
Do you know that?

347
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,719
You had honey this morning,

348
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:06,160
right?

349
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
So sweet.

350
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,440
Well.

351
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,359
If not for the schoolmates' reunion,

352
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,160
I wouldn't have got this.

353
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,879
Oh.

354
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,759
Auntie, you are going to a reunion?

355
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,359
Then you just stand there,

356
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,519
and you'll attract all the attention

357
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,359
and become
the center of the group photo.

358
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,200
I didn't understand

359
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,119
why Guan Xin is so handsome.

360
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,359
Now I finally get it.

361
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,160
Thanks to the genes.

362
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,400
Haha.

363
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:28,680
Alright.

364
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:29,639
That's enough.

365
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,680
Oh,

366
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,320
don't say anything to Guan Xin.

367
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,680
I don't want him to know.

368
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Rest assured, Auntie.

369
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:36,639
Alright.

370
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,359
I'll go to check on Guan Xin.

371
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:37,639
Okay.

372
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,440
Auntie, mind your step.

373
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,920
Okay.

374
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,599
Hello, who is it?

375
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,879
Me, Xu Zehao.

376
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,320
Bro Hao.

377
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:23,320
Okay.

378
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,639
Let's go with this scheme.

379
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,320
Mom.

380
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,239
Why are you here?

381
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,200
I made you some chicken soup.

382
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,560
Oh.

383
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,999
It's not good for you if you're always
eating takeaway at the hospital.

384
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,119
And the restaurants are unsanitary.

385
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:38,960
Come on.

386
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,080
Drink it before it gets cold.

387
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,719
Thank you, mom.

388
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,119
How does it taste?

389
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:48,920
Um.

390
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,160
Mom's cooking.

391
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,040
Guan Xin.

392
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:59,440
I have something

393
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,080
to talk with you.

394
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,560
Um.

395
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:03,200
What's wrong?

396
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,519
Well,

397
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,280
for all these years,

398
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,800
I've always treated you like my own son.

399
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,400
Mom.

400
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,519
Why did you bring that up
all of a sudden?

401
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,080
I always keep that in mind.

402
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,639
I'm just worried about you

403
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,599
being too much burdened.

404
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,160
You can't let go of something.

405
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,879
What happened when you were a kid

406
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,160
has passed,

407
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,639
so just let it go.

408
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,680
The most important thing
is to cherish the moment.

409
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,160
What do you think?

410
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,800
Um.

411
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,239
Mom, I understand.

412
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
If you really do,

413
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,879
then I'm going to take this picture
away from you.

414
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,359
Mom.

415
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,680
I met Lu Xi.

416
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,519
Did she recognize you?

417
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,320
I don't think so.

418
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,719
How did you meet her?

419
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,280
I met her when I bought you coffee

420
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,320
the other day.

421
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
She works several jobs

422
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,239
in this place on her own,

423
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,119
living a difficult life.

424
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,759
You have to stop seeing her.

425
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,680
What if she recognizes you?

426
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,320
We adopted you instead of her,

427
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,239
because...

428
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,040
Forget it.

429
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,479
Each one has his fate.

430
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,560
That's her fate.

431
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,239
You don't have to be burdened with that.

432
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,680
Mom.

433
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:32,519
I was wondering

434
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:33,599
if I could tell

435
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,440
Xia Tian everything about it.

436
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,320
Because I'm going to marry her one day.

437
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,239
I don't want to keep it from her.

438
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,599
You don't have to tell her

439
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,759
who you are even if you get married.

440
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,479
You two are fine just the way you are.

441
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:48,999
Okay.

442
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,440
I got it.

443
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,200
Then I am leaving.

444
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,599
About Lu Xi,

445
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:03,960
don't think too much about it.

446
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,280
Do you hear that?

447
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:05,839
Um.

448
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,519
I see.

449
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,960
(Youwu Pub)

450

Bro.

452
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:35,879
Long time no see.

453
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:36,800
How are you doing recently?

454
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,599
What do you want me for?

455
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,200
I heard you work with
Xia Tian's boyfriend.

Ah.

00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:50,879
Yes.

461
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:51,519
I know him.

462
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:51,920
I know him.

463
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,320
What's he like?

464
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,639
He's a nice guy.

465
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,040
I think he's good

466
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,119
and nice.

No, no.

00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,879
I didn't mean that.

470
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:04,920
I meant

471
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,479
you two are not the same type.

472
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:07,360
He...

473
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,960
Guan Xin is very obedient,

474
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,319
just like a puppy.

475
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,120
Xia Tian knows quite about him.

476
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,840
As long as she asks,

477
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,799
he'll be back in a heartbeat.

478
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,759
For example,

479
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,440
if Xia Tian asks him
to eat the hospital,

480
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,360
he'll chew up the hospital

481
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,999
without saying a word.

482
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:21,400
That's how he is obedient.

483
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,719
I think he's cheating on her.

484
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,160
Cheating?

485
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,440
Ay.

486
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:29,680
I see.

487
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,079
Must be Lu Xi, right?

488
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:32,479
Bro.

489
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,960
You are wrong.

490
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,079
Lu Xi and Guan Xin

491
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,200
are just friends.

492
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:37,440
They're not what you think.

493
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,319
I saw them cuddling.

494
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,719
What?

495
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:47,440
Well...

496
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,440
I really don't know that.

497
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,880
I've always felt
something going with Guan Xin.

498
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,840
He always asked me about Lu Xi.

499
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,519
I can see it right away.

500
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,120
They definitely have
a special relationship.

501
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:04,279
Bro.

502
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,799
You really saw

503
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,479
the two of them cuddling?

504
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:10,600
Yes.

505
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:23,960
Uh!

00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,360

00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,200
I randomly have meals.

520
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,719
Sometimes I don't eat,

521
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,279
or just come here
and bring some skewered food

522
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,440
for a midnight snack.

523
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,400
Miss, you're here.

524
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,479
If you have any doubt in your mind,

525
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,880
you'd better ask Guan Xin all about it,

526
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,519
instead of just thinking about it.

527
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Miss?

528
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:36,880
Sir,

529
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,079
I'll change the address.

530
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,160
Okay.

531
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:38,920
Hey.

532
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:39,999
I remember you.

533
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,600
You're the guest in my shop.

534
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,160
What are you doing here?

535
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,319
I'm his girlfriend.

536
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:48,759
Well.

537
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,200
You must have some misunderstanding.

538
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,479
So you came to find me in the shop?

539
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,319
What's the misunderstanding?

540
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,600
You're not supposed to be

541
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,999
in this place, right?

542
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,319
So what are you doing here?

543
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,799
Hey.

544
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:04,600
You're here.

545
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,039
Come in.

546
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,600
I made some noodles.

547
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,200
Let's have some together.

548
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,120
Dr. Guan.

549
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,719
Your girlfriend's outside the door.

550
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,279
Xia Tian.

551
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,640
It's not what you think.

552
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,799
Dinner is ready.

553
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,200
But I don't think I got any.

554
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,640
Just pretend I don't exist.

555
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:04,440
Just eat.

556
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,840
You can talk about the things
you always talk about.

557
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,799
Not always.

558
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,239
This is her first time here.

559
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:15,960
Right.

560
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,640
This is my first time here.

561
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,920
I didn't know about the dinner, either.

562
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,200
It's just that she works really hard.

563
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,759
So...

564
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,079
So my boyfriend is a gentle,

565
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,440
considerate and kind man.

566
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,440
Is this a good time to nod?

567
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,440
No, no.

568
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:32,759
I...

569
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,360
I don't know what kind of person he is.

570
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,279
Well, I mean,

571
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,079
he is a good man

572
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,999
who likes to help people in trouble.

573
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,440
Because he bought you
such an expensive gift,

574
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,120
and made you a homemade meal.

575
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,840
Right?

576
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,640
I'm sorry.

577
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
I have things to do,

578
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,799
so I have to go now.

579
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,960
I'll leave you be.

580
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,160
I'm sorry.

581
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:11,960
Looks like you're really cheating on me?

582
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,120
Cheating?

583
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,279
Why are you making it so serious?

584
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:16,880
You know better than I do

585
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
how good I've been to you.

586
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,440
Then who just left me out the door

587
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:21,479
and dragged her in?

588
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,440
Do you have any idea
how awkward I was outside that door?

589
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,039
Yes.

590
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,719
I am being nice to her.

591
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:28,160
But

592
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,039
it's not the same as what I do to you.

593
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,160
She is an orphan.

594
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,719
She has no family.

595
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,079
She's been working
really hard by herself.

596
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:42,840
So you don't think I work hard, right?

597
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:43,999
No.

598
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:44,880
I didn't mean that.

599
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,880
You work hard too.

600
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,440
But

601
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,640
your hard work is not the same...

602
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,360
Don't you have a family?

603
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,319
You have your studio

604
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,719
and many friends.

605
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,120
Your hard work
is not on the same level as hers.

606
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,279
Can you understand?

607
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,079
No.

608
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,360
So you can understand hers?

609
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,759
Even if she is your patient,

610
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,600
I think you're going too far.

611
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,200
Or are you being nice
to all your patients?

612
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,039
No.

613
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,559
Absolutely not.

614
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,880
She told me she has no time for dinner

615
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,360
after work every day,

616
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,600
so I thought I'd make her a meal...

617
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,519
So if she still has no meal tomorrow,

618
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,360
you're going to
make her another meal like this, right?

619
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:22,559
No.

620
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,279
Absolutely not.

621
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,120
I promise.

622
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,440
Guan Xin, you can help her.

623
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,120
But,

624
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,999
you have to let me know.

625
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:30,920
Okay.

626
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,880
I won't see her in private anymore.

627
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:34,719
I'm sorry.

628
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,279
Phone.

629
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,039
Check it.

630
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,880
Don't let a word go.

631
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,519
I don't want to check it now.

632
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,279
What's wrong?

633
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,039
Why not?

634
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,079
If you check it, you can clear my name.

635
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,799
I want to make you learn from it

636
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,360
by doubting you

637
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,200
and torturing you.

638
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,039
Okay.

639
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,519
Then keep doubting me

640
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:13,719
and torturing me

641
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,400
forever.

642
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:15,999
OK?

643
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:33,920
Xia Tian.

644
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,600
Do you forget something?

645
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:43,920
Do I?

646
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,079
Do you think

647
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,440
I was out of line last night?

648
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:54,960
It's okay.

649
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,319
You totally have the right to do that

650
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,799
in situations like last night.

651
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,200
You...

652
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,640
Be careful.

653
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,479
I don't want to be the kind of woman

654
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,559
who always checks her boyfriend's phone

655
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,999
and always worries about
her gains and losses,

656
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,160
like a maniac.

657
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,360
You can't let me become like that.

658
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,880
Okay.

659
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,239
It's all my fault.

660
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,799
And

661
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,360
you should behave in the hospital.

662
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,039
Don't be so nice to all those girls.

663
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,519
You are so sweet to the nurses

664
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,039
and the patients.

665
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,440
They will get the wrong idea.

666
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,559
Am I?

667
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,759
Yes.

668
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,960
You look so handsome.

669
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,920
If you smile at others,

670
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,999
they might get the wrong idea

671
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:34,039
that you're interested in them.

672
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:40,559
Okay.

673
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,799
Then I will only smile at you.

674
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,440
That's more like it.

675
00:26:56,162 --> 00:26:58,522
♪Why are you♪

676
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:01,202
♪In my life again♪

677
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,402
♪The breakup♪

678
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,920
Morning, Mr. Xu.

679
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
Why do you call me Mr. Xu? Bro Guan.

680
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,239
I'm here today to send Xia Tian to work.

681
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,960
Didn't we say to have dinner together?

682
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,719
What about

683
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:13,600
today?

684
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,600
Today,

685
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,680
he's got a full schedule,

686
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,279
not available.

687
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:17,999
Right.

688
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:19,559

so he just bought me
a card to kill time.

806
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,519
It's a period of burnout.

Now, he's

811

picking on me.

812
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,759
He told me he liked my simplicity.

813
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,719
Now he hates me for being sloppy

814
00:31:58,719 --> 00:31:59,360
and not dressing up.

815
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,999
He also said I have a flat nose

816
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,039
and asked me if I was planning on
getting my nose prettier.

817
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:03,680
Hey.

818
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,239
Your nose isn't flat.

824
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,479
your boyfriend cares too much about you.

825
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,239
Maybe he doesn't even
know about burnout period

826
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,999
and thinks you two are
in infatuation period all the time.

827

Right?

828

It is the burnout period.

It's true that he said he liked you.

832
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,479
It's also true
that he's sick of you now.

833
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,960
It's something like

834
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,799
he gets tired of you

835
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,039

00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:31,999
I'm busy.

859
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:32,799
You do it yourself.

860
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,319
Just help me.

861
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,840
I'm revising the files.

862
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,640
You do it yourself.

863
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,600
Come on.

864
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,559
This man is so bad.

865
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,680
I can feel the same way.

866
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,640
That's how I feel.

867
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,160
What is it?

868
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,799
It's called being tired of Xia Tian.

869
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,640
Uh-huh.

870
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,200
Hey.

871
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,479
What happened to you?

872
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:58,120
What else is there to do
with a man who has changed?

873
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,680
Quarreling.

874
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,039
Tangling.

875
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,999
Suffering.

876
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,120
I was tired at last.

877
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,519
So we women need to remember,

878
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,240
never cater to others.

879
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,039
Always be yourselves.

880
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:10,679
Yeah.

881
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,400
Always be yourselves.

882
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,760
Hello.

883
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:20,720
Right.

884
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,920
We're having a meeting outside now.

885
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,519
Oh, I see.

886
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,800
Where are you?

887
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,999
Okay.

888
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:26,720
Just a moment.

889
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,519
I'm be there

890
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:27,960
in a minute.

891
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,280
Um.

892
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,599
Excuse me.

893
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,039
The client?

894
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,880
Yes.

895
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
I have finished. I'll go back.

896
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,039
I'll be there

897
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,360
soon.

898
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,679
Take your time.

899
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:32,960
OK.

900
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,840
Bye.

901
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,360
You enjoy yourselves.

902
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:35,960
Um.

903
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,559
Xia Tian.

904
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,999
There are a few things
you remembered wrong.

905
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,920
I remember the ice cream thing.

906
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,999
But the hot dog thing,

907
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,479
I was not as bad as you said.

908
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,360
And...

909
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,800
And five years ago,

910
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,039
I was really busy before the breakup.

911
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,920
Is it important?

912
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,599
Isn't the memory a personal thing?

913
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:06,760
It's important.

914
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,960
We didn't break up because of changing.

915
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,840
Even if the last few days were dull,

916
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,720
in those five years,

917
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:13,920
we at least had a lot of happy memories,

918
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,559
didn't we?

919
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,400
Didn't we?

920
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,679
Are you sure about that?

921
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,159
Are you sure

922
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,679
there were more happy days?

923
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,679
As I expected, even after five years,
you're still so narcissistic.

924
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,679
Or do you think that after five years,

925
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,800
I am still the same Xia Tian
who you pushed around,

926
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,679
did everything you said

927
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,240
and could be easily bullied?

928
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:33,159
I didn't think
you could be easily bullied.

929
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,880
And you cannot be easily bullied at all.

930
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,479
That's right.

931
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,999
Continue with your unrequited love.

932
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,800
It's going to

933
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,440
get worse than this.

934
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,960
And don't be too sure about everything,

935
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,599
especially those in the past.

936
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:52,760
After all,

937
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,440
memory is a personal thing.

938
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,039
Sir, your receipt

939
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:03,720
and Tie Guanyin you requested.

940
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:06,760
Song.

941
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,280
Yes?

942
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,440
This...

943
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,159
Here you are.

944
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,519
Please give it

945
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,559
to the uncle for me.

946
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,280
Which uncle?

947
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,199
Xia Tian's dad.

948
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:17,320
Isn't this his favorite?

949
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,159
Xu Zehao, you've got to be kidding me.

950
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,559
Are you sure
you're talking about Xia Tian's dad?

951
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,280
Yes.

952
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,800
Her dad died.

953
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,280
Don't you know that?

954
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,999
A month before you
broke up with Xia Tian.

955
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,880
Don't tell me you don't remember?

956
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,440
What are you talking about?

957
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,679
Xu Zehao.

958
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,760
No one

959
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,519
would choose to break up with Xia Tian

960
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,519
at that time,

961
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,519
but you did.

962
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,199
Why did you tell him about my dad?

963
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,199
He gave this to me

964
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,280
and told me to give it to your dad.

965
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,880
I was scared to death.

966
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,039
Hey.

967
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,360
What is going on?

968
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:13,639
How could he forget uncle's death?

969
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,880
He remembers
that uncle liked to drink Tie Guanyin.

970
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,280
He really doesn't remember anything?

971
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,559
No.

972
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,800
He acted as if

973
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,519
he heard it for the first time

974
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,199
and so shocked.

975
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,479
I guess he was just
too busy to remember.

976
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,199
No way.

977
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:32,800
He remembers those petty things,

978
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:33,999
but not this significant thing?

979
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,840
I don't believe it.
