All right then. I'll stop talking.

The way you are not talking mean

Tell me.

170
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,040
Why did she say
something like this to me?

171
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:07,999
Huh?

172
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:09,999
Hey.

173
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,680
Morning, Song.

174
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,560
Morning.

175
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,839
You are going back
so early in the morning?

176
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:30,519
Yes.

177
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,119
Our trip is over.

178
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:33,639
Over?

179
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,800
Dr. Guan.

180
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,320
Last night,

181
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,719
why did you call me so many times?

182
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,560
I missed you.

183
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,759
Don't.

184
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:48,320
A lot of people like me.

185
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,200
I don't need you.

186
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,599
You can just like Xia Tian.

187
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,440
Okay.

188
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,879
Then we are going to check out now. Bye.

189
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:56,280
Bye.

190
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:56,879
Bye.

191
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Here, have some congee.

192
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Why did you drink so much again?

193
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,119
Morning.

194
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,519
Morning, Song.

195
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,960
Wow, that's quite a breakfast.

196
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,440
Right.

197
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
I can get you anything you want.

198
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,759
Milk, bread, fruit and an egg

199
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,040
keep the virus away.

200
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,800
Okay.

201
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,040
(Five missed calls from Guan Xin)
Guan Xin called me last night.

202
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,839
The two of them went out.

203
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,440
Why did he call me?

204
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:34,960
Xia Tian must have
been missing last night.

205
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,800
Tell me what the matter was.

206
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,400
You can rest assured
that I'm not taking sides.

207
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,759
You just tell me the truth.

208
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,320
Then I will help you analyze

209
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,999
from an objective point of view.

210
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,519
Last night when I went for a walk,

211
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,839
I met Xia Tian.

212
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,359
And then?

213
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,239
She cried.

214
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,479
What?

215
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Why did you make her cry again?

216
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:01,879
Maybe it's because of the work.

217
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,320
Xia Tian has not been
at work for a long time.

218
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Are you fooling me?

219
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:09,839
The point is

220
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,599
that Guan Xin saw her crying.

221
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,200
I knew it would be more than that.

222
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,359
The last time you sent Xia Tian home,

223
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,560
didn't I tell you

224
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,759
not to get involved with them?

225
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,960
Why are you still doing this?

226
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,239
Can't you just keep it simple?

227
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,800
Like you can eat when you're hungry,

228
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,999
and you can sleep when you're sleepy.

229
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,599
It's that simple.

230
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
You're a grown-up.

231
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,920
Come on, have more.

232
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,639
Um.

233
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,839
Have some fruit.

234
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,040
Fruit can help
gastrointestinal motility.

235
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,080
This is too much.

236
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,800
Not at all.

237
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,560
Xia Tian and her boyfriend
are going back.

238
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,759
It seems that the two of them

239
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,960
have made up completely.

240
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,759
Um.

241
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,479
I am relieved.

242
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,680
Um.

243
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,160
So sweet.

244
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:10,960
It's very sweet.

245
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,880
Then have more.

246
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,440
It's very sweet.

247
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,600
Xia Tian.

248
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,999
I just want to say,

249
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,640
no matter what you do,

250
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,920
I don't want you to be upset.

251
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,559
Let's forget about yesterday.

252
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,999
I want to be happy with you.

253
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,200
Okay?

254
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:42,719
So what are we going to do today?

255
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,600
I'll be with you to work today.

256
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,519
Are you sure?

257
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,360
Um.

258
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:49,960
Aren't you afraid of getting bored?

259
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,120
No.

260
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,120
I just want to know about your work.

261
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,160
If you need anything,

262
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,680
you can ask me for help.

263
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,960
Are you sure you want to see me at work?

264
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,039
Um.

265
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Are you sure you want to work with me?

266
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,239
Yes.

267
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,360

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,039
Do you see anything else
you need to change?

299
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,400
Song.

300
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,680
- Are you tired?
- Thank you.

301
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Do you want to leave it to tomorrow?

302
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,039
I want to get this over,
so I can do the report.

303
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:44,880
I've already made a list
of all the woodcarvings we ordered

304
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,440
for the guesthouse.

305
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,360
And

306
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,360
I have handed over
the scheme to be presented to Yu Hui.

307
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:49,920
I think

308
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,719
we can let
the construction team start now.

309
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,920
What kind of wood will be used
for the woodcarvings?

310
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,120
Didn't I tell you?

311
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,559
Pine, camphor and ginkgo.

312
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,920
What about the exact handover time?

313
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,279
Xia Tian said,

314
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,759
it should be around
the end of this month.

315
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,239
But according to our past experience,

316
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,759
it might be about two days early.

317
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
What do you mean?

318
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,680
If there is no definite time,

319
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,880
shouldn't I have been informed?

320
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,279
As the client,

321
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,079
shouldn't I know the time changes?

322
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,519
And I thought we made a deal before.

323
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,559
We will use the same kind of wood

324
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,719
to make a uniform tone.

325
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,160
Why did you change it
without authorization?

326
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
As the designer

327
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,479
representing our company,

328
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:27,479
Xia Tian should have informed me

329
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:29,079
before making these decisions, right?

330
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,360
Did you make any mistakes

331
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
in communicating in the middle?

332
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Xu Zehao.

333
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,400

have a good chat today with you,

00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,239
We've known each other for a long time.

339
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,120
Do you have to do this?

340
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,999
You know Xia Tian is responsible for

341
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,319
all the design details.

342
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,479
Now,

343
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,519
you put me in the middle
to deliver messages for both of you.

344
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,680
I have to deliver
what Xia Tian told me to you.

345
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,880
And then I have to deliver
what you told me to Xia Tian.

346
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,039
What do you take me for?

347
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,799
A sandwich biscuit?

348
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,999
I'm the one inside the sandwich biscuit.

349
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:19,719
I can't take it anymore!

350
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,680
Alright, stop drinking.

351
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,519
Don't drink too much.

352
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,840
Xia Tian has no feelings for you.

353
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,160
Ay.

354
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,319
Even not with

355
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,279
a tiny bit.

356
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,160
Don't you know that?

357
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:35,719
I know.

358
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,079
If you do, then why are you doing this?

359
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,799
Why can't you behave like a man?

360
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,360
Be a man. If you can't

361
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,920
act like a man,

362
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,319
at least be normal.

363
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,719
Be serious.

364
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,279
I don't act like a man?

365
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,079
In the past years,

366
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,880
who sent you home when you got dumped?

367
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,079
Back then, Donghao was busy with
the work at the hospital,

368
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,960
and I was the one
who carried you back, right?

369
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:57,680
You have no idea of
how high those stairs are,

370
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,719
don't you?

371
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:00,680
You have no idea of
how much you weigh, don't you?

372
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:01,880
So what?

373
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,239
I didn't say you took advantage of me.

374
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,719
You know about my dark history. So what?

375
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,079
You're also
the dark history of Xia Tian.

376
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,400
Today, let's make a deal.

377
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,400
We don't talk about this anymore,

378
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:14,680
okay?

379
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
Fine. I won't talk about it anymore.

380
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,400
Will you stop drinking?

381
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,120
I won't take care of you
if you drink too much today.

382
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,440
Do you know

383
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,039
how I envied you and Xia Tian back then?

384
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,039
It's true.

385
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,160
I thought you two were like

386
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
the hero and heroine in a fairy tale.

387
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,319
You two would love
each other all the time

388
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,319
and then live happily ever after.

389
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,479
Back then, you two

390
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
quarreled,

391
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:52,160
disappointed with each other,

392
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,920
and suspected each other.

393
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,360
But you two were connected together.

394
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,079
You two worked hard

395
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,319
for each other

396
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,319
to make each other happy.

397
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,200
What I want to see

398
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,319
is a happy ending for both of you.

399
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:09,719
In that case,

400
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:10,559
I hope

401
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,440
I could follow the example of you two.

402
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,920
I would like to believe

403
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,319
that there is that kind of

404
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,719
true love in this world.

405
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:19,319
But, Xu Zehao, what happened then?

406
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,239
You're a bad man.

407
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,440
You ruined it all.

408
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,519
You ruined my dream.

409
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:31,279
I'm telling you.

410
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,279
Even if I would be
too drunk to walk today,

411
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,640
I would rather sleep on the street.

412
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,920
I won't ask you to carry me.

413
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,479
I don't need you to carry me.
Put me down!

414
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,759
Alright, if I don't,

415
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:57,680
you'll crawl home?

416
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,719
I told you I'd rather crawl home today.

417
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,160
I won't ask you to carry me.
Put me down!

418
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,039
What have you eaten
for the last five years?

419
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,519
How did you get so heavy?

420
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,519
What? I am not heavy.

421
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:09,559
I have the same weight as before.

422
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,719
Don't move.

423
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,120
Don't move. I'm so tired!

424
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,239
No.

425
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,360
Put me down!

426
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:18,840
Put me down!

427
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,440
Song.

428
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,519
Let me say it again.

429
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,200
Song, I'm begging you.

430
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,559
Be quiet.

431
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,680
Put me down!

432
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,920
You took advantage of me.

433
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,719
Please.

434
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,079
T-T-Throw up

435
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:28,880
here.

436
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:38,960
Have some water.

437
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,319
Xu Zehao.

438
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,279
If it weren't you carrying me,

439
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,519
I wouldn't have thrown up.

440
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,120
You're a bad man.

441
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,759
Alright, it's all my fault.

442
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,799
Is an ex a sin?

443
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,239
I think I owe Xia Tian, not her, right?

444
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,079
And I'm out of Xia Tian's life now.

445
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,039
Ay.

446
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,319
There's something
I've never figured out before.

447
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,440
Why are all women

448
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,079
so active when it comes to blaming

449
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,079
their besties' ex-boyfriend?

450
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,600
I was in love with Xia Tian,

451
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,759
not her.

452
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,759
But she was always
the most aggressive one.

453
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,519
When it comes to
relationship of her own,

454
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,279
she would act crazy.

455
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,039
Have a relationship of your own!

456
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:22,400
Are you done?

457
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,479
If you're done, let's go.

458
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,160
Alright.

459
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,120
It was me who suffered in the end.

460
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,279
Oops.

461
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,559
What took you so long?

462
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,400
Help me.

463
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:37,999
Hurry up.

464
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,279
And she's so drunk. Oh, my God.

465
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:39,960
What were you doing?

466
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,039
Xu Zehao, put me down.

467
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:42,640
Don't move.

468
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,759
Put me down!

469
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,519
I told you I could do it myself.

470
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,319
Almost there.

471
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,160
Don't move.

472
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,400
Xu Zehao.

473
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,360
Be careful, slow down.

474
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,559
Watch your head.

475
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
She's so heavy.

476
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,279
I didn't ask you to carry me.

477
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,479
What did you do?

478
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:00,479
What happened?

479
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,519
Why don't you ask her
when she wakes up?

480
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,799
I want to know too.

481
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:08,999
My back.

482
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,120
Xu Zehao.

483
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,400
Xu Zehao.

484
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,160
You are

485
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,799
the worst kind of ex-boyfriends.

486
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,120
It's been years
since you broke up with Xia Tian.

487
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,920
You still made her cry.

488
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,239
And you're already an ex-boyfriend.

489
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:33,039
You should behave like an ex-boyfriend.

490
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,239
Don't live so well after the breakup.

491
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,239
You're even better looking
than you were a few years ago.

492
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,079
You are so bad.

493
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,319
I've been dating Xia Tian
for five years,

494
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,519
and I've known you guys for five years,

495
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,440
so we're kind of friends.

496
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
I haven't seen you guys

497
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,600
since I broke up with Xia Tian.

498
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,719
Do you really think
I want to be like that?

499
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,079
Just take me as a human.

500
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:55,999
Oops.

501
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:02,360
Song...

502
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,079
Let me send you back.

503
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,120
Do you know that you coming to my place
so often will make me

504
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,319
look forward to it?

505
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,319
(Do I have to explain those words?)

506
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,479
(What was she thinking?)

507
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:39,239
(I think he understands
the complexity of people.)

508
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:42,120
(What I said back then
is not the whole story.)

509
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,479
(I think he knows that.)

510
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,319
(If she meant what she said,)

511
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,360
(would she break up?)

512
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,960
- Well...
- Well...

513
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,440
After you.

514
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:58,160
After you.

515
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,440
Let's just try to be normal.

516
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,880
Don't be awkward all the time

517
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,239
and avoid seeing each other on purpose.

518
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:08,960
It's not good for work.

519
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,999
Well...

520
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,960
You were out walking alone that night,

521
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,799
because...

522
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:16,479
I couldn't sleep.

523
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,039
Can't we just be Party A and Party B?

524
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,160
I can.

525
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,120
What about you?

526
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,120
I can.

527
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
If you can, I can.

528
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,600
Then we have a deal.

529
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,120
Mr. Xu.

530
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:36,999
Um.

531
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,960
What are you doing
at my place in early morning?

532
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,840
I was worried
you wouldn't have the breakfast.

533
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,400
Hey!

534
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,160
Would you stop drinking every day?

535
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,400
It does no good to you.

536
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,400
And,

537
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,400
when are you going to

538
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,640
get over this?

539
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,840
I want to.

540
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,279
If you were me, could you?

541
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,039
Do you think she can really move on?

542
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,279
Then why did she send me back?

543
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:37,200
Maybe she couldn't get it over.

544
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,079
But,

545
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,200
she's just trying to be brave.

546
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,400
I've got all these voices in my head.

547
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,999
They're there when I'm awake,
eating and sleeping.

548
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,360
Hey, bro,

549
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,479
you just had a relationship.

550
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,759
You're not the first one,

551
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,160
and wouldn't be the last one.

552
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,519
People always say,

553
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,279
time will heal everything.

554
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,400
What can time heal?

555
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,759
Why do I feel
that the longer time passes,

556
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,479
the stronger the feelings in my heart?

557
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:05,039
We'll see in a few more years.

558
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,640
Then you will understand

559
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,319
how horrible time really is.

560
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:11,039
No one in this world is special.

561
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,840
The one you love so much

562
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,440
and you can't forget

563
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,160
will eventually become
one of the people you met.

564
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:17,840
You'll understand

565
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,400
that time will take everything away
from a person.

566
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
I know you're trying to be brave.

567
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,160
But it's fine.

568
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,239
Anyway,

569
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,960
it will pass.

570
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,600
When did you become
a master of relationship?

571
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,519
Have you had a relationship before?

572
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,559
I recently found
a particularly interesting

573
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,600
relationship column.

574
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,680
There's one saying

575
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,960
that the person who's never been
in a relationship has the best say.

576
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,360
Nonsense.

577
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,680
But why does that
sound so familiar to me?

578
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:57,039
The person who's never been
in a relationship has the best say.

579
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,840
People who aren't in love

580
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,799
know better.

581
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:08,360
Just some eye-catching thing.

582
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,440
People who have been in love

583
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,360
think their relationships

584
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,400
are representative of all people.

585
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,239
This is so arrogant.

586
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,400
Who wrote this?

587
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
Teacher,

588
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,960
didn't you write this?

589
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,559
Eh?

590
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:26,960
Impossible.

591
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,200
Let me see.

592
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,039
Ah.

593
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,079
Heehee.

594
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:37,559
I guess my sexy brain

595
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,880
went wrong that day.

596
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,239
And it got so many likes.

597
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,200
These people need their heads fixed.

598
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,360
I have to get some fresh air.

599
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,400
Be careful.

600
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,400
What are you looking at?

601
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,759
You.

602
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,239
I haven't seen you so happy
for so long.

603
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,640
Exercise releases dopamine.

604
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,440
It's a normal physiological reaction.

605
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
I thought

606
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,640
it was a psychological reaction.

607
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,079
Hey.

608
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
500 meters more,

609
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,999
we would have walked
two kilometers today.

610
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,319
500 meters to go?

611
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
No wonder I can't walk anymore.

612
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,559
Here.

613
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,559
It's almost two kilometers.

614
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,160
Have some water.

615
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,039
I will stop here.

616
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,519
Just hold on a little longer.

617
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,120
Let's go.

618
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,719
Let's go.

619
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,160
Let's go.

620
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,159
Hey.

621
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,920
I guess it feels good to walk

622
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,800
hand in hand.

623
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,240
Tsk.

624
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,159
Director, forget it.

625
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,360
Those who hold hands

626
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,360
are youthful and living in the moment.

627
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,360
We

628
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,519
have too much to worry

629
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,960
and too much pressure.

630
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,720
Young people can hold hands.

631
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,159
We can hold hands too.

632
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,559
We will be closely connected
when we are holding hands.

633
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,679
Right?

634
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,639
Live in the moment
and live up to the good times.

635
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:35,679
Come on.

636
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,119
Give me your hand.

637
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,880
Hold it firmly.

638
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,280
Let's go.

639
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,519
Li Donghao, hurry up.

640
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,240
Tan Xu?

641
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,519
This...

642
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,159
Why are you here?

643
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,599
And these flowers. What do you want?

644
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,720
Go back.

645
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,119
Do you hear that? Go back.

646
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,159
I meant you.

647
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,800
Go back.

648
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:12,440
Me? What do you mean?

649
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,119
