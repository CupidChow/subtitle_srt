I'd be upset too.

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,080
see you tomorrow.

171
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,759
Oh!

172
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,560
I really feel like

173
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,920
I've been in a spy show

174
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,200
these last few days.

175
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,200
Oops.

176
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,239
I think you take Guan Xin as a fool.

177
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,280
You picked up his phone,
slept at his house,

178
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,400
and he became your client.

179
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,119
Are you guys making an idol show?

180
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,440
Oh!

181
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,519
Oh!

182
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:13,800
It hurts.

183
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,119
Anyway, I think

184
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,320
as long as you don't tell him
that Xu is your ex-boyfriend,

185
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
there will be no problem at all.

186
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Let's tell him.

187
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,479
No way.

188
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:28,839
Li Donghao.

189
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,719
I'm almost deaf.

190
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,639
A word of warning as a man.

191
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,040
If a man acts like nothing happened,

192
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,280
it's just a disguise.

193
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,920
But men and women are alike.

194
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,400
They are sensitive to competitors.

195
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,239
It's human nature.

196
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,119
And don't forget.

197
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,280
We'll meet Xu Zehao a lot more.

198
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,440
We're going to earn his money.

199
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,839
To be honest,

200
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,719
Guan Xin is really a very nice person.

201
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,639
Are you going to keep him in the dark?

202
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,960
Maybe I should tell him.

203
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,400
Because of his pride,

204
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,119
we can't tell him.

205
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,680
And,

206
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,080
we should keep it a top secret.

207
00:09:59,479 --> 00:09:59,759
You

208
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,920
don't say a word about it.

209
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,519
Xia Tian.

210
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,960
About the secret stuff
that happened yesterday,

211
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:06,519
I can do it forever.

212
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,160
What do you think?

213
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,320
Am I loyal to you?

214
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,519
Just tell me what you want.

215
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,400
I was wondering

216
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,680
if I could borrow a sexy dress from you.

217
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:15,719
For the house warming party
with your junior fellow?

218
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,479
Woman,

219
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,759
don't be too smart.

220
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,320
This weekend.

221
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,440
One-on-one.

222
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,560
Song.

223
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,479
Song.

224
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,400
Take me with you.

225
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,119
I'll help you carry your bag.

226
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,320
What's that got to do with you?

227
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,400
Do you want a sexy dress too?

228
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,040
Just choose a dress and lend it to me.

229
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,119
Let's go to pick one.

230
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,599
Let's go!

231
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:52,999
Hey.

232
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,320
Dr. Guan.

233
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,920
Hi.

234
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,160
Why are you here today?

235
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:57,440
Well...

236
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:57,999
I...

237
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,920
I was having dinner
at the restaurant next door.

238
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,839
I have to wait a while
when they are packing the takeaway.

239
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,839
So I just stop by for a cup of coffee.

240
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,560
I know.

241
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,519
Americano.

242
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,920
Take your seat.

243
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,719
Just give me a second.

244
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,119
Okay.

245
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,440
Here.

246
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,160
Americano.

247
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,040
And the cake I just made.

248
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,680
You know how to make a cake?

249
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:23,479
Yes.

250
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,200
Have a try.

251
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,239
Does it taste good?

252
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,800
It's great.

253
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,080
That's what I do best.

254
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,359
Did you learn baking?

255
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,280
I...

256
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
I know baking,

257
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,960
and also making coffee

258
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
and doing manicure.

259
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,920
I also use some of my time
to deliver takeaway.

260
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,879
You know that many?

261
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,719
Are you short of money?

262
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,320
Yes.

263
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,440
A lot.

264
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,960
Did anything happen to you?

265
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,479
Do you think you're kind of weird?

266
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,680
When people ask questions like that,

267
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,239
either you're trying to chase me,

268
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,800
or you're trying to get my money.

269
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:05,999
I am not.

270
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,839
Lu Xi.

271
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:08,400
I mean...

272
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,800
Just kidding.

273
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,040
You are so cute.

274
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,239
I'm trying to save some money
to learn recording.

275
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,119
Recording?

276
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:18,280
Yes.

277
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,320
Why?

278
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,999
Because recording

279
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:24,440
is a very healing thing.

280
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
I often use my little tape recorder

281
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,759
to record

282
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,040
the sound of the waves,

283
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,800
and the wind of nature.

284
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,040
Sometimes if I get up early,

285
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,160
I can hear the chirping of birds,

286
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,680
and the wind

287
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,080
rustling the leaves.

288
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:46,599
Lu Xi.

289
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,160
What?

290
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,879
Have you ever thought about

291
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
getting this scar off you?

292
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,519
Are you worried about money?

293
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,839
I can help you apply for the grant.

294
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,839
It is also possible to do it for free.

295
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,320
For free?

296
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,359
Yes.

297
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,680
This is my business card.

298
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,280
If you make up your mind,

299
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,519
feel free to contact me.

300
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:12,560
Guan Xin.

301
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,320
Plastic Surgeon.

302
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:21,599
Can I talk to you

303
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,359
at the hospital after work today?

304
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,839
Okay.

305
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,839
No problem.

306
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,160
Can I get you something to eat?

307
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:35,920
Hello.

308
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,320
Hello.

309
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,479
Is the pasta I just ordered to take out

310
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:38,999
ready?

311
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:39,920
Please wait.

312
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,839
I'll have the black pepper beef pasta.

313
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,040
Okay.

314
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,239
Pasta with shrimp and peas.

315
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,080
Okay.

316
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,839
And salad.

317
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,119
Thank you.

318
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,920
Okay.

319
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:48,759
I've tried this restaurant before.

320
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,920
Their pasta is good.

321
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:07,119
Hello.

322
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,119
Hello, Xia Tian.

323
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,119
Are

324
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,280
you busy at work?

325
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:12,400
No.

326
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:13,479
I'm out for lunch.

327
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,719
Are

328
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,119
you alone?

329
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,680
It'll be cool if I'm alone.

330
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:19,920
I'm with Mr. Xu.

331
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,560
And we're going to
talk about work while we eat,

332
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,999
so it's just called having food.

333
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,080
Then take your time.

334
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,040
I'll meet you after work.

335
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,920
Okay.

336
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,519
You're pretty good with men now.

337
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,479
A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit.

338
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,519
Who is the pit?

339
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,280
It's not Guan Xin, anyway.

340
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,080
About the blind date,

341
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,359
he explained everything to me.

342
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,680
It's not as filthy as you think.

343
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,440
Well.

344
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:57,200
Why...?

345
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,440
Why do you say I'm filthy?

346
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,719
I know you.

347
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,160
I...

348
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,599
I'm a different person
than I was five years ago, okay?

349
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,560
I know.

350
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,280
I was not that mature five years ago,

351
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,440
but I'm a different person now.

352
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,280
And

353
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,440
we're going to
work together for a while.

354
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,839
I want to...

355
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,200
Stop.

356
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,639
You said yourself it's been five years.

357
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:14,639
It's been a long time.

358
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:15,759
For me,

359
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,879
it's all over now.

360
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,320
I'm happy with my life

361
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,560
right now.

362
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,320
So we just let bygones

363
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,440
be bygones.

364
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:25,759
Okay.

365
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,320
You seem very satisfied
with your boyfriend.

366
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,440
Sir,

367
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,400
your takeaway is ready.

368
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,920
Okay, thank you.

369
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,560
He's handsome and gentle.

370
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,759
Why not?

371
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,879
Doesn't he have any flaw or anything?

372
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:36,680
Like

373
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,479
gambling,

374
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,400
excessive drinking,

375
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,599
sleeping late,

376
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,479
or bad breath.

377
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,359
He's perfect.

378
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,639
Oh my...

379
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,280
He's totally perfect without any flaw.

380
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,999
And it's the most
satisfying relationship I had.

381
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,040
Do I need to emphasize that?

382
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,920
Hi, your meal is ready.

383
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,200
Please enjoy it.

384
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,639
Thanks.

385
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,440
We'll share the bill.

386
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:00,999
Okay.

387
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,320
I will just claim payment
with the invoice.

388
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,160
Thank you for the lunch.

389
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,359
If there's nothing else,

390
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,040
I'm leaving.

391
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:46,119
Right.

392
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:47,280
We've been to several stores.

393
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,879
Where are you going?

394
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,960
Guan Xin's hospital.

395
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,680
Pick him up from work

396
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,080
and give him a surprise too.

397
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,200
I...

398
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,080
I'll drive you there.

399
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,280
I didn't manage to stop you two
from seeing each other yesterday.

400
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,239
Do you think it's not messy enough?

401
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,119
Well, I have to go to the hospital.

402
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,680
Well.

403
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,719
What's wrong?

404
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,519
I'm going to

405
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,519
get some advice on hair transplant.

406
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:10,999
Stop staring at me.

407
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,160
You've offended me.

408
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,079
I just

409
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,880
want some advice.

410
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,559
Shall we go or not?

411
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,479
Turn right ahead.

412
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,719
Turn left

413
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:29,360
at the second intersection.

414
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:30,840
I know that.

415
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,759
I have a navigator.

416
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,600
You really take me as a chauffeur.

417
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,360
Dr. Guan.

418
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,479
I'm here.

419
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,880
I thought you wouldn't come.

420
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,799
Why?

421
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,759
Let's go to my office and talk.

422
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:51,960
Wait.

423
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,039
Actually,

424
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,880
I'm not asking about my scar.

425
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:57,600
I want to ask for someone else.

426
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,120
Is it okay?

427
00:17:59,519 --> 00:17:59,880
Sure.

428
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,519
No problem.

429
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,440
Really?

430
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,600
I heard you could apply for a grant.

431
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,759
Look, here is a boy

432
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,440
with a cleft lip and palate.

433
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,799
He's a lot worse

434
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,319
than my scar.

435
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,360
So I want to ask

436
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,160
if he can apply for a grant.

437
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:16,600
Sure.

438
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
He can apply for it.

439
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,239
Really?

440
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,719
Thank you, Dr. Guan.

441
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:22,479
May I have a rough idea

442
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,759
of how much it will be

443
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,960
if he applies for a grant?

444
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,559
He should be able to apply for free.

445
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,559
For free?

446
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,640
Thank you, Dr. Guan.

447
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,440
You are so nice.

448
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,319
The children in the welfare house
can be saved.

449
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,039
Thank you.

450
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:41,840
We are here.

451
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:51,840
What are you doing?

452
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,799
Well,

453
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,759
there is a No Stop sign over there,

454
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,400
so I can't pull over.

455
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,680
I've been here many times.

456
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,120
Nobody's ever said we can't pull over.

457
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:01,960
Really?

458
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,880
That could be a new one.

459
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,160
A new one.

460
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,840
We've missed it.

461
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,360
It's fine.

462
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
We'll just go all the way around.

463
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,680
Turn round.

464
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,880
I can't turn around here.

465
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,079
How do I put it?

466
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,600
You didn't do well
in the driving license test, right?

467
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:23,719
Don't worry.

468
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:24,640
Just go all the way around.

469
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,519
Okay.

470
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,600
You can get off now.

471
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,680
Isn't it forbidden to pull over here?

472
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,559
Oh, right.

473
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Where's the No Stop sign?

474
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,360
It...

475
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:53,519
It was just right here.

476
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,719
You did it on purpose.

477
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:00,440
Xia Tian.

478
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,120
I drove you here.

479
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,279
Don't you want to thank me for it?

480
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:12,120
Did you?

481
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,200
Won't you get off the car?

482
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,719
Why?

483
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:20,600
Next time.

484
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,680
Tsk.

485
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,440
Hello.

486
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,360
Where's Dr. Guan?

487
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Dr. Guan is off the work.

488
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,600
Then why didn't he reply my message?

489
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,400
Hello, it's 308 in total.

490
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:40,920
Okay.

491
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:44,920
- Hey.
- Okay.

492
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,400
It's okay. I'll pay it this time.

493
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,200
Thank you, Dr. Guan.

494
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,559
Never mind.

495
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,840
I'll take it.

496
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,079
I'll take it for you.

497
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:06,360
No need.

498
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:06,880
I'll take it.

499
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:07,479
Go.

500
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,759
They like to eat these stuff?

501
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,160
Yes, they just love these chips.

502
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Then you have to tell them

503
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,559
not to eat so many unhealthy things.

504
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,920
It's not enough to go on a blind date,

505
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,960
another one again.

506
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,640
Even flirting with the patient,

507
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,239
how can such a playboy
be called a perfect man?

508
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,960
He's totally perfect without any flaw.

509
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,680
And it's the most
satisfying relationship I had.

510
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,559
Do I need to emphasize that?

511
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,360
What a fool!

512
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
So stupid.

513
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,680
You said to have a house warming party.

514
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,079
Why are we eating out here?

515
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,519
I have to treat you to a nice meal.

516
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,319
Waitress.

517
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,039
Hello.

518
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:12,960
What do you want?

519
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,079
A meal for two, please.

520
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,239
Then

521
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,239
do you want to order anything else?

522
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:20,759
Don't bother.

523
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:22,200
A meal for two is enough.

524
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,079
You can order more.

525
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:23,840
It's on me today.

526
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,999
It's definitely enough.

527
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:25,440
That's it.

528
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,840
Thanks.

529
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,600
Okay.

530
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
What's wrong with your neck?

531
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,120
Nothing.

532
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,759
I'm just so tired from my recent move.

533
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,200
It'll be fine soon.

534
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,279
Right,

535
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,719
maybe you and I could

536
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,759
go to a hot spring someday.

537
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,559
I know a great hot spring.

538
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,880
I got you a present.

539
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,759
Open it and see if you like it.

540
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,519
What's that?

541
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:50,999
So mysterious...

542
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:52,719
What do you think?

543
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,200
Well,

544
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,239
Song.

545
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,319
I think

546
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,239
you and I cannot go to
a hot spring together.

547
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,360
What do you mean?

548
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,079
Well,

549
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,479
I think going to a hot spring together
is something a couple should do.

550
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,960
You and I are just ordinary friends.

551
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,680
I just got turned down,

552
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,360
right?

553
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,200
What's the big deal?

554
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,440
I'm not that clingy,

555
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,880
messy

556
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,200
or troublesome.

557
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,079
We're all adults.

558
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,920
You just need to clear it up.

559
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,880
Although

560
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,360
you treat it like a love relationship,

561
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,559
he doesn't think so.

562
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,759
Fortunately,

563
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,920
our friendship is not broken.

564
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,120
We can still be friends,

565
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,039
right?

566
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,160
Tsk.

567
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,440
We're all adults.

568
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,319
There is nothing I can't go through.

569
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,120
And I said that.

570
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,160
Love

571
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,120
is definitely not the whole of life.

572
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,640
He said...

573
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,200
When we were in college,

574
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,039
we've done a lot of things together.

575
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,640
We read together in the library.

576
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,319
I often reserved a seat
for you in the canteen.

577
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,640
The two of us ate together

578
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,279
and watched movies together every day.

579
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,440
Weren't we in a relationship?

580
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,319
And when you got a job,

581
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,120
wasn't I the first one you called

582
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,999
to know this good news?

583
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,319
I went with you

584
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,840
when you bought the car.

585
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:08,999
And Tan Xu,

586
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,719
when you rented the house this time,

587
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,799
I accompanied you
to look for the house for two days,

588
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,479
didn't I?

589
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
And for today's house-warming,

590
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,840
I'm the only one you asked out.

591
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,079
Tell me,

592
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,640
what is this if we are not
in a relationship?

593
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,400
So

594
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,279
between you and me...

595
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,559
We never slept together.

596
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,880
We've done a lot of things together,

597
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,120
but we never held hands,

598
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,479
or kissed.

599
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:30,799
So we're just ordinary friends.

600
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,279
I really just
thought of you as a friend.

601
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,440
He said you never slept together?

602
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:39,759
Is that something a human will say?

603
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,719
Right.

604
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,079
I don't understand

605
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,160
since when things

606
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,799
start to be like this.

607
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,440
Now the judgment of

608
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,719
two people being in a relationship

609
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:56,039
is to see whether
they have slept together,

610
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,039
huh?

611
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,239
Now

612
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:00,680
the difference
between friends and lovers

613
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,880
is whether they have slept together?

614
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,279
Do you both think so,

615
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,319
huh?

616
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:15,880
(Sorry.)

617
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,440
(I spoke harshly today.)

618
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,880
(If you accept to be friends,)

619
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,960
(we can still meet each other
like we used to.)

620
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,880
Hey.

621
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,319
You come back.

622
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:25,559
Hello!

623
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,960
Who am I?

624
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,559
I'm Song's brother.

625
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,200
How dare you

626
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,400
still contact Song?

627
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,360
Do you still want to
take advantage of her?

628
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,759
Are you playing with

629
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,039
Song's feelings right now?

630
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,999
I do Taekwondo.

631
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,279
I have one last word to warn you.

632
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,519
Don't contact Song ever again,

633
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,440
or I'll hit you.

634
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,640
Donghao is so manly today.

635
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,719
Thank you.

636
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:59,840
Li Donghao!

637
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,519
You didn't even call him.

638
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,319
You bullied me too?

639
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,640
Even you lied to me.

640
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,279
Everyone can lie to me.

641
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,239
Don't.

642
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,360
Ah!

643
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,519
Let me tell you two something.

644
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,920
I got a message from
the responsible person.

645
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,440
He said,

646
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,440
the concept of a healing guesthouse

647
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,279
has passed.

648
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,440
And

649
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,039
they also praised Xia Song Studio.

650
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,400
Congratulations.

651
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,319
Right.

652
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,719
They said you're creative and savvy.

653
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,920
The design concept is unconventional.

654
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,079
Alright.

655
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,440
Let's not get too excited yet.

656
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:57,200
Here comes the real work.

657
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,440
After all, the project

658
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,719
is still just a concept.

659
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,799
So,

660
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,799
designers,

661
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,200
you have to work hard.

662
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,079
(You could do so much better.)

663
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,200
(Why do you settle for the status quo?)

664
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:23,080
(Xia Song Studio)

665
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,360
What was the name

666
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,039
of that Chinese designer
you were telling me about?

667
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:33,880
Search for his works for me.

668
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:42,920
(Search history: Guan Xin)

669
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,920
Why are you searching for
my boyfriend secretly?

670
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,039
Me?

671
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:55,719
I didn't search for him secretly,

672
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,400
but fair and square.

673
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,960
Shouldn't Party A
investigate on Party B?

674
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,120
Have you ever heard of
Background Investigation?

675
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,079
I should check your boyfriend too.

676
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,640
Background Investigation?

677
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,719
Don't try to fool me.

678
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:06,559
Such a reason

679
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,039
is even worse than
getting a hair transplant.

680
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:14,440
Hello.

681
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,079
Honey.

00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:16,680
(Sorry to keep you waiting yesterday.)

683
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,999
(I got tickets
for the 8 o'clock movie tonight.)

684
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,559
8 o'clock.

685
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,759
Okay.

686
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,400
I might need
only 20 minutes to get there.

687
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:24,479
Okay.

688
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:26,680
Bye.

689
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,360
I won't blame you

690
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,239
on your secret investigation,

691
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,759
but I won't work overtime today.

692
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,999
I never asked you to work overtime.

693
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,680
As long as you meet
today's performance targets,

694
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,759
you can leave any time.

695
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,120
Okay.

696
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,279
These are all reference materials

697
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,640
mentioned in my presentation.

698
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,799
I have made a summary.

699
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,400
Feel free to ask me
if you don't understand anything.

700
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,719
Wait.

701
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:08,039
These two styles are so different.

702
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,559
You don't even mark the differences.

703
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,680
Also,

704
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
I remember this work
was suspected of plagiarism.

705
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,680
You included it in your reference.

706
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,519
What were you thinking?

707
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,360
Redo it.

708
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,160

Thank you.

Get off work.

732
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,640
Xia Tian, there is no time.

733
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:24,120
It is rush hour now.

734
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,640
It's okay.

735
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,279
I'll pass by.

736
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:25,920
I can give her a ride.

737
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,680
What?

738
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,559
I have an appointment
at a salon next to the cinema

739
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,600
in advance.

740
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,719
Huh!

741
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,640
Do you know which cinema it is?

742
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,039
You could just tell me.

743
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:39,840
You'll be too late if we don't hurry up.

744
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:46,479
Just go.

745
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,319
Oops.

746
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,479
(15 minutes to go.)

747
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,239
(I'll see you soon.)

748
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,600
What are you looking at?

749
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,160
Drive.

750
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:44,880
Xia Tian.

751
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,239
Xu Zehao?

752
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,360
What a coincidence.

753
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,160
Right.

754
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,640
Good to see you again.

755
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,360
Oh.

756
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,039
I just accompanied Xia Tian here.

757
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:16,880
Didn't you see her?

758
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,160
You don't need to
accompany Xia Tian anymore.

759
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,680
Your behavior has gone beyond
Party A and Party B.

760
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,120
Speaking of it,

761
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,640
looks like you're being nice
to your Party B too,

762
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,039
like your patient.

763
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,360
What do you mean?

764
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
I saw you cuddling with your patient.

765
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:43,840
Were you following me?

766
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,400
You're not that attractive.

767
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:46,999
I just happened to see you.

768
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
But,

769
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,960
I suggest you

770
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,200
clean up this mess

771
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,559
before Xia Tian finds out about it.

772
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:54,759
What do you think?

773
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,440
What's that got to do with you?

774
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
What do you mean?

775
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,799
Nothing.

776
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,120
I...

777
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,600
I want you to break up.

778
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,120
You like Xia Tian, right?

779
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,559
Only you're allowed to cheat.

780
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
I'm not allowed to like her, huh?
