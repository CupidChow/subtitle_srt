I didn't think about

if I should take the initiative or not.

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,600
I thought since I liked him,

I should have the courage

to tell him my feelings.

It's okay.

29

I got a picture anyway.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,879
She is a person

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,760
who loves to take the initiative.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,999
And easy-going.

Not coy at all.

A really lovely girl.

35
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,719
I was attracted to her because of that.

36

You look quite handsome from this angle.

37

You too.

I was very compatible with her

both mentally and physically.

Hello.

We want a single...

Yes.

Can you please show me

Okay.

No way.

58
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,879
I know this is an important day.

59
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,480
I especially changed into
a new jacket before I went out.

60
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,999
And...

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,279
New trousers.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,080
There were some episodes in between.

63
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,879
But...

64
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,279
What matters is the result.

65
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,999
Ever since I broke up with her,

66
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,599
I think I became

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,080
incapable of love.

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,760
In another word,

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,240
I just can't

70
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,559
make do with other girls anymore.

71
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,279
I was always more initiative
after we got together.

72
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,679
And I gave more than I received.

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,999
Sometimes I felt like

74
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:07,119
he didn't put his heart into it at all.

75
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,360
Now when I think about it.

76
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,719
I don't know why we broke up back then.

77
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,040
How could he not know?

78
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,879
I dumped him.

79
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,879
A meeting?

80
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,960
I don't think that's necessary.

81
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,919
Why not?

82
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,279
I think it's good to meet each other.

83

And,

84
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,520
I can still be friends with her.

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,000
Do I need more friends?

86
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,839
Why do I have to be friends with an ex?

87
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,599
I want to know

88

how life is treating her now.

89

Is she married?

90

does she have a boyfriend?

92

that you've worked hard.

175
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,999
But,

176
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,599
the details are indeed problematic.

177
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,800
What was the agreement

178
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,719
we had back then?

179
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,680
It should be

180
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,200
both low-key and high-key.

181
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,400
Simple

182
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
but lavish.

183
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:47,680
Concise

184
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,200
but with a touch of extravagance.

185
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,719
Eastern and western styles mixed.

186
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:55,519
Quaint and modern. Right?

187
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,280
Yes.

188
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,359
But look.

189
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,160
I don't see that in this.

190
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:03,999
Xia.

191
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,200
Looks like

192
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,519
we all need to work harder.

193
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,999
How can we

194
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,800
make this wine cabinet

195
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,879
look both quaint and modern?

196
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,440
Tell me.

197
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,560
What do you think we should do?

198
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,080
Use this.

199
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,879
Flowing stream?

200
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,320
A dragon.

201
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,719
Doesn't it resemble a dragon?

202
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:37,759
It does.

203
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,759
Right?

204
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,080
A dragon.

205
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,920
Do you know why we should use dragon?

206
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,239
Because dragon

207
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,239
is the symbol of
traditional Chinese culture.

208
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,800
It indicates something deeper.

209
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,400
A cultural heritage.

210
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,639
How is it?

211
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,560
Isn't that

212
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,080
what quaintness is?

213
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,639
Right?

214
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,440
Come here.

215
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,680
Now you tell me.

216
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,639
How can we make it look modern?

217
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,479
A color?

218
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:11,800
That's right.

219
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,200
Yeah.

220
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,999
What color to be specific?

221
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:16,999
Chinese red?

222
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,999
No, no, no.

223
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,359
Gold.

224
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,599
What?

225
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,920
Gold.

226
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,320
Gold...

227
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,320
Gold dragon?

228
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,280
Yeah.

229
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,680
You see?

230
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,999
After I point it out,

231
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,160
we got the core of this project.

232
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,119
(The client comes first)
Perfect.

233
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,200
That's enough.

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,359
That's enough.

235
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,400
Couldn't he just tell us up front
that he wants a dragon?

236
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,800
We made so many versions.

237
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,960
Remember.

238
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,080
Our motto is just one word.

239
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,104
(Endure)

240
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:58,479
God help us.

241
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,479
Please make sure
the second payment comes in.

242
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,400
Otherwise, I don't know how to pay

243
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,759
this month's rent.

244
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,359
It can't be like this anymore.

245
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,800
You mentioned a guesthouse project.

246
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,440
How did it go?

247
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,999
That was only 20 hours ago.

248
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,599
The results won't be out so quick.

249
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,839
Thankfully,

250
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,320
this emperor cabinet project

251
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,839
can help us hold on
to the end of this month.

252
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,479

(Do not tell Xia Tian about this.)

256
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,759
You're not a good photographer.

257
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,200
You look so much better
than in the picture.

258
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:43,839
Thank you.

259
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,960
My mom said you are also a surgeon.

260
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:48,960
I do plastic surgery.

261
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,560
Plastic surgery?

262
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:52,080
Well...

263
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,080
Do you have a fairly high standard

264
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,440
for your girlfriend's looks?

265
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,040
Do you like the kind of girls

266
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,519
that just look perfect?

267
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:02,160
No need to be perfect.

268
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,239
It's good if we get along.

269
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,519
My current girlfriend and I
are getting along quite well.

270
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,479
Oh.

271
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,119
Are you busy with work now?

272
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,519
Hello.

273
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,519
But you've recommended that
so many times.

274
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:37,999
Yeah.

275
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,119
I have to check it out when I get back.

276
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,080
I sincerely recommend it to you.

277
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,879
What do you like to do

278
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,999
when you are off work?

279
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,479
Sports.

280
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,759
I like working out.

281
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,359

That girl is really beautiful.

287

Take a look at me.

288
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,599
Is there anything I need to adjust?

289
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,560
I want to hear your advice.

290
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,359
You are already perfect.
No need for adjustment.

Really?

292

Yeah.

we should arrange a dinner

with both of our parents.

They all work in the same hospital.

They are all great friends.

I think we can do that.

arrange another dinner party.

What did I do?

316
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,759
You went on a blind date behind my back.

317

I always thought
we get along pretty well.

Didn't you say
you'd like me no matter what?

But why are you falling in love with

a doctor's daughter now?

Yeah.

Excuse me.

328

No shouting here.

329
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:34,920
Is that

330
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,119
your girlfriend?

331

The one you just mentioned?

She does get hot-headed, doesn't she?

333

I always considered myself lucky
for running into you.

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,359
Xia Tian.

345
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Hello?

346
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,079
(Where are you, Dr. Guan?)

347
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,920
(The doctor on duty is not here.)

348
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
(A patient is starting a fight
in the hospital.)

349
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,999
(Come over, quick.)

350
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,039
Okay, I'm on my way.

351
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,880
Hello?

352
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,920
Hello, bo...

353
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,640
Excuse me.

354
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,999
Can you please give the phone to Mr. Xu?

355
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:20,799
I need to talk to him.

356
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,319
I took the wrong phone.

357
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,680
He always gave me bad luck.

358
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,680
You finally realized
you took the wrong phone?

359
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,079
It's me, boss.

360
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,120
That lady told me to call this number.

361
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,279
What is it, Yu Hui?

362
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,279
It's the Guixin Guesthouse project.
Mr. An responded.

363
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,840
We'll take charge and
build a team by the end of this month.

364
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,640
Okay. Got it.

365
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,360
Oh, wait.

366
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,319
And that Ms. Xia told me to ask you

367
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,440
to give her phone back.

368
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,319
The address is...

369
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,680
Tell her if she wants her phone,

370
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,719
she should come get it by herself.

371
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,960
What did you do to my face?

372
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,880
It became like this now.

373
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,400
What should I do?

374
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
What if I get disfigured?

375
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,400
I'm hurting so bad.

376
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,840
Dr. Guan, you are back.

377
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,360
Take a look at me, doctor.

378
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,120
It really hurts.

379
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,920
Let me check the wound.

380
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,999
How is it, doctor?

381
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,680
Don't be afraid.

382
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,440
The wound is not too big.

383
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,279
Don't touch it.

384
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,319
Will there be a scar, doctor?

385
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:21,880
If there's a scar like this

386
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,559
on my face,

387
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,200
people will question my identity.

388
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,039
Don't worry. It won't.

389
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,160
I'll treat it for you.

390
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,640
Take her to the room.

391
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,200
Okay.

392
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,999
Is it really okay, doctor?

393
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:29,640
Yes, it is.

394
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:30,360
Fine.

395
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,120
Thank you, doctor.

396
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,600
This way, please.

397
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,039
The gift's here, Dr. Guan.

398
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,600
You haven't changed the password
after so many years?

399
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,719
Why did you two take so many photos?
You aren't pretty.

400
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
You'll get wrinkles
if you smile like that, okay?

401
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,319
(I'm sorry that I upset you.)

402
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,920
(Can you let me explain?)

403
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,640
Can't you find
a better guy than this one?

404
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
Going on a blind date behind your back.

405
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,920
(How is it?)

406
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,279
(Why are you still not back?)

407
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,039
Still not back?

408
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,440
Is she in trouble?

409
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,360
What's going on here?

410
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,880
Why did you drink so much?

411
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,400
It's my birthday tomorrow.

412
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,680
Come celebrate.

413
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,999
Your birthday?

414
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:21,880
Okay.

415
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,920
My treat then.

416
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,319
I thought you'd at best give me

417
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,920
70% off for my 30th birthday.

418
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:30,799
You are a true friend.

419
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,319
Cheers.

420
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,200
Hey.

421
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,719
Take it easy.

422
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,079
I'm thirty now.

423
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,680
Do you know what I'm doing?

424
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,759
I'm making some gold cabinet

425
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,120
with dragons carved on it.

426
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,880
I'm making these ugly stuff

427
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,319
every day in my life.

428
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,279
Do you know how disgusting it is?

429
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,120
Aren't you always like that?

430
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,479
No.

431
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:58,360
The last few years,

432
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,799
I thought it was just bad luck.

433
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,200
Then I met Guan Xin.

434
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,120
Let me introduce.

435
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,079
(One year ago)
Xia Tian.

436
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,039
Song.

437
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,519
The key figure here is Song.

438
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,400
She's a really nice person.

439
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,440
My good friend for years.

440
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,479
Hi.

441
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,239
This is Guan Xin.

442
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:15,759
In our hospital,

443
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,200
he's a ladies' man.

444
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:19,559
Handsome.

445
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,160
A great doctor.

446
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,479
Most importantly,

447
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:23,239
he's very gentle.

448
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,680
Not my cup of tea.

449
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:27,360
What?

450
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:28,799
Why?

451
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,279
He's too handsome.

452
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,519
Handsome guys

453
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,319
tend to play around.

454
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,239
I don't like that.

455
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,559
Don't you think so?

456
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,759
You can't tell that
just from their looks.

457
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,239
Right?

458
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,799
I think he's all right.

459
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,360
Xia Tian.

460
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,759
She's single too.

461
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,160
Leave her out of it.

462
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,559
We have agreed

463
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,319
to stop dating for a while, right?

464
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,680
Why are you doing this?

465
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm trying to help.

466
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,680
You are making me look bad.

467
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,680
Anyone wants to order anything else?

468
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,400
Whatever.

469
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,319
More beers for us, please.

470
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,319
With ice.

471
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:02,680
And...

472
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,279
And a lime.

473
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,160
Ice.

474
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:10,880
Do it yourself.

475
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,960
Let's celebrate.

476
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,519
Here. Pour it yourself.

477
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,519
I'm so occupied with work.

478
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,799
I haven't been out for ages.

479
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,640
Are you done drinking?

480
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,680
We can drink at the park nearby.

481
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:43,719
Okay.

482
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,479
Sure.

483
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,799
Who's going to buy more drinks?

484
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:46,680
- You.
- You.

485
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,279
Okay.

486
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,079
- I...
- I...

487
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,799
I think I had too many drinks.

488
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:28,600
You okay?

489
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,120
Just need some fresh air.

490
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,759
Song said you are done dating.

491
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,719
Is that true?

492
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:39,160
What about it?

493
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,999
I want to know what you think.

494
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:42,239
I...

495
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,600
Depends on the person.

496
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,479
Then what should he be like?

497
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,600
How about me?

498
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:28,440
I really wanted to marry him.

499
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,400
But he went on a blind date today.

500
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:33,999
Blind date?

501
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,360
He said

502
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,519
she's pretty

503
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
to my face.

504
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,039
He's a bit too greedy, isn't he?

505
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:45,279
He said she's a great person.

506
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,880
Why are you laughing at me?

507
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,920
Even you are laughing at me now.

508
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,120
No, no, no.

509
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,239
Don't cry.

510
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,920
I'm sorry.

511
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,719
How can he do that?

512
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,440
How can he keep praising people?

513
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:07,920
Who's he to laugh at me?

514
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,719
So arrogant, and conceited.

515
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,120
Supercilious.

516
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,400
He saw me as a joke today.

517
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,719
How could I embarrass myself
so much today in front of him?

518
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,600
Hello?

519
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:27,880
It's me.

520
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,559
Who are you?

521
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Xu Zehao.

522
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,160
Where are you now?

523
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,559
What do you want?

524
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,239
You don't want your phone?

525
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,319
Give back my phone right now.

526
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,279
Now.

527
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,120
Where are you? I'll bring it over.

528
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,920
She's at Youwu Pub.

529
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,079
(We're closing now.)

530
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,360
Hello?

531
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,319
Hello?

532
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:53,559
Goodbye.

533
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:14,984
(Youwu Pub)

534
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,640
What are you doing here?

535
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,920
You are so cute.

536
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,920
What are you doing here all alone?

537
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,519
You hit me?

538
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,880
Are you crazy?

539
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,840
Hit me one more time...

540
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,920
Hey!

541
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,479
Look.

542
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,319
This guy asked me to hit him.

543
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,360
Is he crazy?

544
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,319
Take it home.

545
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,880
Get it away from me.

546
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,680
You know I'm allergic to it.

547
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,400
Get away.

548
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
I have an allergy.

549
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,880
I can't. Take it home yourself.

550
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,319
Why are you so cold?

551
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,840
Why don't you take it home
if you are so good?

552
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,840
I don't have the money.

553
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,039
Why are you here?

554
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,479
And there's a dog.

555
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,239
I must be dreaming.

556
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:52,799
This is not a dream.

557
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,200
I never dreamt about you.

558
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:58,999
Even though I missed you a lot,

559
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:02,039
no matter how much
I wanted to dream about you,

560
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,559
you were never in it.

561
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,640
I knew this is a dream.

562
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,279
Xu Zehao would never talk like that.

563
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,680
What would I do?

564
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,920
I need to pee.

565
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,759
Shut up, Xu Zehao.

566
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,880
Drive faster.

567
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,319
I can't go faster.

568
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,079
There's a speed limit.

569
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,880
Pull over.

570
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:42,239
Stop.

571
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,279
Stop.

572
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,640
Can you act like a woman?

573
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,440
Stop it.

574
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,360
The bathroom.

575
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,559
Left.

576
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,999
That's the kitchen.

577
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,519
Stop staring.

578
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:20,920
This is my house.

579
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,999
Your phone.

580
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,200
It's dead.

581
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,239
Where is mine?

582
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,319
Give it to me.

583
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,840
Why do you give me a dead phone?

584
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,799
This is yours.

585
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,319
I want mine.

586
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,200
What's Song's phone number?

587
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:49,200
I'll ask her to come get you.

588
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,239
One.

589
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,440
Eight.

590
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,640
Eight.

591
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,239
Eight.

592
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,160
Eight.

593
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,999
Eight.

594
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,759
I don't remember.

595
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,440
I'll send you back.

596
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,999
I can do it myself.

597
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,799
Let's go home.

598
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,840
It peed.
