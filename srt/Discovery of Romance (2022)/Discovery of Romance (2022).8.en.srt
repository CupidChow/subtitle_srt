Go.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,640
Next time.

177
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,719
Next time.

178
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,039
Be careful on the way.

179
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Okay, alright.

180
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:31,919
Yu Hui.

181
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:32,440
Hey.

182
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,320
Come here.

183
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,760
The nice bottle of wine in my car,
give it to him.

184
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,279
Go!

185
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,799
Now.

186
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,479
Go.

187
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:39,320
Let's go!

188
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,919
Dice?

189
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:47,799
An adult gives others

190
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,200
something like this?

191
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,599
So childish.

192
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,440
Oh, my God.

193
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,359
Boss.

194
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,399
It's dangerous.

195
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,159
Well.

196
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,320
Let me call you a driver.

197
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,479
Aren't you supposed
to send out the wine?

198
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,279
Where is your wine?

199
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Come out!

200
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,159
Young bro.

201
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,839
Here.

202
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,080
Huh?

203
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,320
Young bro.

204
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,560
Over here.

205
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:24,960
Over here.

206
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,479
This.

207
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,039
What is this?

208
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,320
Weren't you born in 1993, a Dog Year?

209
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,440
1994.

210
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,799
Oh.

211
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,960
A rich Dog.

212
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,759
Wish you safe and rich.

213
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,800
Make sure you take good care of it.

214
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,719
It's for you.

215
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,479
This.

216
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,879
Okay.

217
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,719
Big bro.

218
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,680
Thank you for this.

219
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,560
A rich Dog.

220
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,719
I take it.

221
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,639
I must take it.

222
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:49,999
Come on.

223
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,280
Ay.

224
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,160
The...

225
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,239
The time is limited today.

226
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,359
Let's meet another time.

227
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:58,920
Promise.

228
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,879
Promise.

229
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:05,999
What are you doing?

230
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,599
Are you trying to break us up?

231
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,639
Ah?

232
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:12,759
Take care.

233
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,519
Take care.

234
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,479
Be careful on the way.

235
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,560
Take care.

236
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:16,839
Be careful on the way.

237
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:17,359
Take care.

238
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,040
I don't see any problem.

239
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,839
I mean, anyone could get drunk.

240
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,359
Right?

241
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,320
In fact, if Guan Xin

242
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:30,320
is not Xia Tian's boyfriend,

243
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,200
I think he and I

244
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,080
could be good friends.

245
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,599
But if you talk about competitiveness,

246
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:36,920
I don't think it's necessary.

247
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,359
How can he be any better than me?

248
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,920
Right?

249
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,280
As for my confession
to Xia Tian yesterday,

250
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,320
I think that's just

251
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,239
some drunken nonsense.

252
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,440
But,

253
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,719
she seemed
to have rejected my confession.

254
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:52,800
Xia Tian.

255
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,839
Please come back.

256
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,320
I...

257
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,719
I fall in love with you again.

258
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,639
Why is that embarrassing?

259
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,200
Right?

260
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,879
How could I possibly like a woman

261
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,400
I've already broken up with?

262
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,479
Besides,

263
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:13,479
there are so many girls who like me.

264
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,040
Even one garage
cannot accommodate them, okay?

265
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,320
Hey.

266
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,160
Look.

267
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,359
That is what I said.

268
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,920
The girls who like me

269
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,879
call me every day.

270
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,160
I don't know how to say no to them.

271
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,320
It's really annoying.

272
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:30,879
Hello, honey.

273
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,680
I miss you.

274
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,160
I miss you.

275
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,239
Of course.

276
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,160
You miss me too?

277
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:35,999
Ah.

278
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,879
You said to have dinner together?

279
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,800
And then watch a movie.

280
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:42,839
That's fine with me.

281
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,479
But I've been a little busy lately.

282
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,960
Because I just started a project,

283
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,080
I think

284
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,080
maybe some other time.

285
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,440
It's really annoying.

286
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,239
Well.

287
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:54,999
Yes.

288
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,519
Then we'll do it next time.

289
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:56,879
Okay?

290
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,080
Okay.

291
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,639
Bye, honey.

292
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:01,160
Ay.

293
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,920
Maybe that's

294
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,080
the trouble of being a handsome guy.

295
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,359
Two sets.

296
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,160
Okay.

297
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,239
I need you to bring me the contract

298
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,359
with Xia Song Studio today.

299
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,400
What are you going to do?

300
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,239
I want to know

301
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,479
how much we should pay

302
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:31,440
if we break the contract.

303
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,440
What did you say?

304
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:36,080
I said,

305
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,400
I want to know how much we should pay

306
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,200
if we break the contract.

307
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,879
Are you crazy?

308
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,400
It's not about the money.

309
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,160
You saw what they designed,

310
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,239
so cost-effective.

311
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,440
You take your money
and go out there to look around.

312
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,200
You won't find something like that.

313
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,639
And,

314
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,879
can we just stop talking

315
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,160
like a child, okay?

316
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,119
Oh.

317
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,920
Have you ever liked

318
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,960
a girl with a boyfriend?

319
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,839
Of course not.

320
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,519
Psycho.

321
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,239
But I know a guy

322
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,359
who likes a married woman.

323
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:11,160
Who is it?

324
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,320
The Great Gatsby.

325
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,519
A novel?

326
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,359
Yes.

327
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:19,440
Hey.

328
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,599
What is the ending of the novel?

329
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:22,599
He's dead.

330
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:23,320
Dead?

331
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,080
Is he crazy?

332
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,040
Ah?

333
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,239
Just a relationship.

334
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:28,359
Is it necessary to die?

335
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,080
He...

336
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,639
He is more than crazy.

337
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,040
He's a psycho.

338
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,160
You are right.

339
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:37,599
Boss.

340
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,719
Maybe you're still drunk.

341
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:41,759
I don't think
you should drink coffee either.

342
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,999
I'll order you a hangover cure, okay?

343
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:43,519
I'm sober now.

344
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,200
I just want this.

345
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,800
Alright.

346
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,280
Eat some vegetable if you are sober.

347
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,160
Well,

348
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,719
we have an appointment to check timber
at the mill this afternoon.

349
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,879
And Xia Tian will go too.

350
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:14,400
Xia Tian.

351
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,280
Morning.

352
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,639
Morning.

353
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,359
Where's your boss?

354
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,200
I'll go get busy.

355
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,639
Have a chat.

356
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,999
Morning, Mr. Xu.

357
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,400
Morning.

358
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,680
Mr. Xu, why are you here?

359
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,359
I...

360
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,879
I am thirsty.

361
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,080
I get a bottle of water.

362
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,879
Yu Hui didn't even prepare

363
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,359
any bottle of water for me.

364
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,960
Did you sleep well last night?

365
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,239
Quite good.

366
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:56,920
I...

367
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,759
What do you mean by that?

368
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,560
I thought we were all drunk yesterday.

369
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,119
So were you?

370
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,599
Huh.

371
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,639
I got totally drunk.

372
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,160
Good.

373
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,519
Good.

374
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,119
Let's go inside.

375
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,680
Let's go.

376
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:11,879
It's good.

377
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,920
Did you really get totally drunk?

378
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,320
What happened yesterday?

379
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,440
Nothing.

380
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,519
Nothing happened.

381
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,200
Well.

382
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,440
How much do you remember?

383
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,359
We went to dinner yesterday.

384
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,759
Everyone had a good time.

385
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,560
Did you say anything to me at the door?

386
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,999
What you said...

387
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,239
is...

388
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,680
I can't remember it.

389
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,960
Then forget it.

390
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,639
It doesn't matter at all.

391
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,239
What I said when I was drunk
doesn't matter.

392
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:44,119
Forget it.

393
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:49,639
Come here.

394
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,080
Mr. Xu.

395
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,200
If you're looking for old elm,

396
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,639
then you're here to

397
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,879
the right place.

398
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,200
Over the past two years,

399
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,119
I've saved a whole bunch of them.

400
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:03,280
Money can't buy the most valuable thing.

401
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:04,400
It means,

402
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,639
we are meant to meet.

403
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,280
Right?

404
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,519
You can rest assured

405
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,839
in doing business with us.

406
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,080
Mr. Zhang,

407
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,239
are these your elm?

408
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:14,519
Yes.

409
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,200
I have more over there.

410
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:17,080
Look at these.

411
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,239
There aren't many straight ones.

412
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,400
And they have some smell.

413
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,519
Are they fake fumigated wood
that were just ground up?

414
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,599
Hey.

415
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,759
This lady,

416
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,800
you don't know that.

417
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,999
Wood

418
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:31,280
has some smell

419
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,440
more or less.

420
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:35,160
Do you know agarwood?

421
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,359
Its feature is its smell.

422
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,479
Mr. Zhang,

423
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,440
it is true
that the wood up there are elm.

424
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,839
But I wonder if it's mixed with
old fumigated wood.

425
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,320
How is that possible?

426
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,839
Look.

427
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,320
Oh.

428
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,160
It could be the light,

429
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,759
so they might look a little wrong.

430
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,920
These are all authentic

431
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,080
hundred-year-old elm,

432
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,440
older than my grandma.

433
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Mr. Zhang,

434
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,519
whether they are hundred-year-old elm,

435
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,759
you should know better than we do.

436
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,960
Of course.

437
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,040
Oh, well.

438
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,560
Mr. Xu, of course you're an expert too.

439
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,280
Mr. Zhang,

440
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,759
even if your elm is 300 years old,

441
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,119
when it was freshly cut,

442
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,359
it's still a mama's boy.

443
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,320
The texture of natural air drying

444
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,719
cannot be the same

445
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:22,800
as the texture of fumigation.

446
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,639
Well,

447
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,680
this lady,

448
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,200
it doesn't matter if you don't know,

449
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,599
but you cannot say anything like that.

450
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:36,479
Our mill's philosophy is:

451
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:39,400
do fair business,

452
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
be cautious to flaws,

453
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,519
be kind to others,

454
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,400
and sell nice products.

455
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,160
So are you just fooling us?

456
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,320
Ay.

457
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,359
Mr. Xu,

458
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:51,040
how can you say so?

459
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,960
I don't dare to.

460
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,759
Actually,

461
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,759
speaking of it,

462
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,080
some kinds of wood

463
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,519
all work the same.

464
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,160
Everything has some flaws.

465
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,360
You came here just with one call.

466
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,880
To be honest,

467
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,719
I...

468
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:09,200
I don't really
prepare all the materials yet.

469
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,360
Mr. Xu, well,

470
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,440
just give me a few more days.

471
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,160
Just a few more days.

472
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,279
I'll make sure you get a nice batch.

473
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,079
Mr. Zhang,

474
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,640
how can we work with you

475
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,200
if you do business like this?

476
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:18,799
Right.

477
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,680
You're just some talker,

478
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,719
full of empty talk.

479
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,840
So much for this collaboration.

480
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,519
Oh no.

481
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,039
Mr. Xu.

482
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:26,279
Hey.

483
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,039
We can talk about it.

484
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,640
Hey.

485
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,640
Please talk to Mr. Xu for me.

486
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,239
Okay.

487
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,880
This mill must have been doing business
in a dishonest way for a long time,

488
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,799
so they're trying
to fool us with the fake wood.

489
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:38,960
Hey, boss.

490
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,360
This time you point out their problem.

491
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,680
I'm sure they won't play false again.

492
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,960
We can stop working with them
in the future.

493
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,039
If we don't work with them,

494
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,440
it would be troublesome for us.

495
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,640
We checked for the first time today
and they lied to us.

496
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,920
I think it would be difficult
if we go on working with them.

497
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,999
Even if they change it today,

498
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,440
there might be
other problems in the future.

499
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,960
We don't have time

500
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,319
to sit around with them
and check the problems.

501
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:01,960
Exactly.

502
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:03,840
Without trust,

503
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,239
there is no possibility of cooperation.

504
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,120
And didn't you just notice?

505
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,799
His mill is full of young workers.

506
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,160
There are no old workers left
in an old mill.

507
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,079
That is a big problem itself.

508
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,799
It's true.

509
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:17,360
Wow.

510
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,479
You are very observant.

511
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:20,039
That's not something
that people can often see.

512
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,079
You don't have to flatter me like that.

513
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,759
As a constructor,

514
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,079
if I can't see that,

515
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,039
what's the point?

516
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,120
I'll send you back, Xia Tian.

517
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,160
Oh, Yu Hui.

518
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
You have some other things to do, right?

You can.

What is it?

522
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,319
You have.

523
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,600
Oh.

524
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,799
I do!

525
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,360
I have things to do.

526
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,719
Right, I forgot it.

527
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:48,440
Get in the car.

Song.

534
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
She is not in a good mood.

535
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,880
I'm taking her to the disco tonight

536
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,319
to relax.

537
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:13,479
Don't drink.

538

You have an operation tomorrow.

539
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,120
Do you still keep in touch

540
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,600
with that girl?

541
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:24,279
What's wrong?

542
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,999
Nothing.

543
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,079
Just a casual question.

544
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,079
I am afraid it would be a bad idea

545
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,279
if Xia Tian finds out.

546
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,600
I've been working with you
for a long time.

547
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,600
You still don't trust me?

548
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,960
I trust you.

549
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
You are my buddy.

550
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,039
And you're my chosen brother-in-law.

I have to back you up!

Okay.

553
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,999
You can take that advantage.

554
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,440
Get some sleep tomorrow.

555
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,160
I can handle the surgery on my own.

605
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,920
This is too expensive.

I cannot take it.

You don't need to be burdened.

Just take it.

You gave me such an expensive gift.

Maybe I should get you
afternoon tea for a month.

619

Well.

to go to your studio together,

I don't know how to get there.

643

Haven't you been there?

644
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,039
I forgot it.

645

Then thank you, Mr. Xu.

646

I'll take a taxi.

Hold on.

648
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,759
You brought your boyfriend
over there last night

649
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,120
just to piss me off, right?

650
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,360
So you didn't get drunk.

651

I...

652
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,160
I didn't get drunk yesterday either.

I remember all of it.

654
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,440
You start

655
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,680
faking amnesia again, don't you?

656
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,960
You told me last night

657
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,440
that you fall in love with me again,

658
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,400

659

and a lot more.

660

I'm so glad.

661

Hey.

664

How can you talk like that?

665
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,840
Don't you want
to take care of my feelings?

666
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,479
Why do I?

667
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,039
Does it have anything to do with me?

668
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,079
Shouldn't your own feelings

669
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,400
be at your disposal?

670
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,640
Well, you...

671
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,120
Why are you

672
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,600
so mean now?

673
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,559
Or what?

674
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,400
Am I supposed to play nice to you?

675
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,759
Or be kind to you?

676
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,719
I don't think it's necessary.

677
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,039
Compare with your feelings,

678
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:21,840
I care more

679
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,759
about my feelings
and the feelings of my loved ones.

680
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,440
Because there is someone
I need to care about

681

And he is

683

I kept it because of my big brother.

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,799
Every time, you just yell at him.

860
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,160
The thing between you and Guan Xin

861
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,400
is between you two.

862
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,400
(I have to figure it out
in the mind now.)

863
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,279
(What happened?)

864
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:54,920
(Guan Xin had a date
with that girl alone)

865
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,960
(to eat skewered food today.)

866
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,519
(But in the middle of the night,)

867
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,600
(how did he end up with
sending Xia Tian home?)

868
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,519
(What exactly did he do in between?)

869
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,319
(How much does Xia Tian know?)

870
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,759
(Oh, my God.)

871
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,479
(I cannot call Guan Xin now.)

872
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,599
Oh.

873
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,320
I got it.

874
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,679
You want to ask me about

875
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,240
that girl with Guan Xin, right?

876
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,720
Her name is Lu Xi.

877
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,400
I know.

878
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,599
You know it?

879
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,079
Then why are you asking me about it?

880
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:33,479
Oh.

881
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,599
I think she works at a coffee shop.

882
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,720
I know it too.

883
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,960
Why do you ask me
if you know everything?

884
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,159
I just got to know her too.

885
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,119
Tell me something I don't know.

886
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,320
Something you don't know?

887
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,800
She works part-time occasionally,

888
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:47,880
and knows how to do manicure.

889
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,400
Get to the point.

890
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:50,920
What's the point?

891
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,400
What is her relationship with Guan Xin?

892
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,519
Just doctor to patient.

893
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,960
You know your Guan Xin.

894
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,479
He's such a nice guy,

895
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,440
and he'll help if he's asked to.

896
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,559
The girl treated him to skewered...

897
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:04,679
Li Donghao!

898
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,519
You know

899
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:08,639
what Guan Xin was doing tonight, right?

900
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,280
Ay.

901
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,760
Xia Tian, I've been
a little weak recently.

902
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:12,880
The hospital is too crowded.

903
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,079
Ay.

904
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,559
I just forgot it.

905
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,519
Yeah.

906
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,519
That girl is grateful,

907
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,599
so she just treated him to dinner.

908
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,559
That's it.

909
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:19,479
No date.

910
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,280
Certainly,

911
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,240
you know everything.

912
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,679
Why are you
keeping your mouth shut for Guan Xin?

913
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,159
Huh?

914
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,800
I've never seen you care so much
about anything.

915
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,559
You're sharing a room with us
for nothing.

916
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,999
Thirty years of friendship goes in vain.

917
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,360
I really think
there's nothing wrong with that.

918
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,479
He bought her a gift!

919
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,400
What?

920
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,920
I really don't know that.

921
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:39,999
Ask Guan Xin if you don't believe me.

922
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:44,760
Okay.

923
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
That's all for today.

924
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,519
But this conversation today...

925
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:51,960
Okay.

926
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:53,999
I'm your informer from now on.

927
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:54,679
If any situation happens,

928
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,920
I'll report to you immediately.

929
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:56,679
Xia Tian.

930
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,440
Don't think too much about it.

931
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,960
Guan Xin would never cheat on you.

932
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,039
And that energetic girl

933
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,519
is not his type.

934
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,159
I know him about it.

935
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,720
From now on,

936
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,039
you clean all the bowls back there.

937
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:09,800
Why?

938
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:10,760
Traitor!

939
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,320
I'll do it.

940
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,400
I haven't finished yet.

941
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,360
Oh, my God.

942
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,720
What's this?

943
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,840
I knew this man would cheat,

944
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,039
with a beautiful and gentle

945
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,760
girlfriend waiting at home.

946
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,760
He has a love affair stealthily
with that hot girl next door.

947
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,119
Look.

948
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:46,360
Wow.

949
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:46,960
So disgusting.

950
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,639
I wonder if men are all like this.

951
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,880
They want a change sometimes,

952
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,039
like someone who doesn't eat spicy food

953
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:53,159
wants to try
the flavor of skewered food.

954
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,360
Maybe.

955
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,599
Like me,

956
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,479
if there's a new flavor of potato chips
coming up,

957
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,280
I want to try its flavor.

958
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,679
Here.

959
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,440
Spanish ham,

960
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,079
have you tried it before?

961
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,559
New flavor.

962
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:07,999
What happened?

963
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,079
As I told you last time,

964
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,479
there are a lot of Emojis
in Guan Xin's phone recently.

965
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,639
I haven't even seen them.

966
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,280
And he went to eat skewered food.

967
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,039
What's wrong?

968
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,999
Don't you think that's a problem?

969
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,760
This sounds like

970
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,280
there is a problem.

971
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,159
But your evidence

972
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,199
doesn't even stand up to scrutiny.

973
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,479
I don't have any evidence.

974
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:34,559
Guan Xin said
it was just one of his patients.

975
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,320
A patient?

976
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,039
Have you ever thought about

977
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,880
what kind of patient it is

978
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,999
that would make you feel at risk?

979
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,519
With a cute WeChat avatar.

980
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,159
Okay.

981
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,039
I think it's a young girl.

982
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,840
She sent many Emojis to Guan Xin.

983
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,639
It means
she must have a crush on Guan Xin.

984
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:53,360
But that's not the point.

985
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,079
The point is
that Guan Xin takes good care of her.

986
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
He bought her

987
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,880
a set of very expensive
recording equipment last time,

988
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,400
which costs three to four thousand yuan.

989
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,479
No way!

990
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,039
Yes.

991
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:03,240
Dr. Guan is so generous

992
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,320
with a patient.

993
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,479
There's definitely something fishy.

994
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,159
They are suspicious.

995
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,479
Guan Xin is being nice to everyone.

996
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:10,240
This is normal.

997
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,639
But...

998
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,519
There are many young girls

999
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:13,320
who are financially disadvantaged.

1000
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,760
But he can't do that to everyone.

1001
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,880
When you put it like that,

1002
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,320
young girl,

1003

lovely Emojis...

1005
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,999
She might be born after 2000.

1006
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:25,599
Wow.

1007
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,119
Hey.

1008
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,639
Then she should call you sister.

1009
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,920
You're ten years older than her.

1010
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,679
Who cares about

1011
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,720
the age?

1012
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,400
Don't you care?

1013
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:35,840
Look at you.

1014
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,800
You complain about Guan Xin,

1015
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,079
and you defend him too.

1016
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,440
What do you mean?

1017
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,639
Even if I'm ten years older than her,

1018
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,920
it means I'm 10% better than her.
