Not to mention getting a girlfriend.

169

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,719
Look at her.

176
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:49,520
She looks a lot younger than us.

177
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,399
Maybe we should all go to

178
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,719
Guan's hospital for a beauty treatment.

179
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:53,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

180
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,960
I'm in.

181
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,560
I'm in.

You want to go too?

183
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:56,760
I'll take my wife.

184
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,799
Oh no.

185
00:07:58,799 --> 00:07:59,680
Even though Guan Xin

186
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,279
is a nationally famous plastic surgeon,

187
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,760
I don't really like to
do the beauty treatment.

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,640
Pure natural.

189
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,520
Oops.

190
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,320
Look how sweet he is.

191
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:10,880
Here.

192
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880

Thank you.

Thank you.

202

Here, Tong Mei, I'll give you a toast.

203
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,239
Come on, everybody, listen to me.

204
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,440
Is the watermelon sweet?

205
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,839
Sweet.

206
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,119
Sorry.

207
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,960
I didn't tell you in advance today.

208
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,359
Right.

209
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,280
I didn't even get a present.

210
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,119
After all, it's my first time
seeing your parents.

211
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,160
I am so embarrassed
by receiving so many presents

212
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:58,400
from them.

213
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,359
They like you.

214
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,560
How could they not?

215
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,400
I envy them.

216
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,200
At this age,

217
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,400
they are still so energetic.

218
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:13,560
I want to be like them when I'm old.

219
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:15,359
Get a bunch of people together,

220
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,280
singing and dancing.

221
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,560
We're done with them for the day.

222
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,519
Let's have a date tonight.

223
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,639
How?

224
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,639

you might find it a little weird

228
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,119
if I propose to you now.

229
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,160
But I don't want to make a splash.

230
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,160
Because I think

231
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,800
we could do it in a low profile.

232
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:03,800
Didn't you say you envy my parents?

233

00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
by our heroine,

347
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,040
the birthday girl herself.

348
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,359
We're just here to help.

349
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,519
So we need to know our place

350
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,999
in front of the guests
who are here today.

351
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,359
Alright.

352
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,440
Now comes the biggest part of the day.

353
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:49,960
Welcome

354
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,680
our brightest heroine.

355
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:29,200
You're all here.

356
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,320
How is it?

357
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,680
Am I

358
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,040
beautiful today?

359
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,239
Ah-choo!

360
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,599
Ah.

361
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,239
Song, don't get cold.

362
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,359
And you don't get cold either.

363
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:49,639
I'll go inside and get her the coat.

364
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,239
Looks like

365
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,320
we'll have a show here.

366
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,359
Cheers.

367
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,680
Let's celebrate our perfect

368
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,960
Song's birthday.

369
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,639
Happy birthday, Song.

370
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,400
Thank you all.

371
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:03,999
Happy birthday.

372
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,999
Happy birthday.

373
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,040
Sit.

374
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,080
Xia Tian, is this...?

375
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,400
She got engaged to Guan Xin.

376
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,719
You can tell Xu Zehao

377
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,040
about it.

378
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:22,719
Song.

379
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,879
Happy birthday.

380
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:24,719
Thank you.

381
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,680
Hello.

382
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,080
Go away!

383
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,800
Song.

384
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,200
Um.

385
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,800
Okay.

386
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:30,680
Thank you for coming here.

387
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,440
Guan Xin's mom is here
and I have to go meet her.

388
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,599
Just go.

389
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,680
This

390
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,280
is the gift I picked with Guan Xin.

391
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,800
You're going to love it.

392
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,599
Thank you.

393
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,560
You three

394
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,280
take good care of her.

395
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,599
Just go!

396
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,719
Song.

397
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:04,719
Have a try.

398
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:05,960
Okay.

399
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,039
This is the...

400
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,200
Matcha Mousse.

401
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,559
The one I like best.

402
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,120
I ordered it for you 10 days in advance.

403
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,360
Thank you.

404
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:21,719
Hey.

405
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:22,840
Xu.

406
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,200
Such a little piece.

407
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,400
It's not even enough for me.

408
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,600
Next time, buy a bigger one.

409
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,880
Song.

410
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,400
Um?

411
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,519
This is my happiness tree for you.

412
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,519
It's easy to keep.

413
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,360
Look, there are many
copper coins hanging on it.

414
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,400
It means fortune,

415
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,960
happiness,

416
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,719
and beauty.

417
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,559
This is

418
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,719
a pine tree?

419
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,799
Of course.

420
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,640
A pine tree for Song,
[*Pine tree sounds like Song in Chinese.]

421
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
of course.

422
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:43,999
Mr. Yu.

423
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:45,600
Are you celebrating someone's birthday?

424
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,840
It's like
for the opening of a bathhouse.

425
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,160
What are you doing?

426
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
What are you doing?

427
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,920
Then what's your gift for me?

428
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,999
I have to use the bathroom.

429
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:53,880
On the second floor.

430
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,479
The birth...

431
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,400
Hey.

432
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,479
That guy...

433
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,160
Hey.

434
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,759
Wait.

435
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,559
The toilet
on the second floor is broken.

436
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,039
It's under repair.

437
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,840
Go to the one on the first floor.

438
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,239
Didn't I just come from the first floor?

439
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,719
Then check the basement floor.

440
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,519
There is one on the basement floor.

441
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,640
Basement floor.

442
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,559
There is a toilet on the basement floor?

443
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,039
Yes.

444
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,880
Yeah.

445
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,479
Go.

446
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,719
Didn't I tell you...?

447
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,400
Song.

448
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,960
Li Donghao.

449
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,319
What are you doing upstairs by yourself?

450
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,559
Song.

451
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,200
Didn't you ask
what gift I will give you?

452
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,239
I'm telling you.

453
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,440
The gift I'm going to give you

454
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,440
is particularly special.

455
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,479
That cake is delicious,

456
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:31,319
but it will make you fat.

457
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,400
And the pine tree.

458
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,960
Come on.

459
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,759
It's a new era now.

460
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:34,440
A pine tree?

461
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,960
And you have to water it.

462
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,920
What a waste of resources.

463
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,799
My gift

464
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,360
will keep you from worries.

465
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,239
Here.

466
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:39,999
Come.

467
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,680
Let me show you.

468
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,160
Why are you covering my eyes?

469
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm telling you.

470
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm sure you'll be
thanking me for this forever.

471
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,960
Are you going to get me some diamond,

472
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,920
or gold?

473
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,360
Are you ready?

474
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,200
3.

475
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:53,999
2.

476
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,799
1.

477
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,840
Ta-da!

478
00:18:57,608 --> 00:18:58,640
(For Song)

479
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,120
How is it?

480
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,719
Even if you don't flush after you poop,

481
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,120
the intelligent closestool
will flush it for you.

482
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,960
The moment you get up,

483
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:04,880
you'll only get just one word,

484
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:05,999
cool.

485
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,600
Especially for a woman like you
who's always constipated,

486
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,279
it's the most thoughtful
and practical gift of all.

487
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,880
Don't you think I know you so well?

488
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:14,999
Are you touched?

489
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:15,840
Li Donghao.

490
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,079
You really don't know
anything about women.

491
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,759
Piss off.

492
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,559
Did I pick the wrong color?

493
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm really pissed off.

494
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,200
If I only have an EQ of 59,

495
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,239
then Li Donghao's EQ

496
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,680
is negative for sure.

497
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,719
I really wonder

498
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:38,160
how he got into the medical college.

499
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
People who study well

500
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,039
can't even figure things out?

501
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,559
Intelligent closestool?

502
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,759
Auntie, why are you here?

503
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,279
I passed by,

504
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,360
and stopped by to see you.

505
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,239
I also brought you some care products.

506
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,079
Here.

507
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,479
Take a seat.

508
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,640
Thank you, Auntie.

509
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,440
I wanted to go to your house.

510
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,600
But it would be inappropriate

511
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,680
to visit all of a sudden.

512
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,840
So I decided to meet you here.

513
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Please don't blame me
for not telling you in advance.

514
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,559
Uh, no.

515
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,799
I should have visited you first.

516
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,719
I ordered you a cup of coffee

517
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,759
and a piece of cake.

518
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:39,719
Just have it.

519
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,360
Thank you, Auntie.

520
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,319
This is an old and expensive community.

521
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,200
The houses are not cheap here.

522
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,479
You bought the house you're living in,

523
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:52,360
or...?

524
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,799
My mom's.

525
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,360
But I pay the rent.

526
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,999
You pay rent to your mom?

527
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,440
That's interesting.

528
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,440
Some other day,

529
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,880
we can meet up.

530
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,519
I've heard so much about your mom.

531
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,239
I kind of like getting along with
educated people.

532
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,640
I heard

533
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,360
you have a studio

534
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,079
for your own business.

535
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,279
How's the business this year?

536
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,999
I just got a nicely paid
guesthouse project.

537
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:20,680
So...

538
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,200
I think it should be okay this year.

539
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,680
That's nice.

540
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,680
Women should have our own career.

541
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,519
But as long as

542
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,559
you can find the right balance
between career and family.

543
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,039
Hey, eat this.

544
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,759
Try the cake.

545
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:34,880
Okay.

546
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Do you make money management?

547
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,799
Do you have any fixed invested stocks?

548
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,319
I don't pay much attention to this area.

549
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:46,719
But,

550
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,519
I can learn about it in the future.

551
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:49,120
It's okay.

552
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,880
I can teach you that in the future.

553
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,920
Women should be more careful

554
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,360
about the family's finance.

555
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,400
Well,

556
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,319
as long as you're a girl
who Guan Xin likes,

557
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,039
I will like you too.

558
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:05,719
And I'm not a difficult person.

559
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,400
You'll find it out later.

560
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,519
(Premarital Examination for Women)
This is a premarital examination.

561
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,840
I've asked someone
to arrange it for you.

562
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,039
If you have time next week,

563
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,719
ask Guan Xin to go with you.

564
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,279
And then,

565
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,120
(Premarital Agreement)
this is a premarital agreement.

566
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,120
You and Guan Xin need to notarize

567
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,160
your premarital property.

568
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,640
Your income after marriage

569
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:33,600
will be your common property.

570
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,559
But you can rest assured.

571
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:36,840
We won't treat you wrong.

572
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,519
For the marriage of you and Guan Xin,

573
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,039
we'll buy the house in full payment.

574
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,120
On the house proprietary certificate,

575
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,719
your name will be included too.

576
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,719
Auntie.

577
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,719
Guan Xin and I
may not be in such a hurry.

578
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,440
This has to be done.

579
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,559
Don't think of me as being indifferent.

580
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,960
A marriage

581
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,960
is no small thing after all.

582
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,039
After considering all these things now,

583
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,999
in the future,

584
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,999
it would save a lot of trouble.

585
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,759
I didn't mean that.

586
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,360
Auntie.

587
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,920
I can understand your...

588
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,719
That's good.

589
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,840
You can leave the wedding to me.

590
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,200
My besties and I often get together

591
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
to talk about things about wedding.

592
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,880
We know what girls like.

593
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:22,200
In the future,

594
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,120
we can be good friends

595
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,719
who can talk about everything.

596
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:40,424
(Happy forever)

597
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:48,840
Song.

598
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,200
Ay.

599
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,440
What's with the long face?

600
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,360
It's your birthday.

601
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,479
You should smile.

602
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,279
It's alright.

603
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,519
Ay.

604
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,239
I've just met my bane.

605
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:03,360
Well...

606
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,279
Song.

607
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:06,759
Actually,

608
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,799
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

609
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:10,880
Ay.

610
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:11,999
What's wrong?

611
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,239
Today,

612
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,400
I want to

613
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,440
introduce myself seriously.

614
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,039
Take a seat.

615
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,440
I am

616
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,279
32 years old.

617
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,120
I have been single.

618
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:33,200
I don't really like to
have an ambiguous relationship

619
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,279
like those young people do.

620
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,319
I don't really like

621
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,799
the uncertain feelings either.

622
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,120
You and I,

623
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,559
no matter at work,

624
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,559
or in private,

625
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,719
have known each other a lot.

626
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,719
I don't know how to say it,

627
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:54,400
so I wrote a letter.

628
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,400
Please take a look.

629
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
After you read it,

630
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:57,319
well,

631
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,840
then you can consider whether

632
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,719
I am a suitable romantic partner,

633
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,440
or

634
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,039
a life partner.

635
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,319
Yu Hui.

636
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,079
Why are you bothering our birthday girl?

637
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,319
Here.

638
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,479
Eat more.

639
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:14,680
Song.

640
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,360
Don't you like
the color of the closestool?

641
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:17,200
I'm telling you.

642
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,360
I'll change it into a black one.

643
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,279
Look at you in all black.

644
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,319
You like black, right?

645
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,719
Here.

646
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,200
Take a seat.

647
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:22,680
Take a seat.

648
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,319
Sit tight.

649
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:24,079
Sit tight.

650
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,479
What?

651
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:24,920
Sit tight.

652
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,160
Let's swing for a while.

653
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,840
Does it have to be
in such a straightforward way?

654
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,400
I would never have chosen

655
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,479
this outdated way of confession.

656
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:37,880
It's too low.

657
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,519
Ah.

658
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,799
I'll kick your bottom.

659
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Here, you two, be careful.

660
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,799
Watch out.

661
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,440
Slow down.

662
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:43,719
Hey.

663
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,279
This one.

664
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:44,960
Be careful.

665
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
And slow down.

666
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:46,799
Hey.

667
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
Be careful.

668
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,479
Slow down.

669
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,279
Be careful.

670
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:51,680
Okay.

671
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:52,200
Okay.

672
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:52,880
Okay.

673
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,920
When will you come over?

674
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,360
- Give me that.
- Ah?

675
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,200
Mr. Xu.

676
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,640
The furnishings and furniture here

677
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,880
will soon be finished moving in.

678
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,200
This is the list.

679
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,079
Take a look.

680
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,799
If there's no problem,

681
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,640
please sign here.

682
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,200
Did you reserve the place

683
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,719
for the woodwork as I told you before?

684
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,680
Yes.

685
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:16,239
You can rest assured.

686
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:24,160
Thank you.

687
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,039
It's our pleasure.

688
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:25,519
Then I'm leaving.

689
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,519
Bye.

690
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,360
Hey.

691
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,479
Watch out for that one.

692
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,880
Boss.

693
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,799
I'm back.

694
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,960
Well,

695
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,600
do you know that?

696
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,200
What?

697
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,239
Guan Xin proposed to Xia Tian.

698
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:57,799
I...

699
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,600
I'll go get busy.

700
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,079
It's actually

701
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,519
a nice way to end it.

702
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,360
The project is over.

703
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,239
And Xia Tian

704
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,880
lives a happy life.

705
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,759
I hate to admit it,

706
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,600
but

707
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,799
Guan Xin does seem to

708
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
be more suitable for her than me.

709
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:44,559
I just hope that Xia Tian

710
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,920
can have a joyful

711
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,400
and happy life.

712
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,759
That's it.

713
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:04,840
I'm sorry.

714
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,319
Let's...

715
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,239
Let's call it a day.

716
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,200
Sis.

717
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,079
Long time no see.

718
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:14,600
Wow.

719
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,559
You still look so good.

720
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:16,160
Haha!

721
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,960
You are late.

722
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:18,440
I don't have much time.

723
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,600
Hurry up.

724
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:19,920
Well,

725
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,400
sis, you know I am a man
of science and technology.

726
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,600
I can do things like calculus

727
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,479
even with my eyes closed.

728
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,960
But I am illiterate

729
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:25,960
in words expression.

730
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,120
This is a special case.

731
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,200
Success or failure
hinges on this one action.

732
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,039
So can you help me

733
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,279
write a love letter

734
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,440
that would move the one who reads it

735
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,799
and make her marry me?

736
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,880
A love letter?

737
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:39,079
What's the style of that girl?

738
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,840
That girl

739
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,239
is kind of hard to describe.

740
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,960
She is not sensitive at all,

741
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,600
with low emotional intelligence

742
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,079
and a voracious appetite.

743
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,120
But,

744
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,519
she and I have the same selection
for late night snack.

745
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,680
But she speaks without thinking,

746
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,360
and hits me when she gets angry.

747
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:59,079
Her legs are a little short.

748
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:01,960
The boobs

749
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,920
are just fine.

750
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,960
But her look
is really not my type at all.

751
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,680
And on top of that,
I can't believe she has bad hygiene.

752
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,880
She won't flush the closestool
after using it.

753
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,400
She behaves disgracefully
after getting drunk.

754
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,680
She is totally in a mess.

755
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,719
What do you like

756
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,680
about a girl like this?

757
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,880
Right?

758
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,999
I might as well forget it.

759
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,200
I agree with you.

760
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:19,160
Why would I like a girl like Song?

761
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,479
It feels like I've been poisoned.

762
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:21,079
This feeling...

763
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,600
Stop.

764
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,519
I'll help you.

765
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:22,960
Tell me.

766
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
What style do you want?

767
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,759
I want a romantic one,

768
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,200
like the way of movie
and TV characters talking.

769
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,559
What can I do?

770
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,559
I just fell in love with her.

771
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:36,640
Just help me.

772
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:37,960
Something like that.

773
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:38,999
How much will you pay?

774
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,920
Five deluxe hydro lifting packages.

775
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,519
Ten.

776
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:49,319
Deal.

777
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,319
Please.

778
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,039
Just go.

779
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,519
Hey!

780
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,799
Surprise!

781
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,039
Have a look.

782
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,039
Is it for me?

783
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,120
I think so.

784
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:11,160
Wow.

785
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,279
It's a pair of new sneakers.

786
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,920
It's a beautiful color.

787
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:16,920
Do you like it?

788
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,999
And new clothes.

789
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,640
Thank you.

790
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,200
Granny.

791
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,960
I think it's more accurate
to call me auntie.

792
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,999
Thank you, Auntie.

793
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,120
Why did you buy me sneakers?

794
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,440
Well,

795
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,880
this pair of sneakers
is a free gift from an event.

796
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,519
They said only those
who play football can wear them.

797
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,079
I like this pair of sneakers.

798
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,920
But

799
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,039
I don't play football.

800
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,960
So I...

801
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,479
I thought of you.

802
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,239
Thank you, Auntie.

803
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,920
You're welcome.

804
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,079
I have new sneakers.

805
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,120
Wow.

806
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,799
These sneakers are so nice.

807
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:52,640
Cool!

808
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,799
Awesome.

809
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,479
Are you ready
to take over the whole mess?

810
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,640
We shall see.

811
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,160
So how do you think about us?

812
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,319
I've thought about it
120 times seriously.

813
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:07,680
Ah.

814
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,840
The results are not very satisfying.

815
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,239
So I think

816
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:10,640
you might as well forget it.

817
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:11,999
120 times?

818
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,840
You thought about it from day to night.

819
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,960
You're so focused on me.

820
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,079
Relax.

821
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,680
Take your time.

822
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,239
We are far from being old anyway.

823
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,039
Huh!

824
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,519
50 years old
is still far from being old?

825
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,640
If people can live till 100 years old,

826
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,279
we still have 50 years

827
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,079
to talk of everything,

828
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,840
to travel around,

829
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,479
and to eat and drink.

830
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:28,079
Right?

831
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:28,680
Ay.

832
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:32,840
Hey.

833
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:33,880
Let's have lunch together.

834
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:36,440
Here.

835
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,319
It's stuffed with mackerel.

836
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,640
Don't be such a vegetarian.

837
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:44,400
It's not that hard for old friends

838
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,360
to build a family.

839
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,079
In the past,

840
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,400
we met

841
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,239
once a week.

842
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:51,479
In the future,

843
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:52,759
we'll meet 7 times a day.

844
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,999
Right?

845
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:55,239
Hey.

846
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,719
It's like two kinds of
stuffing dumplings.

847
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:58,519
It would be nice to mix up.

848
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,759
Can you be quiet for a minute?

849
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:01,719
Ah.

00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,079
Why is your phone powered off?

860
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,600
I...

861
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,319
I have been busy lately.

862
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,279
Did you have your supper?

863
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,880
I'm going to make my supper.

864
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:41,039
Put down these things.

865
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,279
I'll take you to have dinner nearby.

866
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,239
Let me help you.

867
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,160
Don't bother.

868
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,039
I can handle it.

869
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:07,600
What is it?

870
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,840
You don't look well.

871
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,880
Are you sick?

872
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:12,840
Ah.

873
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:14,079
I just caught a cold.

874
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,039
Why do you have that pity look

875
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,280
on your face?

876
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,479
Do I need to be pitied with a cold?

877
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:26,199
Don't do that.

878
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,880
No.

879
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,800
I'm not pitying you.

880
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm just caring for you.

881
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,519
Eat more.

882
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,119
Dr. Guan.

883
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,400
The other day,

884
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,479
you said at dinner

885
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,280
that if my brother shows up

886
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,599
and recognizes me,

887
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:54,760
he'd pretend he doesn't know me.

888
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,800
I haven't asked you

889
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,840
why he would do that.

890
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Maybe,

891
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,840
he doesn't want to lose what he has.

892
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,360
What does he have?

893
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,320
Right.

894
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,639
What does he have?

895
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,599
Maybe

896
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,360
in the eyes of others,

897
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,760
he comes from a decent family.

898
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,400
So he doesn't want others

899
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,840
to know he was adopted.

900
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,280
What's wrong with adoption?

901
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,159
I...

902
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,199
I know it.

903
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,119
He has his difficulties.

904
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:26,639
Maybe

905
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,079
his foster parents

906
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,639
don't want others to judge them.

907
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,639
He could have told me in secret.

908
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:34,920
I won't tell anyone.

909
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,519
Is it that hard?

910
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,079
Ah?

911
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,720
The last thing he wants to deal with

912
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,240
is his conscience.

913
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,440
He left you behind,

914
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,159
and got adopted himself.
