The ex-boyfriend

Just take me home.

Watch out for others.

39
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,480
You had a bad day at football.

40
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,159
You are not focused,

41
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,399
completely absent-minded.

42
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:31,360
Are you talking to me?

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,200
I think so.

44
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,119
The sneakers don't fit me anymore.

I cannot run as I wish.

Tell your grandma to buy you a new pair.

Lace up.

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,279
My grandma said,

49
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:50,960
the sneakers are too expensive.

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,320
How do you know about my grandma?

51
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,200
Do you two know each other?

Not really.

53
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,679
I saw her pick you up.

54
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,279
My grandma told me
not to talk to strangers.

55

I'm going to play football.

I'm so glad.

60
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,040
You came to see him,

61
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,399
which means

62
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,839
you don't hate him anymore.

63
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,040
What's that got to do with him?

64
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,279
This kid...

65
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:29,640
This kid is pathetic.

66
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,200
Actually,

67
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,360
Xia is quite pathetic too.

68
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,520
He's just got a strange temper.

69
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,439
All those years of working with him,

70
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,599
I can't say

71
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,480
I like him,

72
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,080
but I really don't think he is bad.

73
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,040
Are you done?

74
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:47,679
Yes.

75
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,599
Director.

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,159
Yes.

77
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,559
Can we talk for a second?

78
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,439
Sure.

79
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,080
Would you stop bothering me?

80
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,839
Stop following me around all day long.

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,480
You're invading my privacy.

82
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,040
Do you know that?

83
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,999
You and I know each other well.

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,320
What kind of privacy is there?

85
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,119
I know all about you.

86
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,119
Well...

87
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:09,719
I'll stay away from you a bit.

88
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,760
I think that's enough, right?

89
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,279
Go further away.

90
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,559
Hey.

91
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,200
Don't go.

92
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,559
Hey.

93
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,799
Hello.

94
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,120
Could you call
Dr. Guan Xin for me, please?

95
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,399
Okay.

96
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,239
Hold on.

97
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:22,719
Thank you.

98
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:23,359
You're welcome.

99
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,799
Lu Xi.

100
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:30,880
Dr. Guan.

101
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,080
I brought you afternoon tea,

102
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,159
your favorite Americano

103
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,799
and the cake I just made.

104
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,359
Lu Xi.

105
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,760
Thank you for the coffee and cake,
as well as your kindness.

106
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:43,799
But,

107
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,200
I don't really need it.

108
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,359
You know what we do here.

109
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,000
We are so busy every day.

110
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,279
Sometimes they have to be thrown away
if I cannot eat them.

111
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,719
So, don't give me these any more.

112
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,239
I want to thank you with these.

113
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,279
If it's not convenient,

114
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,680
then forget it.

115
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,640
Is there anything else?

116
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,239
(I was going to ask)

117
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,200
(if I could still send you
afternoon tea every day.)

118
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh.

119
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,960
I also want to ask

120
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,440
about treatment scheme for another kid.

121
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,839
When can I know about it?

122
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,039
Um.

123
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Let me take a look.

124
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,279
Next Wednesday.

125
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,440
Next Friday.

126
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,599
I'll be free these two days.

127
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:28,200
Oh.

128
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:29,839
Okay.

129
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,200
I will not bother you anyway.

130
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,839
Lu Xi.

131
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,760
Take

132
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,159
them back.

133
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,680
As long as it's about the surgery,

134
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,839
you can talk to me any time.

135
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,680
I'll help you in any way I can.

136
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:52,599
I see.

137
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,080
Dr. Guan.

138
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:15,720
(Yinshe Yard)

139
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,239
Why are you here today?

140
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:23,520
I miss you.

141
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,839
Oh?

142
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:30,880
Not me.

143
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,520
You miss your dad.

144
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,799
If you really miss him, go visit him.

145
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
You can go alone
if you don't want to go with me.

146
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,440
It's from a colleague.

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,120
Just drink it.

148
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,719
Oh.

149
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,399
What a surprise.

150
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,239
The new project is paid partly.

151
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll pay you partly too.

152
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,239
Save it for your marriage to Guan Xin.

153
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,960
Do you mean those I owed before...

154
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,880
No way.

155
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,880
You can pay me after getting married.

156
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,880
I knew it.

157
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,120
Are you really getting married?

158
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,799
I don't know yet.

159
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,399
A little hesitant.

160
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,560
I feel like both of us

161
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,239
haven't shown our true selves yet.

162
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,560
He seems to be hiding something from me.

163
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:48,359
But so do I.

164
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,039
Like what happened to my dad,

165
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,560
I never told him about it.

166
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,279
Or

167
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,520
he doesn't know

168
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:58,760
how the studio works.

169
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,880
If we do get married,

170
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,799
I think we should all be
a little more honest.

171
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:04,960
You

172
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,440
are too pride,

173
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:08,440
just like me.

174
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,919
You don't want to show your dark side.

175
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,399
It means,

176
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,359
you're not capable of
facing who you really are.

177
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,839
But that doesn't stop you
from trusting people.

178
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,680
Will the people who really love you

179
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,680
care any of these?

180
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,520
Do you care?

181
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:28,359
What?

182
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,760
Um.

183
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:30,799
Um.

184
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:31,919
Huh?

185
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,719
Nice coffee today.

186
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:50,519
I really got it wrong?

187
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,639
That's impossible.

188
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,320
How could I forget

189
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,839
Xia Tian's dad's death?

190
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Did you make this by yourself?

191
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:21,960
Yes.

192
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,040
It's made from cherry.

193
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,759
Do you know what cherry tree means?

194
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:27,920
I don't know.

195
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,800
What is it?

196
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,839
The one and only love.

197
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,320
The one and only me.

198
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,119
Help me wear it.

199
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,960
The gifts are still there.

200
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,639
Xu Zehao.

201
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Why are you back?

202
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,479
What time is it now?

203
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,839
It's 2:30 PM.

204
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:09,719
Oh.

205
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,160
I'm sorry. I forgot it.

206
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:16,280
Do I mean nothing to you?

207
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,119
No.

208
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,239
I told you so many times
today not to be late.

209
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,479
Why were you still late?

210
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:22,519
In that case, you shouldn't be late.

211
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:23,719
I waited for you
at the station with my friends

212
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,040
for two and a half hours today.

213
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,200
I called you and you didn't pick up.

214
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,719
Do you know

215
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:27,519
how

216
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,080
awkward I was?

217
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,879
In the end, they went by themselves

218
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,759
and I came back alone.

219
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,800
Do you take it for granted

220
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
that you can stand me up?

221
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,680
I didn't mean that.

222
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,960
Hey. No.

223
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,080
Please.

224
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,040
I've been waiting three months
for this camera.

225
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,759
I was late.

226
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,400
I was wrong.

227
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,719
I apologize to you, okay?

228
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:46,999
Don't.

229
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:47,400
Ah.

230
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,320
Give it to me.

231
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,680
Come on.

232
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,320
Alright.

233
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,239
Don't be mad.

234
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,680
Ah.

235
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,239
Don't be mad.

236
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,400
I promise

237
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,999
I will never be late again, okay?

238
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:02,879
You just don't have me in your mind.

239
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,800
Why would you want to be with me?

240
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:06,040
How can it be?

241
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
I'm with you only because I like you.

242
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,080
In your world,

243
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,519
I'm the least important one.

244
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,040
Work,

245
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,519
friends,

246
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,280
and even hobbies
are more important than me.

247
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,560
Hey.

248
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,080
Don't think so.

249
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,719
Let me make it up to you.

250
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,920
Let's go to have hot pot.

251
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,400
Cattle stomach.

252
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,800
Abnormally spicy.

253
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,479
Okay.

254
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,839
You just think I can be easily bullied.

255
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,999
That's why I like you.

256
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,160
There's no way I remember this wrong.

257
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,599
They're all there.

258
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,879
Or

259
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,680
did Xia Tian deliberately forget it?

260
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,280
Why didn't you tell me
about uncle's death?

261
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,999
I've told you.

262
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:18,639
You just forgot it.

263
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,359
No.

264
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,680
You've never told me about it.

265
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,800
At the meal yesterday,

266
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,719
I remember
both of those things you said,

267
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,560
the marshmallow and hot dog.

268
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,160
Although the details we remember
are a little different,

269
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,239
it's all in my mind.

270
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,119
Xia Tian.

271
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,960
I admit

272
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,759
I may have overlooked you

273
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,920
when we broke up five years ago.

274
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
That's because you became a part

275
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,280
of my habit.

276
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:50,960
I didn't have to worry about you,

277
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,400
read your mind,

278
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,400
or figure out what you think anymore.

279
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,960
Even when you got angry,

280
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,800
I would think it would pass.

281
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,680
Sorry.

282
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:03,119
I'm sorry for the way
I treated you at that time.

283
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,239
I remember all these things

284
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,040
I didn't do well.

285
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,759
But I really don't remember anything

286
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,160
about uncle's death.

287
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,320
Why?

288
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:16,639
Even as a friend,

289
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,519
I shouldn't have found it out until now.

290
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:18,920
Right?

291
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,280
Are you sure you remember everything?

292
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,200
Are you so sure of your memories?

293
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,800
I must have given you a call.

294
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,359
(Sorry! The subscriber you dialed)

295
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,440
(is not answered at the moment.
Please try later.)

296
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,080
(Sorry! The subscriber you dialed...)

297
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,639
(Xia Tian)
(Are you busy?)

298
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
(Why didn't you pick up the phone?)

299
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,960
(Pick up the phone, please.)

300
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:14,560
Hello!

301
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,519
(What's wrong?)

302
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,440
(Why did you call me so many times?)

303
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,920
I wonder if you could come.

304
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,519
(I'm working overtime.)

305
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,400
(What's wrong?)

306
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,200
Don't ask.

307
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,960
Just come.

308
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,280
(I really can't make it.)

309
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,719
(I'll talk to you when I'm done.)

310
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:30,040
(OK?)

311
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,719
Remember it now?

312
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,320
One call, two calls, three calls,

313
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,639
four calls, five calls, or six calls.

314
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,800
I've been trying
to reach you on the phone.

315
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,400
Did you ever ask me why?

316
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,999
Did you ever ask me why I needed you?

317
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:03,839
You didn't even ask,

318
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,999
just telling me you were working overtime,

319
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:05,400
you were busy,

320
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,359
and you had no time for me.

321
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,359
You wouldn't remember

322
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,040
even if I tell you which call it was.

323
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,519
But,

324
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,639
something so important
like uncle's death,

325
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,920
you should at least tell me clearly.

326
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,759
What's the point
of talking all about it now?

327
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,920
Our relationship was over
a long time ago.

328
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,879
It ended completely five years ago.

329
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,320
I never felt like it ends.

330
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,920
You will come back to me eventually.

331
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,599
Unless the sky falls down.

332
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,879
It will.

333
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,200
You know that.

334
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,560
I've never failed in anything

335
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,800
I've tried to do.

336
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,639
Then you should now know

337
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,560
that the rules of the game in this world

338
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,960
are not set by you.

339
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,759
And I know exactly

340
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,239
who I like right now.

341
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,479
So what?

342
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,960
There is no relationship

343
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,200
in this world that is constant.

344
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,280
Just like five years ago.

345
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,200
We used to be so sweet,

346
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,479
but we broke up in the end, right?

347
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,040
It's been so many years,

348
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,879
and you still care
all about your own feelings,

349
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,400
never caring about others.

350
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,719
Get yourself a tetanus this afternoon.

351
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,759
I think that nail is rusty too.

352
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,560
Otherwise you'll get a fever

353
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:39,639
and infected.

354
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,879
You're always reckless

355
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,200
regardless of the consequences.

356
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,160
Leave.

357
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,120
If I ask you out to dinner right now,

358
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,239
I don't think you're going to say yes.

359
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,640
Leave now.

360
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:12,880
Okay.

361
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,120
I'm leaving.

362
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,400
Thank you.

363
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,640
Bye.

364
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,239
Xu Zehao will definitely not know

365
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,479
what love is in his life.

366
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:38,920
No kidding!

367
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,920
I never said the word love.

368
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,840
I just said I fell for her again.
That's all.

369
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,160
She is thinking too much.

370
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,840
They are two different things.

371
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,719
How can the word love

372
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,920
be said so casually?

373
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,360
Can't he just grow up?

374
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,479
After breaking up, we can just

375
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,440
offer the blessing generously.
Is it that hard?

376
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,200
No blessing at all.

377
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,479
And he said he fell for me.

378
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,680
Does that make any sense?

379
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,479
Blessing?

380
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,120
Okay.

381
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,680
With me.

382
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,160
If she's with someone else,

383
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,799
do I have to pretend to be generous

384
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,239
and wish her happiness?

385
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,279
So he will never know

386
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,039
what tolerance and understanding mean.

387
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:13,920
Tolerance

388
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,600
and understanding?

389
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,799
I'm OK with it.

390
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,039
Just give me a chance.

391
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,519
I'll make you feel it.

392
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,719
Ah.

393
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:24,479
(Qingshan Charity House)
Who is this?

394
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,479
Tell me.

395
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,239
George.

396
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,120
This is George?

397
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,960
I don't know.

398
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,600
Who is it?

399
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,840
This is Peggy.

400
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,039
This is Grandma.

401
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,319
Uncle Li, I'm here.

402
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,079
Lu Xi's here.

403
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,200
I bought you something to eat.

404
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,559
I'll check on everyone.

405
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:35,920
Okay.

406
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,600
They're in there.

407
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,680
What's this, Cherry?

408
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,120
Ms. Zhang.

409
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,759
Hey.

410
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,319
I'm here.

411
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,559
Lu is here.

412
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:42,799
Um.

413
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,840
Are you good today?

414
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,039
Sis Lu Xi!

415
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,840
Slow down.

416
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,440
Here, are you good today?

417
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,400
Here is your reward.

418
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,360
Don't rush.

419
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,640
In order.

420
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,799
Lemon, pink.

421
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,039
You're welcome.

422
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,440
Ms. Zhang.

423
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,559
Help me share them.

424
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,479
Okay.

425
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
You all have one.

426
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,200
All have one.

427
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,960
Kid!

428
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,719
All have one.

429
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,319
Kid,

430
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
what's your name?

431
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,039
Lili.

432
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,079
Lili.

433
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,200
Why aren't you happy today?

434
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,440
You didn't reach for a snack.

435
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:17,600
It's okay.

436
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:17,999
Here.

437
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,680
I brought you the best one.

438
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:20,400
Here you are.

439
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,799
Thank you.

440
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,440
Um.

441
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:29,799
Ms. Zhang,

442
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,840
what's that scar

443
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,400
on Lili's forehead?

444
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,039
Ay.

445
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,519
Lili just got here.

446
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,880
She's so pathetic.

447
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,559
Her parents fought in the kitchen.

448
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,079
Her father was drunk

449
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,200
and wanted to burn down the kitchen.

450
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,120
At a young age,

451
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,479
she went to take care of her mother,

452
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,840
but she burned her forehead.

453
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,239
Luckily, she didn't

454
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,319
burn her eyes.

455
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,719
Where are her parents now?

456
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,120
They are in jail by selling fake drugs.

457
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,559
Her relatives had no choice
but to send her here,

458
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,960
so she's always been introverted.

459
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:04,440
Ms. Zhang.

460
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:05,759
Yes.

461
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,559
I have to go there.

No way.

Love has to be mutual.

What is a man's sexy brain?

511
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,160
Sexy brain?

512

I hate it when you say that.

513
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,319
Why?

514
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,200
Just admit you're ugly if you're ugly.

515
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,840
Don't put on some labels
like sexy brain.

516
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,680
If you have to talk about sexy brain,

517
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,600
Einstein would have one.

518
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,200
Then why did she say

519
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,680
I have a sexy brain?

520
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,519
That lady who gave you the beef
said that to you?

521
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,640
Director.

522
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,079
I suggest you to wake up.

523
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,640
Your brain is so simple.

524
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,799
Now it looks like

525
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,360
you have a more decent face.

526
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,279
Really?

527
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,200
Well...

528
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,840
In your mind,

529
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
what kind of image do I have?

530
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,120
Say something nice about you?

531
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
You're wearing a pair of glasses,

532
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,360
with not so many hairs left,

533
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,279
no visible beer belly,

534
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,960
but the body
doesn't look strong, either.

535
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:41,239
What's the advantage?

536
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,759
It's hard to describe,

537
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,920
a bit abstract.

538
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,719
Please make it a bit more specific.

539
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:49,279
Am I the right type for you?

540
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,279
Why are you so cheeky?

541
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,600
You can't fall in love

542
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,559
without being cheeky.

543
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,120
Eat your beef.

544
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:02,960
You really don't want to try it?

545
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,079
Then I won't eat it, either.

546
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,999
I won't eat it if you won't.

547
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:09,960
Huh!

548
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:12,600
Ay.

549
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,440
Hey.

550
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,160
Does Director Jianmin like auntie?

551
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,079
He doesn't stand a chance.

552
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,239
No one would like a woman

553
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,400
like my mom.

554
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,680
I think you just don't have

555
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,840
eyes to find beauty.

556
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,039
Auntie is so charming.

557
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,239
If I want to be in a relationship,

558
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,319
I would never choose you two.

559
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,120
I'll look for an elegant woman
like auntie.

560
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
What's wrong?

561
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,239
Look.

562
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,239
Xia Tian.

563
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,160
Xia Tian.

564
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:03,440
Xia Tian.

565
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,319
Turn it off.

566
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:07,440
What do you think?

567
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,400
Are you going out?

568
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,440
I'm going out to battle.

569
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,719
I'm busy today,

570
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,960
so I cannot go to

571
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,200
the construction site.

572
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,799
Who are you going to battle for?

573
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,319
The university association

574
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,360
has a gathering today.

575
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,519
That bad man?

576
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,840
No.

577
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:33,039
Oh.

578
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,160
Then why don't you go now?

579
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,319
Still staying here.

580
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,239
You don't understand.

581
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,799
The important one

582
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,279
is always the last one to come out.

583
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,680
When Tan Xu is burning with anxiety

584
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,160
while waiting for me,

585
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,440
I'll appear in front of him

586
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,840
at the right time.

587
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:50,239
Well.

588
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,960
If he's really anxious,

589
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,079
won't he call you?

590
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,479
So I turned my phone off too.

591
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,559
Fine.

592
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,519
Song's here.

593
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,519
Come on.

594
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:10,840
Hello.

595
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,920
I'm sorry.

596
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,479
I'm late.

597
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,719
We're all waiting for you.

598
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:15,239
We've all had enough.

599
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,400
I got a little stuck in traffic.

600
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,559
Drink three cups of wine first.

601
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,279
You were stuck in the road.

602
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:19,479
I'm stuck in the heart.

603
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,360
So slow.

604
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,519
This is...

605
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,559
Oh.

606
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,759
Let me introduce.

607
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,999
This is Song.

608
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:30,799
We are all from the same school

609
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,120
and same association.

610
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
This is Alice.

611
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,160
Tan Xu's girlfriend.

612
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,079
Hello.

613
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,719
I've heard so much about you
from Tan Xu.

614
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,039
Tan Xu,

615
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,319
when you were in college,

616
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,079
there were so many girls pursuing you,

617
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,400
and you didn't even fall in love.

618
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,759
You make such a great move now.

619
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:53,840
Such a gorgeous beauty.

620
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,880
A gorgeous beauty.

621
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,360
Right.

622
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,400
I'll drink with the gorgeous beauty.

623
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,719
Here.

624
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:58,479
Drink with the gorgeous beauty.

625
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:59,559
Drink with the gorgeous beauty.

626
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,039
Cheers!

627
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,719
How long have you two been together?

628
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,680
More than half a year.

629
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,880
We joined the company together.

630
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,640
Why haven't I heard you
mention her before?

631
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,840
What?

632
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:17,999
Oh.

633
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,880
I didn't take it seriously.

634
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,079
You didn't take it seriously?

635
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:24,640
It was in the middle of ambiguity,
so you didn't want to talk about it.

636
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,600
Look now,

637
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,120
he took her here, right?

638
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,759
I think Tan Xu

639
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:31,079
is being serious this time.

640
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,079
Let me ask you.

641
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,759
Has anyone ever seen him
take another girl out?

642
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:35,719
Have you?

643
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,120
No.

644
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,640
Ah?

645
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:36,999
What about you?

646
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,559
No.

647
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,239
Doesn't he usually hang out with Song?

648
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,479
Right.

649
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,719
Alice,

650
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:44,400
it's really nice to see you.

651
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,360
Oh, wait.

652
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,160
So how old are you?

653
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,880
23.

654
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
I just graduated this year.

655
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,640
Nice to meet you.

656
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,120
23!

657
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,039
Tan Xu,

658
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,360
you're great.

659
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,840
You are good at it.

660
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,360
He's quite good at it.

661
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,479
Tan Xu, I understand it until today.

662
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,920
When you just got your job,

663
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,479
you said you were busy.

664
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:13,440
You asked me
to feed the fish at your place,

665
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,200
so you were just too busy dating.

666
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
You gave me the key to your apartment.

667
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,479
You asked me to clean up your place.

668
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,600
Was it all because

669
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,799
you were too busy in love?

670
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,719
Okay.

671
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,559
Go out with your girlfriend

672
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,680
in the clothes I bought you?

673
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,799
You are so cheeky.

674
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,799
Tan Xu,

675
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,840
you and I have known
each other for a long time.

676
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,920
What do you take me for?

677
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,759
A maid?

678
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,799
A cleaner?

679
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,719
Asking me to come and go

680
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,559
as you wish?

681
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,079
Song.

682
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:33,559
I know your feelings.

683
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,279
You just shut up!

684
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,039
You bad man!

685
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,640
Shame on you!

686
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,120
Song.

687
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,400
Drink, Song!

688
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,400
Let's drink.

689
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,519
Come on.

690
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,400
Don't want to escape it.

691
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,759
Drink!

692
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,279
What are you doing?

693
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,360
You came late, and you drank late too?

694
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,559
Come on.

695
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,559
Drink less.

696
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,680
Don't drink too much.

697
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,319
Ay.

698
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,239
I didn't drive here.

699
00:27:59,239 --> 00:27:59,999
I'm happy today.

700
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,479
I didn't drive here, either.

701
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,400
I'm dizzy.

702
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,759
Why is it always you?

703
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,920
I didn't drive, either.

704
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,680
What's wrong?

705
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,519
Excuse me,

706
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,759
I'm busy today.

707
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:18,759
I'm leaving, guys.

708
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,479
Hey.

709
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:20,239
No way.

710
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:20,759
You just got here.

711
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,559
Ask her to stay.

712
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,200
Yeah.

713
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,120
I have other plans later today.

714
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,799
I just came by.

715
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,239
I haven't seen you all for a while.

716
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,680
So I came here to see everyone.

717
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,719
That's it.

718
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,039
I...

719
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,039
See you next time.

720
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:32,999
I am leaving.

721
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:33,479
See you next time.

722
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,680
Stay a little longer.

723
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,759
Aren't you and Tan Xu good friends?

724
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:39,279
I've been waiting for you
to tell me about his dark history.

725
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,840
Yes.

726
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,279
Leave after telling us all about it.

727
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:43,960
Ay.

728
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,680
Dark history of Tan Xu.

729
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,239
Well...

730
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,999
Don't you know all about it?

731
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:49,759
You know the most.

732
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,600
Tell us.

733
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,880
I'm really running out of time.

734
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,440
I have to leave.

735
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:54,400
See you next time.

736
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,719
I'll tell you about it another time.

737
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:56,600
Bye.

738
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,640
Don't.

739
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,160
Well.

740
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:58,920
Song.

741
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,680
Then you take care.

742
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,319
Have a drink before you go.

743
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,160
Go to Binhai Road.

744
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,279
Okay.

745
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,680
Hey.

746
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,719
Drink less.

747
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:49,999
Don't drink too much.

748
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,120
I didn't drive here. It's okay.

749
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,680
Not Binhai Road.

750
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:00,400
Jianshe Road first, please.

751
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,719
Okay.

752
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,960
Oh, my God.

753
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,440
Hey, girl.

754
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,920
What a grudge you've got here.

755
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,440
I've been a maid for him for years.

756
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,079
Is it enough?

757
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,279
Oh.

758
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:16,960
What happened?

759
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,999
A man dumped you

760
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:19,079
and didn't want to marry you?

761
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,160
I wonder if the world has changed.

762
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,840
Two people

763
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,400
did so many things together.

764
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,319
In the end,

765
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,160
he told me we are nothing
more than friends.

766
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,600
We didn't even hold hands.

767
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,519
Oops.

768
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,440
Did he just waste your time?

769
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,400
You should do it.

770
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,079
A girl's youth is the last thing
one can waste.

771
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:58,519
Hey.

772
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,680
What's wrong?

773
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,440
In an early morning,

774
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,759
you woke me up for a running.

775
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,039
Why does a person

776
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,880
who doesn't exercise run this morning?

777
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,680
Don't you know running
is good for our health?

778
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,960
Are you in poor health?

779
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,160
Let me check.

780
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,960
Oh, my God.

781
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,239
You've been putting on a long face

782
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,239
since last night.

783
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,640
If you don't speak,
no one will treat you as a mute.

784
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:16,799
Can you just shut up?

785
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,279
So annoying.

786
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,400
Will you run or not?

787
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,239
Hello?

788
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,840
(You scratched my car. Why?)

789
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,400
What's wrong?

790
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:38,079
Are you feeling well?

791
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:40,519
Do you have any proof?

792
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,759
What makes you think
she scratched your car?

793
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,960
Is it because she likes you?

794
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:43,999
You brought her here to pay for it.

795
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,880
Look at me.

796
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,400
Tell me. Do you think

797
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:46,920
she can be easily bullied?

798
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:51,680
Watch it yourself.

799
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,239
Sometimes, she's just...

800
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,039
She's

801
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:20,400
kind of hard to figure out.

802
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,600
But this one is pretty high definition.

803
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,559
It must be her.

804
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:23,840
I'm sorry.

805
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:25,400
She's just a psycho.

806
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,319
You know that?

807
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,400
It's really beyond my endurance.

808
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,759
She sends me messages every day,

809
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:30,759
and calls me at all hours.

810
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,640
She cannot get me and gets me trouble.

811
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,360
And now she has done such a thing.

812
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,559
I wanted to be good friends with her.

813
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,519
After all, we've known
each other for so long.

814
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,160
But this is too...

815
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:40,999
She's such a psycho.

816
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,120
Tan Xu,

817
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,759
you bad man!

818
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,319
You bad man,

819
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:51,999
give me back everything

820
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,239
I gave you.

821
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,239
Shame on you!

822
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:54,799
You bad man!

823
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,840
Stop.

824
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,920
Stop.

825
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:57,799
Hey.

826
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:58,680
Bro.

827
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,279
Come back.

828
00:33:59,279 --> 00:33:59,840
Come back.

829
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:05,920
The money was transferred to you.

830
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,799
Thank you for keeping it private.

831
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,840
I'm so sorry.

832
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,920
Song is just like this.

833
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,800
She doesn't know how to control herself.

834
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,760
If you still don't feel well
in the next few days,

835
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,199
just come to my hospital.
I'll check for you for free.

836
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:15,840
It's alright.

837
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,519
Keep an eye on her.

838
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,679
I don't want her in my face ever again.

839
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,119
Okay.

840
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,800
You stupid, crazy, little psycho.

841
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,360
Why do you like a guy like this?

842
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:36,800
Ah?

843
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,039
It's over now.

844
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:39,920
Why are you still crying?

845
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,639
Let's go home.

846
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,360
I don't want to go home.

847
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,440
So where do you want to go?

848
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:48,559
I'll be with you.

849
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:53,559
Don't cry.

850
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,320
You're so ugly.

851
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,479
Alright.

852
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,079
Let's go.

853
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:57,999
Put on your shoes.

854
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:10,920
Hey.

855
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,760
What are you doing? Look at you.

856
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,880
Bad man.

857
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
All men are bad.

858
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,119
Let's go. I'm begging you.

859
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,599
You bad man!

860
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,559
What's wrong?

861
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,119
I'm sorry, uncle.

862
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,639
I'm sorry.

863
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,079
Sorry.

864
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:22,400
I'm sorry.

865
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,479
She's drunk.

866
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,800
Let's go.

867
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,760
Stop it.

868
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,960
He doesn't look good at all.

869
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:29,960
Stop drinking.

870
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,320
You're going to have a beard

871
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,199
and become a man.

872
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:33,880
Let me ask you.

873
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,440
Am I not attractive enough?

874
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,920
Do I look unattractive to you?

875
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,039
I don't have any charm at all?

876
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,679
Why are you taking off clothes
in broad daylight?

877
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,240
Please just stop it and let's go.

878
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,440
Your parents would cut me down
if they find out.

879
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:46,880
I don't want to go.

880
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,320
Let's go.

881
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,920
Don't touch me.

882
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,119
Hey.

883
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,920
She said don't touch her.

884
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:53,039
Ah?

885
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,400
Why did you push me?

886
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,440
Why did I push you?

887
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,999
I pushed you for a reason.

888
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,559
Go.

889
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:58,960
Young girl,

890
00:35:59,199 --> 00:35:59,840
where do you live?

891
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:00,880
I will send you home.

892
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:01,639
Mr. Zhang,

893
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,280
don't mess with me here.

894
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,240
What's wrong?

895
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,479
A misunderstanding.

896
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,639
A misunderstanding.

897
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,280
Okay.

898
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,920
We are fine now.

899
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,999
You guys keep drinking.

900
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,079
Stop drinking.

901
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,840
Stop drinking. Let's go.

902
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,159
The two of them are friends,

903
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,720
not like what you think.

904
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,079
We can continue.

905
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:15,720
What?

906
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,880
Continue?

907
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,039
You want to continue?

908
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:18,720
You still want to drink more?

909
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,159
I have several surgeries
lining up this afternoon.

910
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:20,800
I need to do the eyelids surgery,

911
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,240
hyaluronic acid

912
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,400
and botox treatment for a living.
You know that?

913
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,840
Stop messing around.

914
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,320
Hey.

915
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,960
All you can think about right now

916
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,360
is to take her to the hotel, right?

917
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:27,240
Hotel?

918
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,119
Yes.

919
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:31,280
What do you mean?

920
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,760
What do you mean?

921
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:33,840
Who is she?

922
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,079
My sister.

923
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,840
How many sisters do you have?

924
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,159
Two.

925
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,840
Why do you have so many sisters?

926
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,599
You cannot stop, right?

927
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,320
Stop that.

928
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,280
Well,

929
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,199
let me tell you.

930
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,880
I've known them for years.

931
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,039
It's not like what you think.

932
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,400
So what is their relationship?

933
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,599
Psycho.

934
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:49,960
Hey.

935
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,679
Who are you calling psycho?

936
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,280
Alright.

937
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,840
Look at you!

938
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,760
So drunk.

939
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm really impressed.

940
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:04,639
Drinking so much.

941
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:07,720
What is this?

942
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,720
I shouldn't worry so much about you.

943
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,280
Oh, this smell of wine...

944
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:14,760
Ay.

945
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,199
I'm really impressed.

946
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,479
I respect you.

947
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,559
Drinking that much
with so little capacity for liquor.

948
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,440
Don't drink so much next time.

949
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,599
I'm begging you.

950
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,360
Do I owe you?

951
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,599
I don't know...

952
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,720
Donghao.

953
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,880
Today you are

954
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:39,679
super handsome.

955
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,079
You're very handsome.

956
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:58,079
Song.

957
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,119
I'll get you a glass of

958
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,240
honey water.

959
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,800
(She's still not in the office today.)

960
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:29,240
This batch of wood is quite good.

961
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,199
Miss Xia said

962
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,760
she won't be here in the next few days.

963
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:43,679
I know.

964
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:44,720
I didn't ask you about it.

965
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,199
Hey.

966
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,320
The newly arrived wood

967
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,679
is really of good quality.

968
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,039
Miss Xia is right about it.

969
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,720
Then maybe she should check it out.

970
00:38:59,199 --> 00:38:59,960
Call her

971
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,999
and tell her to come to the office.

972
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,199
Okay.

973
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,960
Oh, wait.

974
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,599
You know what? I'll go find her

975
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,960
and talk with her about the furniture.

976
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,320
Hey!

977
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:10,559
You forgot?

978
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,400
You have a meeting this afternoon.

979
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,679
Just change it to an online meeting.

980
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,400
Does the time stay the same?

981
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,320
You are so annoying today.

982
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,760
Why do you talk so much?

983
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,199
(Oh no.)

984
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,679
(I must be crazy.)

985
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960

the other day,)

Hey.

997

I'm not here for nothing.

998
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,720
I'm here to talk about work.

999
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,039
These are some raw materials

1000
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:39,800
from the manufacturers today.

1001
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,360
Help me check which ones are suitable.

1002
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,159
Leave them there.

1003

I'll check tonight.

1004

Tonight?

1005
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,999
I said I'll check tonight.

1006
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,400
I have my own orders to work for.

1007
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,039
Why would I fit in with your schedule?

1008
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:53,999
The guesthouse project
isn't finished yet.

1009
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:54,400
You...

1010
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,240
You started to take jobs from others?

1011

First come, first served.

1012
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:58,960
You should check mine first.

1013

Hurry up.

1014
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,440
Yes, Mr. Xu.

even when she's angry.)

Alright.

Aren't you curious?

1025
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,079
I don't care.

1026
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,519
It's related to you.

1027
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,519
With Guan Xin.

1028
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:57,960
What do you want with my boyfriend?

1029
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,559
Are you worried?

1030
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,880
Come with me if you're worried.

1031
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,760
Fine.

1032
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,720
In that case,

1033
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,039
I'll go on my own.

1034
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:08,119
But let me clear this first.

1035
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,760
If something gets out of hand tonight,

1036
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,720
that's not my responsibility.

1037
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,079
It's yours.

1038
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,599
I'm leaving.

1039
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,240
Bye.

1040
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,360
Thank you for today, Dr. Guan.

1041
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,280
I was going to
bring that little girl here,

1042
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,960
but she suddenly got a fever.

1043
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,360
I'll bring her here next time.

1044
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:35,960
Um.

1045
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,400
Okay.

1046
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,159
I'll go check on my surgery schedule.

1047
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:38,960
Feel free to contact me.

1048
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:39,639
Okay.

1049
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:41,960
Ah?

1050
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:44,960
It's out of power.

1051
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:48,639
Let me send you back.

1052
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,599
I live nearby,

1053
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
and it's quick to drive home.

1054
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:52,440
Well.

1055
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
I'll give you a ride on my way home.

1056
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:04,840
I won't see her in private anymore.

1057
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:06,559
I'm sorry.

1058
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:09,880
What's wrong?

1059
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:10,800
What is it?

1060
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,440
What's wrong?

1061
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,320
Oh.

1062
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,519
