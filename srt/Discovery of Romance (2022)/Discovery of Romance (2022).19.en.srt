00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,160
Hey.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,240
What did I do with her?

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Why do you misunderstand us?

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,640
Ah?

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,679
I admit,

23
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:26,399
there may be some danger
in our relationship.

24
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:27,839
But we never crossed the line.

25
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:29,440
And I've been trying to

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,720
keep my feelings for her at bay.

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,479
Why don't you trust me?

28
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:33,520
Yes.

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,080
Of course I trust you.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,800
I don't know what they

31
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,960
suspect you of.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,839
Do you need to check under the bed?

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,240
Right.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,199
You can't fit anyone under this bed.

35
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:57,600
Ah.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,720
Hello.

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,360
What's wrong?

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,960
You miss me so much

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,439
that you called me so many times.

40
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,719
Of course.

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,240
I made you sandwiches this morning.

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,360
I was afraid you'd get up hungry,

43
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,240
but you weren't there.

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,360
I came to my mom's house last night.

45
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,240
I forgot to tell you.

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,320
Are you mad?

47
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,520
No.

48
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,320
(Really?)

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,679
Really.

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,679
Then you can help me eat my sandwiches.

51
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,960
Will you come to see me today?

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,920
I have something to do later.

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,159
You are not here now anyway.

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,159
You petty man.

55
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,399
Then miss me when you're done.

56
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,439
Um.

57
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,040
Okay.

58
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,599

Mr. Yu.

61
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,360
All clear!

62
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,679
Xia Tian is at her mom's house.

63
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,679
Ah.

64
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,719
I thought you weren't coming.

65
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,439
You didn't reply to any of my messages.

66
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,279
I got caught up in something.

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,640
You told me you are leaving.

68
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,839
Of course I would come.

69
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,240
Why is this shop suddenly closing down?

70
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,399
The shop owner said,

71
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,839
the coffee shop is not doing well.

72
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
(For Rent)
He wants to change it into a manicure instead.

73
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,800
So have you figured out
what you're going to do?

74
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,879
I was selected by the public service
organization I signed up.

75
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,480
I still don't know

76
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,920
when to go.

77
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,679
The shop is closing down today.

78
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,760
This might be the last cake I make.

79
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:41,679
It's for you.

80
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,439
Lu Xi.

81
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,640
You used to make cakes for other people.

82
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,879
I'll do it for you this time, okay?

83
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,159
I'll give you a little more cream.

84
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,439
Okay.

85
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,080
Turn it like this.

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,520
Dr. Guan.

87
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,800
Um?

88
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,640
You have cream here.

89
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:06,399
Yes?

90
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:06,800
Um.

91
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,399
Here.

92
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,360
Oops.

93
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,719
Okay.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,599
Finished.

95
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,640
Here you are.

96
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,520
Let me draw

97
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:35,320
a sunflower.

98
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,680
Ah?

99
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,200
Why?

100
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,440
Because sunflowers are tough

101
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,520
and very youthful, just like you.

102
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,479
They're vigorous

103
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,279
like you.

104
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:48,960
Thank you, Dr. Guan.

105
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,680
Then I'll get started.

106
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:01,960
Here you are.

107
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,599
The first cake I ever made.

108
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,719
Wow.

109
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,399
It's so memorable.

110
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:08,760
Wow.

111
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,880
It feels like a birthday party.

112
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,159
I don't celebrate my birthday.

113
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,080
Why?

114
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,080
I don't know when my birthday is.

115
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,399
I hear all people who live longer
don't celebrate their birthdays.

116
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,719
This is very good.

117
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:22,719
They don't get old.

118
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,279
Then this cake

119
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,239
is your dimission gift.

120
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,919
Um.

121
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,479
Make a wish.

122
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,080
My first wish,

123
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,399
I hope I could be

124
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,799
more skilled

125
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,159
to see the bigger world.

126
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,680
My second wish,

127
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,520
I hope I can meet
brother Xuan again soon.

128
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,960
My third wish.

129
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,560
My third wish is about you.

130
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,560
About me?

131
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,320
I want to say,

132
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,960
you always keep

133
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,359
a lot of things to yourself.

134
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,159
You take them on yourself.

135
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:14,479
Have you ever thought

136
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,960
that this is also a burden

137
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,359
for those who accept your kindness?

138
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,560
What makes you think that way?

139
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,159
I can feel your kindness to me.

140
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,880
You bought me the recording device,

141
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,680
and helped me decorate my house,

142
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,440
as well as Lili's surgery.

143
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,320
What about you?

144
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,080
When are you going to have your surgery?

145
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,359
Dr. Guan.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,080
Why do you keep asking me

147
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,599
about this scar?

148
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,039
Because I know

149
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,479
some scars are in the body,

150
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,399
also in the heart.

151
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:51,960
I want to help you

152
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
in any way I can.

153
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,719
But I hope

154
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,479
you could love yourself a little more,

155
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,960
and try to open your heart

156
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,479
a little more.

157
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,440
So my third wish,

158
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,839
I hope you love yourself more.

Hello, son!

178
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:08,999
Mom.

179
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,560
Are you asleep?

180
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,400
Not yet.

181
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:12,759
I'm reading.

182
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,080
What are calling me for at this hour?

183
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,440
Tomorrow

184
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,680
I'll meet you after work.

185
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,440
Is there anything important?

186
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,639
We'll talk tomorrow.

187
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:23,999
Take a rest early.

188
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,560
Okay.

189
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,519
So do you.

190
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:29,239
Um.

191
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:43,759
Ay.

192
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,479
Oh, my God.

193
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,359
What is wrong with this kid?

194
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
It's such a mess.

195
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:40,839
Hello.

196
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:41,680
(Lu Xi?)

197
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,759
(I have several Lili's case reports.)

198
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,359
(Come to the hospital
and get them at your convenience.)

199
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,719
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

200
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:47,800
(Okay.)

201
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:53,920
Mom?

202
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,239
Why are you here?

203
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,320
Didn't I tell you?

204
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,719
You can't keep this picture.

205
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,960
I can't believe
you still keep it at home.

206
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,519
Did you ever think about
what you should say

207
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,040
if Xia Tian sees it?

208
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,359
They all say you are gentle.

209
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,599
I don't think so.

210
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,320
How many times do I have to tell you

211
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,359
the same thing

212
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,560
before you understand?

213
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,999
Why are you so stubborn?

214
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:16,239
Mom.

215
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,560
Because I'm like you.

216
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,040
I'm not stubborn.

217
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,119
I'm just waiting...

218
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,599
Waiting for the moment
you can understand me.

219
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,119
What do you want me to understand?

220
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,320
Didn't I tell you?

221
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,239
I want to make it up to Lu Xi.

222
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:31,280
More importantly,
I want to be honest to Xia Tian.

223
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,200
For what?

224
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,119
Have you ever thought...?

225
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:34,560
Mom.

226
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,719
I really

227
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
want to

228
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,759
be able to tell someone
all about myself.

229
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,200
To live with a new me,

230
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,119
there are both benefits

231
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,119
and pains.

232
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,080
I don't want

233
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,160
to carry on with such a heavy burden.

234
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,839
I really appreciate it.

235
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,280
I really appreciate you
getting me out of the Charity House.

236
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,960
I feel I'm so lucky.

237
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:11,839
But...

238
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,639
I don't have anyone
to talk to about these things.

239
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,440
No one.

240
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,999
I want to tell Xia Tian about it.

241
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
Because she's the one I like.

242
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,080
Mom.

243
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,800
Could you allow me to do so?

244
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,680
Ay.

245
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:38,359
Fine.

246
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,239
You are so stubborn.

247
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,479
Hello.

248
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,359
I'm here to get Lili's case reports.

249
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,440
Okay, wait a sec.

250
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,280
Thank you.

251
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,080
You're welcome.

252
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,479
Miss, your case reports are ready.

253
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:01,960
Ay.

254
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,519
Oops.

255
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,119
Ay.

256
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,639
I'm so sorry.

257
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,440
Are you all right, girl?

258
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,839
Auntie.

259
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:08,599
Are you okay?

260
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,479
It's okay. I walked too fast.

261
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:11,680
I accidentally bumped into her.

262
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,440
Auntie, why are you here?

263
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,320
I need to talk
to Guan Xin about something.

264
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,400
We're done here.

265
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,080
Alright.

266
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,839
I have to go back to cook for old Guan.

267
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,160
Take care, Auntie.

268
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,599
Wait.

269
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,160
Who is she?

270
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,560
Guan Xin's mom.

271
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,599
What's wrong?

272
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,080
Dr. Li.

273
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,080
Can you come over here?

274
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,160
Oh, yes.

275
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,479
Hello, Xia Tian.

276
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,519
Are you free this evening?

277
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:01,759
Ah.

278
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,359
Nothing.

279
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:03,759
I just miss you.

280
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:05,040
And...

281
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,639
I have something to tell you.

282
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:09,999
Um.

283
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,920
See you tonight.

284
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,160
I'll become a doctor

285
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,119
when I grow up.

286
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,759
I'll repair your scar.

287
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,999
It's an old injury, isn't it?

288
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,999
How did this happen?

289
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,839
I was naughty when I was a girl,

290
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,879
and I fell when riding a bike.

291
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:35,320
How old were you?

292
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,359
Six.

293
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,239
In the Charity House.

294
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,879
What's wrong?

295
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,839
(I thought)

296
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,759
(I'd recognize you)

297
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,280
(when I see you.)

298
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,160
This is my business card.

299
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,080
If you make up your mind,

300
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,759
feel free to contact me.

301
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,719
Guan Xin.

302
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,599
Plastic Surgeon.

303
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,719
What if he recognizes you

304
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,680
but pretends he doesn't know you?

305
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,920
You're just like my big brother.

306
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,119
He can't eat spicy food either.

307
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,440
Can I call you Brother Guan Xin?

308
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,799
Why are you here again?

309
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,559
And you're crying.

310
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,200
I'm okay.

311
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,799
Then why are you downstairs

312
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,120
at my boyfriend's house?

313
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,680
To me, Dr. Guan

314
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:35,799
is actually like a family.

315
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,039
A family?

316
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,120
Guan Xin is a nice guy.

317
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,640
He thinks you're a young girl

318
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,319
with a difficult background,

319
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,319
so he wants to help you.

320
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
But he does so
simply out of his kindness.

321
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,120
Are you telling me right now

322
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,360
that Dr. Guan is pitying me

323
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,960
because I'm pathetic?

324
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,200
No.

325
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,759
Yes.

326
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,120
You're right.

327
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,279
Dr. Guan helps me

328
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,400
and pities me

329
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,160
because I'm pathetic.

330
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,440
I know all of these.

331
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,840
I understand.

332
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,600
I know it well.

333
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,680
Why do you have to tell me this?

334
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,279
If you know he is just pitying me,

335
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:16,039
why are you still being suspicious?

336
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,279
Even to be helped

337
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,600
or pitied,

338
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,519
that's between me and Dr. Guan.

339
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,360
You don't have to remind me.

340
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,079
If you don't trust
your boyfriend that much,

341
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,600
try being an orphan yourself.

342
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,239
In your life,

343
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,719
you are the main character.

344
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,799
In my life,

345
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,559
I am also the main character.

346
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,279
Even if my life is already like this,

347
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,799
I don't want anyone to tell me

348
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,079
that I am pitied.

349
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:07,960
Xia Tian.

350
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,519
I prepared red wine

351
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,440
and steaks.

352
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,120
I saw Lu Xi downstairs.

353
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:16,680
She's crying.

354
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,160
I've been waiting for you
to explain to me

355
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,440
what's going on with you and Lu Xi.

356
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,319
And you kept telling me

357
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
you are going to tell me about her.

358
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,039
I've been waiting.

359
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,160
Xia Tian.

360
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,440
I...

361
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,880
If you can't explain it, then forget it.

362
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,799
You never want to explain it

363
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,479
to me anyway, right?

364
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,279
Xia Tian.

365
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,239
Why?

366
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,200
Why can I understand you

367
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,200
and trust you,

368
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,999
but you can't?

369
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,360
There's a lot I don't understand

370
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,799
about you and Xu Zehao.

371
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,360
Picked the wrong phones.

372
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,640
Slept in his house.

373
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,640
You two are partners now.

374
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,519
I also feel very strange about you.

375
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,440
And I can't find

376
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,719
a reasonable explanation myself.

377
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,360
But I choose to trust you.

378
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,279
Do you really care how I feel?

379
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,640
Do you really love me?

380
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:24,920
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,999
I may have been a little out of line.

382
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,440
Why don't we both just calm down?

383
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,680
I...

384
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,360
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,200
I can't do this.

386

They are always

Why didn't you just leave?

00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,120
I wanted to.

416
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:45,279
Then I thought

417
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,239
that you might be sitting alone
in the house until morning,

418
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,319
so I didn't leave.

419
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,680
Guan Xin, I love you.

420
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,759
This is the first time
I see you really love me.

421
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,759
I have no qualms in my heart.

422
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,440
I love you too.

423
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:28,400
Xia Tian.

424
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,559
Didn't I tell you

425
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,799
I was going to tell you about Lu Xi?

426
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,400
Actually, I grew up
in the Charity House too.

427
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,239
We had been living together
since we were only kids.

428
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,039
Actually,

429
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,319
my mom was going to adopt Lu Xi.

430
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,719
She was six.

431
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,400
And I was 12.

432
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,719
She didn't know

433
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,120
what it meant to be adopted.

434
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,039
She kept saying

435
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,759
that she wanted to be with me.

436
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,719
And I promised her.

437
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,719
I said,

438
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,039
"Okay,"

439
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
"I will always be with you."

440
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,039
And then we went out for a bike ride,

441
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,719
she broke her arm,

442
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,039
and was hospitalized for a long time.

443
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,079
The wound also left a scar.

444
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,880
And then my mom didn't adopt her,

445
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,440
but adopted me instead.

446
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,519
When I left,

447
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,039
I couldn't even say goodbye to her.

448
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,079
Xia Tian.

449
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,759
Do you think I'm a bad guy?

450
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,519
Why?

451
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,719
You were just 12.

452
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,039
What would a 12-year-old kid know?

453
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,999
You should have told me that earlier.

454
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,880
Because

455
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,880
my mom is a very pushy person.

456
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:28,200
She didn't want me to talk about it.

457
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,200
Actually,

458
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,799
I am also running from it myself.

459
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,039
I'm really afraid of losing you.

460
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,120
Guan Xin.

461
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,960
No matter where you were born,

462
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,519
in my mind,

463
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,440
you are just the way you are.

464
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,360
I like you for who you are,

465
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,680
not anything else.

466
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,559
And I'm thousands of times
stronger than you think,

467
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,519
so you can

468
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,279
totally trust me.

469
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,960
I already came clean.

470
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,200
I have nothing to hide.

471
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,999
What was your name
before you were adopted?

472
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:34,519
He Xuan.

473
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,360
Nice to meet you.

474
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,600
He Xuan.

475
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,640
I'm Xia Tian.

476
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,160
Nice to meet you.

477
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,079
Xia Tian.

478
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,400
Then I was wrong about Lu Xi.

479
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,519
Because she was downstairs
at your house,

480
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:13,759
so I thought...

481
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,999
I was so harsh on her just now.

482
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,479
I said you were good to her

483
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,440
because you were kind and pitying her.

484
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,400
So she's

485
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,960
a little out of control

486
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,999
and cried.

487
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:30,120
I didn't know she is your sister.

488
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,799
So...

489
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,120
You know me.

490
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,920
I always talk offensively.

491
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,400
It's not your fault.

492
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,479
I didn't tell you about it.

493
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,079
I'll just explain it to her later.

494
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,759
But,

495
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,039
you really need to change

496
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,920
that stupid mouth of yours.

497
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,239
Who are you talking about?

498
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,360
The one who pissed off.

499
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,360
I'll give you one more chance.

500
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,120
The one who has the stupid mouth

501
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,920
is me.

502
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,999
You're acting really weird today.

503
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:14,319
Ah?

504
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,440
You bought so many things.

505
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,160
You bought them

506
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,960
for Tan Xu or Yu Hui?

507
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,759
Pooh!

508
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,640
Please,

509
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,160
can you stop thinking about those guys?

510
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,759
This is my reward
for receiving the 3rd payment.

511
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,960
Hey.

512
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,640
Is this a reward for me?

513
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:29,960
This is

514
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,559
for free.

515
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,120
Women

516
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:33,920
never say uncle.

517
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:35,719
It's good.

518
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,999
Hey.

519
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,559
Guan Xin?

520
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,960
What was Guan Xin doing
at the jewelry store?

521
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,360
I saw him buying a small box,

522
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,759
and then he put it in a gift bag.

523
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,999
What would it be?

524
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,600
Um?

525
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,160
Is he going to

526
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,840
propose to you?

527
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:00,999
Just tell me.

528
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,719
How are things going
between you two these days?

529
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:04,600
Quite good.

530
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,999
That's good.

531
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:06,799
What about Lu Xi?

532
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,279
Did you get rid of Lu Xi?

533
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,519
Just a clever kid.

534
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,640
Right.

535
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,360
If there's any problem,

536
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,279
just leave it to me.

537
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,920
You won't get your hands dirty.

538
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,840
Hey, you

539
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,079
just get ready.

540
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:25,680
Maybe tomorrow morning, Guan Xin will...

541
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,239
Here.

542
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,680
He'll show up at our doorstep

543
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,039
with a bouquet of roses
and a diamond ring.

544
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,960
Are you happy?

545
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,759
Ah.

546
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:33,880
I'm going to be the maid of honor.

547
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,960
Well.

548
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,319
I have to find Donghao now

549
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,880
and get some information for you

550
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,759
to see what else
Guan Xin's going to do.

551
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,279
Hey.

552
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,200
Did you ask Guan Xin?

553
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,960
Is he really going to
propose to Xia Tian?

554
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
He won't tell me.

555
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,479
If he tells me,

556
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,799
isn't that the same as telling Xia Tian?

557
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,200
It won't be a surprise at all.

558
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,600
So you must not tell Xia Tian about it.

559
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,920
Keep it between us.

560
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,960
Ah.

561
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:10,799
I know.

562
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,960
Right.

563
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,160
Tomorrow night,

564
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,519
Bairong Restaurant.

565
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,759
Get me a private room.

566
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:21,840
Thank you.

567
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,200
Okay.

568
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:34,640
(Bairong Restaurant: Wedding venue)

569
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,200
That's the basic process.

570
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:36,719
Zhang,

571
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:38,200
you have to keep an eye on
the material mill.

572
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,600
Every time they deliver,

573
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,279
all the data

574
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,440
should not deviate
from our requirements.

575
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:42,360
Yes, Mr. Xu.

576
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,160
Sun.

577
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,039
I need you to go over the budget
and expenditure details

578
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:45,759
of the project again.

579
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,840
I want to check it again.

580
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,559
Okay. No problem.

581
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,120
Yu Hui.

582
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,479
Yes.

583
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,039
Make an appointment with the client

584
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:50,920
to check the timeline of the project.

585
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,559
Don't delay it again.

586
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,559
Okay.

587
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,600
And for Xia Song Studio,

588
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,559
now,

589
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,479
your work has almost come to an end.

590
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,880
You can make some fine-tuning.

591
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,840
But,

592
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,400
no more big changes.

593
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,079
Be cautious.

594
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:12,479
Okay.

595
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,559
That's all for today.

596
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,160
Dismissed.

597
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,400
Thank you.

598
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,360
Look.

599
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,999
Flowers.

600
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,759
Diamond ring.

601
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,680
That's the second part of the proposal.

602
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,719
You have to get ready

603
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:32,400
for the romantic actions of Guan Xin.

604
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:58,880
We can watch the sunset first,

605
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,559
and have a late night snack after that.

606
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,519
You...

607
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,759
Well...

608
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:06,479
What?

609
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:07,920
Nothing.

610
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,239
I've never seen you like this before.

611
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:11,999
Uncle Jianmin,

612
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,319
where are you going?

613
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,999
I am going to hike with your mother.

614
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,640
This...

615
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,519
It's so late now.

616
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,120
You'll go now?

617
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,759
Night hiking is popular now.

618
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,960
We set off at 7 o'clock,

619
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,120
and reach the peak at 9 o'clock.

620
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,840
You can see

621
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,640
the starry night sky above.

622
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,640
It's fancy.

623
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:26,559
I thought you would never
do any outdoor sports.

624
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,600
Recently,

625
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,360
I am not in the mood for writing.

626
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,559
So I want to

627
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,920
take some fresh air.

628
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,479
Are you in love?

629
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,239
- Um.
- No.

630
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,120
If I do fall in love,

631
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,880
I'll let you know.

632
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,360
Go call a cab.

633
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:42,120
I'm telling you now.

634
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:47,999
Say it.

635
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:48,519
What is it?

636
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,799
No big deal.

637
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,680
Maybe you should go hiking first.

638
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,120
Okay.

639
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Have a talk.

640
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:57,920
Here.

641
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,160
Sit.

642
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,840
Why did you marry my dad?

643
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,519
Ah?

644
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:12,160
I...

645
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,360
He's a nice guy.

646
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,120
He can take my temper.

647
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,039
What's wrong?

648
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,360
Did you like him?

649
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,840
What do you think?

650
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:25,039
Can you understand my dad?

651
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,039
Xia Tian.

652
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,479
How can two completely
independent individuals

653
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:32,519
be completely acceptable to each other?

654
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,400
I cannot understand.

655
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,920
I just made do with it.

656
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,799
If Guan Xin asks me to marry him,

657
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,680
should I say yes?

658
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,400
Are you asking me?

659
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,039
How should I know?

660
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,519
You should make decisions on your own.

661
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,960
I just want to remind you

662
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,519
that you don't have to
consider me or your dad

663
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,719
when you make a decision.

664
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:55,519
You are not me,

665
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,279
not your dad.

666
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:56,999
Right?

667
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:57,880
At this point,

668
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,840
I'm a good mom.

669
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,279
I've never asked you to do anything.

670
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,640
You should make decisions on your own.

671
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,479
I have no reason to say no.

672
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,960
If I really do,

673
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,800
I think I'll go too far.

674
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:17,119
If you have to say no,

675
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:18,760
what does it matter?

676
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,519
Do you live to please others?

677
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:23,960
Certainly,

678
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,960
I got my selfishness from you.

679
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,599
Figure this thing out for yourself.

680
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,079
Only if you figure it out,

681
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,639
won't you hurt anyone.

682
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,840
Okay?

683
