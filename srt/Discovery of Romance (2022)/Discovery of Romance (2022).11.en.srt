You shut up.

Do you think you're over the line?

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,640
You were holding

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,279
my boyfriend's hand and hiding around
in front of me.

53
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm the one over the line?

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,080
I can put up with you for once,

or twice.

But I cannot put up with you
for a third time.

57
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,279
You asked me why I was hiding?

58
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,360
That's just because you were
always suspicious of us.

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
You wore sunglasses
and pretended to be a customer

60

in the coffee shop and nail salon.

61
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
You picked on me over and over again.

00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:58,559
Right?

63
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
I didn't mention
anything about it, did I?

64

What she said is true?

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,559
Did you go to Lu Xi's workplace?

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,320
I just wanted to know

67

what kind of girl she is,

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,480

about her?

70
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,839
Why did you do that?

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
I always thought
you wouldn't do such things.

72
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,559
And you said
you wouldn't be the kind of woman

I'll send you back.

122

I'll be worried if you go back alone.

Why are you being so nice to me?

124

Because of me,

125
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,440
you and your girlfriend
are getting relationship problems.

I am trying to help you.

You shouldn't feel stressed

128

Coriander, sesame oil and pepper.

You can still eat now?

130

Would you like another plate
of cattle stomach?

131
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,839
He didn't even hesitate

132
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,320
when he went away with that girl.

133
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,039
I think Guan Xin

134
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,159
likes that girl more or less.

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,279
That's because you don't know him.

136
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,399
He is a person

137
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,120
who is nice

138
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,479
and considerate to everyone.

139
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,399
He doesn't turn others away.

140
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,159
I think that girl

141
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,799
has some trouble.

142
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,960
What did he give you

143
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,039
to get you to be so confused?

144
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,839
If he doesn't like that girl,

145
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,839
why did he defend the girl

146
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,200
subconsciously in front of you?

147
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,599
It was all a reflex of the mind.

148
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,560
Xu Zehao.

149
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,399
You shut up.

150
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,440
Don't talk nonsense if you don't know.

151
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,880
Fine.

152
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,719
I don't know.

153
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,159
If you do, just forgive him.

154
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:03,239
Why are you mad at him?

155
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:05,000
So it turned out to be a play,

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,399
and you dragged me in

157
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,680
as an outsider.

158
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,279
What?

159
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,479
This is not a play.

160
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,159
If I forgive him so easily today

161
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,359
and let it go,

162
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,919
it will become

163
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,440
a habit over time,

164
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,359
just like someone did in the past.

165
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,359
This man got used to
a girl being good to him,

166
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,599
enduring him, bearing him
and waiting for him.

167
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,880
At last,

168
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
everything was taken for granted.

169
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,239
Men are all ungrateful.

170
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,680
Don't you know that?

171
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:35,839
Do you feel bad

172
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,920
if you don't accuse me?

173
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,759
Fine.

174
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,999
Five years ago, I was a terrible person,

175
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:41,960
and I was sorry.

176
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,719
Okay?

177
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,320
One more plate of cattle stomach.

178
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,560
Okay.

179
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,239
He's over there.

180
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,080
Ignore him.

181
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,080
Are you sure?

182
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,879
What do you want to do now?

183
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,680
Give him a hard time.

184
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,119
Coax me after coaxing another?

185
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:46,759
I'm not that easily bullied.

186
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,639
So are you using me?

187
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,440
Yes, I admit.

188
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,999
I like you.

189
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,999
I can't get over you.

190
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,879
I even confessed to you once.

191
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,320
But

192
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,839
at least I have a sense of pride.

193
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,440
Do you just treat me

194
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,639
like I'm a tool?

195
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,320
Xia Tian.

196
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,960
Aren't you going to get off?

197
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,879
Xu Zehao, open the door.

198
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:31,999
Xu Zehao.

199
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,400
Open the door.

200
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,759
Xu Zehao, open the door.

201
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:38,599
What now?

202
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,800
To see a movie.

203
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,639
Do you think
I'm in the mood for a movie?

204
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,599
Just send me to the cinema.

205
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,400
You don't have to go in there with me.

206
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,119
Xu Zehao.

207
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,519
Open the door.

208
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,200
Open the door.

209
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,400
How did you end up like this?

210
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,200
Ah?

211
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,920
Well...

212
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,599
Can you still see the movie?

213
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,280
Do you have any pride at all?

214
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,119
I'm telling you.

215
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,359
You're nobody in the heart of Xia Tian.

216
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,999
She's just using you
to make her boyfriend mad.

217
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,280
What are you still doing here?

218
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,200
Leave.

219
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:38,879
Hey.

220
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Why do you speak like this?

221
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,759
I know you have no choice.

222
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,639
You like her,

223
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,040
so you just have to tolerate.

224
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,719
Besides,

225
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,879
you know that's what unrequited love

226
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,119
is all about, right?

227
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,239
If you really need someone to blame,

228
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,320
you're the one to blame

229
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,479
for liking a girl with a boyfriend

230
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,160
in the first place.

231
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:05,759
Is it that bad?

232
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:08,519
No.

233
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,440
It's quite good.

234
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,160
I just wanted to pee,

235
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,999
but I suppressed it.

236
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,359
There's still an hour and a half to go.

237
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,160
It's alright.

238
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,639

Thank you for today.

I'm a bit embarrassed about that.

245
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,839
You're being so polite all of a sudden.

246
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,479
I'm not used to it.

247
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:58,759
And,

248
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,879
if you need me to help like this,

249
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:02,639
just tell me.

250
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,759
I'll think of it as after-sales service.

251
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:07,960
I am telling you.

252
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,280
I have now become

253

a new Xu Zehao.

254
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,839
If you want to try me again,

255
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:15,839
you should do so before it is too late.

256
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,440
I think you have a merit.

257

What is it?

258
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,040
Even though
you don't treat me very well,

you treat everyone else even worse.

260
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,400
Compared with being good to me

261
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,200
and being better to other people,

262
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
it seems this is better.

263
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,519
Thank you for saying so.

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,479

Right.

Only if he says sorry first,

328

can I have the chance to reject him.

Oh.

at least you're not that bad.

338
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,479
You take a good look.

339
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,559
You blind man!

340
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,920
I have them.

341
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,239
These double eyelids are so unnatural.

342
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:23,840
Look.

343
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,680
They're too wide.

344
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,719
Yeah.

345
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,759
These European style double eyelids
have fallen out of fashion.

346
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,840
Now they have to look natural,

347
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,880
like being born with them.

348
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,239
Um.

349
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,519
You can actually use sunk cords.

350
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,120
(He doesn't seem to)

351
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,680
(want to call Xia Tian.)

352
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,600
(Why wouldn't he do
the same thing this time?)

353
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,559
What do you think?

354
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,039
Oh.

355
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,440
Yeah.

356
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:44,960
We'll do what you want.

357
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:45,960
Xin,

358
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:47,440
I always support you.

359
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,559
I'm going to talk to Dr. Chen.

360
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,719
Go for it!

361
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,719
They haven't talked
to each other for a week.

362
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,920
They have been in silence
for so long for the first time.

363
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,999
I thought at first
that Guan Xin would say sorry first,

364
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,719
but he didn't this time.

365
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,840
Oh, my God.

366
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,999
It's even scarier
when a nice man gets angry.

367
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,360
Of course Xia Tian
would not contact him.

368
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,160
Well.

369
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,279
Do you know
there is a tree called hard birch?

370
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,400
It's invulnerable.

371
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
It wouldn't even move
even when a bullet hits it.

372
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,160
That's how determined Xia Tian is.

373
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,440
Of course.

374
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,519
She wasn't like that
when she was in love before.

375
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,279
She was really lowly to the ground.

376
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,680
But she's different now.

377
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,319
Now

378
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,600
whoever says sorry first loses.

379
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,840
I would never believe
that Guan Xin would cheat on her.

380
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,360
There must be some misunderstanding.

381
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,640
Guan Xin was waiting for her that day,

382
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,160
but Xia Tian got on Xu Zehao's car

383
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,120
and went away.

384
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,960
Who can put up with that?

385
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,999
He is a man, after all.

386
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,120
He needs dignity.

387
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,559
And he did so without knowing

388
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,039
they were a couple before.

389
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,840
Otherwise, it would be
more than a silent treatment.

390
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,999
There must be

391
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,680
a fight.

392
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,079
I'll support Xia Tian on this.

393
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:51,519
Oh.

394
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,279
Her boyfriend
was holding another girl's hand

395
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,680
in front of her,

396
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,079
saying that they did nothing.

397
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,360
I don't believe it at all.

398
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,479
If I were her,

399
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:00,600
I would just kick him right over there.

400
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,160
I will make him pay with blood.

401
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,640
I support Guan Xin.

402
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,039
Guan Xin is just too nice,

403
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,160
too obedient to her.

404
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,680
No way.

405
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,360
She should

406
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,079
learn a lesson.

407
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,079
Say it again.

408
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,039
Which side do you choose?

409
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,880
You useless adviser!

410
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,160
You would be happy

411
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,999
if they break up, right?

412
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,319
Let me ask you.

413
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,039
No.

414
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:19,479
I didn't say it.

415
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,519
Do you know what you should do now?

416
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,160
I...

417
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:21,840
Do you know?

418
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,239
What?

419
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,479
Convince Guan Xin...

420
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,160
Convince Guan Xin

421
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,239
to call Xia Tian.

422
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,120
Do you hear me?

423
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,759
Yes.

424
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,360
I got it.

425
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,079

It's so windy here.

What were you thinking?

Nothing.

Oh, by the way.

445
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Ms. An called me

446
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,120
and asked who's
in charge of this project.

You don't have to worry about this.

Oh, Dr. Guan.

459
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,840
I am so sorry.

460
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,120
I forgot to record your phone number.

461
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Are you free this evening?

462
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,279
I'd like to meet you.

463
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,600
I don't have much time today,

464
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,160
because I have some people to meet.

465
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,120
I'm very busy with surgeries too.

466

Aren't you the boss?

467
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,999
Adjust your schedule.

Hello!

474
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,600
He hung up on me.

475
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:58,160
Well.

476
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,160
Didn't his primary school teacher

477
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,200
teach him to be polite?

478
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:03,279
Didn't his college teacher
teach him to respect others?

I'm going to see Xu Zehao.

Wait.

488
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,880
Why do you want to see him?

489
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,319
Don't tell Xia Tian.

490
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,640
Don't tell Xia Tian?

491
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,120
Tell Xia Tian?

492
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,759
Tell Xia Tian.

493
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,319
No. 35, please come in
and enjoy the meal.

and you were late.

504

I thought you said you wouldn't come.

505
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,759
I'll do it on my own.

506
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,319
You have a temper.

507
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
I asked you to come here today...

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,880
Um.

509
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,319
Let's have a drink first.

510
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,239
Don't make the rules.

511
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,719
You called me bro the other day.

512
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:16,920
Now you're impolite to me?

513
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,160
You and I cannot get along.

514
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,440
We cannot be brothers.

515
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:31,479
You are right.

516
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,360
What did you do with Xia Tian that day?

517
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,120
Why don't you ask her?

518
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,400
Oh, I see.

519
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,719
You two are still at odds, right?

520
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:43,120
It's been a week

521
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,319
since you two started it.

522
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:45,880
Well,

523
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,400
aren't you going to see
each other anymore?

524
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,799
Answer my question.

525
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,120
What do you think we could do?

526
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,759
Eat, drink, and talk.

527
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,600
Why don't you tell me

528
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,999
about your relationship with the girl?

529
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,640
There is nothing between us.

530
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,279
Really?

531
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,360
Really.

532
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,479
I love Xia Tian very much.

533
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:22,120
Xia Tian is very important to me.

534
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,200
I can't live without her.

535
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,360
The earth can still turn without anyone.

536
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,559
So do people.

537
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,559
No one can't live without anyone.

538
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,120
Xu Zehao.

539
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,759
You've never really loved anyone, right?

540
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,920
So you don't know what it feels like.

541
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,719
Don't think you knew a lot about me.

542
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,160
What is the relationship
between you two?

543
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,079
Party A and Party B.

544
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,559
We work together.

545
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,519
Didn't you say you like her?

546
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,680
I did,

547
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:57,999
but now I might not.

548
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,759
That's pretty casual of you.

549
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,559
I am not like you.

550
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,920
I love Xia Tian very much.

551
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,279
And if she lies,

552
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,039
I'll pretend to be fooled.

553
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,719
If she wants to win,

554
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,519
I will let her win.

555
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,999
Making Xia Tian happy

556
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:15,840
is the most important thing to me.

557
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,079
Why are you telling me this?

558
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:21,079
It doesn't matter how you think.

559
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,799
You are free to like her.

560
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,759
All I care about is how Xia Tian thinks.

561
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,079
In the past,

562
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,279
she would never

563
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,519
make a fool of me in front of others.

564
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,400
Xu Zehao.

565
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,279
Open the door.

566
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,519
There's never been
a third person between us.

567
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,120
In a situation like that night,

568
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,239
she would get out of the car
and argue with me.

569
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,120
But just because of you,

570
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,319
it's like everything has changed.

571
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:50,759
You seem to know her well enough

572
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,799
that she can confess her feelings

573
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,559
to you

574
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:54,759
without any burden.

575
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,479
Looks like

576
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,319
you do care

577
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,400
that I work with her.

578
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,999
So

579
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,600
I came here today to tell you.

580
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:20,039
Please stay away from Xia Tian

581
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,999
and stay out of our relationship.

582
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,759
Are you begging me?

583
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:28,759
Then maybe you should be more honest

584
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:29,719
and formal.

585
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:31,239
I'm not begging you.

586
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,559
I'm warning you.

587
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:37,559
What if I say no?

588
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,600
What would you do?

589
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
I'm not a troublemaker,

590
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:43,519
but I'm not afraid of being one.

591
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:45,360
I don't know

592
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:48,960
what would happen.

593
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,559
Okay.

594
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,799
I am waiting here.

595
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,360
(Xia Tian)
(I really miss you.)

596
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:26,360
(I want to talk to you!)

597
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:32,559
(I know you're still mad at me.)

598
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:58,728
(Xia Song Studio)

599
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,960
(Donghao)
(Guan Xin went to see Xu Zehao.)

600
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,880
(And he waited at the door
and told me not to tell you.)

601
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:52,239
(Isn't that he wanted me to tell you?)

602
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,920
They're going to meet?

603
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,079
(I'd better not ask Guan Xin directly.)

604
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:09,096
(Xu Zehao)

605
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,200
(Xu Zehao, why did you
ask Guan Xin out for dinner?)

606
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,479
Keep it down.

607
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:28,799
You really think
I can be easily bullied?

608
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,559
Why would I ask your boyfriend out?

609
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,559
He invited me.

610
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,360
Besides,

611
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,880
if you want to know

612
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
what we talked about,

613
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
go ask him yourself.

614
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,360
Do you really think I am an airfone?

615
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,039
That's it, bye.

616
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,999
So annoying.

617
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:44,999
Taking turns to annoy me.

00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,200
(I am sorry.)

619

(I didn't mean to yell at you.)

620

(There's something I need to ask you.)

621

(Can you come to the studio?)

622
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,279
Do you think you got me?

623
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,079
Silly girl,

624
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,400
you just wait there by yourself.

625
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,999
I won't go there today.

626
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,880
Please turn round.

627
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
To where?

628
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,319
Binhai Road.

629
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,759
Okay.

630
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:21,400
Wait.

631
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,960
Pull over somewhere ahead.

632
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:24,759
Let me think.

633
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:26,799
I'll stop here.

634
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,200
Um.

635
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,079
Calm down.

636
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,279
Xu Zehao.

637
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:44,640
Be determined.

638
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,279
You're not on call

639
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,519
at any hour.

640
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,039
Be firm.

641
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,319
Be determined.

642
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,920
Be steady.

643
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,079
A no is a no.

644
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:57,880
Calm down.

645
00:32:58,999 --> 00:32:59,400
Be firm.

646
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:02,840
Be firm.

647
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,160
Sir,

648
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,920
go to the first place I said.

649
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,519
If

650
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,479
I tell you

651
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,759
to go to Binhai Road on the way,

652
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,400
you just ignore me.

653
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:24,719
Okay.

654
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:25,759
Even if I beg you.

655
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:26,719
Um.

656
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:34,840
Calm down.

657
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,559
Be firm.

658
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,840
Here you are.

659
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,360
Hello?

660
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,679
You arrived.

661
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:14,479
Okay.

662
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:15,519
Um.

663
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,039
Well,

664
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,639
how much is the double rate?

665
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:18,440
Oh.

666
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,559
That's not a double of a double.

667
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,679
That's a double
of a double of a double.

668
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,079
We already arrived at your home.

669
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,039
And we are here now.

670
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:26,519
You've made me do a couple of turns.

671
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,039
Well...

672
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:30,920
Please wait for me down here.

673
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,800
I'll be back in a minute.

674
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:33,679
Okay.

675
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:34,440
Take your time.

676
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,240
Ay.

677
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,320
He was just tossing about.

678
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,199
He could save some money if he decided
to come here in the first place.

679
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,920
Why is he here now?

680
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,159
He likes her and looks for a chance.

681
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:58,039
But relationship is all about

682
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,400
place, timing and people.

683
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,079
She has a boyfriend.

684
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,840
It would be difficult.

685
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:11,816
(Xia Song Studio)

686
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,639
So you're sure

687
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,519
that I will be here, right?

688
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,599
Stop laughing.

689
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
What's so funny about it?

690
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,840
What kind of wood will be used
for the furniture this time?

691
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,320
Hinoki wood.

692
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,999
Love forever.

693
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,679
So you still remember?

694
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,559
You recited it in front of me
every day back then.

695
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:48,599
I could not forget it.

696
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,440
What a pity.

697
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,960
There is nothing

698
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,639
in this world that is forever.

699
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,880
As long as you try hard.

700
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,679
Don't you think we tried hard enough?

701
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,479
We were too young at the time,

702
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,999
always thinking that being together
means liking each other.

703
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,760
We would be happy
just by meeting each other every day.

704
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,240
It looked childish

705
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,639
when I thought back after the breakup.

706
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,199
How can impulsive moments

707
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,599
get us far?

708
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,840
So, actually

709
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,880
we could have gone a lot further.

710
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,440
Right?

711
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,479
Who knows?

712
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,720
Maybe neither of us

713
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,679
had the willpower to sustain the love.

714
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,920
We only liked each other,

715
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,360
but did not know how to love,

716
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,400
how to maintain the relationship,

717
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,720
and how to sustain the relationship,

718
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:41,479
so we broke up.

719
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,320
So,

720
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,119
why did you show up in front of me

721
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,199
when I didn't know anything?

722
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,119
At that time,

723
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,999
I didn't understand your kindness to me,

724
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:00,599
and didn't know how to be kind to you.

725
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,159
I wish I could

726
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,559
switch with someone right now.

727
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,559
If you were with me now,

728
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,159
I would

729
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,760
hold you in the palm of my hand,

730
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:16,920
cherish you,

731
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,800
love you,

732
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,880
and will never let you be wronged.

733
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,400
You got drunk?

734
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,280
You want to know about him, right?

735
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,880
Um.

736
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,280
So what exactly did you talk about?

737
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,479
If you're not going to talk,

738
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,920
you can go now.

739
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,440
Why do you always

740
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,760
show ill temper in front of me?

741
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,519
You don't want to ask him,
so you ask me.

742
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,440
What makes you so sure
I'm going to tell you?

743
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,479
So,

744
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,280
are you going to answer that or not?

745
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,599
I took an oath before I came here.

746
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,039
I'm not going to answer that.

747
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,960
Let's just call it
my personal integrity.

748
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:20,479
Then why are you here?

749
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,240
What do you think?

750
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,320
