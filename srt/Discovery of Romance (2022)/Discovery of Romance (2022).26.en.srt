00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:30,800
Hello.

20
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:44,000
Hello.

21
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,720
Welcome to Xia Song Studio.

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,160
Well...

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,640
I saw the recruitment information.

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
So I want to ask

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,399
if you still need an assistant.

26
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:52,600
We do.

27
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:54,600
Well...

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,919
I don't have any experience
in design though.

29
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,160
You can fill out a form first.

30
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,720
You can see if you fit the job.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,160
Okay.

32
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:05,679
Thank you.

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,640
Take a seat.

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:07,999
Okay.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,800
Do you want some coffee?

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,559
Yeah.

37
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,640
Thank you.

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,520
Well...

39
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,080
It might sound intruding but...

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,999
Actually, I was here to buy a chair

41
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,040
a couple of months ago.

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,879
Do you remember?

43
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,719
I guess.

44
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
It's okay if you don't.

45
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,320
I want to ask

46
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,640
if you have a boyfriend.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,640
What?

48
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,399
I live nearby.

49
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:06,839
I've been observing for some time.

50
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,640
I don't think you have one, do you?

51
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,839
I don't.

52
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:15,679
So...

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,320
How about me?

54
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,240
But I just broke up a while ago.

55
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,800
That's good.

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,480
I'm single too.

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,320
Do you know me?

58
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,520
When I first met you,

59
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,240
I liked you a lot.

60
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,439
I want to know you better

61
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,559
because I like you.

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,159
But I'm the one who got dumped.

63
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,999
Because I cheated.

64
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,159
Is it okay?

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,480
I'll take the form back
to have a better look.

66
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,520
Thanks for the coffee.

67
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,239
It's been a year.

68
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:34,039
Now I realize,

69
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,440
whether it was madness,

70
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:38,919
guilt,

71
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,359
or regret,

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,719
they are just part of love.

73
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:50,640
I'm happy

74
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:52,440
to have met you again.

75
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,120
So am I.

76
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,080
Take care.

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,839
Take care.

If she turned around that day,

81
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
things would probably be different now.

(and cried for hours.)

84
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:38,359
I was thinking,

85
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,479
if he ran after me,

86
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,200
held my hand,

87
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,479
and told me to go with him,

88
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,479
I would probably go anywhere with him.

89
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,239
I don't know how long I've stayed there.

90
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:56,919
I think it was dark

91
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,120
when I left.

92
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,399
I got drunk once after that,

93
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,799
and I called him.

94
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,560
I just want to ask what you are doing.

95
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,200

Don't flatter yourself.

100
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,680
I just want to tell you.

101

Thanks to you,

102
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,839
I won the ADA.

Just say it was Guan Xin.

Why cover it up?

152

Since you don't mind,

I'll tell you the truth.

Guan Xin is still wearing his ring.

I really don't understand women.

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,000
I thought

160
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,440
I've been around her for thirty years,

161
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,440
and I would know her well.

162
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,039
But that's not true.

163

A year into our relationship,

164
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,919
I realized that

even though she's still so cute

166
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,320
and a little sexy,

167
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,160
but she's too clingy.

168
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,519
What about your roommate?

How is she?

171
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:41,999
If she asks about me,

172
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,560
you have to tell her

173
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,040
that I'm having
the best time of my life,

174

Be honest with me.

176
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,599
Do you miss her?

177
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,119
Call her if you miss her.

178
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,519
Don't hold it in.

179
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,879
I don't.

180
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,040
I understand one thing

181
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,400
for my relationship with her.

182
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,040
What is it?

183
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,359
There are many things you can achieve

184
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:10,080
by working hard.

185
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,680
But love is not one of them.

186
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,920
You can't work hard

187
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,639
to make someone who doesn't love you

188
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,040
love you.

189
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,920
There is no reason in love.

190
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,839
It's just like

191
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:29,440
a fate.

192
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,879
(Unbounded Space Design Firm)

193
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,960
These are the sample works

194
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,080
from these companies.

195
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,400
Any thoughts?

196
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,239
They are no good.

197
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,999
Mediocre design.

198
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,280
Why didn't you just
go for Xia Song Studio?

199
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:55,080
Xia Tian's design is so much better.

200
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,519
Right.

201
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,719
Xia Tian and Song

202
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:58,839
are so close to us.

203
00:09:58,839 --> 00:09:59,879
It's easier to communicate.

204
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,080
Because

205
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,280
I was in a relationship with Xia Tian.

206
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
And we broke up.

207
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:10,680
So we can't work together.

208
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Everybody knows that.

209
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,359
You worked pretty well
on the guesthouse project.

210
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,119
Every...

211
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,719
Everybody knows that?

212
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:19,759
Yeah.

213
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:24,999
Enough.

214
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,680
We have to look for a business partner

215
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,160
by the standard of Xia Song Studio.

216
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:29,400
Anything else?

217
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,960
We had a meeting about it.

218
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,479
The living room, dining room and kitchen

219
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,359
will be on the first floor.

220
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,800
Your bedroom on the second floor.

221
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,119
The study and fitness room on the third.

222
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,839
Oh.

223
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,359
There will be some free space

224
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,920
in the balcony on the west side.

225
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,920
So we advise you

226
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,599
to turn it into a garden

227
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,519
or a place to have afternoon tea.

228
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,839
Sounds good.

229
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,320
What about the basement?

230
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,160
Well...

231
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,719
We advise you

232
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,639
to make it an art studio

233
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,719
based on your own interest.

234
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,999
You like to paint, right?

235
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,160
That's thoughtful.

236
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,119
You even know my hobbies.

237
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,200
That's our job.

238
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,239
Thank you.

239
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:19,680
But...

240
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,440
Actually,

241
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,839
I already have an art studio.

242
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,800
Maybe we can make some other use of it.

243
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:29,920
Other...

244
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:30,960
Like what?

245
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,280
Mr. Xu.

246
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:35,440
Do you like wine?

247
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,639
I...

248
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,400
I guess.

249
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,800
I don't quite follow.

250
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,280
If you like wine,

251
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,999
I think we can turn it into a cellar.

252
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,560
They are both fine.

253
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,200
This is your decision to make.

254
00:11:58,479 --> 00:11:59,119
By the way,

255
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,119
as for furniture,

256
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,320
we haven't found

257
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,519
a suitable supplier yet.

258
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,080
So...

259
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,440
Oh.

260
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,719
I already dealt with that.

261
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,440
I want wood furniture
all around the house.

262
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,800
This designer I found

263
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,119
has won the ADA award.

264
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,040
Oh.

265
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,759
Good.

266
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:13,800
I was just thinking

267
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,040
that wood furniture

268
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,800
would match your personality

269
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,839
and lifestyle.

270
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,960
That's it then.

271
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:25,879
Mr. Xu.

272
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,839
Do you have time later?

273
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,800
Maybe we could

274
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,879
have a drink together.

275
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,400
I have a meeting later.

276
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,080
Maybe next time.

277
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,239
Next time...

278
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:40,920
Fine then.

279
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,759
I was thinking that if you do have time,

280
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,879
I can postpone the meeting
with the supplier.

281
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,560
But well, maybe next time.

282
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:49,479
Yeah.

283
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,320
Sorry for that.

284
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,560
Next time,

285
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:53,440
I'll buy you drinks.

286
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,479
Promise?

287
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:54,800
Yeah.

288
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,519
Promise.

289
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,040
Okay.

290
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:58,040
I'll be on my way then.

291
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,200
Yeah.

292
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,080
Bye.

293
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:00,920
Bye.

294
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,479
Here.

295
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,920
You look different today.

296
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,359
Really?

297
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,160
Probably because
I paid extra attention to

298
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,560
my skin lately.

299
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,479
Thank you.

300
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:57,960
I mean you have a nice glow.

301
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,200
Is there a guy?

302
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:03,879
I guess so.

303
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,759
Take a look.

304
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,839
This is the space design

305
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,080
from the company I hired.

306
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:12,960
(Unbounded Space Design Firm)
You can design the furniture based on this.

307
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,639
It's good, right?

308
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,639
I can see they put
a lot of work into it.

309
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,680
And they know you well.

310
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,440
Let me tell you.

311
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,599
This was designed

312
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,479
by the owner of the company.

313
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,479
He's very professional

314
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,759
and thoughtful.

315
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,080
We've come back and forth a dozen times

316
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,239
just for this plan.

317
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,839
He made no complaints.

318
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,639
And the point is

319
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,680
he's so handsome.

320
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,040
I checked.

321
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,359
He's single.

322
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,160
For someone so handsome?

323
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:56,599
He will have one soon.

324
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,800
Hello.

325
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,839
One udon noodle, please.

326
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,200
Hello.

327
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,999
There are seats at the counter.

328
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,960
I'll have this one.

329
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,359
Thank you.

330
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:12,920
Okay.

331
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,320
(I can't believe I met him again)

332
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,560

336
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:28,719
(Unbelievable.)

337
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,239
I didn't expect you to come here.

338
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,839
You are here too.

339
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,719
I have work to do nearby.

340
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,280
Do you think I came on purpose?

341
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,479
So do I.

342
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,719
Who knows
what kind of thing you're into?

343
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:45,719
You never let go of the past.

344
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:48,680
Hello.

345
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Two udon noodles.

346
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:04,519
Oh, I should wear it
on my ring finger now.

347
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,359
I forgot all the time.

348
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,759
Aren't you curious how Xia Tian's doing?

349
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,839
I'm not.

350
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,239
I'll send you invitation

351
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,239
when we hold the wedding ceremony.

352
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,759
What's your address?

353
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,999
Why did you put so much vinegar in it?

354
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,040
I'm done.

355
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,200
(What am I doing?)

356
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:08,960

and talk about it.

379
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,680
Otherwise we'd have to
wait for the furniture

380
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,880
after the space design is done.

381
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:00,999
That'll drag on for too long.

382
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:01,360
Okay.

383
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,279
No problem.

384
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,160
Xia Tian.

385
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,999
Let me introduce.

386
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,960
This is the boss of the design company.

387
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:22,880
Mr. Xu.

388
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,160
Hello, Mr. Xu.

389
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:25,680
Hello.

390
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,519
Xu Zehao.

391
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,279
And this is

392
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,279
my furniture design friend,

393
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:29,920
Xia Tian.

394
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:31,719
Hello.

395
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:32,400
I'm Xia Tian.

396
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,920
I've seen your plan.

397
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
There's not any big problem,

398
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,680
except that I wanted
a cabinet in the kitchen

399
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,479
for small size electrical appliances.

400
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,440
But now the refrigerator is too big

401
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,759
and takes too much space.

402
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,400
So,

403
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,640
I think maybe we can
put the fridge in the living room.

404
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,239
If it's for practical reasons,

405
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,079
I suggest we push the wall back
for forty centimeters.

406
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,999
This way we can make room

407
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,440
for the fridge.

408
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,360
What do you think?

409
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,200
Mr. Xu can make the decision.

410
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,039
Anything you say.

411
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,999
In the future,

412
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,759
you may have the chance
to live there as well.

413
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,519
Sorry.

414
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,719
I got it.

415
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:21,360
I'll talk with Mr. Xu
about every detail.

416
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,039
So I'm designing your love nest.

417
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,079
Xia Tian.

418
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,519
Don't embarrass me.

419
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,279
You know I'm always straightforward.

420
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,840
I've made my intention clear.

421
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,400
Now it's up to Mr. Xu.

422
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,680
I...

423
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,840
I think we can discuss this

424
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,279
next time.

425
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,279
Oh.

426
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,759
This is for you.

427
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,039
For me?

428
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,440
This is a small gift

429
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,640
from our company.

430
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:54,400
Thank you.

431
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,400
It's about time.

432
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:58,640
Um.

433
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,319
Mr. Xu.

434
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,479
Do you have time?

435
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,799
We can have dinner together.

436
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,559
Okay.

437
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,640
I know

438
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,479
there's a good hotpot restaurant nearby.

439
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,600
Are you okay with it?

440
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:10,680
Of course.

441
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,759
I'm okay with anything.

442
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,160
So now...

443
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:13,680
Let's go.

444
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,120
Okay.

445
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,799
Excuse me.

446
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,120
I haven't had dinner either.

447
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,120
Do you mind?

448
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,479
I'll have...

449
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,880
Shrimp balls.

450
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,200
Crowndaisy.

451
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,799
Waxgourd.

452
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,440
Okay.

453
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
What would you like?

454
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,999
- Cattle stomach.
- Cattle stomach.

455
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,880
Cattle stomach.

456
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,120
Okay.

457
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,400
What about sauce?

458
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,440
Sesame sauce for him.

459
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,400
Right, Mr. Xu?

460
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,799
Yeah.

461
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,559
Right.

462
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,120
I want oil, coriander and pepper.

463
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,120
Thank you.

464
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:06,319
Mr. Xu.

465
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,920
Anything you want especially?

466
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,039
He only eats cattle stomach.

467
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,640
Right, Mr. Xu?

468
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,479
What about drinks?

469
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,319
Two bottles of beer.

470
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:20,999
Original.

471
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:22,960
Right?

472
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,600
You two...

473
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:28,960
Oh.

474
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,880
We...

475
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,840
We are in the same business.

476
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,279
So we might have
had meals together before.

477
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,479
Perhaps.

478
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:44,640
Waiter.

479
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,239
Ready to order.

480
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:50,640
Here.

481
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,239
Have some.

482
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:57,880
Hey.

483
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,640
Mr. Xu.

484
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,319
How can you drink alone?

485
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:02,640
The three of us.

486
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,479
Cheers.

487
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,840
Okay.

488
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,160
(Why isn't she wearing her ring?)

489
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:16,600
Mr. Xu.

490
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,440
What do you like to do

491
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:20,559
when you are not working?

492
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,079
Oh.

493
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:23,719
I do some sports.

494
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,079
Sports?

495
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,160
Hey.

496
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,640
I really like diving.

497
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,440
Especially boat diving.

498
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,319
I can rent a yacht some time.

499
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,440
We can go sea fishing together.

500
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,640
Great.

501
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,279
Sounds nice.

502
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,079
But I really don't have much experience

503
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,440
in diving.

504
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,400
It's okay. I can teach you.

505
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,160
He doesn't dive.

506
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,880
He only climbs mountains.

507
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:46,840
Right, Mr. Xu?

508
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,279
Hey.

509
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:55,600
What about

510
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,360
movies?

511
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,319
What genre of movies do you like?

512
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,440
Does skin flick have genres?

513
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,519
I thought there are only
different nationalities.

514
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,239
Hey.

515
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,200
What do you want?

516
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,239
You said it yourself.

517
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,680
You downloaded all three episodes

518
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,400
of your favorite series
on your computer.

519
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,999
Nonsense.

520
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:10,999
What three episodes?

521
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,680
There are only two.

522
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,840
You two know each other?

523
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,640
Yeah.

524
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,759
For a while now.

525
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,079
Not really that long.

526
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:21,680
Only...

527
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,039
11 years.

528
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,759
We were a couple
in the first five years.

529
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:26,920
Right, Mr. Xu?

530
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,840
Do I remember it right?

531
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:36,999
Thanks for your gift.

532
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,360
I don't need it.

533
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,960
Enjoy.

534
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,160
Bye.

535
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,880
Hey.

536
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:56,400
What do you want?

537
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,559
Do you have to embarrass me like that?

538
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,120
It's obvious that she's not your type.

539
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,319
Who said that?

540
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,680
She's exactly my type now.

541
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,360
I like this type so much.

542
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,039
I love it.

543
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:04,960
Ay.

544
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,719
Enough.

545
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
I messed it up. So what?

546
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,680
Take it as I screwed up
one of your relationships.

547
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,319
You screwed up mine too.

548
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,719
We are even now.

549
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,079
You can't always win.

550
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,680
What are you talking about?

551
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:17,719
You are getting married, aren't you?

552
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,120
If so,

553
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,479
you just live your life

554
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,719
and leave others alone. Okay?

555
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,559
Seriously,

556
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:22,960
now I'm so grateful

557
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:25,479
that you broke up with me.

558
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,880
Thank you so much for letting me go.

559
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,120
And,

560
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,719
this is your wedding gift.

561
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:30,680
Have a happy life.

562
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,479
I remember you told me

563
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,920
how to love someone is important.

564
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,279
Yes.

565
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,719
The way to love a person is important.

566
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,519
But first, you need to love them.

567
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,160
Love them first,

568
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,920
and the skills come next.

569
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,039
I used to believe that.

570
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,279
I still believe that now.

571
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,960
And I will continue to
believe that in the future.

572
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,559
What exactly am I going to tell you?

573
00:25:59,319 --> 00:25:59,880
I hope you

574
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,360
live a good life

575
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:02,759
with a heart that loves someone.

576
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,200
You two are moving out?

577
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,079
Don't.

578
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,680
We've been together for so many years.

579
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,759
You can't leave me here alone.

580
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:36,519
Hey.

581
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,400
It's not our stuff.

582
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,719
You are throwing me out?

583
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,400
My mom left me the house.

584
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,239
I don't think that's appropriate.

585
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:46,360
It's not your stuff, either.

586
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,239
It's from Guan Xin.

587
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,479
Ay.

588
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,319
I'll tell you.

589
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,479
Guan Xin is leaving tomorrow.

590
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,559
He asked us not to tell you.

591
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
He won't let us see him off.

592
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,640
Got it?

593
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:00,360
Let's go.

594
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,999
How long will you be away?

595
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,600
Maybe a year.

596
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:50,840
Will you come back?

597
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,880
Will you wait for me

598
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,120
if I say yes?

599
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,479
Guan Xin.

600
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,759
After the breakup,

601
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,239
I owe you an apology.

602
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:14,279
So I came here

603
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,120
to say it to you.

604
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,759
I'm sorry, Guan Xin.

605
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,360
Xia Tian.

606
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,039
Do you know

607
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,400
during the time I spent with you,

608
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,079
I wasn't happy?

609
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,600
And I didn't feel safe.

610
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,160
I was always hiding my insecurities.

611
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,920
I want more love from you.

612
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,960
I was so tired.

613
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
I always wanted

614
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,039
to separate He Xuan
from Guan Xin's body.

615
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,479
I didn't dare to face the true self.

616
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,120
I always thought

617
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,319
I could make up

618
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,960
the emptiness in my heart

619
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,279
once I had you

620
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,999
and a complete family.

621
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,319
But then I realized I was wrong.

622
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,400
You don't give me happiness.

623
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,960
I can only find true happiness

624
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,360
when I can face the true self.

625
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,559
Be happy.

626
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,319
No matter who you're with.

627
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,360
Take care.

628
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:40,519
Take care.

629
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,279
Yeah, I'm here.

630
00:29:58,719 --> 00:29:59,640
A blue coat?

631
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,239
Okay.

632
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,039
I can find her.

633
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,759
After witnessing so many people's love,

634
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,120
it's finally my turn.

635
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:05,960
Follow me.

636
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,319
Hello.

637
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,600
Hello.

638
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,759
You didn't expect to see me, right?

639
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,600
Sit down.

640
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:32,840
Wow.

641
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:33,759
You changed so much.

642
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,920
I barely recognized you.

643
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,719
Probably because
I finally have my own works.

644
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,279
Popularity does this to people.

645
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,079
Do you read?

646
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:43,759
This is for you.

647
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:44,759
Oh.

648
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:45,840
You published a book?

649
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,319
I'm pretty busy with work.

650
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,039
I don't really read much.

651
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,440
Even less

652
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,400
with romance novels.

653
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,960
Have a look.

654
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,479
Discovery of Romance?

655
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,319
Mr. Xu from a construction company.

656
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,640
Miss Xia from a woodwork studio.

657
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:02,519
And a plastic surgeon Mr. Guan.

658
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:05,319
You wrote about...

659
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,559
Oh.

660
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,479
I see.

661
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:10,999
Okay.

662
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,319
I will read this book.

663
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,719
But why did you write this story?

664
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,680
I was just collecting materials

665
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,239
for my vlog videos.

666
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,759
But I accidentally witnessed everything.

667
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,600
People who dumped others get dumped too.

668
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,519
People who got dumped also dump others.

669
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:27,880
We are all bad people

670
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,400
to some extent.

671
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,799
But we also get consolation.

672
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,319
That's what love is.

673
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,319
There's no right or wrong.

674
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,079
Life too.

675
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,600
That makes sense.

676
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:41,559
What's the ending?

677
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:44,440
Miss Xia dumped two people.

678
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,960
She should at least choose one.

679
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,400
Maybe there's a sequel.

680
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:49,799
Maybe...

681
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,680
There's a twist.

682
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,759
As parents,

683
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,039
we can't just

684
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,719
watch our children's life.

685
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,960
We need to have our own life.

686
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:02,559
Watch you?

687
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,319
Watch me.

688
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,960
Boring.

689
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,400
Let's go.

690
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,920
Let's do our own thing.

691
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,799
A grownup now, huh?

692
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,400
Yeah.

693
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,519
What are we going to do?

694
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:16,279
Let's go.

695
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:16,799
Enough.

696
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:18,759
It looks good.

697
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,719
It's really...

698
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,479
Who left the flowers?

699
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:40,360
(Grave of Xia Tian's Father)
This is strange.

700
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:46,120
Your daughter is here to see you.

701
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,239
It's been six years.

702
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,440
She finally straightened things out.

703
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:58,260
(Grave of Xia Tian's Father)

704
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:01,999
Sorry, dad.

705
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,110
(Grave of Xia Tian's Father)

706
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,759
I'm here too late.

707
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
I'll visit you often from now on.

708
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:10,880
I have something to tell you.

709
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:12,759
I'm getting married again.

710
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,920
I decided

711
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:18,440
to live with Jianmin.

712
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,039
Xia Tian will come to see you.

713
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,640
Me, not necessarily.

714
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,680
Isn't it strange to come to see you

715
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,999
when I'm living with another man.

716
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,759
For those years we've lived together,

717
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,479
thank you.

718
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,079
I know I'm not a saint.

719
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,920
But I didn't wrong

720
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,999
our marriage.

721
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,719
But I have no intent

722
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,120
to live the rest of my life like this.

723
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,640
If I meet you over there one day,

724
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,120
it's okay to pretend

725
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,759
that we don't know each other.

726
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:06,400
Goodbye.

727
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,800
I haven't even got married once.

728
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,800
And now you're getting married again?

729
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,240
You...

730
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,400
Stop overreacting.

731
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,280
This is my choice.

732
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,960
End it when it needs to end.

733
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,559
Don't feel sorry for men in the past.

734
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,880
Don't linger on.

735
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,639
You're not obligated to.

736
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,519
Your dad and I got married

737
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,320
and we had you.

738
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
That's a lot, right?

739
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,559
But it's time

740
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,440
to end everything.

741
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,679
Do you understand?

742
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,519
Ay.

743
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,199
Hey.

744
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,559
Put this in tent number one.

745
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:47,920
Okay.

746
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,119
Careful.

747
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:50,960
This.

748
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,639
Move this one.

749
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,199
Put the pomegranate

750
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,360
in tent number two.

751
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,159
Okay.

752
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:54,599
Be careful.

753
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,240
Number two.

754
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,440
Where do I put this?

755
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,720
This goes to

756
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,360
number five.

757
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,119
Put it in tent number five.

758
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:00,760
Thank you.

759
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,960
One, two, three.

760
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,599
Five.

761
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,479
Why are you here?

762
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,440
I don't know.

763
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:31,559
By chance.

764
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,119
Chance?

765
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,559
You are lying.

766
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,039
It's true.

767
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,079
I wasn't kidding.

768
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,720
I drove all the way

769
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,840
to the address you sent me.

770
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,880
I didn't know where I could meet you.

771
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,840
You spent a year at this place.

772
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,559
Was it difficult?

773
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,280
No.

774
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:54,039
Didn't I say

775
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,479
I want to see a bigger world?

776
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:56,800
Now I have seen it.

777
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,159
I realized half of my dream.

778
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,199
I'm quite happy.

779
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,119
And you?

780
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,119
Why did you come alone?

781
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,599
Didn't you get married?

782
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,559
I didn't.

783
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,599
I screwed up.

784
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,199
Did you...

785
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,119
Did you get dumped?

786
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,199
Did you?

787
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,199
It doesn't matter now.

788
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:24,440
What about you?

789
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:25,760
You have someone?

790
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:27,479
No.

791
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,519
But,

792
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,119
I had a crush on someone.

793
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,559
I didn't confess though.

794
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,720
Why not?

795
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,079
He has a girlfriend.

796
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,840
Is it not okay to love someone secretly?

797
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,559
I didn't confess.

798
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,720
Brother Xuan.

799
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,199
Huh?

800
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,199
Nothing.

801
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,800
I just wanted to do that.

802
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:20,440
I'm giving this back to you.

803
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,679
Guan Xin sent me a message.

804
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,079
He said he came across
Xu Zehao a few days ago.

805
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,720
He was still upset.

806
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,760
So he told him
that you were getting married.

807
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:30,920
So...

808
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,639
He asked me to apologize for him.

809
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:34,599
He lied.

810
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:35,880
See?

811
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,280
He's so kind.

812
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,800
After everything you've been through,

813
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,840
he still cares about your feelings.

814
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,360
As for this.

815
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,999

00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,119
Just like how we met by chance today.

862
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:24,999
Isn't it nice?

863
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,360
You mean...

864
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,199
You are pretty happy to see me?

865
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:30,240
Aren't you?

866
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,639
No, I'm not.

867
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:32,760
It took me so long to forget you.

868
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,639
Now I want a normal life.

869
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,920
I'm not plague.

870
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,440
What are you doing?

871
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,519
You are plague.

872
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:39,400
Last year I was like being sick.

873
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,240
Now I finally became immune to you.

874
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,960
But I finally wanted to start again.

875
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:48,159
Why are you so cheeky?

876
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,440
I'm telling you.

877
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:50,559
I'm going to find a girl

878
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:52,440
who's gentle and kind.

879
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,280
You...

880
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:54,360
You are terrifying.

881
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:55,800
But I am gentle

882
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,840
and kind now.

883
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,720
You want to have a try?

884
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,999
Ay.

885
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:01,039
The two of us.

886
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,240
You are not a good person.

887
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:02,920
I'm not any better.

888
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:04,199
Why don't we just make do

889
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,199
and take each other?

890
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,079
Let's not ruin anyone else.

891
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,039
We'll be doing good to the society.

892
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,199
How can you say that?

893
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,360
You are even more terrifying
than ten years ago.

894
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:14,999
Do you know that?

895
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:17,679
Never mind.

896
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,519
I'll go ruin someone else.

897
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,679
There are many good guys in the world.

898
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,079
Hey.

899
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,479
W-Wait.

900
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:26,960
Hold on.

901
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:27,800
Xia Tian.

902
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,079
I bought those earrings for you

903
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,039
with my first paycheck.

904
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:41,440
I bought you the necklace
at our first anniversary.

905
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:43,840
And this purse.

906
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,320
Our third Christmas night.

907
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,199
I bought it for you
after I stood you up for three times.

908
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:48,639
You came here prepared.

909
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:50,599
So?

910
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:52,840
You hurt me just now.

911
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,079
I'm leaving now.

912
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,280
Now I'm holding your hand.

913
00:43:58,679 --> 00:43:59,159
You can't leave.

914
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:00,599
So?

915
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:02,840
Why are you smiling?

916
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,840
What's so funny?

917
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,639
I can't smile?

918
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,119
This is not the time to smile.

919
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,039
Because I'm like myself the most

920
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,960
when I'm with you.

921
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:17,880
You can kiss me if you want.

922
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,840
Don't be shy.

923
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,360
When did I ask for your consent?

924
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,039
Look at them.
