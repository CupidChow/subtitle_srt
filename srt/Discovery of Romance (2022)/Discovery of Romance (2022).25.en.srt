So I came by to take a look.

I'll keep waiting here.

No.

I don't think you are hurting me.

just leave me

A bad relationship

133

from making your decision, right?

139
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:15,200
I noticed

140

that you are a lot tenderer now.

Is that so?

142

People change when they need to change.

143
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,359
You can't control it.

144
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,999
You can't force it.

Hey.

146
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,680
Don't always worry about
being a bad person.

147
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,680
It's always the one
trying to be a good person

148
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,040
who turns out to be the biggest evil.

is hard to forgive.

152

He needs a chance to grow up too.

You should give him the chance.

179
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Morning, Song.

180
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,519
Morning.

181
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,680
What are you doing?

182
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,920
Sit down.

183
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,320
Take a seat.

184
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,359
For me?

185
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,160
Of course.

186
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,119
Try them on.

187
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,160
Walk around.

188
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,040
These are so soft.

189
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,759
Do you like them?

190
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,719
Yes, nice.

191
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,719
The shoes.

192
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,040
Why did you buy shoes for me?

193
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,759
Song.

194
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,359
I thought about it all night.

195
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,599
This might sound very emotional.

196
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,639
But you have to hear me out.

197
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,599
Yeah.

198
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,320
After you put on these shoes,

199
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,639
you can go

200
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:20,960
wherever you want.

201
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,999
You can go to Tan Xu.

202
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,119
You can also go to Yu Hui.

203
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,719
If there's someone better,

204
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,080
you can go to him as well.

205
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,519
Because you are free.

206
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,080
You can make any choice.

207
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:33,999
Do you understand?

208
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,400
I know.

209
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,519
I can make my own choice.

210
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,719
But...

211
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,999
These are couples shoes.

212
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,680
You can also

213
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,239
come to me.

214
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,639
Where are you going?

215
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,080
Are you leaving?

216
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,119
Why do you want me to come to you?

217
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
I mean

218
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,040
I can go anywhere you want with you.

219
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,400
I know.

220
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,879
But aren't you with me right now?

221
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,960
These are couples shoes.

222
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,800
Together.

223
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,239
Together.

224
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:09,879
Understand?

225
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,200
Together.

226
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,759
For what?

227
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,400
I'll go jogging.

228
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,200
Come to me after you figure it out.

229
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,479
Oh.

230
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,239
Heads, she will come.

231
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,599
Tails, she won't.

232
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,080
She won't come.

233
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,960
She will, she will.

234
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:58,920
Ah.

235
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,800
Ah.

236
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,400
What took you so long?

237
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,599
Do you know how long I've waited?

238
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,960
Ten minutes.

239
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,719
Are you yelling at me?

240
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,680
I'm leaving.

241
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,280
No, no.

242
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,200
Let's go.

243
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,879
You gave me a pair of shoes.

244
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,200
What does that mean?

245
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,080
What do you like about me?

246
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,239
Give me three reasons.

247
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:45,800
First,

248
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,599
you are cool.

249
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,599
You are cooler and stronger than guys.

250
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:53,800
Second,

251
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,800
you are kind.

252
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,359
You always help people

253
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,400
sincerely and rightly.

254
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,719
Third,

255
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,400
you are self-consistent.

256
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,999
You know what you want.

257
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,120
So I always feel reassured around you.

258
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,400
Fourth,

259
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,239
I...

260
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,680
I like you.

261
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,559
I like you too.

262
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,479
What's wrong?

263
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,759
Ah.

264
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,759
I... You...

265
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,519
Li Donghao.

266
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,519
Oh, my God.

267
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,400
I...

268
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,880
Ah.

269
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,200
Li Donghao.

270
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,160
You...

271
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,759
Wait for me.

272
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,039
Let's welcome Ms. Wu Yun and Mr. Jianmin

273
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,039
with our biggest applause.

274
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,279
Thank you all.

275
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,400
Take a seat.

276
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,400
Our press conference begins now.

277
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,079
This book you see here

278
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,519
is a literature and documentary project

279
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,840
targeting the emotional life
of young people

280
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,039
produced by Ms. Wu Yun

281
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,200
and the prestigious documentary director

282
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:45,400
Mr. Jianmin.

283
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,600
I heard that you two are good friends.

284
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,400
How do you feel about the cooperation?

285
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:54,759
Me?

286
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,239
It was good.

287
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,400
Mr. Jianmin.

288
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,319
It was not just

289
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,519
good.

290
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,120
During our cooperation,

291
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,120
I think

292
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,039
I had a crush.

293
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,719
Tell us more, Mr. Jianmin.

294
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:12,440
What kind of crush?

295
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,239
This book is about love of young people.

296
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,559
But I think,

297
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,360
no matter you are eighteen,

298
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,960
twenty-eight,

299
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,600
or over fifty,

300
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,360
love

301
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,079
will always be fresh for us.

302
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,440
We should always

303
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,120
take the opportunity.

304
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:32,840
So,

305
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,239
I'll cut to the point.

306
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,160
Ms. Wu,

307
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,759
I think the two of us

308
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,319
can start a new family.

309
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,600
Wow.

310
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,960
Every time I talked about marriage,

311
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,400
you would pretend
that you didn't hear me.

312
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,640
Haha.

313
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,120
I have no plan to get married again.

314
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,960
Everyone knows it, and you too.

315
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,759
Why?

316
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,960
Everyone who's been
in a marriage knows this.

317
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,519
It's always the same.

318
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,239
Hope, disappointment,

319
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,319
argument, and resolution.

320
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,319
Then you force yourself to hope again.

321
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,479
And then?

322
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,279
What if you get tired of all that?

323
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,759
Endurance is what marriage really means.

324
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,559
So...

325
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,759
But look,

326
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,799
everyone lives like that.

327
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,039
We can't lose our hope

328
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,160
for fear of disappointment.

329
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
Being happy is an ability.

330
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,160
You taught everyone the ability.

331
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
But you can't lose it yourself.

332
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,680
I won't wait anymore, Ms. Wu.

333
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,559
I want to say this.

334
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,319
Will you marry me?

335
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,719
Wow.

336
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,999
Mr. Jianmin.

337
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,719
What are you doing?

338
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,200
Marry me.

339
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,440
Get up.

340
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,200
Get up.

341
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,360
Marry him.

342
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,079
I won't get up

343
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:41,799
if you don't say yes.

344
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,319

You have more than 10 thousand fans.

Wow.

365
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,759
I recommended your channel

366
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,960
to a few friends.

367
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,600
They would listen to it every night.

368
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,440
And,

369
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,600
I just asked the guys to follow you.

370
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,920
Don't burst into tears.

371

Thank you.

372
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,200
I should give you
a biggest fan certificate,

373
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,759
frame it and put it on the wall.

374
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:48,479
Sounds great.

375
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,279
Check it out. Your fans left
a lot of comments.

376
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,400
Let me see.

377
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Public recording is a good job.

378
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,960
But it doesn't pay much.

379
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
It's so admiring

380
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,440
for you to come here
without any complaint.

381

Well.

382
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,719
I want to be free,

383
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,759
and also start a new life.

384
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,440
A new life?

385
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,759
Why?

386
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,999
Did anything bad happen to you?

387
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,519
If I tell you about it,

388
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,960
you probably won't believe it.

389
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,160
Ah?

390
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,559
Because

391
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,559
it sounds like a made-up story.

Share with me then.

393

I grew up in the Charity House.

394
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,999
I had a brother

395

who took care of me a lot.

396

we separated for some reason...
