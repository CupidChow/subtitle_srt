How is she?

Um.

30

She's having a temporary fainting.

But her blood pressure has stabilized.

32

Why would this happen?

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,759
Perhaps because of
extreme stress and pressure.

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,319
Is she under a lot of pressure lately?

Oh.

I lived here until I graduated

After that,

Ay.

00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,080
I would be lying

if I say it wasn't.

140
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,120
Sometimes I would complain.

141
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
Why is life so unfair?

142
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,159
Why do I have to toil through life?

Don't you hate him?

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Hate?

148
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,680
Maybe a little.

149
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,000
But he's different.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,239
He's my family.

151
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Yeah.

152
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,320
Sometimes I would think of him.

153
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,560
I don't know if he would think of me.

154
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,239
If he's having a great life,

155
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
maybe he already forgot about me.

156
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,159
But it's fine.

157
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,359
As long as he's doing well,

158
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,080
I'm happy.

159
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:52,359
Maybe...

160
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,640
He isn't.

161
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,279
What?

162
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,479
Why?

163
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,680
Because...

164
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,279
He abandoned you.

165
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,200
No.

166
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,359
It wasn't that serious.

167
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,399
I didn't understand when I was a child.

168
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,159
But I did when I got older.

169
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,279
He was already 12 back then.

170
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:14,520
He must understand

171
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,880
what adoption means.

172
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:23,719

How old are you?

174
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:27,880
Seven.

175
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,359
Do you like me?

176
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:31,999
Brother.

177
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,639
What's adoption?

178
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,440
I didn't agree to go with her.

179
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,479
I want to be with you.

180
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,879
Xi.

181
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,080
Adoption is not as bad as you think.

182
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,999
People who are willing to adopt you

183
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,560
will also love you.

184
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,040
If you go with them,

185
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,920
your life will be better.

186
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,280
Do you know that?

187
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Are you going?

188
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,960
If you don't go,

189
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,400
I won't go, either.

190
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Maybe I would have left too

191
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,999
if I were 12.

192
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:05,719
I don't blame him.

193
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,119
Alright.

194
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,960
That's enough.

195
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,599
It's all history now.

196
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:21,719
It only bugs you.

197
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,680
What matters the most in our life

198
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,320
is happiness.

199
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,479
Right?

200
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,719
Go rest now.

201
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,280
It's late.

202
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,479
Oh.

203
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,960
The accommodation
might not be great here.

204
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,320
Everything is simple.

205
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,280
Hope you don't mind.

206
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,719
No.

207
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,560
I like here.

208
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:42,560
Really?

209
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:43,719
That's good.

210
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm going to bed then.

211
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,719
Bye.

212
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:51,280
Lu Xi.

213
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:51,920
What?

214
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:53,400
Your headphone.

215
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:54,839
Oh.

216
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,800
I forgot.

217
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,519
Bye.

218
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,160
Bye.

219
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,800
Are you asking about my scar?

220
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,320
I kept it because of my brother.

221
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,960
As long as he sees the scar,

222
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:16,999
he'll recognize me.

223
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,119
Slowly.

224
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,560
Relax.

225
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:24,040
Ah.

226
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,639
I think I'm learning it.

227
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,759
Don't let go yet.

228
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,680
Don't let go yet.

229
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,560
Come on, Xi.

230
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,479
You already know how.

231
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,639
Come on.

232
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,080
I can do it.

233
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,359
I can do it now.

234
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,359
I can ride a bike now.

235
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,999
Come on.

236
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,200
I know how to ride now.

237
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,040
Ah!

238
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,200
Xi.

239
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,280
Xi.

240
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,960
How are you doing?

241
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,160
Doctor.

242
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,359
Will her arm be fine?

243
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,080
Yes.

244
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,560
But there will be a scar.

245
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,320
She can have it removed
when she's older.

246
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,639
I'll become a doctor

247
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:26,719
and repair your scar.

248
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,479
Yeah.

249
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,400
After all, he replaced my life.

250
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,999
I don't know where he is right now,

251
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,119
but

252
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,359
he must be living a good life.

253
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,759
Miss.

254
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,800
That lady doesn't want
Lu Xi anymore, right?

255
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,920
I want to go to college.

256
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,280
I want to become a doctor
and treat Lu Xi's scar.

257
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,560
Can you help me get the opportunity?

258
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:12,879
Xuan.

259
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,080
I know what you mean.

260
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,920
I'll think about it.

261
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,999
I'll try my best to help you.

262
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:18,879
Okay?

263
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,560
Come, give it to me.

264
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:25,400
Good boy.

265
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,599
Come on.

266
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,560
Let's go.

267
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:35,119
Come on.

268
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,239
Watch your head.

269
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,239
Sit tight.

270
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:28,960
Xia Tian.

271
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,119
You're awake.

272
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,400
What do you feel?

273
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,359
Still sick?

274
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,440
Do you want something to eat?

275
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,839
You haven't eaten anything for a day.

276
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,560
Why am I here?

277
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,719
You passed out yesterday.

278
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,719
So I took you here.

279
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:45,879
I want to go home.

280
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,800
Okay.

281
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,440
When the drip is over,

282
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,759
I'll send you back.

283
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,680
Come on.

284
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,200
I'm leaving now, guys.

285
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:17,560
I'll have meal with you tomorrow, okay?

286
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:18,239
Yeah.

287
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:19,599
Say goodbye.

288
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:20,479
Goodbye.

289
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,519
Bye.

290
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:22,639
Come on.

291
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:23,800
Let's go home.

292
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:58,960
Careful.

293
00:14:59,239 --> 00:14:59,680
Come.

294
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,239
Eh?

295
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:19,920
Xu Zehao.

296
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,239
What happened?

297
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:22,960
Why was she in hospital?

298
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:25,479
You...

299
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,040
You should...

300
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,280
Xia Tian.

301
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,560
Xia Tian.

302
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:37,639
Xia Tian.

303
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
What did you do?

304
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,839
Why is she like this now?

305
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:46,119
Xu...

306
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,160
Mr. Xu.

307
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:49,359
Didn't you go to the wood factory
with Xia Tian?

308
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,359
Why did she pass out?

309
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,759
Ah?

310
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:55,719
Well...

311
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,599
She doesn't look well.

312
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,759
Let's get her in first.

313
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,160
Ah?

314
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,960
Right.

315
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Let's go in first.

316
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:10,879
Watch out.

317
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,440
Careful.

318
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,519
You can tell me now.

319
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,400
What happened?

320
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,560
The doctor said
she's under too much stress.

321
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,160
So she had a temporary fainting.

322
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,879
Look after her.

323
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:30,479
Oh.

324
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,040
Make some porridge for her.

325
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,160
She didn't eat much these two days.

326
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,200
Okay, I got it.

327
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,719
We have two doctors here.

328
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,879
It's not for you to worry about.

329
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:39,719
Mind your own business.

330
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,359
Xu Zehao.

331
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,800
Yu Hui and I will go to
the wood factory from now on.

332
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,080
Don't see her anymore.

333
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,119
You have no idea

334
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,479
how she's always on tenterhooks

335
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,839
after she met you again.

336
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,759
I regret it so much

337
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,239
that I took this project.

338
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,120
You've had a long day too.

339
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,680
Go home and rest.

340
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:34,840
I'll make some porridge.

341
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,239
You are too feeble.

342
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,200
Have some rest.

343
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:54,322
♪Cannot say it is love♪

344
00:17:55,202 --> 00:17:57,482
♪Just want to care for you♪

345
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:02,602

Just like someone did in the past.

398
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,160
This man got used to
a girl being good to him,

399
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,719
enduring him,

400
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:49,200
bearing him

401
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,120
and waiting for him.

402
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,880
At last, everything
was taken for granted.

403
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,519
Men are all ungrateful.

404
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,559
It's the burnout period.

405
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,479
I know this feeling

406
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,640
too well.

407
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:02,079
It's true that he said he liked you.

408
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,840
It's also true
that he's sick of you now.

409
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,999
The initial novelty wore out,

410
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,960
and his heart changed.

411
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,840
Even if the last few days were dull,

412
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
in those five years,

413
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,920
we at least had a lot of happy memories,

414
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,719
didn't we?

415
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,519
Are you sure
there were more happy days?

416
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,360
As I expected, even after five years,

417
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
you're still so narcissistic.

418
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:23,440
Yeah.

419
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm selfish,

420
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,319
inconsiderate,

421
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,440
a complete scumbag.

422
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,200
Yesterday,

423
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,960
I saw her being sick in the hospital.

424
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
I regret it so much.

425
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,200
When I was with her,

426
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,640
I...

427
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,759
I never really cared for her feelings.

428
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,279
But she has a boyfriend now.

429
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,479
He's very thoughtful,

430
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,999
and loves her very much.

431
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,440
He's the guy

432
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:11,600
who'll make compromises for her.

433
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,840
I never wanted to admit it,

434
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,999
but he truly is

435
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,960
better than me.

436
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,960
So,

437
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,519
should I stop this

438
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
and stay away from her life?

439
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,880
Every time I come close to her,

440
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
I seem to only bring her trouble.

441
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,759
I should just

442
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,680
watch her being happy,

443
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,719
right?

444
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,680
Xia Tian said

445
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,799
this is what an adult should do

446
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,559
with his ex.

447
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,960
So I should stay away from her

448
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,680
and wish her happiness,

449
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,079
right?

450
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,799
Y-Your phone.

451
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:40,840
Get it for me.

452
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,120
It's Ms. An.

453
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:53,999
Hello.

454
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:54,880
Ms. An.

How are you?

456
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Mr. Xu...

457
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,360
He's boxing.

458
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:00,559
Ah.

459
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,559
You will be back
the day after tomorrow?

460
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,559
I'll pick you up for sure.

461
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,880
Hehe.

462
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,400
Okay.

463
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:06,920
Goodbye.

464
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,319
That's the least I can do.

465
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,239
Yeah.

466
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:14,160
Hey.

467
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,279
Ms. An...

468
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,120
I heard it.

469
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Should I make some arrangement?

470
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:21,880
Don't bother.

471
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,840
Wait till she's here.

472
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,319
So you...

473
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,799
I forgot.

474
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,960
We have a seminar about
burn recovery tomorrow.

475
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,759
I knew he was not alone.

476
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,799
Lipstick print.

477
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:00,799
Wandao?

478
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,680
Isn't that a development zone?

479
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,799
What seminar?

480
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:20,479
Qingshan Welfare House?

481
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:22,880
Hi.

482
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,200
You scared me.

483
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,120
What are you doing?

484
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,440
What are you doing?

485
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,600
Why are you in Guan Xin's car?

486
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,440
What else?

487
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,719
Song.

488
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,920
Love makes people go crazy.

489
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,759
She's going through
her boyfriend's things.

490
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,279
Xia Tian.

491
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,600
Why are you like this now?

492
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:39,999
Huh?

493
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,559
I suspect something,

494
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,519
but I have no proof.

495
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,200
So I wanted to look for it.

496
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,360
Guan Xin lied to me again.

497
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,200
He didn't go to a seminar at all.

498
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,239
We just had a fight
and no talking for a week over Lu Xi.

499
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,239
We just cleared everything.

500
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,519
Why would he do that?

501
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:53,999
I...

502
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,759
I really don't understand.

503
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,600
Did you find any proof?

504
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,559
Yeah.

505
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,759
I kind of did.

506
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,440
But it's weird.

507
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,519
How?

508
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:05,920
Here.

509
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,479
Is Charity House a good place

510
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,880
for a date?

511
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Don't be silly.

512
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,960
If men want to cheat,

513
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,200
it doesn't matter where it is.

514
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,279
They can do it wherever

515
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,279
and whenever.

516
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:18,799
Ah.

517
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,200
Li Donghao!

518
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,920
Where are you going?

519
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:20,799
Let me out.

520
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:21,999
I can't stand it.

521
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,799
Think I'll buy that?

522
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,479
It's so stuffed here.

523
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,239
Ah.

524
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,600
I will never let you snitch on us.

525
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,719
I want to get out.

526
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:28,319
Let me go!

527
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
When did you get out?

528
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,920
I thought you were sleeping.

529
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,920
Remember to take
your temperature after lunch.

530
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,440
I was too sick

531
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,680
to fight with you yesterday.

532
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,360
Why did you lie to me?

533
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,840
You weren't at a seminar.
Where did you go?

534
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,200
I went to the Charity House.

535
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,799
Lu Xi and I went to visit
the kid who's having an operation.

536
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,759
There are so many doctors
in the hospital.

537
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,200
Why did you have to go?

538
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:05,799
Why didn't you go?

539
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,079
It'll be my turn soon.

540
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,840
Then where did you go?

541
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:11,719
I told you.

542
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,319
I was working.

543
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,799
But you didn't tell me

544
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,559
you were with Xu Zehao.

545
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,239
You didn't tell her either

546
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,759
that you were with Lu Xi.

547
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,160
Well...

548
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,039
They are the same.

549
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,079
Why do you only pick on Guan Xin?

550
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,920
You seem so familiar with Xu Zehao.

551
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,719
You don't look like
only working together.

552
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,519
Right. Xia Tian.

553
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,680
Don't go out alone
with Xu Zehao anymore.

554
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,479
And you.

555
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,120
Stay away from the guy next to Xu Zehao.

556
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,840
What's that got to do with you?

557
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,079
And you two.

558
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,160
When Xu Zehao
sent her back here yesterday,

559
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
you two looked familiar
with him as well.

560
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:44,360
That's because

561
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,920
we've been working together for so long.

562
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,799
You know Xia Tian and me.

563
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,680
We get familiar with people quickly.

564
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,360
It'd only be weird if we still
weren't familiar after all this time.

565
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:52,319
Right?

566
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,039
That'd be strange.

567
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,960
Right.

568
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,719
They were always at Xu Zehao's company,

569
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,640
as if

570
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,960
they are his employees.

571
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,559
Right?

572
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:02,759
What I don't understand is

573
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,239
we just fought over her a few days ago,

574
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,600
and you still went to see her
behind my back.

575
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:10,039
It's just an operation.

576
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,400
They could just come to the hospital.

577
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,519
Why did you have to go there?

578
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,600
Those children have no parents.

579
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:16,559
It's not a big operation.

580
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,160
But they have no one with them.

581
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,479
I can't ask them to go through
all the trouble to come

582
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,559
just because I'll operate for free.

583
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:23,840
Do you know

584
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,200
how difficult it is
for them to come here?

585
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:26,559
Xia Tian.

586
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,039
If that's the case,

587
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:28,960
then you shouldn't do this.

588
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,999
Is it really worth it?

589
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,600
Guan Xin is doing something good.

590
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,920
You can't blame Xia Tian for this.

591
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,880
So many things happened lately.

592
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,840
Xia Tian only became sensitive

593
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:39,680
because of Lu Xi.

594
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,360
So it's all my fault.

595
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,799
You can be so kind

596
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,880
and considerate to everyone,

597
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:50,519
except me.

598
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,920
Xia Tian.

599
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,319
Xia Tian.

600
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,239
You two.

601
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:07,719
Stop eating.

602
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,799
You want me to feel sorry for you,

603
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,279
right?

604
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,840
Didn't I say I have
nightmares very often?

605
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,999
I told you

606
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,120
that I would tell you when I want to.

607
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,999
I haven't told you about it

608
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:04,999
because of my mom.

609
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,039
I wouldn't be a doctor without my mom.

610
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,960
Maybe I wouldn't have met you.

611
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,920
I don't want her to be sad.

612
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,880
You care so much about everyone,

613
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,519
except me.

614
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,920
There are so many people
you need to care about.

615
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,680
I'll tell you

616
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,960
after I have a discussion with my mom.

617
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:26,120
Okay?

618
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,239
This is

619
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,039
related to her?

620
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,160
Yes.

621
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,920
You won't have to wait for long.

622
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,640
And...

623
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,279
That girl.

624
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:40,079
There's nothing between us.

625
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,600
Don't you trust me?

626
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,360
I do.

627
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,920
I know you are not that kind of person.

628
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,200
But we just keep fighting

629
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,920
over and over again.

630
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,440
If this goes on,

631
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,840
I'm afraid

632
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,039
one day we'll break up.

633
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,279
We won't.

634
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,719
Xia Tian.

635
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,719
We will never break up.

636
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:05,880
Have your lunch first.

637
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,200
Here.

638
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,519
Ah.

639
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,079
From now on,

640
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
I only care about you.

641
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,079
That's more like it.

642
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,279
What are you doing?

643
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,239

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,079
didn't he say
he would have hotpot with us?

687
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,679
Let's ask him to come.

688
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,079
Dr. Guan is busy today.

689
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,199
He has an operation.

690
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:46,920
How about this?

691
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,840
After he finished the operation,

692
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,039
we'll ask him
to treat us with a nice meal.

693
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:52,840
How does that sound?

694
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,039
Shall we ask him?

695
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,159
You prepared so much food.

696
00:35:58,479 --> 00:35:59,479
We can't finish it by ourselves.

697
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:03,999
Lili.

698
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:07,679
If Dr. Guan doesn't contact us,

699
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,639
it means he's busy.

700
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,400
It's bad to bother people.

701
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,479
Oh.

702
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:15,199
I'm just afraid he forgot.

703
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,840
Sis.

704
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,159
Just call him and ask.

705
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,240
Okay.

706
00:36:26,088 --> 00:36:27,816
(Lu Xi)

707
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,840
She said earlier

708
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,880
that we would have dinner
with the child.

709
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:51,559
Hello, Lu Xi.

710
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,360
This is Xia Tian.

711
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:54,800
How are you?

712
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,720
Not good.

713
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:57,999
Because my boyfriend
lied to me yesterday

714
00:36:57,999 --> 00:36:59,320
and went to the Charity House with you.

715
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,280
He won't be able to go anywhere today.

716
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,599
You'll have to have lunch by yourself.

717
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,920
Dr. Guan is busy.

718
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,440
Let's finish this.

719
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,639
Here.

720
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,240
Dr. Guan has a girlfriend?

721
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,679
I thought you were his girlfriend.

722
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,159
Not me.

723
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
He has a girlfriend.

724
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,199
Is she pretty?

725
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:27,519
No.

726
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,519
Is she kind like you?

727
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:30,999
No.

728
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:35,360
Then why is Dr. Guan with her?

729
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,840
I don't know.

730
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,760
Eh?

731
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,280
Ay.

732
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,960
Lili.

733
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,800
Why do you have so many questions?

734
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:41,639
Let's eat.

735
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:42,360
Here.

736
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,400
Tofu, your favorite.

737
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:43,999
Here.

738
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,119
Eat more

739
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,119
and you'll grow tall.

740
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,440
Be careful. It's hot.

741
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,840
Let's go out after breakfast.

742
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,519
Long time no see.

743
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:18,720
