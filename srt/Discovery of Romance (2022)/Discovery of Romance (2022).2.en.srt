I went to catch Guan Xin
on a blind date yesterday.

100
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:50,159
I met Xu Zehao when I did.

101
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,919
And then we took
the wrong phones by mistake.

Did you sleep with him?

I really don't know how to explain it.

112
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,080
Because

113
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,120
I don't remember anything.

It's a birthday gift from Guan Xin.

117
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,760
I just stopped by that day
and said it looks nice.

118
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,320
Now is not the time to be touched.

119
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,960
What about Guan Xin?

120
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,200
He was afraid that you will be jealous

121
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,760
and told me to explain to you

122
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,520
that the blind date
was arranged by his mother.

123
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:41,640
Look what you've done.

124
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Do you need to tell Guan Xin about it?

125
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,960
Definitely not.

126
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,359
You can't say a single word.

127
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,039
Hey.

128
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,919
Song was right about it.

129
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,599
She got drunk and
wandered around the park yesterday.

130
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,520
She was picked up by the police
and spent the night at police station.

131
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,000
It's terrifying.

132
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,560
Oh,

133
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,359
Xia Tian

134
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,760
is always confused and acts rashly.

135
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,880
Do you know?

136
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:13,200
She's really mad about you
going on a blind date,

137
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,359
so she got drunk.

138
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,359
She didn't say a word
at home this morning.

139
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,479
Don't think too much about it.

140
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,239
Are you done?

141
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,479
Let me tell you.

142
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,760
I have severely criticized
and educated her

143
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,479
at home.

144
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,080
She's feeling guilty right now.

145
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,520
We are best friends.

146
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:29,960
I would do whatever for your benefit.

147
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:32,560
You can count on me
to keep an eye on her

148
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,279
and keep her safe.

149
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,120
I see.

150
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,640
I've said everything I need to say.

151
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,560
He believes me.

152
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,880
I've been lying like that.

153
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,039
How could he possibly believe that?

154
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,359
He likes me,

155
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,960
so he just pretends to believe.

156
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,799
Don't you know him?

157
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,919
Well, it's not that bad.

158
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,599
After all, he went on a blind date.

159
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:57,799
I think he can understand.

160
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,320
That's the scariest part.

161
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,799
We're both wrong.

162
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:01,719
The one who talks first

163
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,000
doesn't make the point.

164

00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,719
(30 years ago and raising me.)

171
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:44,200
(Love you.)

172
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,080
Title.

173
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,680
Love Mask.

174
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,120
Have you noticed

175
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,479
that the current love relationship

176
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,520
is based on the disguise?

177
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,000
Like two people on a first date,

178
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,359
no matter a woman or a man,

179
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,599
each wants to make
a perfect impression on the other.

180
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,120
This man takes shower every three days.

181
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:10,039
On that day,

182
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,320
he'll make sure to wash himself clean

183
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,000
totally.

184
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,520
And this woman

185
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,120
usually can have a bowl of rice,

186
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:17,680
but she'll only
take two bites at this time.

187
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,680
And then she would say
with a satisfied smile,

188
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,560
"Well,"

189
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:23,039
"I really can't eat any more."

190
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:27,120
I think we should be honest
in our relationship.

191
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,880
Once the relationship is established,

192
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,399
everything will be exposed.

193
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,999
How awkward they will be after that.

194
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
Director Jianmin,

195
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:35,639
what do you like to do?

196
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,759
Reading.

197
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,479
Really?

198
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,239
Drinking beer.

199
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,239
Haha!

200
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
You're right.

201
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,879
Look at my daughter.

202
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,239
Look at her.

203
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,560
She's not wearing any makeup
and is in plain dressing.

204
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,320
She looks really untidy.

205
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,960
Because she needs to see her mom,

206
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
she doesn't need to hide anything,

207
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,400
and just needs to show who she really is.

208
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,719
But,

209
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,479
if she's going to see her boyfriend,

210
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,280
she never shows up as she is now.

211
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,759
She would dress up deliberately.

212
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,999
Why?

213
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:09,920
For being

214
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,280
perfect.

215
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,119
Mom.

216
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,519
My case,

217
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,800
you can use as you wish.

218
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,320
It's really my honor.

219
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,119
There is no charge for it.

220
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:21,920
See?

221
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,519
There are many different ways
that a mask woman can appear.

222
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,960
She can put on a cheeky mask
if she has to,

223
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,560
like in front of the creditor.

224
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:31,359
My daughter owed me rent last month.

225
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,800
So, she probably came here today
trying to convince her mother

226
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,680
to give her two more days.

227
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,400
Of course.

228
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,599
Selling my privacy

229
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,040
to pay for the rent

230
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,119
is not an option.

231
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,080
Won't you really give me any option?

232
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,320
Are you really

233
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,519
my mom?

234
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,519
I almost forgot if you didn't say so.

235
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,080
Okay, then I'll try to be nice.

236
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,280
Well,

237
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,479
I promise
I won't kick you out this month,

238
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,479
but I won't wait until the last day.

239
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,359
Those homeless dogs out there

240
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,479
are even cared by someone.

241
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,839
The mask woman is good at
controlling emotions too.

242
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,160
She is so slick and sly.

243
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,320
No matter how bad her own situation is,

244
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,599
she would only try every mean
to convince her mom

245
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,320
without informing her boyfriend.

246
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:09,239
So,

247
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,040
from the aspect of human nature,

248
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,639
pretending to be perfect

249
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,200
is far more important than seeming real.

250
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:18,400
But if the disguise is broken,

251
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,719
will there be any big trouble?

252
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,160
Of course yes.

253
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,119
Like now.

254
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,560
I'm just taking you for example.

255
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,599
You may want to use
your readers' letters as examples.

256
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm leaving.

257
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:31,239
Hey.

258
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,239
Is she really mad?

259
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,200
Telling the truth
will make people upset.

260
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,599
You really charge her rent?

261
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,960
Director.

262
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,639
Do you have any opinion?

263
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,440
I wouldn't charge her rent
if I were her dad.

264
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Too bad you don't have a daughter.

265
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,599
I can consider to have one.

266
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:49,639
Haha!

267
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,119
H-a-

268
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,280
p-p-y

269
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,280
B-i-r-t-h...

270
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,879
I told her that this morning.

271
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,239
(Guan Xin, what are you doing?)

272
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,719
Don't you

273
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,639
want to see me again?

274
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
No, no way.

275
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,320
How could I say that?

276
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,119
That's not my style at all.

277
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,560
What should I send?

278
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,839
(Why haven't you contacted me all day,
Dr. Guan?)

279
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,280
Do you want the puppy or not?

280
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,239
If not, I'll send it to the pet shop.

281
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,759
Why do I think it's so awkward,
no matter what I say?

282
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
What should I send?

283
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,759
You still haven't contacted
Xia Tian yet?

284
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,359
You know her.

285
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,400
This woman is so proud.

286
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,839
Just give her an out.

287
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,359
She still cares about you.

288
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,519
I know.

289
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,680
I always make the first move.

290
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,479
Xin.

291
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,280
Why could Xia Tian

292
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,960
meet a wonderful man like you?

293
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,839
Hello!

294
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:31,440
Hello?

295
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,040
Your order is at the door.

296
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,719
Order.

297
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:34,879
Hello.

298
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,440
Already?

299
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:35,999
What?

300
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,080
Oops.

301
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:37,960
Oh.

302
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:38,999
I'm sorry.

303
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:39,800
I didn't mean that.

304
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,479
I did not see you.

305
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,400
I'll pay you for this.

306
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,960
You go and change your clothes.

307
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I'm sorry.

308
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,759
Don't give me a bad scoring.

309
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm sorry.

310
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,759
I'll do it.

311
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,359
I'll do it.

312
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,040
Thank you.

313
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,680
I'll do it.

314
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,359
Hello?

315
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,599
Where is my takeout?

316
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,519
I'm just around the corner.

317
00:12:59,519 --> 00:12:59,839
I'm right...

318
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,239
I don't need it anymore.

319
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,239
I'm sorry.

320
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,639
That's okay. I'll do it.

321
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,839
You still have orders, right?

322
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,119
You can go.

323
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,960
Thank you.

324
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,800
Wait.

325
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,560
Wipe your hands.

326
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:18,584
(Guan Xin)

327
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,759
Thank you.

328

(Xia Tian's WeChat)

329
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:55,119
(Xia Tian, shall we talk?)

330
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,239
Hi.

331
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,239
Dr. Guan, hi!

332
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:46,999
Let's have dinner together.

333
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:05,999
Xia Tian.

334
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,599
I went on a blind date
because my mother wanted me to.

335
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,800
Both families know each other,

336
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,879
so I can't disgrace my elders.

337
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I wanted to explain it to you
when we were done.

338
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,359
I'm so sorry

339
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,839
to let you get the wrong idea.

340
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:19,960
What about you?

341
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,599
Is there anything you want to tell me?

342
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,920
Then

343
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,040
where did you go that night?

344
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:40,999
I need to be honest with you.

345
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,879
I checked your phone location that day.

346
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,160
I was worried about your safety,

347
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,359
but I still don't understand

348
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,680
why you were in that place.

349
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,479
Why didn't you ask me yesterday?

350
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:57,960
It was your birthday yesterday.

351
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,560
I don't want to upset you.

352
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,960
(Should I tell the truth?)

353
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,040
Sorry, Guan Xin.

354
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,239
(That's the last answer I want to hear.)

355
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,519
(I wish she had some other reason.)

356
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,960
"I'm sorry."

357
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
What are you sorry for?

358
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,879
I had the wrong phone

359
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,999
with that man you met

360
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,639
on the day you went on a blind date.

361
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,119
When I went back to him
to get my phone back,

362
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,759
I slept at his place

363
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,999
because I was too drunk.

364
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:36,719
What?

365
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,759
Because you were on a blind date,

366
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,719
I was so mad,

367
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,879
so I drank so much...

368
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,999
You should have called me
when you were drunk.

369
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,320
I thought you didn't like me drinking.

370
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,519
But you were drunk.

371
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,479
You should have thought of me first.

372
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,999
Just because I was too drunk,

373
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:52,759
I...

374
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,119
But nothing really happened between us.

375
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,080
I can guarantee that, really.

376
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,479
Just forgive me for once.

377
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,200
Is this something I can forgive?

378
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:07,880
Don't I know what you act like

379
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,479
when you're drunk?

380
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,120
You always act coquettishly
when you're drunk,

381
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,479
which is easy for people
to get the wrong idea.

382
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:12,960
Even at the first time we had a drink,

383
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,160
you got drunk in the park and...

384
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,640
That's because you went on a blind date.

385
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,319
If you didn't go on a blind date,

386
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,519
I would not drink.

387
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,880
So you think I treat everyone the same

388
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
when I am drunk,

389
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,519
right?

390
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,719
No, Xia Tian.

391
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:32,559
I didn't mean that.

392
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,840
That day at the park...

393
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,200
It was because I like you.

394
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,279
Don't you know that?

395
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,479
I know!

396
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,079
Forget it.

397
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,239
Where are you?

398
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,840
Taking a shower, my baby.

399
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,640
Oh, my God.

400
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,719
See, here.

401
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,960
Come and play.

402
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,799
Wait here.

403
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,400
Someone will pick you up in a minute.

404
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,559
It's quite good.

405
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,360
The whole family loves it.

406
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,400
Right, baby?

407
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,759
What's the matter?

408
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,920
Xu Zehao.

409
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,559
What happened between us that night?

410
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,920
How come I don't remember anything?

411
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,120
Why did I sleep in your house,

412
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,160
not even wearing any clothes?

413
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,079
Did you take my clothes off?

414
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:37,759
Take clothes off?

415
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,479
Oops.

416
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,079
Baby.

417
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,840
We can't just let someone
take your clothes off.

418
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,640
Why are you so agitated?

419
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,160
You act like
I haven't taken them off before.

420
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,880
Xu Zehao.

421
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,759
I'm talking to you
about something serious.

422
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,640
I need you to be serious.

423
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,960
I wonder if you want an explanation,

424
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,479
or an answer

425
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,559
for you to explain it to someone else.

426
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,960
I need to know

427
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,840
what happened between us that night.

428
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,479
I have to tell Guan Xin everything.

429
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,960
Aren't you going to break up with him?

430
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,279
Why am I?

431
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
He went on a blind date.

432
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
He went on a blind date!

433
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Don't you have any self-esteem?

434
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
No.

435
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,279
Because he's so nice

436
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,840
that I don't need to have self-esteem.

437
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:11,840
Right, you used to do that.

438
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,319
That's what happened
when you were with me.

439
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:14,960
He's very different from you.

440
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,279
He's so much better than you.

441
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,559
I love him so much.

442
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
It's really easy for you

443
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
to fall in love with someone.

444
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,880
Why don't you just tell him the truth?

445
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,840
The man you met at the hotel

446
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,559
is your ex-boyfriend of five years.

447
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,719
You slept with him

448
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,519
while you exchanged phones.

449
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,600
We didn't!

450
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:32,239
Keep it down.

451
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
So are you going to tell me

452
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,559
what happened between us or not?

453
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,759
Don't you know
what you act like when you're drunk?

454
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,479
You're really so confused

455
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,880
that you slept in a man's house.

456
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,079
Then why did I sleep in your bed?

457
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,719
Who knows!

458
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:54,920
You were sleeping on the couch.

459
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,319
I don't want to care about you.

460
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,279
I don't even want to look at you.

461
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,079
You should have woken me up.

462
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:04,759
I...

463
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,719
I did! Why didn't I?

464
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,920
What an elegant man!

465
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,319
Hey.

466
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,640
Just treat me like I'm a regular man.

467
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,039
Do you think I would really
let you sleep on the couch?

468
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,279
Is that who I am?

469
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,519
Then why did you wake up in the bed too
the next morning?

470
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,600
I have to sleep too.

471
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,279
But nothing happened.

472
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,600
Who do you think I am?

473
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,799
It is like casting pearls before swine.

474
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,719
Anyway, that's it.

475
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,719
I'll never see you again.

476
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:39,400
Wait.

477
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,360
The puppy.

478
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,680
Look at your master.

479
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,640
He's so mean.

480
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,200
You must be strong.

481
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,920
Don't you want to take it with you?

482
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,039
Hey.

483
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,079
Xia Tian.

484
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,120
You can't abandon your pet.

485
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,799
What kind of person do you think I am?

486
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,600
You are arrogant, selfish, and egoistic.

487
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,400
Are you done complimenting?

488
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,200
Then leave!

489
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:17,239
Baby, bye!

490
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,479
What exactly have I done wrong?

491
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,400
Why did this woman say that about me?

492
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,200
Of course he's wrong.
He's wrong about everything.

493
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:39,999
Although it sounds
petty to say so, it's true.

494
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:41,799
Excuse me.

495
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,999
Every time I bought bubble tea,

496
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:49,160
he took the first sip himself.

497
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,799
How petty this man is!

498
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Do you have any idea?

499
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,880
Do you know how particular she was

500
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,680
about her bubble tea?

501
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,559
Light sugar, cold but no ice,

502
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,600
and more bubbles.

503
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,600
Every time I drank it first,

504
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,559
I just wanted to taste

505

whether the bubble tea was done right.

many times.

Do you think I didn't put up with you?

510
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,719
I put up with you for many things too.

511
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,960
What exactly?

512
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,319
Like cutting nails.

513
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,920
Every time you cut your nails,
you wouldn't wrap them in paper,

514
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,960
but made them all over the floor, right?

515
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,120
You can just break up with
a girlfriend like that.

516
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,799
That's why we broke up.

672
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,120
You don't even know why,

673
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,319
so we have to break up.

674
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,559
You don't even care

675
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,120
why I was so upset and crying, do you?

676
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,680
You don't even care about it, do you?

677
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,039
We've been together for five years.

678
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:01,719
There might be a burnout period
after five years.

679
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,600
How can we stay passionately in love
for five years?

680
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,960
And I've been so busy lately.

681
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,279
Could you understand me?

682
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,079
Then you should do those things

683
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,840
that are more important than me.

684
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,920
What do you want?

685
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,360
Are you sure?

686
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
You know me.

687
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,759
I'm not going to
get you back if we break up.

688
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,840
I just know you too well.

689
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,719
I know you won't get me back,

690
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:37,960
so I've been afraid to say that.

691
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,200
I know that once I need to break up,

692
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,880
you're going to walk away
without even looking back.

693
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,880
But I've been holding up on my own,

694
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,759
holding on on my own,

695
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,999
and waiting on my own.

696
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,239
But that is wrong.

697
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,719
Let's break up.

698
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,920
Xia Tian.

699
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:06,960
Xia Tian.

700
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,239
Hey!

701
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,360
Maybe

702
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,719
our love faded a little,

703
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,160
but we didn't need to break up.

704
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,120
What's wrong with you?

705
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,200
Being dumped is being dumped.

706
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,279
It's something like

707
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,999
he just doesn't care about me
and I don't love him anymore.

708
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,400
If she puts it that way,

709
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,039
I have to say something.

710
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,880
Actually, I think

711
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,559
there's no need to

712
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,360
bring up the past.

713
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,120
But I have to say something
if she talks like that.

714
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,840
Do you know what she did
to get me back five years ago?

715
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,719
Why didn't you answer my call?

716
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:00,920
And why didn't you

717
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,360
answer Song and Donghao's calls either?

718
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:10,360
Do you know how hard it is
to find a phone booth?

719
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,800
I won't say breakup again.

720
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,679
I'm sorry.

721
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,639
I know it's all my fault.

722
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,360
I'm sorry.

723
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,039
I will never hang up on you again.

724
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:47,479
Xu Zehao.

725
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,840
Xu Zehao, open the door.

726
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,360
Open the door.

727
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,199
(You're the one who wants to break up.)

728
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,840
(But you made me say it)

729
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,760
(with emotional abuse.)

730
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,999
Senior.

731
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:25,440
Don't call me that.

732
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:26,999
We are partners now.

733
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,039
There is no such thing as
treating you like an acquaintance.

734
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:30,960
Well,

735
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:32,920
I have something to do.

736
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,920
Can I take a leave of absence?

737
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,599
You don't have to come to
the construction site again.

738
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,800
Having a rich family
makes people question your abilities.

739
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,880
What can you learn
when you're so careless?

740
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,199
You want to make no effort

741
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,119
and get the triumph
with your family relationship?

742
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,599
I'm learning.

743
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,800
And when did I use
my family relationship?

744
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,039
Do you want to ask them

745
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:49,880
when I worked overtime,

746
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,360
when I was absent

747
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,920
and when I left here?

748
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,880
Who are you talking to?

749
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,320
You can't have a solid relationship

750
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,360
without a solid financial foundation.

751
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,320
Think it over.

752
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,760
Make my decision again?

753
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,479
Why?

754
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,360
Fortunately, there is

755
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
no such thing as "if" in this world.

756
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,320
I don't think it's necessary.

757
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,119
I'm doing pretty well right now.

758
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,559
If

759
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,079
I can make my decision again...

760
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,280
