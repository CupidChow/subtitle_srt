I can still love you)

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,160
Wow!

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,360
Oh, my god.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,960
Our life quality has improved a lot.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,279
Smells great.

22
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,119
Guan Xin is really a nice person.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,199
Hey.

24
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:31,759
I kind of regret

25
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,880
saying bad things about him
the first time I met him.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,479
It's nice to be roommates with Guan Xin.

27
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,479
That way I can
have great breakfast every day.

28
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,279
Look at this.

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,440
Eastern plus western style.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,039
How wonderful.

31
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,399
It's useless to say so now.

32
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,919
He's getting married soon.

33
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,600
If you can make do with it,

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,279
just go live in their living room.

35
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,440
Living in the living room
is better than sharing a house with you.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm tired of eating takeout every day.

37
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:55,319
What's wrong with takeout?

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,559
This is to promote
economic and social development.

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,279
You have to think when ordering takeout.

40
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,240
You have to order
the delicious and cheap food.

41
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:04,160
You're not aware
that you are living a happy life.

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,080
Then I'll go to their house
to have dinner.

43
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,719
You order your own takeout every day.

44
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,119
Then I'll learn to cook.

45
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,200
Li Donghao.

46
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:19,839
I need you to come out.

47
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:20,999
What is it?

48
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,679
Why did you ask me out here?

49
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:30,999
It's quite cold.

50
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,679
I saw it.

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,119
What did you see?

52
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,839
I saw there's a wooden box
in Xia Tian's room.

53
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,999
It contains photos of her and Xu Zehao

54
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:54,080
and love letters from Xia Tian.

55
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:01,240
They must have been together for years.

56
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,040
They went to the cinema together.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,719
They went to the aquarium.

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,520
And,

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,040
I saw a picture of the four of you.

60
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,599
Sorry.

61
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,679
I didn't mean to.

62
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,159
It's not what it looks like.

63
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,800
You kept it from me for so long,

64
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,719
and you said you didn't mean to.

65
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,760
Li Donghao.

66
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,999
Do you take me for a fool?

67
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,279
Xia Tian thinks me as a fool,

68
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
and you too?

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,599
No.

70
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,200
You misunderstood.

71
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,439
I told Xia Tian not to say it.

72
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,240
I had no idea they'd be
working together for so long.

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,640
I wanted to keep you
from thinking too much.

74
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,999
It was a white lie.

75
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,960
Why did you let her take that job?

76
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:39,879
You've been around me for so long,

77
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,640
seeing me being uneasy

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,240
and suspicious,

79
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,240
and you were still trying
to convince me to be generous.

80
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,719
You must be glad.

81
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,399
You're glad it wasn't you.

82
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:48,839
Right?

83
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,439
You know that's not who I am.

84
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,679
I really don't know who you are.

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,480
Do you ever think of me as a friend?

86
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,360
I am your friend,

87
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,439
so I know you love her.

88
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,719
If I told you the truth,

89
00:03:58,999 --> 00:03:59,839
can you let it go?

90
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,719
You could just tell me about it,

91
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,640
come clean with me,

92
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,279
and then let her take the job.

93
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,240
It would be totally different from

94
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,999
me finding it out myself.

95
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,200
Don't you understand that?

96
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,559
Now you were all cheating me.

97
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,800
Every one of you

98
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,520
is cheating me.

99
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,799
It's been a long time
since they broke up.

100
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:22,200
They knew the boundaries.

101
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,279
How am I supposed to tell you?

102
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,440
I'm undercover every day.

103
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,000
Am I not tired?

104
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,080
You didn't tell me
because you are tired?

105
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,239
Xia Tian didn't tell me,

106
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,479
but at least you should.

107
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,159
Could you understand if I told you?

108
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,159
It really isn't what it looks like.

109
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,239
Ever since Xia Tian met you,

110
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,560
you're the only person she cares about.

111
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,520
Yeah.

112
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,520
They were in love.

113
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:45,200
You know the whole truth now.

114
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:47,799
Can you break up?

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,880
You can do it if you can.

116
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
I don't understand

117
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,640
how they could work together

118
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,839
after they broke up.

119
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,239
How could she be friends

120
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,880
with someone she loved so much?

121
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,640
Xia Tian knows what she wants.

122
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,640
If she still loves Xu Zehao,

123
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,159
she won't take your ring.

124
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,680
And now you're at this point.

125
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,719
You need to let it go

126
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,200
and get ready to get married.

127
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,799
I've tried to be generous.

128
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,760
But I can't do that now.

129
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:48,760
Where are the other two?

130
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,520
They went out.

131
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,719
Ay.

132
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,839
Did you two solve the thing?

133
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:56,960
He allowed me to take it.

134
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,279
That's really awesome.

135
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,120
Now it's perfect.

136
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:05,200
But why did he overreact like this?

137
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,839
He saw Yu Hui coming yesterday.

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,839
Why did Yu Hui come?

139
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,120
To give me
the information about the bid.

140
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,640
How did he know we are going to bid?

141
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,239
Xu Zehao again?

142
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Ay.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,680
You two have a terrible connection.

144
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
Then what I did last night...

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,479
Sorry.

146
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,320
I can't help you this time.

147
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,640
You're on your own now.

148
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,680
Do you think

149
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,640
I still love Xu Zehao?

150
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
You'd better not.

151
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,760
Then why do you think

152
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
I'm still with Guan Xin?

153
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:46,359
Because of the virtues

154
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:47,479
or my kindness?

155
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,200
I'm not as sacred as you think.

156
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,919
The only reason

157
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,159
that I choose Guan Xin now

158
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,359
is that I love him.

159
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,640
So if you change your mind,

160
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,359
would you still choose Xu Zehao?

161
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,279
Why not?

162
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,719
I would go for him immediately.

163
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,159
Or who am I going to lie to?
Guan Xin or me?

164
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,799
I can't be a puppet
around Guan Xin, right?

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,799
Woman,

166
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,640
you're playing with fire.

167
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:17,560
If we have a bullet screen in real life,

168
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,880
now the screen would
be full of insults to you.

169
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:25,359
They are back.

170
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,479
What did you two talk about?

171
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,000
Um?

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,520
Nothing.

173
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,159
About work.

174
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
I poured you a bowl of congee.

175
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,279
Have some.

176
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Which of these would you like to eat?

177
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,839
This one, okay?

178
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
How about a dumpling?

179
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,919
Let's go.

180
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,120
I'll wait for you at the door.

181
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,279
I'll be right there.

182
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,039
Guan Xin.

183
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,960
We're not going to the wedding house.

184
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,399
We're going to the aquarium.

185
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,080
Something serious happened.

186
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,560
What is it?

187
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,239
Didn't you notice something
was wrong with Guan Xin just now?

188
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,080
Um.

189
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,920
A little.

190
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,280
What did you two talk about out there?

191
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,560
Guan Xin found out
Xu Zehao is Xia Tian's ex.

192
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,960
Oh no!

193
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,999
Oh, my God.

194
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,160
This time, it's over.

195
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,560
How did he know?

196
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,440
You told him that?

197
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,239
I didn't.

198
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,400
He found it out on his own.

199
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,519
Then how did he know?

200
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,960
What about the wedding?

201
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:03,999
The wedding cannot be canceled, right?

202
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,680
What about Xia Tian?

203
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,519
He just took Xia Tian out.

204
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,160
I'm at my wit's end.

205
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,479
Leave it to fate.

206
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,920
No way.

207
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,680
I have to calm down.

208
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,960
There shouldn't be a problem.

209
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,680
Guan Xin is so nice.

210
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,719
And he doesn't seem

211
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,680
so mean

212
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,519
or petty.

213
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,080
Right?

214
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,239
And most importantly,

215
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,519
he loves Xia Tian,

216
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,920
and Xia Tian loves him.

217
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:28,879
So,

218
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:29,800
don't think too much.

219
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,639
No problem.

220
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,200
No problem.

221
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,599
There will be absolutely no problem.

222
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,479
So,

223
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,599
you can't be unfaithful in love

224
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,999
or be ambiguous
between different people.

225
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,560
In the end, it will go against you.

226
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,119
But Xia Tian is not
being unfaithful in love.

227
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,239
She's just

228
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,680
working on a project with her ex.

229
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,040
It's my fault.

230
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,639
I only see the money.

231
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,119
I'm not talking about Xia Tian.

232
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,080
I'm talking about you.

233
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,280
What's with me?

234
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,440
A like is a like.

235
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,879
A dislike is a dislike.

236
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,719
Do not hesitate

237
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,680
and make it a mess.

238
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,280
You date A, B and C at the same time.

239
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,280
Hello!

240
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,999
Tan Xu.

241
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,200
Why did you bring me here?

242
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,519
I need to go to the bathroom.

243
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,680
Follow me.

244
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:36,960
You knew it?

245
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:38,879
Why did you keep putting up with it?

246
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,200
You used to act coquettishly
in such cases.

247
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,999
So you didn't say anything the whole way

248
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,359
just to punish me, right?

249
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,479
Even if I don't know what I did wrong,

250
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,200
I'd rather let you punish then.

251
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,479
What's going on?

252
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,960
I saw the wooden box

253
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,160
in your room.

254
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,999
I wanted to put up with it

255
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,560
till the day I die.

256
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,320
But I found I couldn't do it.

257
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,920
Since you've broken up,

258
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,440
why didn't you just throw them away?

259
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,960
Why are you still keeping those photos?

260
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,239
Sorry.

261
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:47,680
Sorry.

262
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,639
Have you ever done anything wrong to me?

263
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,479
Sorry, Guan Xin.

264
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:56,040
Sorry.

265
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,599
What are you sorry for?

266
00:12:58,359 --> 00:12:59,200
Sorry, Guan Xin.

267
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,879
For what?

268
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,800
Sorry.

269
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Sorry again.

270
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,239
Do you know that every time

271
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,320
you say sorry to me,

272
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,680
I feel really upset?

273
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,320
Ever since you met that man,

274
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,119
you just kept apologizing to me.

275
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,879
I really don't want to see

276
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,200
you look guilty.

277
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,839
But what can I do?

278
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,400
I never opened that box.

279
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,519
I don't even know what you saw.

280
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,680
I was going to throw it away.

281
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,160
But I just missed
the perfect time to do so.

282
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,680
Well...

283
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,759
There's something, you know...

284
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,080
If you miss it,

285
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,839
you just miss it.

286
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,519
Sorry, Guan Xin.

287
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,080
Would you stop saying you're sorry

288
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:58,999
and stop doing things
that you need to apologize for?

289
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,280
If you still can't accept it,

290
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,839
we can take a break from each other.

291
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,999
Why can you say that so easily?

292
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,560
We're already going to get married.

293
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,879
Does your foot still hurt?

294
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,519
I'll send you back home.

295
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:53,359

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,479
To be honest,

338
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,800
this is the first time

339
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,759
that I have experienced
such a thing since I grew up.

340
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,160
I really don't know how to reply.

341
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,160
So I might as well

342
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,200
make things clear today.

343
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,239
Tan Xu.

344
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:08,920
I like you.

345
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,200
Since we started being friends,

346
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,840
I've really changed a lot for you.

347
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:21,279
I want to be better

348
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,360
because of you.

349
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,440
Thank you.

350
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,440
But,

351
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,120
I always felt

352
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,519
we are not destined.

353
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,880
When I liked you,

354
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,680
you did not like me.

355
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,400
When you like me now,

356
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,999
I get a new way
of thinking about relationship.

357
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:45,039
Sorry,

358
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,160
Tan Xu.

359
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,640
I already have a crush on someone else.

360
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:53,759
Yu Hui.

361
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:55,799
Mr. Yu.

362
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,239
You really are

363
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,759
a very, very nice guy.

364
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,079
You are very gentle,
considerate and kind.

365
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,200
And

366
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,920
you're rich.

367
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,840
We've known each other for so long.

368
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,840
And we do come to a stage

369
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,920
where we can make further contact.

370
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Right.

371
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,279
But I never

372
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:16,559
had that feeling in my heart,

373
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,079
which can make me

374
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,160
take another step forward.

375
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,880
Do you get me?

376
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:21,960
Take another step forward?

377
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm sorry.

378
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,519
I may have been a little direct.

379
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,920
But I still want

380
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,999
that impulse of love,

381
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,400
a feeling that can
make my heart beat fast.

382
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,239
I'm sorry.

383
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,999
I'm done.

384
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:41,999
Song.

385
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,960
I think there's been
some misunderstanding between us.

386
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,440
After all, we've known
each other for 10 years.

387
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:48,440
We like each other, don't we?

388
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:49,880
I admit

389
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,680
that I've done a lot of things

390
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,799
that made you feel bad about.

391
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,999
So please give me a chance
to make it up to you.

392
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,440
Can we start over as friends?

393
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,519
Song.

394
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,920
All you've ever seen

395
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,759
about me is at work.

396
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,160
If you'd like to spend
a little more time

397
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,360
to get to know me more,

398
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,960
and see me in private more,

399
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,479
maybe you'll get

400
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,279
that impulse of love.

401
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,880
Give me a chance, okay?

402
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,279
You guys are crazy.

403
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,440
She said she doesn't like you.

404
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,400
Didn't your teacher ever teach you

405
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,519
not to touch a girl's hand?

406
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,559
Then what are you doing?

407
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,360
I don't listen to teachers.

408
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:53,799
Why are you here?

409
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,559
Don't eat the cookies.

410
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,960
Do you have any idea
how many projects you missed

411
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,039
while you were away?

412
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,200
Tell me you're not here to blame me.

413
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,319
You think too much.

414
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,519
I'm here to tell you

415
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,319
that Sheng Group decided
to continue the cooperation with us.

416
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:11,999
I know.

417
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,519
But,

418
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
I'm not interested in
making guesthouses anymore.

419
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:16,799
Because we can't do anything better.

420
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,519
Guixin Guesthouse Project was a success.

421
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,600
It earns reputation in the industry

422
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,559
and is of good business value.

423
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,239
I had dinner with Mr. Sheng yesterday,

424
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,640
and he wanted to talk to you.

425
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:26,999
Next Wednesday,

426
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:28,759
there will be a business summit.

427
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:29,719
Big bosses will all go there.

428
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,360
You can attend it
on behalf of the company.

429
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:32,920
Next Friday,

430
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,559
there will be a live sharing
of guesthouse designs.

431
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,360
I want you to get ready.

432
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:35,920
Okay?

433
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,319
But I don't have time.

434
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,719
And since when is our industry

435
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:40,759
involved with Internet traffic?

436
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,680
We should also adapt to
the development of the times.

437
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,079
It's just some packaging publicity.

438
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,479
Some promotion for a project,

439
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:46,360
it's so normal.

440
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,400
Isn't it the same for you to attend?

441
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,440
You can attend for me.

442
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,640
I've been working on
a different project.

443
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,319
I'm busy.

444
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,360
Xu Zehao.

445
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,479
You just made something.

446
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,880
Don't retreat now, okay?

447
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,239
Aren't you afraid of
being outpaced by others?

448
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,279
I still have the confidence.

449
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,799
If I would be outpaced by others

450
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,640
just because I took a few days off,

451
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:06,640
I guess

452
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,319
I deserve it.

453
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:09,479
Alright.

454
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,160
So you've been working on

455
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,279
Alex's project, right?

456
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,360
He told me
that you recommended someone to him.

457
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:20,640
Xia Tian, right?

458
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,120
Yeah.

459
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,239
Xia Tian.

460
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,079
Don't you recognize her ability too?

461
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:26,799
Yes.

462
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,600
I recognize her talent.

463
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,719
But I don't recognize you

464
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,920
to lose profits of the company
for personal reasons.

465
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,680
Block design,

466
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,160
what is there to design?

467
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,880
You can only get a trophy.

468
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:38,880
Moreover,

469
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,880
what does this trophy
have to do with you?

470
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,759
What's the business value of it?

471
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,239
What's the profit for the company?

472
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:45,960
And,

473
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,600
do you think the opportunity
to work with a big company

474
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,640
is that easy to get?

475
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:49,759
If I were Xia Tian,

476
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,759
I will blame you

477
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,360
for not doing so.

478
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,120
You don't know about Xia Tian.

479
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,759
You are not her.

480
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,039
A company has its logic.

481
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,319
A company needs to spend
the least amount of money and efforts

482
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,039
to earn the most money.

483
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,079
But Xia Tian is not a business person.

484
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,600
She still has a passion for design.

485
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,319
It's not about profit.

486
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,319
Besides,

487
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,319
what company profits can she affect?

488
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,079
I'll make it straight.

489
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,880
You can take all of Sheng's project.

490
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,039
You can use any staff you want.

491
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,840
I won't ask.

492
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,120
That's

493
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,479
why you came to me today, right?

494
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,200
But you're a businessman.

495
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Is it worth all the sacrifices

496
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,319
you made,

497
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:29,799
but she doesn't even know anything?

498
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:33,120
If my relationship with Xia Tian

499
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,479
is a business,

500
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,999
just think of me
as a venture capitalist.

501
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,479
Maybe

502
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,519
I will lose everything

503
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,440
I have,

504
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,160
