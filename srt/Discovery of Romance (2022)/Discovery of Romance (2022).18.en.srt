And these flowers.

Um.

Please

I have four words for you.

00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,279
You don't deserve it.

40
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,520
What makes you think
he doesn't deserve it?

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,080
I found you're so funny.

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,520
This man made you cry for once,

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,839
and he will make you cry again.

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,360
will stay wrong no matter how.

Can you figure it out?

00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,679
Piss off.

49
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,319
I told you to go back inside.

50
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,679
Psycho.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,960
He's in now.

52
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,800
Say whatever you want to.

53
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:20,960
Sorry.

Song.

55
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,999
Back then,

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,760
I knew exactly how you felt about me,

57
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,679
but I pretended not knowing.

58
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,879
And I made you pay for my car repairing.

59
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,279
I didn't realize how much it hurt you.

60
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,279
I did some self-examination afterwards.

61
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,999
I was so confused back then.

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,200
So,

63
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,879
I am sorry.

64
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,240
I sincerely apologize to you.

65
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:47,999
Huh!

66
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,999
Song won't forgive you that easy.

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Thank you.

68
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
You're blocking my view.

69
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:11,760
Song.

70
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,839
You had fun with Yu Hui
in the team building,

71
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,159
and you also accepted Tan Xu's flowers.

72
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,399
You must like one of them.

73
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,040
You like one of them,

74
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,679
or not?

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,760
I cannot tell exactly right now.

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,599
It's yet to be determined.

77
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,480
No way!

78
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,439
You want to date with two people?

79
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,399
Before we enter a relationship,

80
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,439
we should go on a few dates first.

81
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,159
No.

82
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,240
You can't.

83
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:44,960
Why?

84
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,879
Well...

85
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,520
If you date them,

86
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,439
I don't know
who will have night snacks with me.

87
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
What?

88
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
All you know is eating.

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,279
You're getting so fat.

90
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,320
I'll stop having
night snacks from now on.

91
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,719
I won't have them anymore.

92
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:01,999
Go away!

93
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:03,960
Ah.

94
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:05,999
Li Donghao.

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,559
You bad man!

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,520
Hey.

97
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,640
Put my flowers down.

98
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,279
Aren't you allergic to pollen?

99
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:12,719
Li Donghao.

100
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:13,839
Li Donghao.

101
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,559
Li Donghao.

102
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,120
Stop walking around.

103
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,080
You're making me dizzy.

104
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,200
Hey.

105
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,279
My personal life

106
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,719
got a little complicated,

107
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,279
which I didn't expect.

108
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:51,320
How is it?

109
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,919
(WeChat messages from Tan Xu and Yu Hui)
Isn't that wonderful?

110
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,359
These two.

111
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,680
Which one do you prefer?

112
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,960
I don't know either.

113
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,599
Yu Hui,

114
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,520
is older.

115
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,839
But he's

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,799
careful,

117
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,799
considerate

118
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,599
and mature.

119
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,279
He's a nice guy.

120
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,839
But I always feel like...

121
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:13,839
Tsk.

122
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:14,880
And Tan Xu,

123
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,640
I don't like him that much already.

124
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,200
But,

125
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,359
Tan Xu has really changed me a lot.

126
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,080
Look.

127
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,279
I learned financial management

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,200
because of him.

129
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:27,799
Fund, insurance, something like that.

130
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,719
Otherwise,

131
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,880
I don't know any of these.

132
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,680
And most importantly,

133
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,000
Tan Xu likes me now.

134
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,120
Isn't that nice?

135
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,039
No.

136
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,239
There's one person

137
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:47,760
I'm struggling with right now.

138
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
As long as it's not Li Donghao.

139
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:54,680
Um.

140
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,479
Our Li Donghao?

141
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,159
Song.

142
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:06,719
Ah?

143
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,880
Song.

144
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,359
Where are you going?

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,200
I'm going to have a meeting
at Xu Zehao's company.

146
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:12,200
Alright.

147
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,960
I'll drive you there.

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,159
Ay.

149
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:13,359
No need.

150
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,159
I got a cab.

151
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:14,599
Bye.

152
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:14,719
Hey.

153
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:14,960
No.

154
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,760
Wait for me.

155
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,399
Oops.

156
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,799
Are you alright?

157
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:29,320
Song.

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,680
Let me drive you there.

159
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,279
Lisianthus is beautiful
and well-cultivated.

160
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,239
Its meaning

161
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:39,120
is true and unchanging love.

162
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,799
These are the best flowers for a woman.

163
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,279
Li Donghao.

164
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,919
What's in your hand?

165
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,440
Nothing.

166
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,039
What's in your hand?

167
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:50,560
Nothing.

168
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,239
You're hiding it from me?

169
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,000
No.

170
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,359
No.

171
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,120
What's wrong?

172
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,599
Take it out.

173
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,560
I just saw it.

174
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,080
Do you really want to see it?

175
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:00,919
Do you?

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,440
Do you?

177
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,799
Hi, Xia Tian.

178
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,120
Where did you get this?

179
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:07,680
Tell me.

180
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,880
The auntie gave them to me
when I bought her scallion.

181
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,640
She gave you these?

182
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,640
Here you are.

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,120
For you.

184
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:19,680
Do you know that?

185
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,359
He just did a lot of weird things.

186
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,919
For example,

187
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,200
we made a chair

188
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,120
with a leg missing.

189
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,560
You can see him no matter where.

190
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,239
It's just

191
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,919
so eye-catching, you know?

192
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,760
Stop laughing.

193
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,320
And...

194
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,599
I asked myself a serious question.

195
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
What exactly do I need?

196
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,919
Wealth, family background,
education background,

197
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:45,279
talent, appearance, height.

198
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,839
I don't think any of them
matters to me now.

199
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,880
Maybe when I was 20,

200
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:49,760
I cared a lot about them.

201
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,279
But now,

202
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,520
I only care about two things.

203
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,520
One,

204
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,960
take me as a woman.

205
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:56,839
Two,

206
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,479
except for taking me as a woman,

207
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,320
treat me as a human being.

208
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,320
But our Li Donghao

209
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,440
just takes me as a buddy,

210
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,799
never as a woman.

211
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,399
Even so,

212
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,760
you still like Donghao.

213
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,399
Look, you like people for a reason,

214
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,960
except Donghao.

215
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,799
Right?

216
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,399
I can't tell you why myself.

217
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,919
But there's no reason to like someone.

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,880
It just happens for no reason.

219
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,279
By the time you know it,

220
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,440
you already like him.

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,120
It doesn't matter
whether you know nothing

222
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,120
about him.

223
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,639
Have you experienced that?

224
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,800
Tell me more about it.

225
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,280
Like,

226
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,440
his favorites,

227
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,599
his hates,

228
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,320
his horoscope,

229
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,400
and his birth date.

230
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,320
You don't know any of them,

231
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,920
but you still like him.

232
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,479
Maybe even

233
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,599
love at first sight.

234
00:08:59,119 --> 00:08:59,680
It's not visible

235
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,800
or suspicious.

236
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,599
By the time you know it,

237
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,440
it just happened

238
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,040
naturally.

239
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,320
There's no room for regret.

240
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,920
That's when you realize

241
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,639
that maybe your heart
works a little faster than your mind.

242
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,719
That's it.

243
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,479
Haven't you really experienced it?

244
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,560
I really hate Xu Zehao.

245
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,519
Xia Tian, are you crazy?

246
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,759
Do you even know
what you were talking about?

247
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:38,999
What do you mean by "your heart

248
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,359
works a little faster than your mind?"

249
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,999
What do you mean
by "it just happened naturally"?

250
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,239
Do you have any idea of
how hard it is for me

251
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,599
to play dumb between you two?

252
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,040
I really can't understand

253
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,839
what is going on with you two.

254
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:56,920
You broke up five years ago.

255
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,759
And you broke up for the second time
after five years.

256
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,639
And you?

257
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,119
You would cry when you heard him

258
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,519
saying those nonsense.

259
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:05,960
What's wrong with you?

260
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,999
You are tempted by him again?

261
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,119
Yes.

262
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm tempted.

263
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,800
How could I not?

264
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,359
He's Xu Zehao,

265
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,280
not somebody else.

266
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,599
What Xu Zehao means to me,

267
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,440
don't you know?

268
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,719
We were together at our simplest time

269
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,160
for five years.

270
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,440
We grew up together.

271
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,920
By far,

272
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
he's still the one who knows me best

273
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,119
and has seen the worst of me.

274
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,200
Sometimes, he knows me

275
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,599
even better than you and Donghao.

276
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,320
How could I not?

277
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,800
But what can I do?

278
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,160
I know I shouldn't wait for him.

279
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,800
But I did.

280
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,920
I know there are many words
I shouldn't say.

281
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,839
But I did.

282
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,800
But other than that,

283
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,160
what else have I done?

284
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,119
Did I sleep with him?

285
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:02,920
Did I run off with him?

286
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Anyway,

287
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,239
I know exactly what I'm supposed to do.

288
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,080
I've never run away from it.

289
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,359
And I know where I should be.

290
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,999
I'm doing my best to be in my place.

291
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,280
But I'm not a saint.

292
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,879
I'm just a human being.

293
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,359
I'm just tempted.

294
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,160
What should I do?

295
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,359
I'm sorry.

296
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,920
I was too harsh on you.

297
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,639
It's okay.

298
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,639
I know these things
are hard to understand sometimes.

299
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,040
It's not that I don't understand.

300
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,280
I am just worrying about you.

301
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,879
Do you understand?

302
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,719
Isn't that what people do?

303
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,759
When others fall in love,

304
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,719
they may think
they are naive and ridiculous,

305
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,119
like psychos.

306
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,160
I can't understand them either.

307
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,400
But you're Song.

308
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:23,920
I don't care what others say,

309
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,160
except you.

310
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,999
I know.

311
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,040
I was wrong.

312
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:33,879
I won't do it again.

313
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,040
Don't worry.

314
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,960
I know.

315
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,639
I love Guan Xin now.

316
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,599
I was too young when I was with Xu Zehao

317
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,639
back then.

318
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:47,839
I can't see anything else

319
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,999
but him.

320
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:51,999
Love always came first.

321
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,479
But I know

322
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,560
Guan Xin.

323
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,839
And the more I know him,
the more I like him.

324
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,040
I feel safe with him.

325
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,879
I can always be spoiled by him.

326
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
I can do whatever I want.

327
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,599
So I won't leave him

328
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,960
and I don't want to.

329
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,599
I trust you.

330
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:18,839
Huh.

331
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,800
Don't ever say that again.

332
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,160
I will always be

333
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,519
on your side.

334
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,280
Boss.

335
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,920
I'm going over to
Sheng Group this afternoon

336
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,080
to talk about the townhouse.

337
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,359
Okay.

338
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:35,359
And...

339
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,599
Miss Xia will be here this afternoon.

340
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,040
I got it.

341
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,519
Are you alright?

342
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,280
Of course.

343
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,639
Of course okay.

344
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,400
How can we work together
if we are not okay?

345
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,519
And you said,

346
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,040
time will heal everything.

347
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,719
It will pass.

348
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:58,479
Okay.

349
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:00,400
Then I can give you the files.

350
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,519
Oh.

351
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:01,999
Wait.

352
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,479
Um.

353
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,800
The client said he wanted
to plant a tree in the yard

354
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,639
in front of the house, right?

355
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,479
Um.

356
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,800
Tell them it's not possible.

357
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,639
Because after 10 years,

358
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,479
or 20 years,

359
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,960
when this tree grows,

360
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,400
it will definitely
affect the sunlight to the townhouse.

361
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,080
We can't just cut it down then.

362
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,239
It's a life after all.

363
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,519
We can't just think about the present

364
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,239
but not the future.

365
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,639
Boss.

366
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,599
Now I see

367
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,400
why you're so obsessed with Xia Tian.

368
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,680
What do you want?

369
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,280
Because she said the same thing as you

370
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,599
when she saw the tree

371
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,359
in this proposal.

372
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,440
You look like a bad man right now.

373
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,920
Do I?

374
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:48,519
I...

375
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,119
I have to go now.

376
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,560
That's the general guideline.

377
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,359
I'll be there again

378
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,400
before the furniture is installed.

379
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,440
Mr. Xu, any opinion?

380
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:32,920
Nothing.

381
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,359
Thank you.

382
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,359
Guys,

383
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:35,920
the meeting is over.

384
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,239
It's almost finished.

385
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,400
I'm kind of looking forward
to seeing it done.

386
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,639
Yes.

387
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
We'll be busy for a few more days.

388
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,239
Go for it.

389
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,800
Thank you.

390
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:12,239
You're here.

391
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,400
I know.

392
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,320
The old rule.

393
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,920
No shrimps.

394
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,440
More clams.

395
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,759
Yeah.

396
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,519
Pick one place and sit.

397
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,080
Chef,

398
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,040
one without shrimps,

399
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,759
more clams.

400
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,560
I hope you won't mind me sitting here.

401
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,479
You said it,

402
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,960
we can be just Party A and Party B.

403
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,839
It's common
that colleagues share a table

404
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,479
when they meet at a restaurant.

405
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,440
Since the last time you drove me home,

406
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,560
I haven't been to your house.

407
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,639
At work,

408
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,800
I think I didn't embarrass you

409
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,839
by talking about the work.

410
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,799
No.

411
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,680
Suit yourself.

412
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,239
Hey.

413
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:08,960
Here come the noodles.

414
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,239
One with lots of beans and fungus.

415
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,920
One without shrimps but with more clams.

416
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,519
Enjoy.

417
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,239
Thank you.

418
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,880
Are you as lazy as ever?

419
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,479
Are shrimps that hard to peel?

420
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,880
What a hassle it is to peel shrimps.

421
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,239
It's handier

422
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,360
to eat clams.

423
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,559
You too.

424
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,120
With lots of beans and fungus.

425
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:06,984
(Guan Xin)

426
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,279
Hello.

427
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,039
(Hello.)

428
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,799
(It's me.)

429
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:12,880
(Have you finished eating?)

430
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,999
(I'm eating with Xu Zehao.)

431
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,120
(We're at the final sprint
of the project.)

432
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,960
It will be over when it's done.

433
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,479
Ah.

434
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:28,360
What about tonight?

435
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Do you have any plans?

436
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:31,920
Ah.

437
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,479
Nothing.

438
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,840
I may have to work overtime tonight.

439
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:36,799
You enjoy yourselves.

440
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,239
Okay.

441
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,519
Bye.

442
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:50,999
Here.

443
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,840
Three spare ribs in sauce.

444
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,200
Right.

445
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,960
We used to take two,

446
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:58,600
and had to fight for it.

447
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:00,999
Right.

448
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:02,680
It's funny to fight about something

449
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,239
like that.

450
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,799
Also the instant noodles with cheese

451
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,640
or not.

452
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,840
Bean curd jelly sweet or salty.

453
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,920
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes
with salt or sugar.

454
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,759
Potatoes hard

455
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,719
or soft.

456
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:18,960
Ah.

457
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,680
And...

458
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,400
The cola.

459
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,239
Pepsi

460
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,120
or Coca.

461
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,160
So annoying.

462
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,279
I don't know
how I put up with all these back then.

463
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,799
If you ask me,

464
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,680
I'd say we should have broken up

465
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,200
the first time we fought.

466
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,400
I'm the one who should say that.

467
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,400
I won't order beer.

468
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,719
Just in case after getting drunk,

469
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,200
something that couldn't
be fixed happens.

470
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,799
As long as you won't drink too much

471
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,120
and send me messages
in the middle of the night,

472
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,640
there will be nothing we can't fix.

473
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,999
Hey.

474
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,719
That was the only time I did wrong.

475
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,960
Do you want to always bring it up?

476
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,160
Waiter.

477
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,519
A bundle of protoplasmic beer.

478
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:52,479
Ah.

479
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:52,840
Okay.

480
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,640
That's it.

481
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,840
I think it's okay for you, right?

482
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:57,920
Okay.

483
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,400
I really didn't eat seafood noodles

484
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,920
until I met you.

485
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,999
Before that,

486
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:11,479
I didn't even eat any noodle.

487
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,719
So did I.

488
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,880
Before I started dating you,

489
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,840
I had never seen a movie before.

490
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,079
Don't mention about TV dramas.

491
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,160
All because of you.

492
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,440
And camera.

493
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:19,640
Taking photos.

494
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,319
I began to learn the tree language.

495
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,600
I listened to Jay Chou's songs
and watched his movies

496
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,600
because of you.

497
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:28,840
I read the romance novels
like My Sunshine

498
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,079
because of you.

499
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,319
You have to dip in vinegar
when eating dumplings.

500
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,279
You have to dip in sauce
when having hot pot.

501
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,680
I just want to know

502
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,799
why a hamburger
has to come with a milkshake.

503
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,160
I don't know

504
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,960
why you dip chips
in sweet and sour sauce.

505
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,559
Tsk.

506
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,160
Hey.

507
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,039
When I think about it,

508
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,239
at least half of my habits

509
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,400
were changed because of you.

510
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,600
Me too.

511
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,920
But I still can't accept

512
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,319
the wasabi thing.

513
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,079
I can't accept durian either.

514
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,079
Even if I keep it in the fridge,

515
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,279
its smell will be all over the room.

516
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,759
It's a pity
that you don't get its delicious taste.

517
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,920
But you are probably
the only one in the world

518
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,759
that can be so scared by Train to Busan.

519
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,079
Be serious.

520
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,279
Train to Busan is really scary, okay?

521
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:07,319
Why didn't you mention
Monkey King: Hero Is Back?

522
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,079
For a cartoon,

523
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,079
you cried so hard.

524
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,160
Was I the only one crying in the cinema?

525
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,999
More than half the people cried, okay?

526
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:14,079
When others cried,

527
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,319
at least they didn't blow their nose
on other's clothes.

528
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,360
Didn't you cry?

529
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,880
Didn't you ask me for tissue?

530
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,759
I...

531
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,200
Well...

532
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,680
When there was a cockroach in the house,

533
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,719
didn't you always jump on my back?

534
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,160
I took care of

535
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:28,799
that rat last time.

536
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,559
Rats are really scary.

537
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,600
Girl are all afraid of cockroaches.

538
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,759
Are your father and mother all right?

539
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:46,999
Yes.

540
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,840
They have fun all the time,

541
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,600
and never come home.

542
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,160
Are they really
traveling around the world?

543
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,039
It's been three years.

544
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,360
Except for a postcard

545
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,160
I received from them last month,

546
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:57,880
I haven't heard from them since.

547
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,400
I really admire you.

548
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,079
Your parents love each other so much

549
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,479
and they love you so much.

550
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,279
But in such a privileged environment,

551
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,319
why are you

552
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,200
so difficult to get along with?

553
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,039
That's weird.

554
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,160
Are you cold?

555
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,160
Unfortunately,

556
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,840
we're not in a relationship

557
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,519
where you can take off the coat for me.

558
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:30,799
Haha.

559
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:32,680
Who wants to take off the coat for you?

560
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:34,160
Don't flatter yourself.

561
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,160
You used to be like this.

562
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,840
You like to sing Karen Mok's songs

563
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:38,799
alone.

564
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,759
I told you to sing
Hiroshima Love with me,

565
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,600
but you rejected it.

566
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,680
I really don't get it.

567
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
What's wrong with out of tune?

568
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,400
I was not afraid of that.

569
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,600
There has always been a saying

570
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,759
that whenever couples sing this song,

571
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,600
they will break up.

572
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,400
Even if you tried so hard to avoid it,

573
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,400
didn't we break up in the end?

574
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,759
Is it bad to break up?

575
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,759
Now I can sing whatever I want.

576
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,759
I don't have to be so careful.

577
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,400
Maybe we'll get along

578
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:10,999
and can still be friends.

579
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,200
Friends?

580
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,600
With you?

581
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,640
I'd prefer Song.

582
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:15,920
Tsk.

583
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm okay now

584
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:21,600
with being completely disconnected

585
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,759
after the breakup

586
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,279
and not knowing

587
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:27,559
how the other one is doing.

588
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,200
Didn't we always do so

589
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,880

Where is Xia Tian?

Xia Tian.

622
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:58,999
Ah.

623
00:25:58,999 --> 00:25:59,840
I'll go and check.

624
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:02,039
Ah.

625
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,120
Xia Tian.

Xia Tian.

627
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:12,440
Xia Tian is not here.

628
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,079
Isn't she at home?

629
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,799
She may have gone
for a walk on the seaside.

630
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,600
She likes to go to the seaside
a lot these days.

631
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:19,360
Oh.

632
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,519
I got it.

633
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,719
Ah.

634
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,440
Morning.

635
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,479
Morning.

636
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,319
Where is Xia Tian?

637
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,360
Is she out?

638
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,039
Didn't she come back?

639
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,559
I think she's with Guan Xin.

640
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,160
What?

641
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,319
She's not home.

642
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,519
Guan Xin just called me
looking for Xia Tian just now.

643
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,360
She didn't come back?

644
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,719
You are tempted by him again?

645
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:58,999
Yes.

646
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,319
I'm tempted.

647
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,799
Xia Tian had a meeting
with Xu Zehao yesterday.

648
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,600
Oh no.

649
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,160
What did you say to Guan Xin?

650
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,239
I said she went for a walk
on the seaside.

651
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,360
What kind of nonsense did you say?

652
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,840
What was I supposed to say?

653
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,160
Weird.

660
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,559
Nothing.

661
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,840
I...

662
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,039
I may have to work overtime tonight.

You enjoy yourselves.

664
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,279
I had the wrong phone

665
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,400
with that man you met

666
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,200
on the day you went on a blind date.

667
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,519
When I went back to him
to get my phone back,

668
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,239
I slept at his place

669
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:07,600
because I was too drunk.

670
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,799
You are the one who picked up the phone?

671
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,799
Why is he here?

672
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,600
He's my client.

673
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:14,719
Yeah.

674
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,719
I'm the one who picked up the phone

675
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:18,880
and also her client.

676
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,640
(I hope you're on the seaside.)

677

679
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,999
This is not good.

680
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,640
Why isn't Xu Zehao answering his phone?

681
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:43,079
Hey.

682
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,479
What did Guan Xin say?

683
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,840
I haven't talked to Guan Xin yet.

684
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,160
Do you think

685
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,999
Xia Tian is with Xu Zehao?

686
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,039
I knew it was only a matter of time.

687
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,039
What is it?

688
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:52,840
Is she crazy?

689
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,920
Are you crazy?

690
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,200
I need you to watch your mouth.

691
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,920
What?

692
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,400
She's like this.

693
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,200
What can I say?

694
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,239
I'm telling you.

695
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:58,759
Li Donghao.

696
00:28:59,079 --> 00:28:59,999
You can't say a word

697
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:00,960
to Guan Xin later.

698
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,079
Or I'll rip out your tongue.

699
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,440
What?

700
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:02,999
What?

701
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,279
If she's with Xu Zehao,

702
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,400
I'll never see her again.

703
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,479
I'll stop being friends with her.

704
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,440
Whatever.

705
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,360
Alright.

706
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,759
It's not going to solve anything

707
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:10,999
with or without you.

708
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:11,840
Do you have any idea?

709
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
During this period,

710
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,400
she and Xu Zehao were together

711
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,239
for the right reasons,

712
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,600
either as partners or as exes.

713
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,239
That's why I kept it from Guan Xin.

714
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,880
But if they were together last night,

715
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,840
what else can I hide?

716
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Shut up.

717
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,440
Li Donghao.

718
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,519
I'm telling you.

719
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,559
No matter Xia Tian slept with Xu Zehao

720
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,519
or not,

721
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,479
she's my friend.

722
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:28,200
Do you hear me?

723
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,640
Oops.

724
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,640

Um.

Is Xu Zehao with you?

Mr. Xu?

No.

No.

736
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
I just wanted to talk to him

737
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:56,600
and called him,

738
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,519
but he didn't answer it.

739
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,200
What about last night?

740
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,719
Were you two together?

741
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,799
I've been busy with something else

So many questions!

755

You just know to ask questions.

Wait.
