Let's cooperate.

23
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:53,839
I must admit

24
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:54,960
I have my purpose.

25
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:57,479
Me too.

26
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,000
You know that our studio

27
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,919
is in a vulnerable position.

28
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,279
Can you pay us the deposit

as soon as we sign the contract?

Don't worry.

I like this project.

I will do my best.

But my purpose is you.

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,679
Did you read
my mom's column about relationship?

00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,439
Why are you talking like this now?

37
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,800
Don't be so mean.

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,760
Am I?

39
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:34,920
Stay away from me.

40

I'm not only mean.

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,040
Very good.

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,999
Business is business.

43
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,559
I won't let things

get personal.

I'll invite you to dinner next time.

Thank you.

55
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,879
Have you figured out
how to tell Guan Xin about this?

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,960
I'll tell him I'm going to work

57
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,640
on a very good project with my ex.

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,279
Do you think I'm stupid?

59
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,439
Good.

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,200
I'll only tell him about the project.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,360
Of course I need to tell the truth.

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,320
Lovers need to
be honest with each other.

63
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,320
And,

64
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,920
I have nothing to hide.

65
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,559
I'm just waiting for

66
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:40,719
an opportune moment

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,719
and a way

68
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,119
that doesn't make both of us feel bad.

69
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,719
What are them?

70
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,080
I'm still looking.

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,799
It's an old injury, isn't it?

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,760
How did this happen?

73
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:20,960
I was naughty when I was a little girl,

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,760
and I fell when riding a bike.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,560
How old were you?

76
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:25,440
Where?

77
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,359
Six.

78
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:27,560
In an orphanage.

79
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:33,560
Come on.

Xia Tian.

83
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:06,760
Are you sleeping?

84
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,039
Yes.

85
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:10,359
But I am awake now.

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,320
Why don't you sleep?

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,200
Nightmare?

88
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,200
Yeah.

89
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,120
Didn't you use an aromatherapy scent?

90
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,320
I did.

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:21,960
Nothing.

92
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going out for a walk alone.

93
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,640

It seems to happen every few days.

If it keeps going like this,

114
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,919
it will make me very worried.

It's okay.

You don't have to do this.

119

When you want to say it,

120
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:20,760
you will tell me.

121
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,640
Right?

122
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,799
Actually,

123
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,719
it was a dream I had when I was a boy.

124
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,719
What was it?

125
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,239
I made a mistake when I was young.

126
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,560
I'm ashamed to tell you.

127
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,080
Come on.

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,200
Who did not
make mistakes when they were little?

129
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,039
You must have made
fewer mistakes than me.

130
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,960
I stole my mom's money

131
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,080
when I was in middle school.

132
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,120
Because she gave me

133
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,919
too little pocket money.

134
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,799
So,

135
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,159
more than once,

136
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,320
at least

137
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,799
ten times.

138
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,359
Was I a bad girl?

139
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,440
I know you're comforting me.

140
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,359
I'm very sorry

141
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,399
for that mistake I made.

142
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,200
In fact, those who often
have nightmares are very kind.

143
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,159
They are always
afraid of hurting others,

144
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,640
so they will keep thinking about

145
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
how to compensate

146
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
others.

147
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,880
It's okay.

148
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,320
Tell me about it when you want to.

149
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,479
Actually,

150
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,040
I have something to tell you.

151
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:41,280
What is it?

152
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:49,160
I just got a good project

153
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,759
about guesthouses.

154
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,759
We'll make a fortune.

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,920
But,

156
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
I will spend less time with you.

157
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,680
Do you mind that?

158
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,759
Even if I say I mind that

159
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,080
and don't want you to do it,

160
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,519
you will still do it.

161
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,160
I won't,

162
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,440
as long as you say "no".

163
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,359
Just kidding.

164
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,680
Do what you like.

165
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,800
I don't mind it.

166
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,599
Thank you, Guan Xin.

167
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,040
What a good moment.

168
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,960
I love you.

169
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:30,920
Xia Tian.

170
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,239
I love you too.

171
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:00,599
Hey, bro.

172
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,960
Put the chair here.

173
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
Here.

174
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,359
Yes.

175
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:04,759
Thanks.

176
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,639
Is this what both of you are agreed on?

177
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,639
This is the first time

178
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,839
I see Party A
working in Party B's office.

179
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,320
Mr. Yu said

180
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:23,320
this is what Mr. Xu always does.

181
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,839
They're the client.

182
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:27,359
Got it?

183
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,160
Hey!

184
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Where were you last night?

185
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,280
Why did you come back so late?

186
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,280
I was with Guan Xin.

187
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,119
What else could I do?

188
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,160
I shouldn't have asked.

189
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
I don't want to hear it.

190
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,719
Xia Tian.

191
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,239
Xia Tian.

192
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:39,839
Don't show off.

193
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,160
Do you want to know
what we did last night?

194
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,080
No, no.

195
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,719
Watch out.

196
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,479
Don't get it chipped.

197
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:47,599
Stop.

198
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,639
Just put it here.

199
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,280
Stop.

200
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,040
Be careful.

201
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:54,879
Wow.

202
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,680
You made

203
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,400
a really nice wine cabinet.

204
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,560
This is what the client wanted.

205
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,759
Yeah.

206
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,800
After all, our business
is to serve the client.

207
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,599
Although the client often has

208
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,080
unreasonable requirements,

209
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,160
we still need to
try our best to meet them.

210
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,440
That's great.

211
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,040
Hope you will try your best
to meet my request.

212
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,999
Our firm

213
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,920
generally leaves two weeks

214
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,119
for the first draft of the design.

215
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,200
But because of
the tight schedule this time,

216
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,519
we only give you six days.

217
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,160
So,

218
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,560
in the next period of time,

219
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,560
the two of you may have to work harder.

220
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,839
Hope we will create guesthouses

221
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,440
that the people of this city
will never forget.

222
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,639
Let's start.

223
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,560
Soul Habitat.

224
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,280
This is not good,

225
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,680
with no feature at all.

226
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,920
City Folding Concept.

227
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,320
Too abstract.

228
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,200
Not many people can understand it.

229
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,680
Leisure, Recreation, and Fitness...

230
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,560
Don't give me such a cliche next time.

231
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,560
Forgotten Ti...

232
00:11:58,999 --> 00:11:59,879
Who wrote this?

233
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:02,879
Um.

234
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,040
Not bad.

235
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,759
But not detailed enough.

236
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,560
There's only one page.

237
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,479
We can't let the client
decide it by guessing.

238
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,280
There's little time.

239
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,320
I just listed

240
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,519
all possible plans

241
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,800
for everyone to discuss then.

242
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,599
Make this complete.

243
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,680
I have to finish it tonight?

244
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,040
Yes.

245
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,719
Tonight.

246
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,960
It's dark now.

247
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,999
You can't let everyone
go to work with an empty stomach.

248
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,440
Who is hungry?

249
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,359
Xia Tian.

250
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:40,879
Yu Hui.

251
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,519
Order some food.

252
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,560
Okay.

253
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,119
Plus chicken soup.

254
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,920
This is good.

255
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,599
Hey!

256
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,400
Dinner is here.

257
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,719
I can finally eat.

258
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,280
Dinner, dinner.

259
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,920
Give me the chicken soup.

260
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,680
Let's have dinner.

261
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:54,239
Thank you.

262
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,400
This is the chicken soup.

263
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,080
Here you are.

264
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:57,239
Hang on.

265
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,200
Have some chicken soup.

266
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,879
Wow.

267
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,280
It smells great.

268
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,599
Sweet and sour sauce.

269
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:11,912
(Guan Xin)

270
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,599
(How is your work today?)

271
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,280
Salt and pepper.

272
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
(I haven't heard from you for a day.)

273
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,759
That's right.

274
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,759
Try each flavor.

275
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,479
Okay.

276
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,119
Thanks.

277
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,680
Anytime.

278
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,440
I'm okay.

279
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,359
Just a cold.

280
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,759
But all is well at work.

281
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:35,759
Why don't you eat anything?

282
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm not very hungry.

283
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,320
Mr. Xu.

284
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,599
It's inappropriate for you to do this,
considering our current relationship.

285
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:55,879
And I can't drink chicken soup
because I'm having a cold.

286
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:00,936
(Guan Xin)

287
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:09,879
Hello?

288
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,119
Hello, Xia Tian.

289
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,680
You're having a cold?

290
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,519
I'm coming to you tomorrow.

291
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,920
Coming to me?

292
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:17,599
Yeah.

293
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,599
You're having a cold.

294
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,320
Remember to have more warm water.

295
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,239
Well,

296
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:24,400
I've been too busy lately.

297
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,400
I haven't finished work yet.

298
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,320
Don't worry.

299
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,639
Just a cold.

300
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,719
(I've taken the medicine)

301
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:31,680
(and warm water.)

302
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,800
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

303
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,280
I will cook it for you
and bring it to you.

304
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,160
No need.

305
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,839
The client gives us meals,

306
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,800
even including late-night snacks.

307
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:41,960
Okay.

308
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,759
Since you're having a cold,

309
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:44,680
you should rest early

310
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,599
and don't stay up late.

311
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,080
I see.

312
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:49,479
Of course I want to go to sleep now.

313
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,519
Okay.

314
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:51,320
Good night.

315
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,239
Bye.

316
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,320
Guan Xin wants to come here?

317
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,160
I stopped him.

318
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,519
Ay.

319
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,599
These two rivals

320
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,999
will inevitably meet

321
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,839
each other.

322
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:05,560
Well.

323
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,239
It will be hard

324
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,359
for you.

325
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,479
Ouch.

326
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,040
Isn't it because of you?

327
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,920
I know.

328
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,359
Well,

329
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,879
how about this?

330
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,080
I will deal with Guan Xin.

331
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,639
Since I caused

332
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,040
the trouble,

333
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,719
I will settle it.

334
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,280
I will never get blood

335
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
on your hands.

336
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,400
Where are you going?

337
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,200
Go find a counselor

338
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,599
to discuss the solution.

339
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,639
Although my boss

340
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,839
is a little harsh,

341
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,119
he's kind.

342
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,320
He is just serious about his work.

343
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,519
Don't worry.

344
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,200
I knew him much earlier than you.

345
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:53,879
Yeah.

346
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,359
So,

347
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,960
why did they

348
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,879
break up?

349
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
You are such a gossip.

350
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,040
No.

351
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,920
I am just curious

352
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,800
about the person

353
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,999
who made Mr. Xu miss for five years.

354
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,719
What?

355
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,560
Are you saying that for five years,
Xu Zehao hasn't...?

356
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,479
Yeah.

357
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:15,359
But I really

358
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,400
have kept my integrity for 30 years.

359
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,560
Really?

360
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,200
Haha!

361
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,759
Hey!

362
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Me too.

363
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,200
We're the same.

364
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,400
"Gugua", "gugua".
[*That means they are single.]

365
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,639
Gua, gua.

366
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,800
It's the first time
I've met someone like me.

367
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,759
Really.

368
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,080
Someone like me.

369
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:36,080
Really?

370
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,400
Yeah.

371
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,800
Do you want this one?

372
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:39,599
Cereal.

373
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,519
Okay.

374
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,040
Thanks.

375
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,879
This time,

376
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,239
we still mainly use wood tones

377
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,999
and white walls

378
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:52,160
with some but not much wood siding.

379
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,680
The ratio of walls to siding

380
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,479
is about five to five.

381
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,920
When it comes to the furniture,

382
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,999
such as dining chairs

383
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:01,080
and dining tables,

384
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,479
I will mainly use elm wood.

385
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,200
I was not going to watch it.

386
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,279
You thought too much.

387
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,440
What do you think?

388
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,600
Bad.

389
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,160
But you were nodding

390
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,120
and taking notes.

391
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:19,600
Well,

392
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,239
not all are bad.

393
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,559
The previous content is good,

394
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,719
but the content in the back is bad.

395
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,559
Are you tired?

396
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,719
You take a break.

397
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,680
Leave it to me.

398
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,519
Go take your notes.

399
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,360
Song.

400
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:34,440
Um?

401
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:35,840
Come and help me.

402
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,479
No.

403
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,279
Only you.

404
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,079
Xu Zehao.

405
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,200
Who told me today

406
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,360
that she would try her best
to meet all the requirements of client,

407
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,440
including those unreasonable ones?

408
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:52,759
Okay.

409
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:53,840
Boss.

410
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,680
Well.

411
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,600
The operation that Cui Qi did

412
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
was really...

413
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:09,719
Didn't you sleep well?

414
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:10,640
No.

415
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,600
I couldn't sleep last night

416
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,440
and my neck hurts.

417
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:14,160
Is Xia Tian uncomfortable?

418
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,160
I said I didn't sleep well.

419
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,319
Can you care about me?

420
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,759
Do you only care about Xia Tian?

421
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,840
Xia Tian must be working overtime
a lot lately.

422
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,759
Am I not here?

423
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,319
You can't see me?

424
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm a little worried about her.

425
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,759
I'm going to see her.

426
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,519
Sit down!

427
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:28,799
Xin.

428
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,799
Do you know what is
most important in a relationship?

429
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:31,960
Distance.

430
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,400
Distance makes the heart grow fonder.

431
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,759
You two shouldn't go to see each other

432
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,079
too often.

433
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,719
Trust me.

434
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,319
Don't see each other
for at least a week.

435
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,479
Indeed, I haven't seen her for a week.

436
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,279
The surgery was canceled this morning.

437
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:44,559
I'll go to her.

438
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:45,719
Wait.

439
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,239
What is this?

440
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,840
This is the greatest invention
of the 21st century,

441
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,799
cell phone.

442
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,360
Call her if you want to.

443
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:07,976
(Guan Xin)

444
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:08,920
No one picked up.

445
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:09,840
Right?

446
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,400
I told you

447
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,120
she must be sleeping.

448
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,960
Don't call her.

449
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,559
Let her sleep more.

450
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,680
I'll go buy some fruit for her.

451
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:17,999
She doesn't like fruit.

452
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,600
What does she like?

453
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:21,279
She likes...

454
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:23,759
(Mitten crabs)

455
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,479
Chinese mitten crab.

456
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,239
Yeah.

457
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,559
She said she wanted to eat crabs.

458
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,160
Freshly caught crabs
from Yangcheng Lake.

459
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,279
Female crabs weighing 400g

460
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:29,960
with much crab roe

461
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,519
and enough nutrition.

462
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,079
Chinese mitten crab.

463
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,039
I remember Weishan Lake is near us.

464
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,600
I can go there and buy some crabs.

465
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,160
Yeah.

466
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,999
This is the time
to show your strength in front of her.

467
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,200
Go to Weishan Lake
and stay there for a few days

468
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,640
to catch crabs weighing 4.4kg by hand.

469
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,279
So she can eat
for eight days and eight nights,

470
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,880
and you won't quarrel
for the next 88 days.

471
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,719
No way.

472
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,880
She's having a cold.

473
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,239
She can't eat crabs.

474
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,440
I'm going to buy her
some seafood congee.

475
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:56,360
Wait.

476
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,200
What?

477
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,559
Don't you remember

478
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,160
there will be a party
in our department tonight?

I know you.

Are you hiding something from me?

482
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,440
Turn around and look at me.

483
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,160
Open your eyes.

517
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,319
During this period of time,

518
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,640
you can't take time off
unless there is something important.

519
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,120
Very important personal affairs.

520
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,759
It will be the weekend tomorrow.

521
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,759
You better forget the word "weekend".

522
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,160
Now I am the client.

523
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,279
As long as it affects my work,
it has something to do with me.

524
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,600
If you guys

525
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,680
get the design concept done today,

526
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,559
you will take one day off.

527
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,079
And,

528
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,360
look at you.

529
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,039
Who can you handle?

530
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,200
Bite me.

531
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,559
It has nothing to do with you.

532
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,239
Well,

533
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,799
we are friends.

534
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:13,880
Let's not fight.

535
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:14,999
Let's not fight.

536
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,079
He's not my friend.

537
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,999
I don't have such a friend

538
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,360
not letting me sleep
or not letting me take off.

539
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,880
I don't have a friend
without ambition like you, either.

540
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,279
Your arms.

541
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:24,880
Look at your living room.

542
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,680
There is no design at all.

543
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:28,600
Turned where you work

544
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,719
into like this.

545
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,479
How can you have a good taste in men?

546
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,759
Thank you.

547
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,120
I did have a bad taste

548
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,319
in men.

549
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,840
Yeah.

550
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,160
But now I have better taste.

551
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,920
And the place you're sitting in

552
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
isn't our living room.

553
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,680
The living room is for loved ones.

554
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,400
As the client,

555
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,920
it is good for you
to have such a place to sit.

556
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,239
Be satisfied.

557
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,799
What did you just say?

558
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,559
I said I did have a bad taste

559
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,200
in men.

560
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:57,920
Next one.

561
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,880
The living room is for loved ones.

562
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,799
Yeah.

563
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,920
That's what we lack.

564
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,239
We've been discussing

565
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,279
the practicality

566
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,479
of guesthouses.

567
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,999
What about other aspects?

568
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,200
The previous proposals

569
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,719
are all about practicality.

570
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,440
But in fact, the guesthouse
is like a home in another sense.

571
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,120
Yeah.

572
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,519
Guesthouses should be warm

573
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,559
and full of love.

574
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,120
Most young people

575
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,880
now live alone,

576
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,640
lacking emotional communication.

577
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,960
If we introduce some ideas

578
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,999
of tolerance and healing

579
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,239
into the furniture and facilities

580
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,239
of guesthouses.

581
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,479
Let people start

582
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,279
to communicate

583
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,160
and find love here.

584
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,160
That's what we're looking for.

585
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,160
Wow.

586
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,880
You two.

587
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:52,559
That means

588
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,239
we have now found
our goal and direction.

589
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,160
Just goal and direction.

590
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,039
We have to hurry up and finish the rest.

591
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,079
We have to create

592
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,519
a one-of-a-kind experience.

593
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:13,920
I'm going to the restroom.

594
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
Xia Tian.

595
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,039
Look!

596
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,400
(I failed to stop him.)

597
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,799
(Guan Xin is going there.)

598
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,960
Didn't you say
that Donghao could handle Guan Xin?

599
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,200
I told him,

600
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
but he failed.

601
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,360
I can do nothing.

602
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,799
And,

603
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,160
you can't keep Guan Xin

604
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
from coming here during the project.

605
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,999
Don't worry.

606
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,400
Xu Zehao,

607
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
I'll handle him

608
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,479
and make him cooperate with us.

609
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,920
That's not the question.

610
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,519
It's...

611
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,600
Make him disappear right now.

612
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,079
Okay.

613
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,999
Disappear.

614
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:50,920
Okay.

615
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,479
I got it.

616
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,519
Take it easy.

617
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,519
Don't be nervous.

618
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,400
Trust me.

619
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:55,600
I'll help you.

620
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,960
Do it right now.

621
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:58,680
I'm going to do my makeup.

622
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,600
Look at me.

623
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,640
Handle him, okay?

624
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:02,719
Okay?

625
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:19,920
Boss.

626
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,319
Look at this proposal.

627
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,200
What's this?

628
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,400
So stupid.

629
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:28,479
Let them redo it.

630
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,160
Mr. Xu.

631
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,960
That's enough talk

632
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,200
for now,

633
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:44,920
isn't it?

634
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,079
Just decided the concepts,

635
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,279
not even close.

636
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,200
Ouch!

637
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,920
Oh, my God.

638
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:55,440
What?

639
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,759
What's wrong, Song?

640
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:57,440
It hurts.

641
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,200
What's wrong?

642
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,360
Get up.

643
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,719
Stop, stop.

644
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,719
I'm on my period.

645
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,279
It hurts so much, Mr. Xu.

646
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,759
I really can't work today.

647
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,160
That's okay.

648
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,640
You get some rest.

649
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,519
We talk with Xia Tian.

650
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,319
No.

651
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,400
She's on her period too.

652
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:12,519
She's in pain just like me.

653
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,519
I infected her.

654
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,759
What's the matter, Song?

655
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:18,799
Aren't you on your period?

656
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,360
Why do you dress like this?

657
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,479
We were on our period at the same time.

658
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,640
It was over yesterday.

659
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,200
Are you on it again?

660
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:32,680
Yes.

661
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:33,319
Over.

662
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,799
Mr. Xu.

663
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,559
Song and I are going out.

664
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,400
We'll be back for work tonight,

665
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,319
and it will be delivered
to your mailbox before 12 this evening.

666
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,079
Okay.

667
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,519
I'll let you get on.

668
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:44,880
Yu Hui and I are here waiting for you.

669
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
My mother is coming soon.

670
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,640
Well, that's good.

671
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,519
I haven't seen
your mother for a long time.

672
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,559
I'm going to see her.

673
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,719
Mask.

674
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,600
I have a bad cold.

675
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,440
We have masks.

676
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:19,559
Xu Zehao.

677
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,680
Work is over.
Are you going to stay here?

678
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,160
Didn't we have a good chat just now?

679
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,079
Why are you suddenly like this?

680
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:25,960
Good chat?

681
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,440
You are just my client

682
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,559
and I'm just Party B.

683
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,759
Even if you are the client,

684
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,360
you have no right
to supervise me 24 hours a day.

685
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,200
I have my own private life.

686
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:39,840
Okay.

687
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,719
We're going back
and waiting for your news.

688
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,160
Let's go.

689
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:44,360
OK.

690
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,479
Have more warm water.

691
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,479
Ay.

692
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,479
He finally left.

693
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:00,559
Xia Tian.

694
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,440
I'm telling you.

695
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,360
I'm going upstairs now to sleep.

696
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,200
Don't call me

697
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:07,079
other than to eat.

698
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,239
Hear that?

699
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,440
You must call me for dinner.

700
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:16,799
Boss.

701
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:20,479
I think Miss Xia must be a little tired.

702
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,519
She's afraid.

703
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:23,999
Afraid of what?

704
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:25,920
Afraid of something between us.

705
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,039
Seafood congee.

706
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,319
Surprise?

707
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,079
How did you know I wanted to eat this?

708
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,640
You're having a cold.

709
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,519
So I was thinking

710
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,920
it might be better to have some congee.

711
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,319
But you don't like plain congee.

712
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,079
You are still working today?

713
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:18,279
Ay.

714
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,640
I haven't had a day off

715
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,279
since I took on this project.

716
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,999
The client just went away.

717
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,319
Am I interrupting you?

718
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,079
Of course not.

719
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,719
Go ahead.

720
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:34,600
It's getting cold.

721
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,999
Xia Tian.

722
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,079
What kind of person is your client?

723
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,200
Just like other clients,

724
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,160
picky,

725
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,799
bad temper

726
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,799
and a long face.

727
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:08,880
What's wrong?

728
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:10,360
Nothing.

729
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,640
I'll go get you a spoon.

730
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:37,519
What are you happy about?

731
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,360
You wanna catch me up?

732
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,160
How many days are left
before the submission date?

733
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,719
Didn't you decide this?

734
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:46,799
Oh.

735
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,120
I have a notebook left there.

736
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,920
I gotta go back.

737
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:50,799
A notebook?

738
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,239
Get it next time.

739
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,640
No.

740
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,160
It's very important.

741
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,400
Stop.

742
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,360
Stop here?

743
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,239
Are you nuts?

744
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,279
Psycho.

745
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,160
Are you hungry?

746
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,079
Famous designer.

747
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,719
I'm starving.

748
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,200
You only take a day off,
but you're cooking for me.

749
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,279
I'm okay.

750
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:50,840
I'm not tired at all.

751
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,400
Have it.

752
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,279
Have it.

753
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,999
What's wrong?

754
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,239
Does it taste bad?

755
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,319
There's ginger in it.

756
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,079
I'll...

757
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:05,840
You.

758
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,479
It doesn't taste good.

759
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:08,559
You don't need to eat it.

760
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:11,640
But you cooked it for me.

761
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,239
Every time I wanted to buy it,

762
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,999
there was a long queue.

763
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:25,759
So I haven't bought it.

764
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,239
You like it.

765
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,120
I'll buy it for you next time.

766
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,319
Okay.

767
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,880
Guan Xin.

768
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,799
Hug me.

769
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:36,799
Hug me.

770
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,039
What's wrong?

771
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,999
I just want you to give me a hug.

772
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,279
You are...?

773
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,400
I...

774
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,840
I have something left here.

775
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,680
So...

776
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,880
Oh.

777
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,640
You are the one who picked up the phone?

778
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,680
Why is he here?

779
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,479
He's my client.

780
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:16,200
Yeah.

781
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,360
I'm the one who picked up the phone

782
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,160
and also her client.

783
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:21,920
Oh.

784
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,519
Small world.

785
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:23,920
Hello.

786
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,640
Hello.

787
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,200
He's my...

788
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,840
I know.

789
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Your boyfriend.

790
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,559
Yes.

791
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:30,400
By the way,

792
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,120
I'm cooperating with Xia Tian

793
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,559
on a guesthouse project.

794
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:36,039
Xia Song Studio has a unique design

795
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,440
and a sense of responsibility,

796
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,239
so,

797
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,559
by chance...

798
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,079
Yeah.

799
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,200
They really appreciate our design style

800
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,079
and like our design,

801
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,640
so they come to work with us.

802
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,719
Mr. Xu has already forgiven me

803
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:53,440
for that thing.

804
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,519
I explained that to him,

805
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,319
and Mr. Xu let it slide.

806
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:01,479
Mr. Xu.

807
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:02,960
Are there

808
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,519
any other requirements for my work?

809
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:05,999
Oh.

810
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:08,320
I have a notebook left here.

811
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,679
Is it

812
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,400
