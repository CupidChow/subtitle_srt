Actually,

27
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,240
sometimes people
want to be not so careful,

28
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,599

Here is the thing.

34
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,640
We two had a little talk

00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,439
before you came back.

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,040
I was convinced.

37
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,920
It's really not appropriate
for you to do so.

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,879
You have Guan Xin with you
when you two are dating.

When you have some arguments,

40

you have us with you when you're back.

You will never be alone.

42

I'm not saying you should forgive him
right here and now.

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,719
I just want to say

46
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,520
that whoever initiates the talk
doesn't necessarily lose.

47
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:33,640
Of course.

48

When they love someone,

53
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,439
they will be very good to her.

54
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,480
Do whatever she tells them.

55
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,279
Come whenever she needs them.

56
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,800
Comfort her.

57
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,480
Indulge her.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,960
When they are so madly in love,

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,839
they can even get the stars for her.

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,920
But there is only
one thing they can't do.

61
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,119
That is love for a lifetime.

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,839
So many couples didn't make it

through the seven-year itch.

So,

65
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,080
you should think carefully

66

that our relationship was special.

The relationship between Guan Xin and I

might have changed from the very moment.

it's not that different

00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:23,440
Morning.

169
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,400
Get in.

170
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,280
Get in.

171
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Let's go.

172
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,759
I just called the staff
in the orphanage.

173
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,119
They said the kid is very nervous.

174
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,719
She's afraid to take the operation.

175
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,999
You are right.

176
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,560
It'd probably do her good
if she can see you in advance.

177
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,359
You are so happy today.

178
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,719
I'm happy every day.

179
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,519
Hey.

180
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,160
Dr. Guan.

181
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,999
Is there a mall there?

182
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,160
Right.

183
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,160
There is one.

184
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,719
Why?

185
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:16,560
You want to have lunch?

186
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
I'm not hungry.

187
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,719
I just thought we can buy
some food for the kids.

188
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,719
Sure.

189
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,400
Well...

190
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,719
We can have lunch too.

191
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,680
Okay.

192
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:36,800
Let's find a mall to grab some food.

193
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,160
Otherwise we'll have to starve

194
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,639
once we get on the highway.

195
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,800
Whatever.

196
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,920
It's so cute.

197
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:02,400
This looks good.

198
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,080
Yeah.

199
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,519
Look.

200
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,359
Isn't it cute?

201
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,359
It is.

202
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,960
Kids love something like this.

203
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,479
You have a good taste, Miss.

204
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,320
This one just came in.

205
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,239
It's on sale.

206
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,040
588 yuan per piece.

207
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,920
Okay.

208
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:15,719
588 yuan?

209
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,479
Thank you.

210
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,839
I'll think about it.

211
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:20,639
I'll think about it.

212
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,839
Why don't you take it?

213
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,680
We can go have a look at other stores.

214
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,719
Hello.

215
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:28,160
Please wrap these for me.

216
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,519
110.

217
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:28,839
120.

218
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:29,560
130.

219
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,359
Three pieces for each.

220
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,440
Okay. Please follow me.

221
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,960
Thank you.

222
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,160
I wanted to buy something for the kids.

223
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
But you paid for all of these.

224
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,999
Don't worry about it.

225
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,920
I'm not rich.

226
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,839
But,

227
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,920
I want to do something for them too.

228
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,680
I'm very happy.

229
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:51,519
Just give me the chance to do my share.

230
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,839
Okay.

231
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:54,160
I'll tell the kids

232
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,599
that you bought all the clothes.

233
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,119
What about this one?

234
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,759
Looks fine.

235
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,639
Let's go have a look.

236
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,320
Is it here?

237
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,719
Let me see.

238
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,519
Um.

239
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,239
I think...

240
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,519
Maybe we should go somewhere else.

241
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,479
They look like they have a bad rating.

242
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,320
Um...

243
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,960
There.

244
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,879
They must have some good food.

245
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,359
Let me see.

246
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:11,920
Um.

247
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,519
Let me see.

248
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,239
Um.

249
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,560
It seems you really like this bag.

250
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,599
You've used it for so many years.

251
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,280
Classic and durable.

252
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,040
My taste was so good back then.

253
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,960
I bought it myself.

254
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,160
No way.

255
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,920
I bought that bag for you

256
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,639
with my first month salary.

257
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,119
You were going to an interview

258
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,080
and needed a serious looking bag.

259
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:49,960
I think it was a Friday.

260
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,160
I wanted to give you a surprise.

261
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,239
So I bought it at the mall

262
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,759
and waited for you at your company.

263
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,200
Oh.

264
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,519
You didn't like the color I chose.

265
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,400
So we went back to the mall
to pick a new one.

266
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:00,639
Hey.

267
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,519
How can you forget that?

268
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,680
You were so moved then.

269
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,280
Excuse me.

270
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:10,800
You bought earrings
with your first month salary,

271
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,680
not a bag.

272
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,960
It was Valentine's Day.

273
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,359
We went to see a romance movie.

274
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,080
The hero gave the heroine
a pair of earrings,

275
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,479
so I wanted you to get ears pierced.

276
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,239
But you wouldn't.

277
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,280
Then we went to the mall
to buy earrings.

278
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,560
You wanted to buy a pendant.

279
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,200
But I insisted.

280
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,200
Is that so?

281
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,400
Well...

282
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,200
Then when did I buy the bag?

283
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,560
You bought it as an apology gift

284
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:43,800
after you stood me up three times.

285
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,879
Well...

286
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,200
What about the earrings?

287
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,280
Do you still have them?

288
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,200
Surely I got rid of them.

289
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,719
I should keep them to show off

290
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,359
that you bought something
for me five years ago?

291
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:01,839
I didn't mean that.

292
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,920
I just wanted to know
if you remember these things.

293
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,360
What if I do?

294
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
And what if I don't?

295
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,960
We did have a good time together.

296
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,920
But it turned stale

297
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,600
within five years.

298
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,559
Every time I see you now,

299
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,160
I'll just keep reminding myself.

300
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,440
Every good thing in this world

301
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,600
will inevitably wither away.

302
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,120
I always thought I was special
when I was young.

303
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:26,479
And my love

304
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,640
is never a cliche
but always extraordinary.

305
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,840
After we broke up,

306
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,920
I realized it was nothing extraordinary.

307
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,239
It's not your fault.

308
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,920
I was too naive back then.

309
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,759
Didn't you say it yourself

310
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,079
that the everlasting relationship
is too scarce in this world?

311
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,200
Right?

312
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,680
Let's eat.

313
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,920
That's enough talking.

314
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:13,120
You are here to shop too?

315
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,960
Of course I'm here to shop.

316
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,880
What else would I do here?

317
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,799
Why are you two together again?

318
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,079
Do I need to explain to you?

319
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,999
Why do you always have
that attitude with me?

320
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,360
Do we look like

321
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,640
we are good friends?

322
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,279
Maybe we should go take the escalator.

323
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,999
Let's go.

324
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,400
Enjoy your shopping.

325
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,519
You too.

326
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,960
Let's go.

327
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,400
Take a deep breath.

328
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,559
Take a deep breath.

329
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,519
Come on.

330
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,559
A deep breath.

331
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:48,680
Relax.

332
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:53,719
(A girl so pretty.)

333
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:54,999
(Who would've thought
she's so calculating?)

334
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:55,999
(Good god.)

335
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,840
What?

336
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,279
Restroom.

337
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,120

Guan Xin didn't answer his phone.

Is he doing an operation?

349

He didn't come today.

350

Oh.

I have more gifts for you.

Wow.

Help me hand these out, Ms. Zhang.

This is the Dr. Guan I told you about

462

who can make the scar disappear.

Go.

464
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:38,719
Have some talk with Dr. Guan.

Come on.

Hello.

Lili.

468
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:47,160
I have a present for you.

469
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:50,960
Do you like it?

470
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:56,600
Take it.

471
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,319
Thank you.

472
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,039
So cute.

473
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
Can I tie your hair up?

474
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:06,600
Yes.

475
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,120
Did I hurt you?

476
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:33,680
Lili.

477
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,200
Don't be afraid.

478
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,279
I can do magic.

479
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,840
I can make the scar on your forehead

480
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,360
disappear.

481
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,440
Okay?

482
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:45,519
Lili.

483
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,120
You like drawing?

484
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,479
Yes.

485
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,600
Can you teach me how to draw?

486
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,640
Okay.

487
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:53,880
Let's go.

488
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,600
What are you drawing here?

489
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:01,400
The blue sky.

490
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:02,840
Oh.

491
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,880
Do you like him?

492
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,920
Lu.

493
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:10,960
Ah?

494
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,120
Do you like him?

495
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,079
Yeah.

496
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
But he has a girlfriend.

497
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,799
This is just a one-sided thing.

498
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,680
The longer you stare at something,

499
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,640
the more you want it.

500
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,799
What is this?

501
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,360
The sun.

502
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,319
I'll hold this for you.

503
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,279
Okay.

504
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,999
That's right.

505
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,920
Summarize the data and it would be done.

506
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:42,999
Ay.

507
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,239
It's so easy.

508
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,719
I just figured it out.

509
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm so sorry

510
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,200
for making you come all the way here.

511
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,319
It's alright.

512
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:51,880
No worries.

513
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,200
It's your first time doing decoration.

514
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
It's normal to get a little confused.

515
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,559
Thank you very much for your guidance.

516
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:03,039
No.

517
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:03,640
No.

518
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,400
Do you have time?

519
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,400
I'll treat you lunch

520
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,440
to show my gratitude.

521
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:11,840
It's okay.

522
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,559
It's fine.

523
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,319
The thing is, Song.

524
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,680
Our work is almost done.

525
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,160
And Miss Xia and Mr. Xu are not here.

526
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,719
I want to ask
if you are free this afternoon.

527
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,440
I am.

528
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,440
I have two tickets to the aquarium.

529
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,360
Do you want to go?

530
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,319
Oh.

531
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,120
This is a gift from our company.

532
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,120
But I haven't had the time to use it.

533
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,160
Your company is so generous.

534
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,319
I can go.

535
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,360
Really?

536
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:40,880
Yeah.

537
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,200
But you have to wait for me.

538
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,120
I'll go upstairs to change.

539
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,079
Okay.

540
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,680
I'll be quick.

541
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,160
Okay.

542
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:47,799
I...

543
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,640
I'll wait.

544
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:48,999
Okay.

545
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:52,160
Yes.

546
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:56,160
Donghao.

547
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:56,640
Huh?

548
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,519
Come! Quick!

549
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,519
Help me zip it up.

550
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,319
I can't reach it.

551
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:03,840
What are you waiting for?

552
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:05,479
Hey.

553
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,120
It spilled.

554
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,360
Oh.

555
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,039
What are you doing?

556
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:10,600
Come on.

557
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,079
I'll help you.

558
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:15,999
Are you done?

559
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:21,960
Done?

560
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,160
Done.

561
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,200
Thank you.

562
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:27,400
Hey.

563
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,400
Help me with something.

564
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,079
What?

565
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,559
I can never find this piercing.

566
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,680
Help me wear it.

567
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,079
Oh.

568
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:32,799
Come on.

569
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,239
Um.

570
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:38,479
Can you see it?

571
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,640
Yeah.

572
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,319
Slow down.

573
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:47,840
Is it through?

574
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:49,880
Ah.

575
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,680
It went through.

576
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,079
Okay.

577
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,039
It's done.

578
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,279
Thank you.

579
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:02,559
Donghao.

580
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,600
Why is your heart beating so fast?

581
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,479
Are you sick?

582
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:07,079
Huh?

583
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:08,719
No.

584
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,999
It's just a little...

585
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,200
irregular...

586
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,680
You should take more rest.

587
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,120
I'm leaving.

588
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,640
Wait.

589
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,479
Why are you dressing up?

590
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,479
Where are you going?

591
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,519
The aquarium.

592
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,079
With me?

593
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:22,279
With Yu Hui.

594
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:22,719
Ah?

595
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,239
Didn't you ask me

596
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:26,160
to finish what's left with Tan...

597
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,600
Xu.

598
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,680
What's left with Tan Xu?

599
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,519
How can you leave me here alone?

600
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,079
You are so cruel.

601
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,039
Why did you become like this?

602
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:32,719
You want to come?

603
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,200
Of course.

604
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:36,079
Play cute for me.

605
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,559
Song.

606
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,079
Take me with you, Song.

607
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:39,479
That's enough.

608
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:41,479
Come with us if you want to.

609
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:42,479
We'll wait downstairs.

610
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:47,680
Oh.

611
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,239
Here.

612
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,719
Song.

613
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,400
Coffee.

614
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Oh. Thank you.

615
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,479
You're welcome.

616
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:57,999
Ah.

617
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:58,719
I want to drink it too.

618
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,640
My mouth is so dry.

619
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:00,519
Song.

620
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,120
I'll take a sip.

621
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,279
Is this coffee?

622
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:03,999
I bought it for Song.

623
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,600
Then I'll have the popcorn.

624
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:07,880
It's good.

625
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,200
What's that?

626
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,559
That one.

627
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,039
Come on.

628
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,279
Is that a seal?

629
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,360
What are you doing?

630
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:17,840
Donghao.

631
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,400
Help.

632
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,519
Take a picture of me, Donghao.

633
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,079
I'm coming.

634
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
There is one poking its head out.

635
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,319
Look.

636
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,400
I want to take a picture too.

637
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,759
It looks good.

638
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,200
I want to take a picture too.

639
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,999
Together.

640
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:27,559
My arm is longer.

641
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,120
Let me do it.

642
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:28,559
Here.

643
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:29,479
Like this?

644
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:29,999
No.

645
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:30,960
Keep the seals in the shot.

646
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,600
Hold it higher.

647
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,239
Hold it higher.

648
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:32,640
Right.

649
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,120
There it is.

650
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:33,719
Yu Hui.

651
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:34,519
Come to the back.

652
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,120
A little more to the back.

653
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,799
You are tall.

654
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:36,680
You should stand at the back.

655
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,479
The seals are out.

656
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,479
Three, two...

657
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,160
Like this?

658
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,239
One, two, three.

659
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:40,920
Cheese.

660
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,640
Old cucumber.

661
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,559
Dinner time.

662
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,559
Come and eat.

663
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,079
Dinner.

664
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,400
Throw it.

665
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,519
You can do it. Just throw it.

666
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:50,880
What are you doing?

667
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,440
Quick.

668
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,279
Right.

669
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:52,759
It's here.

670
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,200
Give it to me.

671
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,960
Give it to me.

672
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,759
Are you nuts?

673
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:56,519
Give me one.

674
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:56,880
Song.

675
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,400
Look.

676
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,079
Song, look at me.

677
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,680
You look retarded.

678
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,279
Keep doing this.

679
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,200
Like an idiot.

680
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,039
That's not how it does it.

681
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,799
I can do it too.

682
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,479
Come, Song.

683
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,279
Sit.

684
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:11,840
Thank you.

685
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,680
Thank you.

686
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,200
What do you want to drink?

687
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,600
Iced Americano. Thank you.

688
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:22,960
Iced Americano?

689
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:24,239
Orange juice.

690
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,200
No ice.

691
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,840
Large.

692
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:26,559
Thank you.

693
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,840
I'll go get it.

694
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,279
Okay.

695
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,239
Oh. Excuse me.

696
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:37,160
This is...

697
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,719
Wow.

698
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,200
White whale.

699
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,999
It's so beautiful.

700
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,400
White whale is a mammal.

701
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,519
It feeds on fish and invertebrates.

702
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,400
I didn't know you know so much about it.

703
00:30:52,296 --> 00:30:54,824
(Knowledge about white whale)

704
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,519
Do you know where they live?

705
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,160
What kind of question is that?

706
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,400
In the sea, of course.

707
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,999
The deep sea.

708
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:01,360
Wrong.

709
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,759
They live in

710
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,719
the shallow and deep seas
off the coast of the Arctic Ocean

711
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:07,319
and adjacent sea areas.

712
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:08,519
Hehe.

713
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,960
Hey.

714
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,920
I didn't expect that.

715
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,360
When did you get that information?

716
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,239
I read a lot of books.

717
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,279
Hey.

718
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,079
How do you tell its gender?

719
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:17,559
Yeah.

720
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,360
How?

721
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:18,920
Like these two

722
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,960
right here.

723
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,279
What's their gender?

724
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,640
Um.

725
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,519
It's not written here.

726
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,719
Li Donghao!

727
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:42,600
Yu Hui.

728
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,079
Postpone the meeting
with the wood factory

729
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
for an hour.

730
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:47,319
I'll go there later.

731
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:49,039
Yes.

732
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:49,920
Okay.

733
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,640
Bye.

734
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:54,960
Come out.

735
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:56,600
What's wrong?

736
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:58,759
Refresh yourself.

737
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,999
Have some fresh air.

738
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,559
Come on.

739
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,360
Don't you think it looks familiar here?

740
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,120
Does it?

741
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,799
Think again.

742
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,039
We've been here before.

743
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,880
I'll take you somewhere else later.

744
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,479
You'll definitely remember.

745
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,559
Did you see Guan Xin just now?

746
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:52,920
No.

747
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
Why aren't you telling the truth?

748
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,120
I have a promise with him.

749
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,200
I don't want to break my word.

750
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,960
So you did see him.

751
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,479
No.

752
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,519
You saw him.

753
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,759
I said no.

754
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,319
Childish.

755
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:13,799
You are always like this.

756
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,880
Putting your honor at the first place.

757
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:20,279
Since when you become
bros with Guan Xin?

758
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,840
Is it something to be proud of

759
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:22,680
to keep a promise like this with him?

760
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,079
We are not bros.

761
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,479
Are you getting insecure now?

762
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,479
Guan Xin told me
he was going to a seminar.

763
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,960
But I saw Lu Xi.

764
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,960
If that's the case,

765
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,360
the two of us are together too now.

766
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,680
But we are...

767
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,920
Don't think we are that different

768
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,880
from them.

769
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,920
We must look really weird

770
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,960
in Lu Xi's eyes just now.

771
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,600
I didn't want to tell you this.

772
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,079
You asked me

773
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,840
what Guan Xin said
when he was drinking with me.

774
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,920
He said he only has you.

775
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:15,840
He also said

776
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,760
there's nothing between Lu Xi and him.

777
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,880
He can't live without you.

778
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,280
So if you have any doubts,

779
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,039
go ask him in person

780
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,999
and find out what's going on.

781
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,559
Let's go.

782
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,159
Even though I said
nice things about him,

783
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,559
I have no idea

784
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,479
why he wouldn't tell you the truth.

785
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:43,400
In this aspect,

786
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,960
I have never ever hidden
anything from you.

787
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,720
At least I'm all clear

788
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,999
in this regard.

789
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,599
So I'm still better than him.

790
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:54,760
Why are you laughing?

791
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
You have a nice smile though.

792
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,119
Let's go.

793
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,159
You two.

794
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:45,960
Have a look around.

795
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,800
These are the best materials.

796
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,720
Well.

797
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,519
This is good stuff.

798
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:06,762

799
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:11,242

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,639
This is what elm should look like.

802
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,400
Traces of drying,

803
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
and prints of time.

804
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:25,920
You can see them all.

805
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,760
It always takes time
to find good things.

806
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,079
Ah.

807
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,800
You know it when you see good stuff, Miss.

808
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,199
Well.

809
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,440
You spotted that our wood

810
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
is the most authentic.

811
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:51,639
How is it?

00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,599

814
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,880
This one.

815
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,840
Sir.

816
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,479
Can I take some pictures?

817
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,280
Of course.

818
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,159
Take pictures.

819
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:03,999
As many as you want.

820
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,119

It wasn't easy.

834
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,999
I spent a fortune on a piece of wood.

835
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,920
I finally see you cheer up.

836
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,039
You said it like
I'm difficult to deal with.

837
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:05,639
What do you think?

838
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:06,440
I thought over and over again

839
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,920
and still didn't know
how to make you happy.

840
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:11,039
There's nothing to be happy about.

841
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,479
I haven't got a single call

842
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,479
till now.

843
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,800
Don't think about it.

844
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Can't we just have fun for the trip?

845
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,400
If we are having fun,

846
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,800
would they be having fun too?

847
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,840
Do you know you are like crazy now?

848
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,920
You are obsessed.

849
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:31,999
It's true.

850
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:33,679
What's there to be happy about?

851
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,360
I'm 30 now.

852
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,880
I had two boyfriends.

853
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,599
One is even worse than another.

854
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:42,039
Do you think I got off
on the wrong foot?

855
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,079
Hey.

856
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:43,800
Don't insult me.

857
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,320
What's it got to do with me?

858
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,519
For me,

859
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,280
at least

860
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,720
we had some precious memories.

861
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:50,119
Even if I argued with you,

862
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,360
I'd still find it interesting.

863
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,240
You mean if I argue with Guan Xin now,

864
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,880
it'll become a precious memory?

865
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:55,240
Well.

866
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,159
It could be.

867
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:58,679
Maybe you should break up and see.

868
00:38:59,039 --> 00:38:59,880
Let me tell you.

869
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,920
Even argument feels great
after you break up.

870
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,079
Careful about what you say.

871
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,559
Fine.

872
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:07,199
Careful.

873
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,800
I know what you mean.

874
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:09,599
It's...

875
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,159
You know.

876
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,360
You had two relationships.

877
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,800
You want to protect it every time.

878
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,599
You want to catch it

879
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,039
and keep it from breaking.

880
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,800
You feel like
the next one would be better.

881
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,559
But for something like love,

882
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,240
the more you care,
the quicker you lose it.

883
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,760
So,

884
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:24,720
break up and see.

885
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,679
Fine.

886
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,559
Another topic.

887
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:30,800
It's not late.

888
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,800
I'll take you to somewhere else.

889
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,440
Let's go.

890
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,159
You must remember here, right?

891
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,599
Is here where you wanted to take me to?

892
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:15,840
Yes.

893
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,400
This is where we set up a tent

894
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,760
and fished with your dad.

895
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:20,440
Let's go.

896
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,240
Go have a look.

897
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:23,840
No.

898
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,519
Hey.

899
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,320
Just a quick look.

900
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,119
We are here anyway.

901
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,760
Quick.

902
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:38,920
It hasn't changed at all.

903
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,240
It smells so great.

904
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,360
Uncle.

905
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,599
How long do we have to wait to have it?

906
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,440
It's best

907
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:48,440
to have it now.

908
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,199
Have a try.

909
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,119
You have this every day.

910
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:54,960
But this is the first time for me.

911
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,639
And you are still fighting for it?

912
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:57,240
Well.

913
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,599
Ladies first.

914
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,079
Here.

915
00:40:59,079 --> 00:40:59,559
This is yours.

916
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,039
Thank you.

917
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,159
Wow.

918
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:04,840
Smells great.

919
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,320
The soup tastes so special.

920
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,280
Uncle.

921
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,920
Do you have any secret recipe?

922
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,720
What secret?

923
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,639
Dad.

924
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,119
He's trying to flatter you.

925
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:14,800
There is no secret.

926
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,360
Fresh materials are the most important.

927
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,559
You hate our memories so much?

928
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:52,079
Can we go now?

929
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,800
What's wrong?

930
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,999
Just go.

931
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,280
What's wrong?

932
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,519
Are you feeling sick?

933
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:21,800
Why did you turn so pale?

934
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,960
The closest hospital is about
20 minutes' drive away.

935
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,240
Hang in there. I'm taking you there.

936
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:40,999
Xia Tian.

937
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,320
Hang in there.

938
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,280
