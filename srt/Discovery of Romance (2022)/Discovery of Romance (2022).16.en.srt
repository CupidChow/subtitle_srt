Hello, this is DeRUCCI.

34
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,599
We are professionals in
creating a healthy sleep system.

35
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,520
Are you looking for a bed set

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,480
or just a mattress?

37
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,559
I can recommend something for you.

38
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,040
Um.

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,240
You can recommend for us.

Okay.

This way, please.

42

Let's go.

43
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:11,640
Hello.

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,159
You can have a look at this mattress.

45
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,999
This is our newest one.

46
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,719
I don't need such an expensive one.

47
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,719
Bed and mattress are important.

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,279
You work so hard.

49
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,599
It's essential to get some good sleep.

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,240
That's very considerate, sir.

51
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:24,999
You are right.

52
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,520
Now the people in the city
are very stressed.

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,200
Many of them
suffer from sleeping problems.

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,520
This T10 AI smart mattress

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,040
is the newest adjustable mattress.

56
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,399
It will automatically
adjust the softness

57
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,119
according to your body shape
and sleeping position.

58
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,399
Do you and your girlfriend

59
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,999
want to have a try?

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,480
We can do a test on site.

61
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:42,999
No.

62
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,399
We...

63
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,240
We are not a couple.

64
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,439
I'm picking one for her.

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,800
Oh, I see.

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,439
Miss,

67
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,960
do you want to have a try?

68
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,439
That's not necessary.

69
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,480
They will ask us to buy it if I do.

70
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:53,760
Go try it out.

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,439
How else would you know if it's good?

72
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,159
Yeah.

73
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,760
It's okay.

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,480
Come have a try.

75
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:57,999
You came all the way.

76
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:58,520
Here.

77
00:03:58,679 --> 00:03:58,960
It's alright.

78
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,719
Come here.

79
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:00,879
Just have a try.

80
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,480
It won't cost you money.

81
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,240
I'll just try it out, okay?

82
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,599
Ay.

83
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,040
It's okay.

84
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,279
Here, put them up here.

85
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,719
Wow.

86
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,279
How is it?

87
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,119
Um.

88
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:08,920
Besides automatic adjustment,

89
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
you can also use an application

90
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,279
on your phone

91
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,640
to adjust its softness

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,279
and check your sleeping report.

93
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,200
Look here.

94
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,719
Do you need any adjustment

95
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:17,599
anywhere?

96
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,239
I think this is nice enough.

97
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,919
Um.

98
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
This feels so good.

99
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:25,680
Wait.

100
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,799
It's not that good.

101
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,399
Maybe we should check out others?

102
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:31,760
I want this one, please.

103
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,880
And also a same-sized

104
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,839
single bed.

105
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,359
Okay.

106
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,200
No problem.

107
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,039
Is there anything else
you want to have a look?

108
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't bother.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,760
Pack this gel pillow for me

110
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,599
as well.

111
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,200

it seems that you know quite well

113
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,520
about our brand and products.

114
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll place the order for you right away.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,239
I'll need an address from you.

116
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:47,719
Later,

we'll have someone
deliver it to your home.

118
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:49,960
Okay.

119

Dr. Guan.

151
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
Why do I feel like

152
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,399
you are so familiar?

153
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,799
Maybe

154
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,239
you have met someone

155
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,200
who's similar to me.

156
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,279
Um.

157
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:26,239
Right.

158
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,239
You are so much like my brother.

159
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,599
When I was little,

160
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,359
he helped me a lot.

161
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,839
Now you are helping me a lot too.

162
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:44,200
Well...

163
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,760
How did he help you?

164
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,080
He shared my pain

165
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:50,919
to stop me from crying.

166
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,599
That's good.

167
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,200
Sharing pain

168
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,159
is much harder than sharing happiness.

169
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:01,799
Of course.

170
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,640
You can share happiness with anyone.

171
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,200
But you can only share your pain

172
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,919
with someone who loves you.

173
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,359
Only those who love you

174
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,960
can be trusted.

175
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,279
Hello.

176
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,599
Hello. Where are you?

177
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,479
Why are you not at work?

178
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:29,960
I'm on leave today.

179
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:30,719
What is it?

180
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,640
Anything in the hospital?

181
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,359
We have a couple patients at the A&E.

182
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,320
Come back now.

183
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,160
I went out.

184
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,960
Will be back in a moment.

185
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,519
(Are you)

186
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,839
(with that girl again?)

187
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:43,719
I know what I'm doing.

188
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,080
Don't worry about it.

189
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,239
I'll be back soon.

190
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:48,960
Dr. Guan.

191
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,359
You have work to do?

192
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,479
Just go.

193
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:52,719
Okay.

194
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,200
Everything's settled here.

195
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,160
I am leaving.

196
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,560
Um.

197
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,759
Thank you.

198
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:58,879
You don't have to say that with me.

199
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,080
Come on.

200
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,639
Pull yourselves together, everyone.

201
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,560
Song came all the way here today

202
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,040
to discuss the details with us.

203
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,200
If there's anything we can't figure out,

204
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,440
we'll call Miss Xia,

205
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:16,719
okay?

206
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,200
Okay.

207
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
What's wrong?

208
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,879
Get the spirit up.

209
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,359
I just asked you to send a proposal.

210
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,040
And you can't even get that done?

211
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,599
If you can't even do that,

212
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,999
why don't you buy a ticket and go home?

213
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
Are you stupid?

214
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,040
Cao Li, did you order the products?

215
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,639
Yes, I did.

216
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,280
You did?

217
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,759
Wow.

218
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,960
You guys...

219
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,560
It must be very hard for you.

220
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,839
Song.

221
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,080
I am so sorry

222
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,759
to have you

223
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,999
come all the way here.

224
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,639
Ay.

225
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,239
It's alright.

226
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,200
This is what we should do.

227
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,400
Since I'm here today,

228
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,200
we can talk about all the details

229
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,920
that you need to know.

230
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,560
Come on.

231
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,839
Get the spirit up.

232
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,239
Come on.

233
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,802
♪When I'm awake♪

234
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,162
♪I suddenly found♪

235
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:58,682
♪You tilted your face♪

236
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,720
♪Like the reflection in the water♪

237
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:04,482
♪Clear and transparent♪

238
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:09,562
♪You're my love♪

239
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:14,042
♪You're my love forever♪

240
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,479
For the study area

241
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,719
and all the children's area,

242
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,479
we choose round shaped ones.

243
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:21,119
The carpet looks pretty good this way.

244
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,560
So now...

245
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,160
How is it?

246
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,160
Anything we haven't covered?

247
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,479
Yes.

248
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,320
Work's done.

249
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,400
Yes.

250
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,160
Good job, everyone.

251
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,160
No.

252
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,440
No.

253
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,400
Good job to you guys.

254
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,040
Anybody wants a drink?

255
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,999
Song.

256
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:35,719
Are you coming with us?

257
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,680
Sure.

258
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,759
I know a place.

259
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,800
Let's go together.

260
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,800
Okay.

261
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,560
Get your stuff.

262
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,119
Come on.

263
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,560
Let's sit here.

264
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,719
I have made adjustment for 20 times.

265
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,479
We used to come here often.

266
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:47,879
Really?

267
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,280
Yeah.

268
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,920
This is our place.

269
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,440
Waitress.

270
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:53,759
Yes, sir.

271
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,759
Can I help you?

272
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,759
Get us a bottle of Saki

273
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,719
and four glasses.

274
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:57,719
Keep it warm.

275
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,040
Small world.

276
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,280
You know him?

277
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,879
My old crush.

278
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,440
Here.

279
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,400
We were so busy with work.

280
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,400
Finally, we've got time to have a date.

281
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,440
How much can a bottle of wine cost you?

282
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,519
Never once have we
really had fun on a date.

283
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,999
Always so stingy.

284
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,759
You use a coupon even at a bar.

285
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,879
And the last time
when you treated my friends,

286
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,200
of all the restaurants in the mall,

287
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,839
you just chose
the one that has coupons.

288
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,800
Do you know how ashamed I was?

289
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,800
That was the first time
you met my friends.

290
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,359
Couldn't you just spare more money?

291
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,280
Do I not deserve it?

292
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,960
We even always split the bills.

293
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,759
Oh, my.

294
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,879
I see you are just cheap.

295
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,719
Don't you think you are going too far?

296
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,359
Am I?

297
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,839
Aren't you the one going too far?

298
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:49,759
Hey.

299
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,200
Excuse me.

300
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,759
Sorry to interrupt you.

301
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:53,519
Long time no see.

302
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,359
Song?

303
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,479
This is a small place.

304
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,040
You were so loud just now.

305
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,519
I heard everything

306
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,359
even though I wasn't trying to.

307
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,119
Hey.

308
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,200
Did he use coupons again?

309
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,440
Yes.

310
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:11,879
I knew it.

311
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,320
Didn't you ask me

312
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,599
to tell you all about him last time?

313
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,359
Today is the day.

314
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:16,719
Hey.

315
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:17,800
I'll tell you all about it.

316
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:18,479
Hey, scoot over.

317
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,719
Come on.

318
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,320
Move it.

319
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,040
I've known Tan Xu

320
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,239
longer than you.

321
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,280
Tan Xu

322
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,639
is such a stingy person.

323
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,320
Really?

324
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,839
It's true.

325
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:33,680
He didn't ask you

326
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
to pay for this?

327
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,639
That's good enough.

328
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,040
He started doing part-time jobs

329
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,080
even in high school

330
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,479
to save money for his family.

331
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:42,560
When he was in college,

332
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,479
he barely asked his family
for any money.

333
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:45,440
Oh.

334
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,200
In college,

335
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,920
he was the head of our club.

336
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,519
But he rarely came
to our club activities.

337
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,440
Because he saved all the money

338
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,280
instead of using it to have fun.

339
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:55,160
Do you know what the money is for?

340
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,519
He used it to help those students

341
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,639
who really needed that money.

342
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,280
Stop it, Song.

343
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,519
I have to say it.

344
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,080
Tan Xu is still helping

345
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,879
those students in underdeveloped areas

346
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,160

347
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,359
Do you know that?

348
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,479
And I want to ask you this.

349
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,960
You think using coupons is shameful?

350
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:15,560
If you really think

351
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,479
that way,

352
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,759
then I'll say

353
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,280
that you don't deserve him at all.

354
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,879
You deserve him.

355
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
You can have him.

356
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,680
I know.

357
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm probably not entitled to say this.

358
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,320
But...

359
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,759
I'm sorry.

360
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,599
Thank you.

361
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,879
I was just saying what I know.

362
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,400
That was so cool, Song.

363
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:05,759
Awesome.

364
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,320
So great.

365
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,680
You did great.

366
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,040
Here, have a drink.

367
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,560
Cheers.

368
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,879
Let's order something else.

369
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,719
Okay.

370
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:18,999
Don't just drink.

371
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:19,479
Okay.

372
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:19,800
Yeah.

373
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Waitress.

374
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,119
Song.

375
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:32,800
What is it?

376

(Pick me up, Xia Tian.)

377

Where are you?

378
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,879
You got drunk again?

379
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:43,519
Hello.

380

What is it?

381
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,040
Song got drunk?

382
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:47,599
Oh.

383
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:48,359
I just got off work.

384
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,200
I'll be right back.

385
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,320
I'll be home when you are.

386
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,320
Be careful.

387
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:54,800
Xia Tian said Song got drunk again.

388
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,960
We should go back quick.

389
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,320
Okay.

390
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,320
It's not her first time.

391
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,119
She drank too much a lot.

392
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,560
Have you even loved me?

393
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,479
It never counts.

394
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:51,879
Dear missy.

395
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,999
Why did you drink so much again?

396
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:53,560
Whoops.

Go sleep.

Ay.

401
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,119
Why are you so heavy?

402
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,560
Why are you here?

403
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,920
I was switching shifts with Donghao.

404
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,920
I sent him back.

405
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:02,879

What did I do?

411
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,840
Why did I send something like that?

412

Ay.

413
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,120
This is humiliating.

414
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,960
Why did I send something like that?

Why did I have to do that?

Why?

00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:20,160
Wow.

419
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,120
What are you doing?

420
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
You drank so much again?

421
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,319
Ah?

422
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,759
Someone sent you a message last night.

423
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,680
Two in the morning.

424
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,120
A man asks a woman if she's asleep.

425
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,680
How should I interpret that?

426
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,559
He must have sent it
to the wrong person.

427
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,039
"Are you asleep?"

428
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,519
What if you are?

429
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,600
And what if you are not?

430
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,039
You just work together.

431
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:00,960
Is that really necessary?

432
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,479
Maybe he was drunk.

433
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,680
Give me your phone.

434
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,799
Just forget about it.

435
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,160
Enough.

436
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,880
Stop it.

437
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,999
Sit down and take a break.

438
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,239
Why isn't she texting me back?

439
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,840
Do you think it's possible

440
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
that she had a bad signal last night

441
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,200
and didn't get the message?

442
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:46,519
Or she was just as drunk as I was.

443
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,200
She saw it

444
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:47,960
but forgot about it?

445
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,120
Why am I so nervous right now?

446
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,759
Why nervous?

447

Don't be.

448
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,120
You can't take it back.

You know?

00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,920
I was thinking...

You pick it up.

00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,160
Me?

453
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,079
Ah.

454
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:03,759
Just pick it up.

455
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,079
Do it.

519
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,999
Why don't you come lend a hand?

520
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,160
Set up everything.

521
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,160
Let me know when you're done.

522
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,039
I'm talking to you.

523
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,559
Can't you hear?

524
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,880
You won't ask me
how Xia Tian is doing lately?

525
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,400
Will you tell me

526
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,360
if I do?

527
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:28,759
I will tell you

528
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:29,640
if you ask me today.

529
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,600
How is she?

530
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,960
Very good.

531
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,600
She went on a date with Guan Xin.

532
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,559
So,

533
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
you'd better forget about her.

534
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,640
Don't drown yourself

535
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,680
in liquor all day.

536
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,360
Look at yourself.

537
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,600
You are like a corpse.

538
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,120
No one wants to see that.

539
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,559
Get yourself together.

540
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,759
Here

541
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,680
is a popular hotel.

542
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,400
It took me so long to book.

543
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:04,200
Do you like it?

544
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,600
How long are we staying here?

545
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,120
Um...

546
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,039
How long do you want?

547
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,479
Xia Tian.

548
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,719
Here.

549
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,559
Cheers.

550
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,120
Xia Tian.

551
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,559
Why are you dating me?

552
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,360
What kind of question is that?

553
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:09,519
I just

554
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,759
want to know.

555
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:12,719
We have never

556
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:13,960
really talked about this.

557
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:17,840
What about you?

558
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,519
Why do you like me?

559
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,519
Um.

560
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,880
When I first met you,

561
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,319
I was supposed to
be introduced to Song.

562
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,079
But she said you were done dating.

563
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,239
I saw you

564
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,680
drinking the beer,

565
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:36,920
and eating the meat.

566
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:38,400
And your eyes

567
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,079
were sparkling.

568
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,840
And I thought I really like this girl.

569
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,479
I have never met anyone

570
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,680
quite like you.

571
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,319
Why didn't you tell me this?

572
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,239
What if you get smug?

573
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,799
It wasn't easy to
get a hold of you for a start.

574
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,160
I didn't know

575
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,559
you had some secrets.

576
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,600
But I'm not always like that.

577
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:07,600
That night,

578
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,999
it was like a hangover.

579
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,519
I had never been so impetuous.

580
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,759
And you?

581
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,319
Why do you like me?

582
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,319
Because you are polite,

583
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:23,880
warm,

584
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,120
and kind.

585
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,960
What if

586
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,079
I weren't the polite

587
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,360
and kind doctor?

588
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,200
In this world,

589
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,920
there are many people who are polite,

590
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,519
warm,

591
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,160
and kind.

592
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,120
Let alone doctors.

593
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,920
Donghao is not bad.

594
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,479
Why does it have to be you?

595
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,160
Being polite,

596
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,640
warm and kind is just a part of you.

597
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,400
But I like all of you.

598
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:26,719
Hello.

599
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,400
Excuse me.

600
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,920
The toilet paper is out over here.

601
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Can you share me some?

602
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,319
Thank you.

603
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:39,719
Song?

604
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
Xia Tian?

605
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,840
Hey.

606
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,360
I thought Guan Xin and you
went out on a date.

607
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,440
Why are you here?

608
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,559
We wanted to go somewhere farther.

609
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,200
But it's heavily raining there.

610
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,880
So we came here.

611
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:54,999
Oh.

612
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,719
And you?

613
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,840
We're here to have a group event here.

614
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:58,840
Oh, wait.

615
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,039
I told Xu Zehao today

616
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:03,120
that Guan Xin and you went on a date.

617
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,319
Why did you tell him that?

618
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,200
I wanted to save him.

619
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,319
You have no idea

620
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,640
what he's like in the company

621
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,999
in the past few days.

622
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,039
He's drunk all the time.

623
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,799
I really can't see him go on like that.

624
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,440
So I wanted to help him.

625
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,120
Dr. Guan?

626
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,079
Um.

627
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:23,880
Hello.

628
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,960
You are Miss Xia's boyfriend, right?

629
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,360
Right.

630
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,600
We have met in the Karaoke room.

631
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,440
Do you remember?

632
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:30,160
Oh.

633
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,039
It's you.

634
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:31,719
Hello.

635
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:31,960
Hey.

636
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,759
Our company is having
a group event here.

637
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:35,559
We are going to play games later.

638
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,999
Mr. Xu and Song are here too.

639
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,360
You should...

640
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:37,920
Guan Xin.

641
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:40,160
What a coincidence.

642
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,719
The toilet paper ran out
in the restroom cubicle.

643
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,519
And Xia Tian is right next to me.

644
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,279
Ay.

645
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,960
Otherwise I wouldn't even know
that you are here.

646
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:46,880
If I didn't go there

647
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,039
or the paper didn't run out,

648
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,600
I would never have met you.

649
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,160
This is fate.

650
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,999
I can't believe it.

651
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:53,400
I was just asking Dr. Guan to join us.

652
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,120
Miss Xia.

653
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,600
I haven't seen you for a while.

654
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,479
You should join us.

655
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,999
Um. That's right.

656
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,319
We all know each other anyway.

657
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,600
Let's go.

658
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:04,719
Dr. Guan.

659
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,680
This is freshly grilled.

660
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,039
Have it.

661
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:11,920
Have it when it's hot.

662
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,440
Pass it over there.

663
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,079
Not for me.

664
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,120
Here.

665
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,319
Here.

666
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,120
Have it.

667
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,160
Everyone got food and drinks, right?

668
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,759
Yeah.

669
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,279
Now I announce

670
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,999
that the most exciting moment

671
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,079
in our group event this time

672
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,920
starts.

673
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:31,799
Here we go.

674
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,559
The one who gives a correct answer

675
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,200
to the question

676
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,319
will receive a thousand yuan

677
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:39,519
from our boss, Mr. Xu.

678
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,039
Boss!

679
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,600
Boss!

680
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,719
Boss!

681
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,600
Guys,

682
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,840
look who's here.

683
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,799
Miss Xia.

684
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:47,999
Make some space.

685
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:48,319
Give it to me.

686
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,759
I met her in the restroom.

687
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,479
Can you imagine?

688
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,239
Really?

689
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:51,759
What chance is that?

690
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:52,600
You certainly found

691
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,999
the right time to come.

692
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:54,279
It's alright.

693
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,120
We just started.

694
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,759
What is this?

695
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,719
Pop quiz.

696
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:57,840
With prizes.

697
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,440
Oh.

698
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,079
Are you ready?

699
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,799
The first question.

700
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:04,039
Well,

701
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,239
I believe everybody loves
flowers and trees.

702
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,799
Flowers have their meanings.

703
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,519
And trees

704
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,479
each convey something too.

705
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,640
Personally,

706
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,920
I really like

707
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,440
pine trees.
[*Chinese for pine tree is "Song".]

708
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,239
Okay.

709
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,039
The first question.

710
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,479
What's the meaning of cherry trees?

711
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,279
"I love you."

712
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,719
I love you too.

713
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,719
But wrong answer.

714
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:31,600
"I miss you."

715
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,079
Ay.

716
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:32,719
I don't miss you.

717
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,160
Then what is it?

718
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,600
Did you make this on your own?

719
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:41,640
Yeah.

720
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,479
It's made from cherry tree.

721
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,920
Do you know what cherry tree means?

722
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:47,719
I don't know.

723
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,400
What is it?

724
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,279
The one and only love.

725
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,759
The one and only me.

726
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,840
Oh.

727
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,400
Xia Tian?

728
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,039
The one and only love.

729
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:06,759
Wow.

730
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,319
You got it right.

731
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,160
Wow.

732
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,799
The first question.

733
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,680
The prize.

734
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,799
Xia Tian, the prize.

735
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,960
Awesome.

736
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,360
Impressive.

737
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,759
What are our colleagues doing?

738
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:18,479
Come on.

739
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,360
I will definitely get the second right.

740
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,719
Wait and see.

741
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:22,400
We'll see.

742
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,039
The second question.

743
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,360
There was once a beautiful love

744
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,600
presented to me,

745
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:28,120
but I didn't cherish it.

746
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,200
After I lost it,

747
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,120
I began to regret.

748
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,440
These lines are from...

749
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,479
A Chinese Odyssey.

750
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,519
Sit down.

751
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,400
The prize.

752
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,120
Sit down!

753
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,600
I didn't finish yet.

754
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:40,360
The main character of
the movie A Chinese Odyssey...

755
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,759
The theme song.

756
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:41,840
I know.

757
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,519
Stephen Chow.

758
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,160
Yeah.

759
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,200
Wait till I finish the question.

760
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:46,440
Listen.

761
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,400
When was the movie A Chinese Odyssey
starred Stephen Chow

762
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,079
re-released in Mainland China?

763
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,200
When was it?

764
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,799
The re-release?

765
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,279
Yeah.

766
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,079
Search it on the phone.

767
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,279
The re-release.

768
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,440
Put your phone down.

769
00:33:58,719 --> 00:33:59,440
No cheating.

770
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,360
I think I watched it

771
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,880
on my computer when I was little.

772

I can't get mad with the boss.

Why are you back?

795

I thought you wouldn't be back
till the end of month.

796
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,679
Today is your birthday.

797
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,280
So I asked for leave,

798
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,360
and came back to watch a movie with you.

799

I'll go back tomorrow morning.

You always wanted to see the movie.

Since this is your wish,

Take your guess.

861
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,320
Christmas tree.

862
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,679
How can it be?

863
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,079
Xia Tian.

864
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,119
What are you looking for?

865
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,599
We've been looking for two hours.

866
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,199
I made research yesterday.

867
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,320
It should be around here.

868
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,840
There's a 300-year-old twinned trunk.

869
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:38,199
Twinned trunk.

870
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,679
But I can't find it.

871
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,039
Maybe we can look for it some other day.

872
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,960
Maybe somewhere else has one too.

873
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,280
I'll find it for you.

874
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,800
Really?

875
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,519
Really.

876
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,080
Twinned trunks?
