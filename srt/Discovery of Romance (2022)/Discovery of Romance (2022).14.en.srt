Long time no see.

20
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,480
Ms. An?

21
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,920
Long time no see.

22
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,280
I'll get straight to the point.

23
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,400
You are in charge of design
for the guesthouse project.

24
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,040
Yes.

25
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,640
It must've gone well
working with your ex-boyfriend.

26
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,000
He can make compromises
for you anytime.

27
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,959
What's that got to do with the project?

28
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,280
Do you really believe
it's got nothing to do with it?

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,479
Both of us know Xu Zehao very well.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
He's impulsive

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,879
and emotional.

32
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,560
Have you heard about

33
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,759
the cost overrun?

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,759
This guesthouse project is one of
the most important projects

35
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,159
of our company this year.

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,520
But to realize

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,039
your so-called personalized design,

38
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,840
we kept reworking.

39
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,080
So not only would we have no profit,

40
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,240
we would actually lose money.

41
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,199
In this project,

42
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,599
our studio is only
in charge of the design.

43
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,039
And we only charge for the design fee.

44
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,599
We don't know about anything else.

45
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,960
I found out that you started this studio

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,400
four years ago,

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,840
with a registered capital of
one million yuan.

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,120
During the time,

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,520
I found you had no design

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,000
or any other works.

51
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,840
Is it correct to presume

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
that this guesthouse project

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,000
is the first big project
you've ever taken?

54
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,240
Yes.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,680
Of course I understand

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,199
that it's none of your concern
if we make profits or not.

57
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,599
But it's very obvious

58
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,960
that Xu Zehao as the client
has indulged you.

59
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,400
I believe

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
if it were someone else as the client,

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,560
he would never choose your proposal.

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,560
So I think

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,599
it's best for us

64
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,479
to terminate the contract

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,400
and stop our loss.

66
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,199
This is a very sudden announcement.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,479
I need some time to think about it.

68
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,400
I don't know if you have seen

69
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,479
the design proposal.

70
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,199
If you are okay with the design

71
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,240
and only have problems with the cost,

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,520
I can think of some way to adjust it.

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,759
But I don't think it's really necessary

74
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,319
to terminate the contract.

75
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,120
Don't you understand?

76
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,400
The overrun is only part of the reason.

77
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,400
Most importantly,

78
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,360
Xu Zehao will keep being emotional

79
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,680
because you are involved in the project.

80
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,960
I, as a business partner,

81
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,400
cannot just watch us losing money

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,199
and keep it going.

83
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,240
Excuse me.

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,840
Mr. Yu.

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,039
Ah.

86
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,919
I'm on my way.

87
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,639
Okay.

88
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,360
Sorry.

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
I have work today.

90
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Then I'll cut long story short.

91
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,000
Read this contract carefully.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,159
I'm making a generous offer.

93
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,319
I won't take back
the money you received.

94
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,560
I hope to get an early reply.

95
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,800
Ms. An.

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,839
Boss.

97
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,160
I just contacted Xia Song Studio.

98
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,920
They'll check and accept
the wood materials at 11 this morning.

99
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,399
Let Song do it.

100
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,480
Are you sure?

101
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,319
But it's Xia Tian who's been keeping up
with the wood materials.

102
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,240
Boss?

103
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,439
Bo...

104
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,319
Ay.

105
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,279
What was that?

106
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,560
Am I living on a rollercoaster?

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,759
How am I going to tell Xia Tian?

108
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,800
In this contract,

109
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,560
the two parties work together equally,

110
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
instead of just ordering and submitting.

111
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,800
I hope you will listen to

112
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,920
some of my opinions.

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,839
I admit

114
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,319
that I don't have much experience
in designing big projects.

115
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,199
But it doesn't mean
I'm not capable of it.

116
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,759
Isn't it a little partial

117
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,439
to assess my ability
by the scale of our company?

118
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,040
Maybe you haven't done
a thorough background investigation.

119
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,639
My graduation project got in the ADA.

120
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,560
So I hope you can have a better look at

121
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,759
my design proposal.

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
If it's okay with you,

123
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,199
I can think of something
to make up for the overrun.

124
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,199
And,

125
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,959
this project was brought to me

126
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,000
by Xu Zehao.

127
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,040
He wanted to find a younger

128
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,560
and more creative team.

129
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,120
He chose our studio

130
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,959
because of

131
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,199
our distinct design style.

132
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,439
If your cost overrun is only caused

133
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,519
by the wrong choice of Party B,

134
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,399
shouldn't Xu Zehao

135
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,959
take most of the responsibility?

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,879
Mr. Yu.

137
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,800
Oh.

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,199
Something came up this morning.

139
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:52,800
I'll go now.

140

and check the materials today.)

(You don't have to come.)

143
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,480
Why?

144
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,279
(Well...)

145
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,000
(It's Mr. Xu's decision.)

146
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,079
Okay.

147
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,040
I got it.

148
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,279
I can see your basis of cooperation

149
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,360
is not as strong as you thought.

150
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,279
Oh.

151
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm not trying to belittle you.

152
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,120
I'm a working woman too.

153
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,639
I know too well how difficult it is

154
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,399
for a woman to achieve something

155
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,879
in the current society.

156
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,360
So I think

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,000
you should reflect on this

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
and do some thinking

159
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,639
as to whether you got this project

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,399
because of your ability

161
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,160
or something else.

162
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,160
I've examined this batch.

163
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,920
It's all good.

164
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,759
When the second batch

165
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,279
arrived,

166
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,360
have a check very carefully.

167
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,199
Okay.

168
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,480
Xu Zehao.

169
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,399
You can go.

170
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,120
Yes, Mr. Xu.

171
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,319
Why?

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,800
There's no reason.

173
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:13,600
Xu Zehao.

174
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,240
What do you mean?

175
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,000
What do you take Xia Tian and me for?

176
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,240
Should we always come and go

177
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,959
at your call?

178
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,000
Did you forget
how you came to our studio

179
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,519
and begged us to work with you?

180
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,160
I admit it.

181
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,639
I was a little careless.

182
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,000
I should be the one to be sorry.

184
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
I was blind.

185
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,000
I forgot

186
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,920
that you are a selfish

187
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,720
and arrogant person.

188
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,639
I wasn't wrong.

189
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,519
You are even more cold-blooded now.

190
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,560
Gross.

191
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,079
Here.

192
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:07,639
Ay.

193
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,439
Don't mind it.

194
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,720
He's not any good anyway.

195
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,439
How about this?

196
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,199
We can find some place
to have a little drink

197
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,639
tonight.

198
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,680
I'll go see my mom tonight.

199
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,240
You should go home.

200
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,480
Okay.

201
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,240
Say hello to her for me.

202
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,279
Call me if you need anything.

203
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,040
Yeah.

204
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,839
Bye.

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,080
Drink it when it's still warm.

206
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,240
Mom.

207
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,080
I want to talk to you about Lu Xi.

208
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,799
I had a little fight with Xia Tian

209
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,639
the other day because of Lu Xi.

210
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,200
So,

211
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:57,720
I think...

212
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,399
I should talk to you about it.

213
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,399
Her again?

214
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,600
Why do you always bring her up?

215
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,080
I think I need to
tell Xia Tian the truth.

216
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,480
And...

217
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,720
She has already met Lu Xi.

218
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,519
Xia Tian misunderstood me many times

219
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,600
because of Lu Xi.

220
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
Didn't I tell you not to see her?

221
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,759
I don't want people
to find out your real identity.

222
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,679
I don't want them to know

223
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,320
that I'm not your biological mother.

224
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,080
Your father and I came to a new place

225
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,960
for our family to have a new start.

226
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,720
It wasn't easy, son.

227
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,080
I know that, mom.

228
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,679
I know you've given me a lot.

229
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,360
If I didn't meet you,

230
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,879
maybe I'd have the same life as Lu Xi's.

231
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,639
Maybe Lu Xi would have

232
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,159
the same life as mine.

233
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
It's like I took away everything

234
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,759
that would have belonged to her.

235
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,240
So I just want to

236
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,960
give her back something

237
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,559
that I received from you.

238
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,559
Even if it's just ten percent.

239
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't blame yourself for her.

240
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,679
It was me who gave up adopting her.

241
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,240
If anyone should feel guilty, it's me.

242
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,039
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

243
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,000
Mom.

244
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,759
I've never disobeyed you.

245
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,960
But this time,

246
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,600
can you let me make the decision?

247
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,120
Did Xia Tian agree to marry you?

248
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,639
If not,

249
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
you should think it over again.

250
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:36,944
(Yinshe Yard)

251
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,000
Ay.

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,679
This soup is good,

253
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,320
much better than the beef in sauce.

254
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,919
Stop overreacting.

255
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:51,679
Ah?

256
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,200
This restaurant
has opened for ten years.

257
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,120
I can't cook.

258
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,600
This is takeaway?

259
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,840
Still good.

260
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,639
Xia Tian.

261
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,120
Just in time.

262
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,159
Did you eat?

263
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,480
Come here.

264
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,360
I'll pour some soup for you.

265
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,480
This fish soup

266
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,279
is so tasty.

267
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, well, well.

268
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,799
Come on.

269
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,080
Have a try.

270
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,159
What's wrong?

271
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,480
This soup is from the restaurant
my dad went to all the time, right?

272
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,679
This month's rent.

273
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,759
I'll pay you next time.

274
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,639
She's missing her dad?

275
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,399
None of your business.

276
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,039
Just eat.

277
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,559
This fish soup

278
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,559
is not for me,

279
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,440
but your late husband.

280
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,879
You are jealous of a dead man?

281
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
You can't forget about him?

282
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,799
Is that why

283
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,879
you can't accept me?

284
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,480
Are you nuts?

285
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,000
I...

286
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,000
Let me ask you.

287
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,919
The lovers that you divorced,

288
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,559
broke up with,

289
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,759
or died.

290
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Are they really that bad?

291
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,759
Just because of that,
you won't take the soup,

292
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,679
you won't watch their movies,

293
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,960
or you won't touch their things?

294
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,120
Don't you think you are childish?

295
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,000
How old are you now?

296
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,360
Don't play innocent with me.

297
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,039
But it really isn't necessary

298
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:44,039
to watch the movies anymore.

299
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:44,559
Just eat.

300
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,840
It was Detective Chinatown I
when he was alive.

301
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,639
Now even the third one was out.

302
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Finish your food and go home.

303
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,480
Eat.

304
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,440
Why are you staring at me?

305
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,200
I just feel

306
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,919
you are more handsome now.

307
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,320
Stop it, senior.

308
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,399
We haven't parted for that long.

309
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,039
For real though.

310
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,799
I always thought you'd be emotional

311
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,679
when you work with Xia Tian.

312
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,559
I didn't think you'd realize

313
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,840
the problems so quick.

314
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,279
Just five years ago,

315
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,759
you were still an indecisive

316
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,639
and impetuous kid.

317
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,600
What do you mean?

318
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,799
I was afraid you wouldn't stop
working with her.

319
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,120
So I went to see her

320
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,799
after I came back.

321
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,399
You went to see her?

322
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,559
Before I came back,

323
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,600
I saw the financial statement
of this project.

324
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,480
We're losing so much money.

325
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,360
I figured you wouldn't
get new suppliers.

326
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,639
So,

327
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,159
I had to get rid of her.

328
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:54,679
Hey.

329
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,679
Don't think I'm cruel.

330
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,440
I did it for the company.

331
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,320
Why did you do that?

332
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,679
I wasn't going to
terminate the contract with her.

333
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,480
Huh?

334
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,080
Didn't you tell her today

335
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,480
not to go check the materials?

336
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,240
Now I'm at fault in this?

337
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,559
I have my reasons to tell her that.

338
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
I wasn't going to
terminate the contract.

339
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,279
During the time you were abroad,

340
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,279
we agreed that I'd
take charge of all the projects.

341
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,879
Why did you start meddling
as soon as you came back?

342
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,480
The financial statement
doesn't mean anything.

343
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,960
You can at least do some investigation.

344
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,879
I overestimated you.

345
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,600
You didn't mature at all.

346
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,120
Do you think I didn't do that?

347
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,159
Her studio can never reach our standard

348
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,440
for business partners,

349
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,519
whether their ability

350
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,399
or scale.

351
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:40,799
Oh, wait.

352
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,159
She does have something notable.

353
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,440
She once got into the ADA design award.

354
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,720
But she withdrew from the competition.

355
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,759
That means she has
no ambition in her profession.

356
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,159
She just gave it up like that.

357
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,639
What did you just say?

358
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,799
What?

359
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,240
She got into ADA,

360
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,080
and then withdrew?

361
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Yes, just your ex-girlfriend.

362
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,720
Why are you so anxious?

363
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,960
I just think

364
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,240
you wouldn't give her the project

365
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,639

avoid meeting Xia Tian.

to avoid meeting her.

Xia Tian is not in the studio now.

Did Xia Tian get into

It was fortunate enough
that she could graduate.

After all, I don't have

Maybe I am too headstrong.

I'm still trying to prove my talent

473

when I can hardly feed myself.

474

Talented people are
allowed to be headstrong.

But talent doesn't feed you.

It doesn't.

Why can't I do that?

480

Have you heard of

481
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,599
how the book To Kill A Mockingbird

482
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,160
was created?

483
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,039
The author is Harper Lee.

484
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,119
At one Christmas,

485
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:02,799
her friend gave her
a whole year worth of salary.

486
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,799
So,

487
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,480
she didn't need to work
for a whole year.

488
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,000
She put her whole mind to the book.

489
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,759
Then,

490
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,359
the famous To Kill A Mockingbird

491
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,200
was created.

492
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,519
So?

493
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,720
So

494
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,559
even a friend can give away
a year worth of salary.

495
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,400
A boyfriend is even more obliged

496
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,480
to do so.

497
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,480
You want me to drop it?

498
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,799
Not really.

499
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,160
I want you to be the one to choose.

500
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,480
I don't like Xu Zehao.

501
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,400
But it'll be a real shame

502
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,279
if you quit because of that.

503
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,160
Thank you.

504
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,960

00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,720
(whether when you are happy or not.)

509
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,000
(And you believe
that they'll think of you too.)

510
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,599
(This is probably
the point of a relationship.)

511
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,319
(But for some feeling,
you can't keep waiting.)

512
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,000
(If you keep waiting,)

513
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,160
(you'll eventually absorb it yourself.)

514
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,519
(If that happens too much,)

515
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,200
(you won't need each other anymore.)

516
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,279
(Fortunately,)

517
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,400
(Guan Xin and I)

518
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,839
(don't have that problem yet.)

519
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,000
(He makes me feel safe.)

520
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,039
I'm a little hungry.

521
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,799
Let's grab something to eat.

522
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,920
Let's go.

523
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:54,799
Ah.

524
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,599
You got up so early.

525
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,160
You came back to life?

526
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:03,640
Yeah.

527
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,440
Make do with the breakfast.

528
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,039
This is the best I can do.

529
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,240
I'm fine with it.

530
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,759
It's all good as long as
you can take care of yourself.

531
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,359
But I can't even
take care of myself now.

532
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,119
In your third grade,

533
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,759
I got your hair cut short.

534
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,519
You were disgruntled for a week.

535
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,160
You didn't get into a good high school.

536
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,880
You stayed at home for three days.

537
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,279
You got into the university,

538
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,799
and had a break-up.

539
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,519
You were down

540
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,119
for half a year.

541
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:28,880
That's enough.

542
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,440
Was that you?

543
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,920
Why do you have to bring them up?

544
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,039
Project cancelled.

545
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:33,559
You were only down for one day.

546
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:34,880
That's good.

547
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:35,960
I see progress.

548
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,960
You are better
with emotion management now.

549
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,839
I'll take it as a compliment.

550
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,240
Ms. Wu.

551
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,240
But who told you
the project is cancelled?

552
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,480
It isn't?

553
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,240
Great.

554
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,359
I wanted to give you a remedy card.

555
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,559
What?

556
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,200
But it's of no use now.

557
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,400
What card?

558
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,839
A card I prepared for you.

559
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,920
You are a trouble maker.

560
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,279
What if one day

561
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,200
you screw something up.

562
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,519
I can't use
my funeral expense to save you,

563
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,319
can I?

564
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,119
Who do you think I got it from?

565
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,680
Headstrong.

566
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,359
Proud.

567
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,400
No sucking up to anyone.

568
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,799
You made it sound like a bad thing.

569
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,559
That's the best heredity you can get.

570
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,359
One day you'll thank me for it.

571
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,440
I'll thank you
if you won't ask me to pay the rent.

572
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,400
Why did we start
playing a nice family now?

573
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,960
I'm not used to that.

574
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,200
You're overthinking.

575
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,000
You paid all the money.

576
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,759
Ms. Xia has paid
quite a lot of rent until now.

577
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,599
You saved it up?

578
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,599
Thank you for supporting me, Ms. Wu.

579
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,279
No.

580
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,559
I don't support premarital cohabitation.

581
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,359
Don't live with your boyfriend
before marriage.

582
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,359
Modesty is a virtue.

583
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,319
Fine.

584
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,920
Now we've done playing a nice family.

585
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,240
Go clean up your mess.

586
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,119
I have something to do.

587
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,359
My time is valuable.

588
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,759
I've got my hands full.

589
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,519
The card...

590
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:01,640
Ah?

591
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,759
Card.

592
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:03,880
Ah?

593
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,880
What?

594
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,160
What?

595
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,240
The remedy card you said.

596
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,359
The card.

597
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:19,920
Boss.

598
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,880
This is the information you asked for.

599
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,599
Here.

600
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,200
I'm really surprised.

601
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,160
Her design back then

602
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,880
was really ingenious.

603
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,240
Very natural and smart.

604
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,359
With some modernity in it.

605
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:36,920
Oh.

606
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,160
Find out

607
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,119
what the jury will be this year.

608
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:40,880
And,

609
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,519
where Alex is now.

610
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,720
In the country or abroad.

611
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:44,920
Okay.

612
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,680
Now come with me.

613
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,079
Let's go.

614
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:50,440
Ah?

615
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,519
Let's go?

616
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,039
What about breakfast?

617
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,119
It took me a lot of time.

618
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,079
Li Donghao.

619
00:25:59,079 --> 00:25:59,799
Hurry up.

620
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,759
Hey.

621
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,319
Song.

622
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,160
Good morning.

623
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:03,880
Morning.

624
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,720
Where is Xia Tian?

625
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,839
She got fed up with you and left.

626
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,799
Why are you here so early?

627
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,119
To talk about the termination?

628
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:12,119
No.

629
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,400
Mr. Xu has never even

630
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,119
thought about termination.

631
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,839
It's a misunderstanding.

632
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,759
That's all.

633
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,880
But regarding the material acceptance,

634
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
we should finish it quickly.

635
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,000
It's always Xia Tian

636
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,359
who checks the materials.

637
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,680
I don't make the decision.

638
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,200
Is that all?

639
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,240
Then I'll go have breakfast.

640
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,319
Li Donghao.

641
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:29,960
Yeah.

642
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm coming.

643
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,400
Ah.

644
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:34,880
Bro.

645
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,559
You are going to have breakfast?

646
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,319
Yeah.

647
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,599
Come have it with me, Donghao.

648
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,680
You stay here to
tell Song about the work.

649
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,000
Great.

650
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:42,759
Bro.

651
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:43,599
What do you want from me?

652
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,559
I want to ask you something.

653
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:45,319
Let's go.

654
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:54,440
Bro.

655
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,839
Don't worry about Xia Tian's health.

656
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,119
I'm a doctor.

657
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,400
I'll take care of her.

658
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:00,359
Here.

659
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,559
Have one.

660
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:07,559
Donghao.

661
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,799
Where is the grave of Xia Tian's dad?

662
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,480
Why?

663
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,799
Why are you asking about that?

664
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,160
Xia Tian never told me.

665
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,599
I want to know.

666
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,680
Xia Tian never told you.

667
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,880
That means she really
doesn't want to face it.

668
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:23,519
As far as I know,

669
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,519
she hasn't been there even once

670
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,559
after the funeral.

671
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:27,960
Every death day,

672
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,160
her mom would go alone.

673
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,440
What exactly happened?

674
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,960
Why wouldn't she go there
even at the death day?

675
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:33,799
To tell the truth,

676
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,599
I don't really know.

677
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,559
But at the death day every year,

678
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,400
she would be like a different person.

679
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,079
She would be like neurotic,

680
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,640
and wouldn't talk to anyone
the whole day.

681
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,920
What about her mom?

682
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,960
She didn't do anything about it?

683
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,079
Her mom didn't force her to go.

684
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,319
Because she knows
that Xia Tian is not well.

685
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,519
So she just leaves her be.

686
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,400
Do you know about Xia Tian withdrawing

687
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,079
from the ADA competition?

688
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,880
Oh.

689
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,240
I've heard about it from Song.

690
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,759
We were all trying to persuade her.

691
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,240
But she was so down

692
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,880
and depressed.

693
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,160
We all felt like she was giving it up.

694
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,759
She only got better
after starting the studio.

695
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,799
After all that,

696
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,279
I felt like she grew up overnight.

697
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,279
Life is full of uncertainty.

698
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,920
Donghao.

699
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,680
Tell me.

700
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,000
Where is her dad's grave?

701
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:34,960
His grave

702
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,839
is at the Xiaoshan Cemetery.

703
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,720
Song and I went there
once with her mom.

704
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,440
(Morning.)

705
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,720
(Xia Tian)
(My little sun.)

706
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,960
(Guan Xin)
(Morning.)

707
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,799
(You are also my little sun.)

708
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,720
(Looks like you are
in a good mood today.)

709
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,920
(Xia Tian)
(Not bad.)

710
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:31,759
(Are you busy today?)

711
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:42,960
(Guan Xin)
(Today I need to arrange)

712
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,440
(the scar removal operation
for the girl from the Charity House.)

713
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,839
(Xia Tian)
(Okay.)

714
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,160
(All the best.)

715
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,160
(Don't exhaust yourself.)

716
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:11,839
Xia Tian went back?

717
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,160
Yeah.

718
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,200
She's not in a good mood lately.

719
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,759
Is she thinking about her dad?

720
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:21,799
Eh?

721
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:22,920
Do you need me to talk to her?

722
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,519
What's that got to do with you?

723
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,759
Change the topic.

724
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,319
(This is where Xia Tian used to live.)

725
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,640
(I haven't been here for years.)

726
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:38,440
Let's talk about us
if we're not talking about the kid.

727
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,680
We...

728
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:40,559
Come in, please.

729
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,799
Auntie.

730
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:42,920
It's me.

731
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:45,440
Oh.

732
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,000
Xu.

733
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,079
Come in.

734
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,480
Um.

735
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,839
Xia Tian's ex-boyfriend.

736
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,920
My colleague.

737
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:52,799
Oh.

738
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:53,640
Hello.

739
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,079
We...

740
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,240
Show yourself out.

741
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,000
Have a seat, please.

742
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,799
Auntie.

743
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,680
I brought you two bottles of red wine.

744
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,720
I know you like this.

745
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,279
Oh.

746
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,039
Thank you.

747
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,680
I'll leave it here.

748
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,359
Okay.

749
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,359
Why do you...?

750
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:15,799
Oh.

751
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,559
I'm looking for Xia Tian.

752
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:17,960
Oh.

753
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,200
She just left.

754
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,920
She...

755
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,319
She went back to the studio?

756
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,839
I don't know.

757
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,960
Maybe with her boyfriend.

758
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,160
You two are working together
on a project, right?

759
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Yes.

760
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,720
Yeah.

761
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,640
But we had

762
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,480
a little misunderstanding.

763
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,839
I want to talk to her.

764
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:37,960
After all,

765
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,319
I do acknowledge

766
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,400
her talent in design.

767
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,519
Also,

768
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,359
I didn't take care of her well

769
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,720
when we were together.

770
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,119
She missed an important competition
because of me.

771
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,920
So I want to make it up for her.

772
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,480
Oh.

773
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,319
Make it up?

774
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:54,119
Oh.

775
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,039
I mean at work.

776
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,480
At work.

777
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,039
I know.

778
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,319
I'll never interfere with these things.

779
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,759
You are 30 now.

780
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,759
You know how to handle things.

781
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:03,680
Um.

782
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,480
Auntie.

783
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,599
I'm sorry.

784
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,400
Well...

785
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,119
I didn't know

786
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,960
about her dad's passing away.

787
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,279
I thought

788
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,160
he was pretty healthy.

789
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,160
It just happened so suddenly.

790
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,359
That was years ago.

791
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,920
I'm also responsible.

792
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,880
I didn't take care of Xia Tian well.

793
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,960
So she never really got over it.

794
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:28,880
How are you responsible?

795
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,240
It's got nothing to do with you.

796
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,759
If anyone should be responsible,
it should be me.

797
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm a strong-willed person.

798
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,279
I always wanted to compete with him.

799
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,039
I wanted to win

800
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,240
and control him.

801
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,000
After he passed away, I realized

802
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,480
that there's no big deal

803
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,799
except life and death.

804
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,039
But he...

805
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:46,680
Why would he do this?

806
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,359
If he really wanted to be with her,

807
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,680
he could just tell me.

808
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,720
It's not like I couldn't live

809
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,839
without him.

810
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,000
If he told me,

811
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,240
the car accident might not
have happened at all.

812
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,759
Car accident?

813
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,240
I thought it was cerebral hemorrhage.

814
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,200
It was a car accident.

815
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,400
On the Mid-Autumn Day,

816
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,319
he had a car crash with his lover.

817
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,960
They both passed away.

818
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,359
You two.

819
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,119
Don't always argue with each other.

820
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:37,799
Uncle.

821
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,559
We don't.

822
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,119
I wouldn't dare argue with her.

823
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,920
She was berating me the whole time.

824
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,920
What did she say?

825
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,599
She said I'm careless.

826
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,960
I don't make plans.

827
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,480
I don't bring sleeping bags.

828
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:50,519
Just

829
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,799
things like this.

830
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,799
Only trivia.

831
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,519
Don't take it seriously.

832
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,079
Okay?

833
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,200
I won't.

834
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,880
We've been together for five years.

835
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,240
I really want to marry her.

836
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,639
Marriage is different from dating.

837
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,400
You have to lose to her unconditionally.

838
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,920
In a marriage,

839
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,280
if you want to win the other one,

840
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,239
then it will be over.

841
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,280
You have to remember

842
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,719
that you'll spend all your life
with the person.

843
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,760
You have to have that belief.

844
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,400
Do you understand?

845
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,480
I do.

846
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,880
Everybody says

847
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,519
that marriage is different from dating.

848
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,480
But I don't see the difference.

849
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,039
As long as I'm sure about it,

850
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,159
I won't let go.

851
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,000
When you are with a woman,

852
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,039
don't use your brain,

853
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,239
but use your heart.

854
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,519
Xia Tian and her mom
are both strong-willed.

855
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,719
They are always arguing with each other.

856
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,840
You have to be the mediator.

857
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,519
Got it?

858
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,800
You have to stand next to her.

859
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,400
Your partner is more important
than your parents.

860
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,840
So you have to let her know

861
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:09,039
that you'll always have her back.

862
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,679
Don't worry.

863
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,000
Uncle.

864
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,400
I will.

865
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,079
Actually,

866
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,559
I'm not really worried about
arguing with her.

867
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,119
You are here.

868
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,639
She always listens to you.

869
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,280
If I have some conflicts with her,

870
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,920
you can be the mediator.

871
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,840
I'm an old man now.

872
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,320
I won't be with her for long.

873
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,280
She can always do things

874
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,199
as she pleases.

875
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,800
Most importantly,

876
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,199
don't force your good intentions on her.

877
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,599
This is important.

878
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,519
Happiness is the most important.

879
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,239
Don't think about it.

880
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,159
You won't figure it out by thinking.

881
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,960
You have to do it.

882
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,079
(I realized now)

883
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,519
(that the talk with her dad)

884
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,239
(was his last advice for me.)
