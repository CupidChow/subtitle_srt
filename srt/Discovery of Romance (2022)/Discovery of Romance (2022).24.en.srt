We need to talk.

357
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,279
Let me get this straight.

358
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,479
I don't want to see you anymore.

359
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,360
And,

360
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,519
I won't allow Xia Tian
to work with you anymore.

361
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,999
Why are you making the decision?

362
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,600
You said you wouldn't
interfere with Xia Tian's work.

363
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
That's what I thought before.

364
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,759
But now I have changed my mind.

365
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:42,719
I'll convince her.

366
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,759
Don't you have
any confidence in Xia Tian?

367
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,759
Don't you know she's going to marry me?

368
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,559
So what?

369
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,319
You love Xia Tian.

370
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,759
But she loves herself.

371
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,239
She does love herself.

372
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
But she loves me too.

373
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,279
Otherwise, she wouldn't
have agreed to marry me.

374
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,079
Do you really think
she is going to marry you

375
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,999
because she loves you?

376
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,039
Xia Tian is not a person

377
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,239
who would be content
to be around other people.

378
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,079
She won't feel happy

379
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,039
clinging to someone.

380
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,559
Do you know her?

381
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,079
Do you know what she needs?

382
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,279
Do you know what her dream is?

383
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,640
Do you know what she gave up for you?

384
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,559
You don't even deserve to be with her.

385
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,559
And you do?

386
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,400
At least I know

387
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,759
what she needs most now.

388
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,600
At least I know what she wants most.

389
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,680
And you?

390
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:32,640
You...

391
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,239
You know nothing.

392
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,400
Crap.

393
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,319
If you get in the way again,

394
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,079
I'm going to kill you.

395
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,519
Would you please stop talking like that?

396
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:44,960
I won't get in the way
of you and Xia Tian.

397
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,719
And I can't.

398
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,999
But please don't
interfere with her work either.

399
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,600
What Xia Tian wants to do
is her own choice.

400
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:53,319
Neither of us is qualified
to decide anything for her.

401
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,920
Xia Tian does not need anyone

402
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,440
to give her self-righteous happiness.

403
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,279
She is a person who shines on her own.

404
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,120
You...

405
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,880
You won't last long with her.

406
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,239
Stop.

407
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,120
Stop.

408
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,039
Take it easy.

409
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:41,120
You two are great.

410
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:41,600
Ah.

411
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,079
A boss

412
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:44,920
and a doctor.

413
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,600
Two decent men.

414
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,880
It's no problem
if you're jealous because of a girl.

415
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,640
But you started a fight?

416
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,120
You two are amazing!

417
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,519
I don't understand

418
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,400
what love

419
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,360
is.

420
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,680
Can it be eaten as a dish?

421
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,160
In a world where it's hard to get food

422
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,319
and sleep tight,

423
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,519
you two fought?

424
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,079
I think you guys are too idle.

425
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:18,799
Then

426
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,719
I am telling you.

427
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,239
You have to pay for all the things

428
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,239
you broke today.

429
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,160
Hey.

430
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,719
Ms.,

431
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,400
you are here.

432
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:30,440
Ay.

433
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,079
I'm sorry.

434
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:31,880
I'm sorry.

435
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,160
Look,

436
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
we are all regular customers.

437
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,120
We were friendly.

438
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,640
But,

439
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:38,920
today is really an exception.

440
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,799
I'm sorry.

441
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,400
Right.

442
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,519
I know you are regular customers.

443
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,559
That's not
what regular customers can do.

444
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,840
Look at them.

445
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,120
He is in anger.

446
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,239
And he is not convinced.

447
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,400
They haven't fought enough.

448
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,400
Continue.

449
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,120
Continue to break things.

450
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,640
Ah.

451
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,920
And then double my compensation

452
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,440
according to the bill.

453
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:58,680
Ay.

454
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,239
Okay.

455
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,799
You can rest assured.

456
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,600
I'll do it.

457
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,880
What are you doing?

458
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:04,479
We share.

459
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,039
Ah.

460
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,559
Let's go, boss.

461
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,759
You go back first.

462
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Leave me alone.

463
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:48,200
Even big things will pass.

464
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,799
You're still so naive.

465
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,479
Ms.

466
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Do you think

467
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,200
that no matter how much you love her,

468
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,759
as long as the time apart
is long enough,

469
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,719
she would eventually

470
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,999
become a passerby?

471
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,239
Of course.

472
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,759
The deepest love of all
will also pass in the end.

473
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,680
But I've known Xia Tian for 10 years.

474
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,440
We had been dating for five years,

475
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,680
and broke up five years ago.

476
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:22,840
So far,

477
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,440
I still can't

478
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,559
think of her as a passerby.

479
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,920
And I know...

480
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,840
I know she still loves me.

481
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,479
You know?

482
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,440
Then go get her back.

483
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,079
I've tried.

484
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:40,519
I've tried hard.

485
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,079
But...

486
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:42,799
But I can't make it.

487
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,039
Let me ask you.

488
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,079
Do you think

489
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,479
that you've tried your best

490
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,400
in your relationship?

491
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,920
If you have,

492
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,519
no matter what happens in the future,

493
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,799
you won't regret it.

494
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,519
Look at you now,

495
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,360
10 years older.

496
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,479
Ah.

497
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,880
What happened

498
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,279
to that swagger you had

499
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,079
10 years ago?

500
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,759
Won't you earn the money?

501
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,079
Won't you eat?

502
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:38,880
Won't you want to live?

503
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,039
That's right.

504
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:40,960
That's right.

505
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,680
Good.

506
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,440
That's the good boy.

507
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,120
Listen to me.

508
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,680
Let's

509
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,759
have a good drink here today.

510
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,400
Then you go home,

511
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,440
take a shower

512
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,960
and have a good sleep.

513
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,680
Tomorrow

514
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:58,759
will be another brand new day.

515
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,200
Thank you.

516
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,400
Silly boy.

517
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,799
Why were you squatting
on the ground and crying just now?

518
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,880
What's in such a hurry?

519
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,360
You went over there
in the middle of the night.

520
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,160
Let's break up.

521
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,640
Guan Xin.

522
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,039
Xia Tian.

523
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:47,719
Don't do that.

524
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,239
We're going to get married.

525
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,440
So what do you want me to do?

526
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,279
Today

527
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,479
I am angry.

528
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:05,559
But it's OK.

529
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,479
If you explain it to me,

530
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:08,719
I'll be okay.

531
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,960
Don't tell me that you'll be OK anymore.

532
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,360
Guan Xin.

533
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,120
Don't force yourself to take it, either.

534
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,559
And you know it,

535
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,640
if we keep going like this,

536
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,920
we'll only break up in the end.

537
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,600
How do you know we won't get closer

538
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,039
and sweeter?

539
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:18,840
I just know it.

540
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,120
In the beginning,
we stick with each other.

541
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,279
Gradually,

542
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,120
we'll disgust each other.

543
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,319
And we'll end up hating each other.

544
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,840
This is what we've become.

545
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,279
Do you know that?

546
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:36,999
Guan Xin.

547
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,719
You have to accept

548
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,319
that we're at the end of the road.

549
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,519
Is this the end?

550
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,719
Is that all you can do?

551
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,559
Is that as far as you can go?

552
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,999
I can keep walking.

553
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,640
I won't mind how far I should go.

554
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,999
How far can we go?

555
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,759
Far, far away.

556
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,160
How much more do you
want me to hurt you?

557
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,880
Do you think that makes me feel good?

558
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
How much more do you want to hate me?

559
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,759
Well, Xia Tian.

560
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,360
Do you know so much about love?

561
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,079
Who did you learn about love from?

562
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:18,920
From Xu Zehao.

563
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,840
Is it the answer you want?

564
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,920
Let's end it up here.

565
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,319
Guan Xin.

566
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,200
Xia Tian.

567
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,600
Xia Tian.

568
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:05,640
Xia Tian.

569
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,279
How's it?

570
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:09,680
Two men were fighting for you.

571
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,640
Are you happy now?

572
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,200
You shut up!

573
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,120
Guan Xin is still outside.

574
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:19,999
Shut up.

575
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:20,840
Shut up.

576
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:21,920
I'll go find him.

577
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,079
How is she?

578
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,319
You're in a situation like this,

579
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:54,600
and you are still worrying about her?

580
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,319
I had a quarrel with her.

581
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,239
She said a lot of outrageous things.

582
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,519
So did I.

583
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,880
Then why did you fight with Xu Zehao?

584
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,279
Xia Tian

585
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,400
got out of Xu Zehao's company,

586
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,039
and cried.

587
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:29,079
It was the second time she cried
in front of Xu Zehao.

588
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,039
I asked her why.

589
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,519
She just wouldn't tell me.

590
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,799
What Xia Tian wants to do
is her own choice.

591
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,759
Neither of us is qualified
to decide anything for her.

592
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,440
Xia Tian does not need anyone

593
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,120
to give her self-righteous happiness.

594
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,079
She is a person who shines on her own.

595
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,440
You...

596
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,079
You won't last long with her.

597
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,559
Actually, I know

598
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,559
why she wouldn't tell me.

599
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,440
Because she knows

600
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,479
I can't accept the answer.

601
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,160
(What else am I supposed to tell him?)

602
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,920
(Do I have to say)

603
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,120
(I love someone else,)

604
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,759
(or I fall in love with Xu Zehao again?)

605
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:29,640
(It's too cruel.)

606
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,680
(I really can't say that.)

607
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,920
Hey.

608
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:03,559
Where's Guan Xin?

609
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,559
How's it?

610
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
I sent him away.

611
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,640
Where is Xia Tian?

612
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,599
I haven't got the nerve
to go in there yet.

613
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,679
Poor Guan Xin.

614
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,559
Throw it away for me.

615
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:26,920
You figured it out?

616
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,479
Then I'll just assume
you and Guan Xin are still together,

617
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,479
and you two just had a quarrel.

618
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,320
Let's sleep together.

619
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:06,119
I know you can't fall asleep.

620
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:06,960
What a coincidence,

621
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:07,840
I can't fall asleep, either.

622
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,720
Now that you've chosen Xu Zehao,

623
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,720
just go for it.

624
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,999
I'll be there with you
if you get scolded.

625
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,280
How about Guan Xin?

626
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,639
How is he?

627
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,280
Don't worry.

628
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,999
Guan Xin's already home.

629
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,639
Actually,

630
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:40,999
it's good to choose Guan Xin.

631
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,240
I don't want to think about it anymore.

632
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,920
I've got the answer long ago.

633
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,880
Donghao was right.

634
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,280
I knew it

635
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,079
when I saw the two of them at the pub.

636
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,920
It's over.

637
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,760
For both of them,

638
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,400
I'm really not a good person.

639
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,880
Now that you've made your decision,

640
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
just go for it.

641
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,679
Um?

642
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,599
But I think

643
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,880
Guan Xin is not ready for a breakup.

644
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,800
Just give him some time.

645
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,479
What about you?

646
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:51,960
Are you ready?

647
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,119
Don't people like me

648
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,800
deserve to suffer?

649
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,240
(For Xu Zehao and Guan Xin,)
