What was I thinking?

How come I still dream about him?

But the dream

23

seemed so real and made me feel so good.

I didn't sleep last night,

feeling sad all night
in front of my bracelet.

How do I start talking to him?

Wait.

Haven't you contacted him?

Did you two break up?

It is the bracelet
you sent her, isn't it?

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,040
It was just next to the sink.

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,439
I was so afraid that I would break it.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,320
Do you know she didn't sleep all night?

35
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,480
You did that on purpose?

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,399
You took off the bracelet
on purpose to let me see it,

37
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,040
so I would tell Guan Xin that, right?

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
You scheming girl.

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,040
I even don't eat.

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,320
I'm really sad.

41

Do you know?

42
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,480
She hasn't eaten anything

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,439
but fruit for several days.

get butterflies in his stomach.

Don't you have a conscience?

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
My conscience is on vacation now.

49
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,559
Give it to Guan Xin for me.

51
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,999
Give this to Xia Tian for me.

Oh, my God.

When will you end it?

54
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:19,159
I'm going crazy.

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,320
That's horrible.

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,159
I've never been in a relationship

57
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,360
because I'm afraid
of meeting a girl like you.

I know.

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,200
But you still...

61
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,040
Do you know how guilty I am these days?

62
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,080
How is it?

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,159
Is it brighter than before?

64
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,640
Go away!

65
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:48,920
I'm really sleepy.

66
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,360

Donghao.

68
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,999
I learned it from Xu Zehao.

69
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,119
In a relationship,

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,279
girls should not take the initiative.

71
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,279
Boys should.

72
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,960
The one who confesses first in love

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,440
will become the one
who bows down first in a quarrel.

74
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,560
When you fall in love,

75
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,440
you should not only have courage,

76
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,320
but also know
some strategies and skills,

77
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,399
especially when it comes to apologies.

78
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,919
Five years ago, I really thought
Xu Zehao was out of line.

79
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:32,839
Of course.

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,919
I don't think he's
a good man now, either.

81
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,560
But then I calmed down
and analyzed that.

82
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,239
It was me who actually didn't know men

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,120
and the right way to treat men.

84

Okay.

I'll only drink when I'm with you.

135

The designer I'm looking for

can't be too ordinary.

I need something new.

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,560
it has a natural and special style.

172
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,200
This is a wood furniture studio.

173
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,560
It's called Xia Song Studio.

174
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
In addition to interior design,

175
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,879
this studio also

176
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,119
has its own handmade furniture brands.

177
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,280
Although

178
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,080
they haven't done any big cases

179
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,119
and are young,

180
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:27,960
their overall style

181
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,879
is very warm,

182
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,320
natural

183
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,719
and more ingenious.

184
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,479
Yu Hui.

185
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:36,999
Yes.

186
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,759
Contact them.

187
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,200
Okay.

188
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:40,960
Okay.

189
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:47,560
(Designer Xia Tian)

190
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,280
(Xia Song Studio)

191
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:06,879
How is it?

192
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:07,960
It can be even sold

193
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,479
to an emperor.

194
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,960
But

195
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,999
there's still no emperor paying us.

196
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,999
We're running out
of money to eat next month.

197
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:17,200
The mortgage and the rent,

198
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:17,999
which one should I pay first?

199
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,080
It took us so long

200
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,280
to make such an imperial wine cabinet,

201
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,280
but we only earned 20,000 yuan.

202
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,239
Ay.

203
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:31,239
Our income was much less
than the amount of efforts we put in.

204
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,719
Xu Zehao?

205
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,280
Why are you here?

206
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,359
It's been a long time.

207
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,960
Song.

208
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,200
I don't want to see you at all.

209
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,680
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,560
I went to get the files.

211
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:52,479
Hello.

212
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,359
I am Yu Hui, the liaison

213
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,280
of Unbounded Space Design Firm.

214
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,879
This is my card.

215
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,719
Don't you always want
to start your own studio?

216
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,999
It's not that easy.

217
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,200
Yes, it is.

218
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,999
Start at the elementary level.

219
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,560
Find a small room first.

220
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,479
You don't need to buy anything.

221
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:13,719
I will

222
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,040
send you a table tennis table then.

223
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,440
You can use it

224
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,999
as an office table.

225
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,440
When there is a conflict with Party A,

226
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,759
you can play a game
of table tennis with each other.

227
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,719
The one who loses
will listen to the one who wins.

228
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,800
Good.

229
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
You are so clever.

230
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,759
I know, right?

231
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,280
We're here

232
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,639
to cooperate with you.

233
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,560
Cooperate?

234
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,519
Cooperate?

235
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,280
Yeah.

236
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:42,999
Wait.

237
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,839
Let me

238
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,759
briefly introduce

239
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,599
our Unbounded Space Design Firm.

240
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,519
Our firm

241
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,200
is mainly engaged

242
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,879
in the overall design
of public space and commercial space.

243
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:56,680
We've done 35 cases

244
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,359
in the past five years.

245
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,080
They were all good projects,

246
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,160
including Tantu Art Space,

247
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,879
Jun'an Building,

248
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,839
and the renovation of an opera house.

249
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,719
Usually, we work with

250
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:10,400
some large and well-known teams.

251
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,999
But the project
is quite special this time.

252
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,400
Mr. Xu thinks

253
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,879
that we may
cooperate with small companies.

254
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,200
Wow.

255
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,639
You two have attracted us

256
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,519
with your unique temperament

257
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,839
and creativity.

258
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,440
We think that the design style

259
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,839
of Xia Song Studio

260
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:31,040
really matches this project.

261
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,719
What do you see

262
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,999
in our small studio,

263
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:36,280
Mr. Xu?

264
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,599
You may have misunderstood.

265
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,239
Our little studio

266
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:42,759
cannot handle such a large project.

267
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,719
Because I found
that you have your own ideas

268
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,920
in designing furniture.

269
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,639
You like using natural materials

270
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,920
and the latest ideas.

271
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,320
The style is bright, fresh

272
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,839
and relaxing.

273
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,479
In a word,

274
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:58,119
it's great.

275
00:12:59,119 --> 00:12:59,639
That's right.

276
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,359
The project this time is quite special.

277
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:05,320
It is to transform a batch of old houses

278
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,479
into themed guesthouses
with a unique urban flavor.

279
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,320
We all think

280
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,719
that the style of Xia Song Studio

281
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:14,759
really matches the project.

282
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:15,599
Oh, wait.

283
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,479
This is the project information.

284
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,040
You can read it.

285
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,400
Guixin Old House?

286
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,440
Yeah.

287
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,839
Xu Zehao!

288
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,280
Xu Zehao.

289
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,440
It is your firm that is responsible for

290
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,560
this Guixin Old House project?

291
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,239
Yes.

292
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,160
Excuse me.

293
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,719
I want to talk to her in private.

294
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:36,680
Xia Tian.

295
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:39,239
It's the project that you really

296
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,560
want to work with.

297
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,239
This,

298
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,920
Guixin Old House.

299
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,560
Now...

300
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,479
Work with Xu Zehao?

301
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,719
So what?

302
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:46,519
Since the schedule
of this project is a little tight,

303
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,440
I have to confirm cooperation
as soon as possible.

304
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,359
And you can rest assured

305
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,719
that as soon as you sign the contract,

306
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,999
the first funds
will be credited to your account.

307
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,719
Pay us so fast?

308
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:55,599
Yeah.

309
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:57,920
So do you two

310
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,800
have any questions
about this collaboration?

311
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:00,759
- Yes.
- No.

312
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:03,639
Rest assured, Mr. Xu.

313
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,200
We are confident.

314
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,639
We will complete this project very well.

315
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,080
We haven't decided yet.

316
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,920
We have.

317
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,560
We will sign the contract

318
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,879
next time we meet.

319
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,359
Mr. Xu.

320
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,080
Okay.

321
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,160
Yu Hui.

322
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,479
Yeah.

323
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,040
You get her contact info

324
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,560
and then talk to her about the contract.

325
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,160
Okay.

326
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,999
Miss Xia.

327
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,119
How about we have a chat?

328
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,200
Have a good chat.

329
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,599
Mr. Xu.

330
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,280
Coffee

331
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,800
or tea?

332
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:27,719
Americano.

333
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,200
Okay.

334
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,560
Americano.

335
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,719
I think

336
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,599
there must be something

337
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:47,519
between Mr. Xu and Miss Xia.

338
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,560
If it weren't

339
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,879
for your good project,

340
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,320
we wouldn't pay Xu Zehao
any attention at all.

341
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,359
They knew each other before?

342
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,119
They broke up.

343
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:58,560
Ex-girlfriend?

344
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,040
Yeah.

345
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:00,999
Now let's see

346
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:03,560
if Mr. Xu can persuade Xia Tian.

347
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,359
Here you are.

348
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,320
Thanks.

349
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,040
Hope we will work well together.

350
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,239
Miss Xia.

351
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,800
I don't think we will cooperate.

352
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,800
I won't be friends with my ex-boyfriend,

353
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,160
let alone working with him.

354
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,400
Why?

355
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:27,999
Because when I see you,

356
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,599
a lot of painful memories recur to me.

357
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
But when I see you,

358
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,200
all the memories
I think of are sweet and beautiful,

359
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,920
like

360
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,800
kissing.

361
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,359
The things between me and you

362
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,560
are clear

363
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,639
in my mind.

364
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,119
Well,

365
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,519
how about leaving that blind date guy

366
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,119
and coming back to me?

367
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,800
I promise I won't
let you down this time,

368
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,800
and I won't cause your pain again.

369
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,759
I didn't expect you
to start acting like in an idol drama

370
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,239
after so many years.

371
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,280
You wouldn't say these disgusting things

372
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,879
ten years ago.

373
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,280
I was just testing you.

374
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,519
Afraid that you would
fall in love with me again.

375
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,999
If that is the case,

376
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,400
then our partnership

377
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,920
might not go well.

378
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,879
Don't flatter yourself.

379
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,040
Okay.

380
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,879
Now you have no reason

381
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,599
to refuse our cooperation.

382
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,160
From today on,

383
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,080
we are just partners.

384
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,200
I was just looking for
a suitable design studio

385
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,800
for the project.

386
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,680
And your studio
just happened to be that one.

387
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,639
Let's put our feelings aside

388
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,160
and just focus on work.

389
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,719
Think about it.

390
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,200
Then contact me.

391
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,279
Bye.

392
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,440
Conceited.

393
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,440
After so many years,

394
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,880
this person is still so naive

395
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,120
and self-righteous.

396
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,640
How old is he?

397
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,719
Still looks like a stupid boss.

398
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,519
Kabedon, huh!

399
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:33,999
But,

400
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm not a girl

401
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,600
in my twenties anymore.

402
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,079
So this trick won't work

403
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,279
for me.

404
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,160
Basically, the cooperation
I want to achieve

405
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,200
has not failed.

406
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,360
Especially, this time the partner

407
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,559
is Xia Tian.

408
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,319
I know her well.

409
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
Strong self-esteem
and eager to prove herself.

410
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,519
So the best way to persuade her

411
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,920
is to provoke her.

412
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:57,200
She looks shrewd and cold now,

413
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,239
but she will try to prove

414
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:00,719
that she has no feelings for me,

415
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,160
and that even if she cooperates with me,

416
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,640
she will never be tempted by me.

417
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,840
I'm sure

418
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,440
she'll take up the project soon.

419
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,719
Boss.

420
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:10,759
You've gone too far.

421
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,559
The car is here.

422
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,279
Oh.

423
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:13,840
Hehe.

424
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,600
Hey.

425
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:30,840
Here you are.

426
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,200
I won't take it anyway.

427
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,360
If you want it, you take it yourself.

428
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,120
Large-scale,

429
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,160
really caring about something

430
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,680
and will pay us a deposit in advance.

431
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,519
What a good project.

432
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,640
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

433
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,840
And I believe

434
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,920
this is the best time for us

435
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,640
to become successful.

436
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,319
No matter how big the scale is,

437
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,680
or how good the project is,

438
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,279
as long as Party A is Xu Zehao,

439
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,680
no way.

440
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,719
It is equivalent to making
a hundred imperial wine cabinets.

441
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,519
Then what about Guan Xin?

442
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:13,920
Guan Xin and I had words

443
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,400
because of Xu Zehao
and were just reconciled.

444
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,120
What if he finds

445
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,039
that we are working together?

446
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:19,680
Will you be responsible for that?

447
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,400
Madam.

448
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,079
Don't be picky about that.

449
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,759
You can't even pay the rent.

450
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,719
When did you become so realistic?

451
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,840
If you don't understand what's going on,

452
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,360
don't forget your mother.

453
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,799
Okay.

454
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,519
Now let's see

455
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,319
how much you owe me.

456
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,239
Xia Tian.

457
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,519
The rent, 24,000.

458
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,160
Unpaid.

459
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
The new computer, 15,000.

460
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,840
Unpaid.

461
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,400
The appendectomy, 6,000.

462
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
A total of 45,000 yuan in arrears.

463
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,440
Song.

464
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,719
The rent, 12,000.

465
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,880
These even don't include
your studio's seed money.

466
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,680
When are you going to pay me?

467
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Why do these include

468
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,160
the appendectomy in my junior year?

469
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,279
Or what?

470
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,719
Was your appendix okay

471
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,519
when I gave birth to you?

472
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,400
How could you remove it?

473
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,640
Shouldn't you
be responsible for your body?

474
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,479
If you say so,

475
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,680
I won't take care of you
when you are old.

476
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,840
Of course you can.

477
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,719
I don't count on you at all.

478
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,039
And,

479
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,920
you often don't go home
at night, do you?

480
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,279
Auntie.

481
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,479
Have you installed
a surveillance camera

482
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,079
in our house?

483
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,360
Who you are going out with

484
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,759
and how you are going out
are your personal business.

485
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,120
But,

486
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,559
as a mother, I have to remind you

487
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,239
not to be pregnant.

488
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,920
Okay?

489
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,400
That's it.

490
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,160
I'm leaving.

491
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,840
I'm going to marry him.

492
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:46,360
Good.

493
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,039
Make a plan now.

494
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,960
Even if he can buy a house,

495
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,279
shouldn't you
be responsible for decoration

496
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,160
or buy a car?

497
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Two people do business together.

498
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,880
Shouldn't they each
contribute a portion of the funds?

499
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,719
You want to get something with nothing

500
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,559
or borrow some more from your mother?

501
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,920
When a daughter says
she is getting married,

502
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,360
her mother would be elated

503
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,200
and send her many things.

504
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,519
Why do I have to borrow from my mother

505
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,239
to get married?

506
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,400
Come on.

507
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:12,920
Stop it.

508
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:14,400
Enough.

509
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,920
I rarely cry.

510
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,160
Well.

511
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:36,840
(Guan Xin: The scenery here is good.)

512
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,719
(Let's go for a walk together someday.)

513
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,200
Let me think about it.

514
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,799
Just think?

515
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Okay, think.

516
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,640
Anyway, your mother won't come to me

517
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,840
even if we can't pay the rent.

518
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,479
I have to

519
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,279
sprint 8 kilometers today

520
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,200
to burn 500 kcal.

521
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,160
Otherwise I can eat nothing

522
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,519
but vegetable tonight.

523
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,999
Just eat what you want.

524
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,719
You have been in good shape.

525
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,799
Wait.

526
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,160
Does your girlfriend have

527
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,160
the habit of exercising?

528
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,440
She

529
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,279
is busy.

530
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,200
So she doesn't have much time.

531
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,519
What is her occupation?

532
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,880
So busy?

533
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,279
Furniture designer.

534
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,440
She has her own studio.

535
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,279
Furniture designer.

536
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,719
And started her own business?

537
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,920
But that's not a problem

538
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,920
if you really like her

539
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,960
and think she's someone you will marry.

540
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:44,840
You are not young anymore.

541
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,360
You should

542
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,719
consider getting married.

543
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,799
Mom.

544
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:51,360
I thought you would mind her profession.

545
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:52,840
All I care about

546
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,640
is if your relationship is strong

547
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,759
and if you share
the same whole world view.

548
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,479
Most importantly,

549
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,039
whether she really loves you.

550
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:04,039
Mom.

551
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,160
I know you well.

552
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,479
You always think of others.

553
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,840
When it comes to marriage,

554
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,279
I think

555
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,559
you'd better find someone

556
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,799
who loves you more,

557
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,360
like the girl you met last time.

558
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,880
Mom.

559
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,319
She really loves me.

560
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,079
I'll take you to meet her someday.

561
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,960
Okay.

562
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,799
Let's talk about it sometime later.

563
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:26,840
Mom.

564
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,360
Well.

565
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm a little thirsty.

566
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,880
Go get me a cup of black coffee.

567
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:33,079
Okay.

568
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,160
Welcome.

569
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
Hello, what would you like?

570
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,440
Hey.

571
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,200
Dr. Guan.

572
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,999
It's me.

573
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:02,960
I delivered coffee

574
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,559
to your hospital
the day before yesterday.

575
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,799
Oh.

576
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,160
So you work in this shop?

577
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,360
Yeah.

578
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,840
I work in different places.

579
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,120
This is just one of them.

580
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,960
What would you like to drink today?

581
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:15,920
Um.

582
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,840
Two cups of Americano

583
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,360
to go.

584
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,079
Okay.

585
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:18,840
Wait a second.

586
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,239
Okay.

587
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:25,600
You...

588
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,239
Oh.

589
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,719
I'm sorry.

590
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,440
No, no.

591
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,960
That's fine.

592
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,920
I'll do it.

593
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,719
I'll do it.

594
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:32,519
Don't trouble yourself.

595
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:34,960
Oh.

596
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,360
Um?

597
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:46,960
Dr. Guan.

598
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:47,960
Dr. Guan.

599
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,920
Dr. Guan.

600
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,400
What's the matter?

601
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,600
It's an old injury, isn't it?

602
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,519
How did this happen?

603
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,880
I was naughty when I was a little girl,

604
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,840
and I fell when riding a bike.

605
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,160
How old were you?

606
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,840
Where?

607
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:06,799
Six.

608
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,279
In an orphanage.

609
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,120
What's wrong?

610
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,600
Can I know your name?

611
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,279
Lu Xi.

612
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,160
Under this bad situation,

613
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,759
there is only one way,

614
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,920
that is to take the guesthouse project.

615
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,039
Making money, paying rent,

616
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,999
and getting married,

617
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,440
all these are things
that only Xu Zehao can help us with.

618
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,239
Xu Zehao?

619
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,880
How come you
get involved with him again?

620
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,880
What's happening?

621
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,559
Xu Zehao came here today.

622
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,400
He told us
that there was a very good project

623
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,559
and he wanted to cooperate with us.

624
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:13,759
It is a big deal

625
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,759
and I even didn't know about it.

626
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,039
Do you still care for me?

627
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,759
No.

628
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,200
Calm down.

629
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,920
We didn't say we took it.

630
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:21,759
And,

631
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,360
Xia Tian has no feelings

632
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,999
for Xu Zehao at all

633
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,079
and has long stopped loving him.

634
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,400
Now Xu Zehao

635
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
is just a bad ex

636
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,759
she doesn't care about.

637
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,239
Right?

638
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:34,640
Yeah.

639
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,279
I definitely and absolutely

640
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,640
have no feelings for him.

641
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,759
Cheers.

642
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,039
Don't be that heated.

643
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,479
Or you will look like lying.

644
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,200
I just care about Guan Xin's feelings.

645
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,680
Xia Tian.

646
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,120
Watch me.

647
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,559
You must

648
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,680
never let Guan Xin know about this.

649
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,400
Got it?

650
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:01,920
Well,

651
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,759
how about this?

652
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:04,400
Hem.

653
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,680
Listen to me.

654
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,680
We have to

655
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,239
see it

656
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,239
as an act of revenge.

657
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,880
Take his order,

658
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:14,840
take his money,

659
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:15,960
be adamant,

660
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:16,999
be professional,

661
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,680
and at last,

662
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,840
when we receive the final payment,

663
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,079
you tell Xu Zehao,

664
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:22,200
"Mr. Xu.

665
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,039
Thank you.

666
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,400
It was a pleasant cooperation.

667
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,440
I'm going to get married

668
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,799
with your money.

669
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:31,360
Haha!

670
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,279
And you are not the groom."

671
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:33,920
What do you think?

672
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,279
What do you think?

673
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:34,640
What do you think?

674
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,479
What a bad girl.

675
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,479
How about this?

676
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,920
Let's use the oldest way.

677
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,160
Come on.

678
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:43,680
Coin tossing.

679
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,840
If it is the flower,
we will sign the contract.

680
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,039
If it is not the flower, we won't do it.

681
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,640
What do you think?

682
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,239
Let's get started.

683
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,200
Li Donghao.

684
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,440
