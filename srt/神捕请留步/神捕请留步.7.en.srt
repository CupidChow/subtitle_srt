00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,860
demographic

2
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,460
completa

3
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,840
this lead

4
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,920
flowers

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,920
I saw Shadow backstabbing,

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,920
and I saw the blood on his face.

7
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
But,

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,920
I didn't see the moment when the leader got stabbed.

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
He was sitting in the first row,

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
and facing the stage.

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,920
How can our audience see

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,920
the situation when he was alone?

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Okay, I got it.

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,920
You can go now.

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Why do you think it's shadow killing?

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
You're not a local, are you?

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Four years ago, we expected shadow killing.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
But, the people here are so crazy.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
We didn't find out until now.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Now, the leader is dead.

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Why do you think it's shadow killing?

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Okay, you should take this.

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,920
What do you think the leader is like?

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
He's a bit stubborn.

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
He has a daughter.

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
She's poor.

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
She lost her mother and was bullied.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,920
She often has a sore nose and a bruised leg.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Now, she has no family.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Poor her.

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
I remember something.

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
There's a hooligan outside the troupe.

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
He comes to threaten the leader every day

34
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
and asks her to hand over the land.

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,920
It's said that the leader's daughter's leg...

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Yuanyuan.

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
You're getting more and more handsome.

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Ah, Ting.

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
You're so pretty.

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Let me check how you're doing.

41
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Let me go.

42
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,920
You're right.

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,920
You're not fast.

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Stop! Stop!

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Stop! Stop!

46
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
These two guys seem to be very smart.

47
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,920
They want to catch me.

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,920
No way.

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Listen,

50
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920
you'd better be polite to me.

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
You know what?

52
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
I've been searching for you for a long time.

53
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
What kind of person am I?

54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
You even want to steal flowers from me?

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
You're dreaming!

56
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Ah, Ting.

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Please forgive me.

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Please forgive me.

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Stop!

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,920
What did you say?

61
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,920
What's wrong with me?

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Why are you running?

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
You're chasing me. How can I not run?

64
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
If you keep talking, I'll find you.

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
I have a shadow.

66
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,920
I've been a grudge-monger since I was a kid.

67
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Let me ask you.

68
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Did you threaten the troupe?

69
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
You said you were going to tear down their theater?

70
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Yes.

71
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
I owe money and I owe it.

72
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,920
You owe money?

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Ah, the troupe leader is a gambling ghost.

74
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
He lost money and

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
took the land to the casino.

76
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
He didn't pay me back for months.

77
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,920
The casino manager asked me to collect the land.

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
Is there a problem?

79
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Is he a gambling ghost?

80
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Let me ask you.

81
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Where were you last night?

82
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,920
I was sleeping at home.

83
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Who can prove it?

84
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Who can prove it? I'm a gambling ghost.

85
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Wait, take me to your house.

86
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Come here.

87
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Look at this.

88
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,920
This is my house.

89
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
No one else in the house?

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Just me.

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,920
The bed is clean.

92
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
No dust.

93
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Looks like you sleep a lot.

94
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Do you have anything else?

95
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
I'll leave if you don't.

96
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I'm busy these days.

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Don't disturb my performance. Bye.

98
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Wait.

99
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Do you think this bed is normal?

100
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
No problem.

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
It's normal.

102
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
It's not normal if it's too normal.

103
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
This gangster is 80 cm tall.

104
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
This bed is 5 feet long.

105
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,920
The length of the bed is lower than his height.

106
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,920
But the end of the bed is 86 cm long.

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
If he wants to sleep on this bed,

108
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
he has to lie down.

109
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
The bed should be clean.

110
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
But this bed is completely flat.

111
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
So you didn't sleep on this bed last night.

112
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
You didn't sleep on this bed

113
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
for a while.

114
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
What?

115
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
You lied to me.

116
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Where were you last night?

117
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Did you kill him?

118
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
What? Kill him?

119
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
You're still pretending to be stupid.

120
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
The leader of the shadow troupe died last night.

121
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Now you have a big suspicion.

122
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
It's not me.

123
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
It's definitely not me.

124
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Then why did you lie?

125
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,920
I lied.

126
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Actually,

127
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
actually,

128
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
I didn't sleep at home these days.

129
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
I slept in the small house next door.

130
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I was afraid that my neighbors would gossip.

131
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I thought

132
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
I was killing the fire.

133
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
You're not a gangster.

134
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
You're afraid of gossip.

135
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Then

136
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
love

137
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
is also a bottom line.

138
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Thank you.

139
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Liu Shen is investigating the shadow troupe.

141
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
There may be a result soon.

142
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Didn't he become stupid?

143
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
It seems that he is recovering his mind.

144
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Go and investigate this matter.

145
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Almost.

146
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Almost.

147
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Almost.

148
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Almost.

149
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Who gave you the confidence?

150
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
There are only two days left.

151
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
To solve the case in such a short time,

152
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
you must first understand the information of the victim.

153
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Instead of making a quick judgment.

154
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I've asked everything I should ask.

155
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Where else can I understand?

156
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Do you want to ask the dead?

157
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Sometimes

158
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

159
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
The truth is

160
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

161
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
The truth is

162
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

163
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
The truth is

164
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

165
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
The truth is

166
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

167
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
The truth is

168
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

169
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
The truth is

170
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

171
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
The truth is

172
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

173
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
The truth is

174
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

175
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
The truth is

176
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

177
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
The truth is

178
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

179
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
The truth is

180
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

181
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
The truth is

182
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

183
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
The truth is

184
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

185
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
The truth is

186
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

187
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,920
The truth is

188
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
that the dead is much more knowledgeable than the living.

189
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
The truth is

190
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
