1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
Be a hero

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,440
Find a fairy

3
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,040
I will be with you

4
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,920
Popscout

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,440
Fidget dominance

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,880
Stole your money

7
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,600
Is that your money?

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,680
It's the whole deceive's money

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Why do you always lose money on the west bank account?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's all because you took the gambling!

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How did you know?

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I secretly changed the account book to earn a few pieces of jade.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I only understood when I saw the account book

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
why I always lose money all these years.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's you! It's all you!

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Didn't you want to sweep me out?

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fine! If you don't let me live, don't think it's good!

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now I'll go out and tell everyone who it is!

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I stole their money! You all come back!

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Didn't you want to sweep me out?

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Didn't you want to sweep me out?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Come on! Come on!

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Didn't you want to sweep me out?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on! Didn't you want to sweep me out?

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My own money!

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's my money. It's all yours.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
My money...

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My money...

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm dead!

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm dead!

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I killed someone!

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I killed someone...

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I killed someone...

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I killed someone...

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Am I wrong?

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Am I wrong?

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Am I wrong?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I've been holding the book for so many years.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What have I done?

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I stole the donkey skin just to get back the money that belongs to me.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Am I wrong? Am I wrong?

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Enough! It's not up to you to decide if you're wrong.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's go!

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Am I wrong?

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's finally over.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I didn't expect a little shadow to hide so deeply.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Ah Cai is too smart.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But there is always a book in the puzzle.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Then...

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The agreement between you and Xian Ling is...

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Liu Shen just broke the case.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sir, that's it.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm a man of my word.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Since you caught the real murderer,

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
it means you're innocent.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The case of the shadow play has nothing to do with you.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's great.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But there's one more thing.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
My two brothers always talk about you in front of me.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:57,180
Do you want to be a

63
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,180
Please help me ask.

64
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,180
Does this person have the idea of being a guide in our yard?

65
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,180
The treatment is excellent.

66
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,180
I'm not interested.

67
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,180
Ah Qin, let's go.

68
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,180
Liu Shen!

69
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,180
You little thing.

70
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,180
Let's see how I get you.

71
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,180
Liu Shen.

72
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,180
Are you still following me?

73
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,180
You really don't want to go?

74
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,180
Are you going to go with a group of nine bags of food?

75
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,180
It's not necessarily all nine bags of food.

76
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,180
There are still a couple of smart children.

77
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,180
Childish.

78
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,180
You have no taste.

79
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,180
I'm going back to the six mountains to report to the police.

80
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,180
Are you going to leave the Changhe County?

81
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,180
Ah.

82
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,180
Ah.

83
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
Ah.

84
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,180
Don't move.

85
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
Shadow.

86
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,180
Shadow?

87
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,180
Ah.

88
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Ah.

89
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,180
Ah.

90
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,180
Forget it.

91
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,180
Forget it.

92
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,180
Forget it.

93
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,180
Forget it.

94
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,180
Forget it.

95
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,180
Forget it.

96
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,180
Forget it.

97
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,180
Forget it.

98
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,180
Forget it.

99
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,180
Forget it.

100
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,180
Forget it.
