00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,340
The Legend of Chusen

9
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,340
Episode 05

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,340
The best shenbu in the world.

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,340
How can you buy the clues with money?

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,340
Why should I do it

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,340
if I can solve it with money?

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,340
How do you prove that you are the best shenbu?

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,340
It's just a false name.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,340
Do you have the token of six gates?

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,340
I'm not wearing any common clothes.

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,340
You have nothing.

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,340
No.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,340
You are just showing off.

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,340
Why don't you come with us?

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,340
Come on.

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,340
The army of the fruit-trees.

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,340
The army of the tree-tree-tree or the army of the guard?

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,340
How do you know?

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,340
Then it must be the army of the tree-tree-tree.

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,340
When you stand up,

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,340
you use both legs to bend your back.

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,340
It means you often participate in the team exercise.

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,340
There is always a hand in your body at any time when you relax.

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,340
It means you are very alert.

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,340
You will leave traces when you stand up.

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,340
So you must be the army of the tree-tree-tree.

34
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Many of the soldiers who retreated are not good.

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,340
How do you know he is the army of the tree-tree-tree?

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,340
And he has fought in battles.

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,340
Now the national security has not been rebellious.

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,340
He must be a soldier of the tree-tree-tree.

39
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,340
He has been ready to fight at any time.

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,340
How can he understand these without having experienced life and death?

41
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,340
As for the battle,

42
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,340
have we won?

43
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,340
Then how do you know he has been a long time?

44
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,340
I smell it.

45
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,340
Why didn't I smell it before?

46
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,340
Nonsense.

47
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,340
You are lying.

48
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,340
Do you like to play cards or dice?

49
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,340
What cards?

50
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
What dice?

51
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,340
You won a lot last night.

52
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,340
Did you also play in the casino last night?

53
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,340
No.

54
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,340
Then how did you...

55
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
Your fingers are on the top.

56
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,340
Your index finger and the inner side of the thumb have a layer of heart.

57
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,340
This is the poison in the gambling glass.

58
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,340
If you want to play dice, the poison should be in the index finger.

59
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,340
Only playing cards and the poison should be in the index finger.

60
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,340
Yesterday was the day of the Eighth Route.

61
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,340
The first thought of a gambler before getting the money must be the poison.

62
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,340
Then you look at your eyes and the whole world keeps playing cards.

63
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,340
This is a night-time card.

64
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,340
But you have only ten cards in the month.

65
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,340
You should have lost a few cards in the tree.

66
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,340
You haven't left the night-time card yet.

67
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,340
So you won a lot last night.

68
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,340
Xiao Yin, Xiao Yin, just keep it.

69
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,340
I advise you not to gamble anymore.

70
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,340
Take more time to care about your wife.

71
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,340
Otherwise, she will forget about the world.

72
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,340
I will fix that woman sooner or later.

73
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,340
But how did you know about this?

74
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,340
I just spent a pound of money.

75
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,340
I bought it from this lady.

76
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,340
It seems that you are really a gentleman.

77
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,340
Sir, what do you want?

78
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Please tell me.

79
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,340
The soup is on fire, sir.

80
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
You find the gambler now.

81
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
You must come back before dark.

82
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,340
I'll be waiting for you here.

83
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Okay.

84
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,340
You arrange the people to re-arrange the crime scene.

85
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
I'll pay you a lot of money.

86
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,340
Okay.

87
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,340
What about me?

88
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,340
Have you married anyone?

89
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,340
What are you doing in this?

90
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
Break the case.

91
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,340
Break the case?

92
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,340
It's been so many days since the crime.

93
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
There are no traces here.

94
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,340
How to break the case?

95
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,340
Just because there are no traces.

96
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,340
So you have to restore the crime scene.

97
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,340
You just sit here and play the bride.

98
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,340
What is this?

99
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,340
This is the day the victim was killed.

100
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,340
The day the victim was killed.

101
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,340
What is this?

102
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,340
This is the red cloth covered by the victim.

103
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,340
Then it flew to the tree.

104
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,340
I spent five taels of silver to buy it.

105
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,340
Are you ready?

106
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,340
Okay.

107
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,340
The crime scene is restarted.

108
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,340
Start.

109
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,340
It's dry.

110
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,340
Be careful of the fire.

111
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,340
Be careful of the fire.

112
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,340
The person is out.

113
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,340
Stop.

114
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,340
Do you have to go through this road every night?

115
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
No.

116
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,340
It started a few days ago.

117
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,340
It's the old king of the paper shop.

118
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,340
He found the city and let us go here.

119
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,340
So not many people know you walk this road, right?

120
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,340
Continue.

121
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,340
Fireproof road.

122
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,340
People and places are safe.

123
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,340
Miss Wang.

124
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,340
Fireproof road.

125
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,340
Miss Wang.

126
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Stop.

127
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
No.

128
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,340
That bride didn't run here.

129
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,340
She was floating here.

130
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
She didn't touch the ground.

131
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,340
Is it possible that you saw the fire?

132
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Absolutely not.

133
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
I saw it with my own eyes.

134
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,340
No wonder the next day we only found the fire.

135
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,340
Continue.

136
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,340
Then the bride's head flew away.

137
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,340
Then the bride's body burned in front of me.

138
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,340
How did it fly?

139
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,340
Covered with red cloth.

140
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
The case is solved.

141
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,340
Passed.

142
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Follow me.

143
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
Look at this red cover.

144
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,340
The hair is curled and transformed.

145
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,340
It means it has suffered a high temperature.

146
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,340
There is also a smell of pine tree.

147
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,340
Pine tree is the source of the light.

148
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,340
What does it mean?

149
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,340
The smell of pine tree.

150
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,340
It means it has suffered a high temperature.

151
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
What does it mean?

152
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,340
You tell me.

153
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,340
What does it mean?

154
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,340
This head is actually a sky lamp that can make a human face.

155
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,340
And this fake bride is a scoundrel.

156
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,340
That night, this fake bride was put in front of the scoundrel shop.

157
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Light the sky lamp.

158
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,340
The temperature of the fuel rises.

159
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,340
The water is filled.

160
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,340
The fire of pine tree burns down.

161
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,340
Burned.

162
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
The whole village is burned.

163
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,340
But who can make the face of the paper so ugly?

164
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,340
Ordinary people can't.

165
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,340
But there is one person who can.

166
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,340
Who?

167
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,340
Paper scoundrel.

168
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,340
As the saying goes,

169
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,340
Seven points of paper, three points of soul.

170
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,340
Can make a human face.

171
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,340
It's too easy for them to draw a human face.

172
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,340
Paper scoundrel.

173
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,340
There is only one paper scoundrel in town.

174
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,340
Isn't it the dead's father?

175
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
Yes.

176
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,340
The answer is only one.

177
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Follow me.

178
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
Hurry.

179
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,340
The paper scoundrel.

180
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,340
The paper scoundrel.

181
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,340
The paper scoundrel.

182
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
The paper scoundrel.

183
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
The paper scoundrel.

184
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
The paper scoundrel.

185
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,340
The paper scoundrel.

186
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,340
The paper scoundrel.

187
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,340
The paper scoundrel.
