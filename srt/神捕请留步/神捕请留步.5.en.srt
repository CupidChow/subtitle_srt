1
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,200
It's hard to tell if you chose it or not alone.

2
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,280
It materializes.

3
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,720
While you are raising a seed,

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,560
it also has require to bear fruit with charm.

5
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,820
Ever since I left my home.

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,780
Those fruits are tart.

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,160
Try neem.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,260
However many years I trained myself.

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,240
It struck me that

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,220
In a plane...

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,480
In a plane...

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,140
I think she does have you on board..

13
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,320
You sure think we could have it with our friends?

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,120
But traveling somewhere else is difficult,

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,420
Don't mix me with that fool

16
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,620
Lord Shen Bu is also interested in the murder case of Pi Ying?

17
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,320
If you can solve the case, we have a traitor

18
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,120
Want me to help you solve the case?

19
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,120
I can't help you

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm sorry

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
The case is solved

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Solved?

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
So fast

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
So fast

25
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
So fast

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
So fast

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Lord Shen Bu is really a master

28
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Lord Shen Bu is really a master

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
The murderer is...

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,120
It's him

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,120
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,120
The murderer is Qing

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Are you crazy?

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,120
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Then let me analyze it for you

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,120
First, according to the investigation of the Six Hills Gate, most of the murderers will return to the scene

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
He is not an exception, everyone is in a hurry to collect the murderers

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Second, he directly contacted the dead and called the name of Lord Shen Bu

39
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Everyone is collecting the murderers

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Third, he personally planned the head-to-head case

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,120
He is a little cook, but he has the ability to commit crimes

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,120
In addition

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
The murderer is him

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
It's too ridiculous

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
No one will believe such a strong reason

46
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,120
The old man said it makes sense

47
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Take it down

48
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Liu Shen

49
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
Liu Shen

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120
Liu Shen

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Liu Shen

52
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Liu Shen

53
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
Liu Shen

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Liu Shen

55
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Liu Shen

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Liu Shen

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Liu Shen

58
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Liu Shen

59
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
Liu Shen

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Liu Shen

61
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Liu Shen

62
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Liu Shen

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Liu Shen

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,120
You kill people

65
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,120
You don't admit your crimes

66
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,120
You are so cruel

67
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
You are so cruel

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,120
You think I am a coward

69
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Wake up

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Sir, I am innocent

71
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Wait

72
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
What

73
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
My leg is dying

74
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
I can't eat

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Sir

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
You don't want to eat

77
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Get on the road

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Sir

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
What are you doing

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Jiang Wanqing

81
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
You are the most beautiful in the world

82
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
I am sorry

83
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Can you give me more money

84
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,120
I don't have money to spend

85
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
I don't have money to spend

86
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
I will give you money

87
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Liu Shen

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
I won't let you go

89
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Liu Shen

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
Liu Shen

91
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Liu Shen

92
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Liu Shen

93
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Liu Shen

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Liu Shen

95
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Liu Shen

96
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Liu Shen

97
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Liu Shen

98
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Someone is here

99
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Hurry, stop them

100
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Stop them

101
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Liu Shen

102
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Don't come to save me

103
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Does it look good

104
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Why are you here

105
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Money can solve everything

106
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
It's not my business

107
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
You are not going to die

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Wait

109
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Wait

110
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
I want to pretend to be her

111
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
She gave too much

112
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
What is it?

113
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Continue to fight

114
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
You are too despicable

115
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
You are too despicable

116
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Go

117
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Wait for me

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Who

119
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Wait for me

120
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Go after her

121
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
Go after her

122
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Hurry

123
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Hurry

124
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Stop

125
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Don't run

126
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Don't run

127
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Hurry

128
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Hurry

129
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Hurry

130
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
How is it?

131
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
I have tried my best

132
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
It's a big deal

133
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
How can we explain to the head

134
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
You two are useless

135
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
There is no way

136
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
It's going to rain

137
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Let's go back and talk

138
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Sir

139
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
The back office has prepared a good hot pot for you

140
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
Please eat hot pot

141
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
It's cold

142
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm sorry

143
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
I'm sorry

144
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120

I'm sorry

149
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm sorry

150
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120

I'm sorry

167
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
I'm sorry

168
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
I'm sorry

169
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
I'm sorry

170
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
I'm sorry

171
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
I'm sorry

172
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
I'm sorry

173
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
I'm sorry

174
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Hello

175
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
It is incredibly nice to visit facades

176
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
It is incredibly nice to experience facades

177
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
It is incredibly nice to experience facades

178
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
It is incredibly nice to experience facades

179
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
It is incredibly nice to experience facades

180
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
It is incredibly nice to experience facades

181
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Forget him, forget him

182
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Forget the rest of the year

183
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,120
How silly is the love song
