00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,960
Most Beautiful Night

4
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,360
So you'reろうarape

5
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,880
You killed your father

6
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,140
My father had hit me

7
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,020
But I have no reason to kill him

8
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,020
This can't prove anything.

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,020
And I have a disability.

10
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,020
I can't stand up.

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,020
How can I kill him?

12
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,020
I...

13
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,020
You have nothing to say, right?

14
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,020
Xiaopan is a victim.

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,020
You still talk nonsense.

16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,020
Are you a human?

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,020
That's it.

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,020
He's like this.

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,020
How can you kill him?

20
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,020
Qing, are you wrong?

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,020
No, no.

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,020
Where are you standing?

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,020
Come here.

24
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,020
Pretty sister gives Bu Bu delicious food.

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,020
Bu Bu is...

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,020
Here, eat slowly.

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,020
Thank you, pretty sister.

28
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,020
Eat, eat, eat.

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,020
You can't eat.

30
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
Bu Bu, eat more.

31
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,020
It's delicious.

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,020
The End

33
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,020
You are indeed a famous dish.

34
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,020
It's the best dish.

35
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,020
It's worth to be the best.

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,020
Qing, you are so stupid.

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,020
You can't even think of this.

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,020
There is only one truth.

39
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,020
Xiaopan's disability is fake.

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,020
Fake?

41
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,020
How is that possible?

42
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
Xiaopan has been doing this for so long.

43
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,020
How can it be fake?

44
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,020
Xiaopan can't be this kind of person.

45
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,020
The truth of the story is like this.

46
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,020
You can't buy it.

47
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,020
This is the last thing my mother left me.

48
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,020
You can't buy it.

49
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,020
I can pay you back when I win.

50
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,020
I will definitely win.

51
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,020
No.

52
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,020
Stinky girl, you are shameless.

53
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,020
Get out.

54
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,020
My leg.

55
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,020
My leg.

56
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,020
After this, you are on the surface.

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,020
After this, you are on the surface.

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,020
You have started to plan to kill Ban Zhuo.

59
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,020
You are a weak girl.

60
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
You can only play tricks to kill Ban Zhuo.

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,020
For example, you use the bar to hang the bar.

62
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,020
The wheelchair is useful at this time.

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,020
You can use the weight of the wheelchair to hang the bar.

64
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,020
You practice repeatedly for this.

65
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,020
But Acai doesn't know your plan.

66
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,020
You are a weak girl.

67
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,020
You can only play tricks to kill Ban Zhuo.

68
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,020
For example, you use the bar to hang the bar.

69
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,020
You play tricks to kill Ban Zhuo.

70
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,020
For example, you use the bar to hang the bar.

71
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
After this, you are on the surface.

72
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,500
Your

73
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,020
so callel there are three grounds.

74
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,020
You play tricks to kill Ban Zhuo.

75
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,020
Now you are a strong girl.

76
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Stop chasing you.

77
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,020
Okay.

78
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,020
Xiao Pan, look.

79
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
Is it pretty?

80
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,020
I made it myself.

81
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Okay.

82
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,020
That's it.

83
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,020
Ah Cai broke into your plan.

84
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,020
