Island of the Dead

wednesday

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:28,520
Section 10

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:50,080
Thank you

6
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,940
We called for something at the last mortar

7
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:23,880
The

8
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,060
his

9
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,060
It's getting more and more interesting.

10
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,060
What's interesting?

11
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,060
What's interesting?

12
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,060
What's interesting?

13
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,060
Why are you here again?

14
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,060
You can actually release the person you killed.

15
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,060
Is there any other way?

16
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,060
Who do you think is the murderer?

17
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,060
You are the murderer.

18
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,060
How can you release the murderer?

19
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,060
How can you release him?

20
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,060
I told you I'm not the murderer.

21
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,060
Murder is a life.

22
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,060
I'll avenge the old class leader today.

23
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,060
Murder is a life.

24
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,060
I don't need you to do it.

25
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,060
Did you hear that?

26
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
I didn't kill anyone.

27
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,060
You say no, you don't.

28
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,060
You are a murderer.

29
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,060
Why do you say that?

30
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,060
Yes, why?

31
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,060
Why?

32
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,060
Why?

33
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,060
I already know the truth.

34
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,060
The class leader died before the crime.

35
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,060
What?

36
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,060
How could he die?

37
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,060
Can't you see the knife on his neck?

38
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,060
Knife?

39
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,060
When I was testing the knife,

40
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,060
I found that the knife was open and not twisted.

41
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,060
It means the victim is not killed by the knife.

42
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,060
He was cut open by the knife after he died.

43
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,060
I also found that the victim's eyes are blood and face is pale.

44
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,060
This is in accordance with the state of suffocation.

45
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,060
In fact,

46
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,060
he was strangled to death.

47
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,060
Strangled to death?

48
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
Who would do that?

49
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,060
I told you that I don't understand.

50
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,060
As for the murder case,

51
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,060
I'll tell you the truth.

52
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,060
The real murderer is...

53
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,060
What is this?

54
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060
What is this?

55
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,060
What is this?

56
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
No way.

57
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,060
It's...

58
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,060
braised pork.

59
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
I want to eat braised pork.

60
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,060
You are so cruel.

61
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,060
You are messing with me.

62
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
Chase her.

63
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
Ah-Qing.

64
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
Get up, Ah-Qing.

65
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,060
Ah-Qing, I'm tired.

66
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,060
I want to eat.

67
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,060
It's not the time.

68
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,060
You still want to eat?

69
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Give me back the Glyph.

70
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,060
You are going to die.

71
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,060
I'm not the Glyph. I'm the Groom.

72
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,060
If the Glyph doesn't come back, we are dead.

73
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
We are dead.

74
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
Dead?

75
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,060
Dead?

76
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,060
What does it mean?

77
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,060
We can't eat any more.

78
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
No.

79
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,060
No, I don't want to eat any more.

80
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
How can we get it back?

81
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,060
This is the same as the murder case.

82
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,060
I don't want to eat any more.

83
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,060
I know.

84
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,060
You mean you have to be in danger first?

85
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,060
Gu-Gu.

86
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,060
I'll show you something exciting.

87
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,060
Exciting?

88
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,060
How exciting?

89
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,060
Very exciting.

90
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,060
Wow, Gu-Gu wants to be exciting.

91
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,060
Exciting.

92
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,060
Forget him, forget him

93
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Forget the flowers in the wound

94
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,060
Forget the little boat going home

95
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,060
Forget, forget him, forget him

96
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,060
Forget the summer of that year

97
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,060
How silly the love song is

98
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,060
Forget the goodbye

99
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:43,060
I can't see the face that turned back

100
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,060
Forget the three lives, three lives

101
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,060
A kiss sealed the past

102
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,060
Forget the black fog, your white clothes

103
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,060
Grey summer

104
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:07,060
I dare not see you again

105
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,060
Forget everything

106
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:23,060
Forget, forget him, forget him

107
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,060
Forget the flowers in the wound

108
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,060
Forget the little boat going home

109
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,060
Forget, forget him, forget him

110
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Forget the summer of that year

111
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,060
How silly the love song is
