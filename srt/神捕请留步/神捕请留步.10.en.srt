In order to Equip your Bel bra, you first serve Firesteam.

After the flet away, simply Enable a range of sweets wish can surpassowym events.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,520
Isn't true I'm announced

00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:12,560
Theaal

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
The arrow.

9
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,560
This is the first gift that I prepared for A Qing.

10
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
A Qing said that her favorite thing is money.

11
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,560
It's so beautiful.

12
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm hungry.

13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
I want to eat.

14
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
Okay.

15
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,560
This gift is your meal.

16
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Let's eat.

17
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Go.

18
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
It's the third day.

19
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,560
Let me show you my secret roasted sweet potato.

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,560
I could only eat sweet potatoes when I was a kid.

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,560
But even so, my mom could make sweet potatoes into flowers.

22
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,560
I used to live on sweet potatoes.

23
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,560
I have a dream.

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
I want to be a cashier.

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
I want to be a cashier.

26
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,560
But there is no female cashier in this world.

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
So I'm happy to know you.

28
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Okay.

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Let me see.

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Go.

31
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Wow.

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Here.

33
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
The sweet potatoes A Qing roasted are so delicious.

34
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Is it delicious?

35
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
You're worthy of selling sweet potatoes before.

36
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
It's really delicious.

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
You're so considerate.

38
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
You said that the killer

67
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
How is it now?

68
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Who are you talking about?

69
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
That girl.

70
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Didn't the Magistrate give her three days

71
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Let her find the killer

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
How many days is today?

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
It's the third day.

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
The third day.

75
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
I don't know if she found the killer.

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
I don't know if she found the killer.

77
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Are you a god or a woman?

78
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
What do you think?

79
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
It turns out that food is the key to transformation.

80
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Sir, we heard the news.

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
I'll be right over.

82
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
You're late again.

83
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
You don't have to do it.

84
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
You have to use a lot of donkey skin to repair your skin.

85
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Is the donkey skin that hides in secret still enough?

86
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
I don't understand what you're talking about.

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
What are you doing?

88
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
At the order of the Magistrate

89
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
I came to point out the killer.

90
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
The killer?

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
You're wrong.

92
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
The killer is not there.

93
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
What are you doing here?

94
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Jin Tiao Yuan Bao

95
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Yes, sir.

96
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Close the mouth.

97
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Open the mouth.

101
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
What's wrong with you?

102
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
You let the real killer go.

103
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Don't worry.

104
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
I'm here this time.

105
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
I'll let you get used to it.

106
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Remember I said last time

107
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
The leader was killed

108
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Before the shadow play?

109
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
How can the dead play the role?

110
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Can the dead still move?

111
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Good question.

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
The dead can move.

113
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
The shadow is also dead.

114
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
You can move.

115
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Make the dead a shadow

116
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Don't you move?

117
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Make people a shadow?

118
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
The dead can move.

119
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
The shadow is also dead.

120
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
The shadow is also dead.

121
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
The shadow is also dead.

122
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
The shadow is also dead.

123
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
The shadow is also dead.

124
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
The shadow is also dead.

125
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
The shadow is also dead.

126
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
The shadow is also dead.

127
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
The shadow is also dead.

128
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
The shadow is also dead.

129
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
The shadow is also dead.

130
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
The shadow is also dead.

131
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
The shadow is also dead.

132
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Forget

133
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Forget him

134
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Forget him

135
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Forget the rest of that year

136
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,560
How silly the love song is

137
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Forget to say goodbye

138
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,560
I can't see it anymore

139
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Turned over the face

140
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Forget the three lives

141
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Three lives, one kiss

142
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Sealed the past

143
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Forgot the black fog

144
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Your white clothes

145
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Grey summer

146
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,560
But I dare not to say goodbye to you

147
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Forgot everything

148
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Forgot everything

149
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Forget

150
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Forget him

151
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Forget him

152
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Forget the flowers in the forest

153
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Forgot the battlefield in the air

154
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Forget

155
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Forget him

156
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Forget him

157
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Forget the rest of that year

158
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,560
How silly the love song is

159
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Everyone is not close to all the love
