1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,300
As I male and batter

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,440
you

3
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,840
Are in

4
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,840
Three days ago, I found this thread here.

5
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,840
This thread has no color, no taste, and is also called the shadowless thread.

6
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,840
It can not only control the shadow, but also kill people.

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:23,840
When I was doing the autopsy, I found a scratch on the owner's finger.

8
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,840
It is exactly the same as the shadowless thread.

9
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,840
When the murder took place, the owner had multiple shadowless threads.

10
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,840
Really?

11
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:50,840
The only person who could use this thread that night was Ah Cai from the shadowless building.

12
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Ah Cai, do you have anything else to say?

13
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Do you think your theory is right?

14
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Why would I kill the owner?

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Your theory is not true.

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,840
One shadowless person can only control one shadowless person.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,840
And I have good memory, and two hands can control two different shadows.

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Then the question arises, how can I kill people with two hands?

19
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,840
That's not easy. Use your feet.

20
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Blood? How can I explain the blood?

21
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,840
If the owner had been strangled to death, why would he bleed?

22
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,840
This blood proofed that you are the murderer.

23
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,840
Did you notice anything different about today's scene?

24
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,840
I remember when I watched the shadow drama, the light was on the left. Why is it on the right today?

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
The light of the scene was on the left.

26
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,840
But when I was checking the scene, I found the blood on the back.

27
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,840
The truth is that someone moved the tomb on the day of the murder.

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Ah Cai, do you have anything else to say?

29
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Ah Cai, is it really you? Why did you do that?

30
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Ah Cai, why is it you?

31
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Ah Cai, you killed the owner.

32
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,840
I didn't mean to kill him.

33
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,840
At that time, the salary of the troupe was getting lower and lower.

34
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,840
I wanted to make a new film, and to play a new character.

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,840
But the troupe owner didn't agree with my plan.

36
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,840
Impossible! My troupe can't be in the same situation.

37
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Isn't it great to play a character like Chu Han? Why can't we continue to play?

38
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Troupe owner, troupe owner.

39
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,840
The salary of the troupe is getting lower and lower.

40
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
You know that.

41
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,840
It's not good to be a regular.

42
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,840
We should do what the audience likes.

43
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Now the audience likes to watch the love drama.

44
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Let's do the love drama.

45
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Okay, I said it. I'm the troupe owner. I said it.

46
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,840
My troupe can only play the old troupe owner.

47
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Troupe owner, troupe owner.

48
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,840
I was rejected several times.

49
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,840
I made a new film and needed a donkey skin.

50
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,840
But the donkey skin is expensive and I have no money.

51
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,840
So I pretended to be a fool.

52
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,840
I took the opportunity to fix the donkey skin.

53
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
I secretly transferred the donkey skin in the script.

54
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,840
I was rejected several times.

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
I was rejected several times.

56
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,840
I took the opportunity to fix the donkey skin.

57
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,840
I secretly transferred the donkey skin in the script.

58
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
I used it to make a new film.

59
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
But the troupe couldn't keep the fire.

60
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,840
He still found out.

61
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,840
The first half hour of the opening of the drama.

62
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,840
In his room, he saw me.

63
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Ah Cai, what are you doing?

64
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Troupe owner, the drama is about to start.

65
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
I'll go prepare.

66
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Stop.

67
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
How long have you been doing this?

68
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
It's really you.

69
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,840
I've been burning your body for years.

70
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
You're stupid.

71
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,840
How dare you steal my money?

72
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Troupe owner, listen to me.

73
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
I stole the donkey skin not for others.

74
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
I did it for the life of the troupe.

75
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
What explanation?

76
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
You just want to use your new film.

77
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Okay, I promise you.

78
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Get out of here now.

79
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Go get your food.

80
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Don't come back again.

81
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Troupe owner.

82
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Troupe owner, no.

83
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Troupe owner, you can't drive me away.

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Troupe owner, master.

85
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
I only know how to make a film.

86
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,840
I can't live without this.

87
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
The drama is about to start.

88
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Go prepare.

89
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
Stealing your money.

90
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Stealing your money.

91
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Is that your money?

92
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
That's the whole troupe's money.

93
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Forget him, forget him

94
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Forget the flowers in the wound

95
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Forget the little boat going home

96
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Forget, forget him, forget him

97
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Forget the summer of that year

98
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,840
How silly the love song is

99
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,320
Forget the

100
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,840
face that can't be seen again

101
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Forget the three lifetimes

102
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,840
A kiss sealed the past

103
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Forget the black night

104
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Your white clothes

105
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,840
The gray summer

106
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Never dare to say goodbye

107
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,840
I see you again

108
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Forget everything

109
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Forget, forget him, forget him

110
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Forget the flowers in the wound

111
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Forget the boat going home

112
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Forget, forget him, forget him

113
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Forget the summer of that year

114
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,840
How silly the love song is
