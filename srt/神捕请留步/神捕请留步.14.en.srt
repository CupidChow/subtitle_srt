1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Okay.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
I'll go to the kitchen.

3
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,160
This is for Brother A-Cai.

4
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,200
Fried food.

5
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,640
Is it your favorite?

6
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,080
I know this dish.

7
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,240
It's made with shrimp meat.

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,520
It's put in the stomach of sea cucumber.

9
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,640
It's steamed together.

10
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,760
Brother A-Cai is going to behead today.

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,960
Let's give him something good.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,840
Go.

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,080
We're going to see A-Cai off.

14
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,040
If you feel uncomfortable,

15
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,840
you can...

16
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,720
I'm not feeling well.

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,400
So I won't go with you.

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
When you see A-Cai,

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,440
please help me to ask him

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,800
if he regrets it.

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,960
Pan, I'm sorry to bother you.

22
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,840
We'll bring your words to him.

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,920
Let's go.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
Go.

25
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,560
Bu Bu.

26
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,040
What are you doing here?

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,400
Bu Bu wants to solve the case.

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,720
Bu Bu wants to save someone.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,960
You've solved it?

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,800
You said it.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,760
I'm helping you.

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,840
Let's go.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,720
Where are you going?

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,680
We're going to see Brother A-Cai off.

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,720
Go back.

36
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,880
I want to solve the case.

37
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,120
The murderer is still among you.

38
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,240
Still among us?

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,880
Go.

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,400
Go and send food to A-Cai?

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,440
Yes.

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,760
Instead of sending food,

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,880
we should help him clear his name.

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,160
What do you mean?

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
A-Cai is not the murderer.

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,880
There's another murderer.

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,560
You said he killed someone.

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,800
Now you say he didn't kill someone.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,160
What do you want?

50
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,240
Find the truth.

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,400
You're right.

52
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,920
Now we're here to find the murderer.

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,200
You mean the murderer is here?

54
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,880
Yes.

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,080
There are eight of you in the troupe.

56
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,440
Except your father and A-Cai,

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
the real murderer

58
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,640
is among you six.

59
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,560
Do you have any evidence?

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,520
Evidence?

61
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,640
No.

62
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
No.

63
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,240
But as long as I look carefully,

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,920
I can find the murderer.

65
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,800
Okay.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,600
You can look for the murderer

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,840
as you like.

68
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,960
Let's eat first.

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,320
Don't you feel a little bit proud?

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,600
You're not mine.

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,120
I don't have to stay with my Plwhen.

72
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,480
Though my home is a ass where I fit,

73
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,960
I still still have you.

74
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,760
Okay.

75
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,080
His Lordship.

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,000
hungerstress Jiao 180 A-Cai

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,840
should have known

78
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,760
某阿享,

79
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,840
Aren't you afraid?

80
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,440
The murderer

81
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,520
went missing on that day.

82
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,160
You're the only one

83
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,620
in this place who is able to

84
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,120
expose yourself.

85
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,000
The murderer is you.

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
On that day, you are the only one

87
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,120
that was even among us.

88
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,480
I have no reason to kill my father.

89
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
Who says no?

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,280
I've been in the Pinyin Theater for many years.

91
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,800
Every time I see you, I'm the leader of the Yixing Company.

92
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
But in the last half year,

93
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,480
you've been ill and can't leave the house.

94
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
But your son has never disappeared.

95
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,240
This means

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,800
the person who beat you is the person around you.

97
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,960
But who dares to beat a class leader's daughter in the theater?

98
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,560
Only your father, the class leader.

99
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,400
You can't live your own life.

100
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,720
You can't leave the theater.

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,280
But in the theater,

102
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,240
there's only endless pain.

103
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,840
So you're so guilty.

104
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,920
I'll kill you.

105
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,040
Forget him, forget him.

106
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,400
Forget the flowers blooming at the mouth.

107
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,840
Forget the little boat going home.

108
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,360
Forget him, forget him.

109
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Forget him, forget him.

110
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Forget him, forget him.

111
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Forget him, forget him.

112
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,400
How silly the love song is.

113
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,280
Forget the frosty mountains.

114
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,280
I can't see your face again.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,640
Forget the three lifetimes.

116
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
A thousand years have passed.

117
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,800
I've sealed the past.

118
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Forget the black mist.

119
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Your white clothes.

120
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
The gray summer.

121
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:59,480
I can't see your face again.

122
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Forget everything.

123
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Forget him, forget him.

124
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Forget him, forget him.

125
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Forget the flowers blooming at the mouth.

126
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Forget the little boat going home.

127
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Forget him, forget him.

128
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Forget him, forget him.

129
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Forget the summer.

130
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,480
How silly the love song is.

131
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Forget the flowers blooming at the mouth.

132
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Forget the three lifetimes.

133
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,480
A thousand years have passed.

134
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Forget the flowers blooming at the mouth.

135
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Forget the three lifetimes.

136
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Forget the flowers blooming at the mouth.

137
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Forget the flowers blooming at the mouth.
