1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
AND NEXT phon aqua

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Coming rectangular

3
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,100
Fast luck

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,740
мн

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The first time the magistrate saw the owner's daughter was a surprise.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He gave her a bride.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The owner's daughter was married to a concubine by the magistrate.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But she didn't want to marry the magistrate.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
After the engagement, the magistrate often cried.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The neighbors couldn't sleep at night.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I know to cry. I know to cry.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If the magistrate refuses to marry her, it will be troublesome.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The owner of the magistrate thinks of a way to escape from the wedding.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He made a fake bride and acted a play.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It seems that his daughter's marriage is over.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So the murderer is not someone else.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's the daughter of the magistrate.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What are you waiting for?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Catch her.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I remember.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The owner put his daughter's clothes in the coffin.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So the bride must be in the coffin.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Chase her.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hurry.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hurry.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hurry.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Chase her.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Stop.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll file a case.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Put it down.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Open it.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Are you satisfied with the case?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What?

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The case was so smooth.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's the result of your guidance.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The owner of the branch shop and his daughter are not the same.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They can't think of such a smart way.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And you appeared at the right time.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Nonsense.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If it's really me, I would have saved him that night.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why should I come here again?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Because you admire me.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But you don't know me.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You only follow me.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You just want to see how I can solve the case.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You have no evidence.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Do you remember the red blanket?

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But the dead man's blanket is so strange.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Ordinary people are so desperate.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But you don't care.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There is only one explanation.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You know the bride is not dead.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I planned this play.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
My friend Nian Fang Erba is going to marry a man who is not familiar with the play.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No one will be willing to marry him.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So I helped him.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you think I'm wrong?

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
A fake death is better than a life of death.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I understand what you said.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But I don't understand.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why do women have to pay for their life when they are looked at?

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Who is wrong?

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not wrong.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You can arrest me.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why should I arrest you?

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There is no dead man or real murderer in this case.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Actually, this case is no longer there.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You said it.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's wrong with you?

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Qing, I'm hungry.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Help me.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I want to eat.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let go of me.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Qing, hurry up.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hurry up.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm starving.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hurry up.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's not good.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Leave it.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's not ready yet.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It smells so good, Qing.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Fried rice with eggs.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's North Crispy Golden Jade Rice.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How much is this special meal?

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What do you mean by money?

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What are you pretending to be?

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You don't know money?

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's really bad.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Here you are.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You are so stupid.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not Liu Shen.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm not Liu Shen.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm not stupid.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm Bu Bu.

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Liu Bu Bu.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm eating.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll keep it for you.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's really bad.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's good to eat it for you.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Am I real or fake?

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Liu Shen.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Stupid.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm Bu Bu.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I won.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I lost, Qing.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can't let this guy eat and drink for free.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Bu Bu.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Qing.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Here, change.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's not as pretty as Bu Bu.

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What nonsense is this?

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Just change it.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Go.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm not going to eat it.

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's not bad.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Turn around.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm not satisfied.

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm tired.

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm crying.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Who is it?

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Who is it?

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm not going to eat it.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm not going to eat it.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Qing, add some green onions.

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't add so much green onions.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Bu Bu, serve the guests.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm going to kill someone.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're going to kill someone.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm going to kill someone.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm going to kill someone.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm going to kill someone.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm going to kill someone.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm going to kill someone.

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm going to kill someone.

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm going to kill someone.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm going to kill someone.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm going to kill someone.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm going to kill someone.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going to kill someone.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm going to kill someone.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm going to kill someone.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm going to kill someone.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm going to kill someone.

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm going to kill someone.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm going to kill someone.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm going to kill someone.

153
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm going to kill someone.

154
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm going to kill someone.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm going to kill someone.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm going to kill someone.

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm going to kill someone.

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm going to kill someone.

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm going to kill someone.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm going to kill someone.

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm going to kill someone.

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm going to kill someone.

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Forget, forget him.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Forget him.

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Forget the rest of the year.

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
How silly is the love song?
