00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,740
Okay.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,740
You should perform well today.

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,740
If you perform well,

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,740
I will make fried rice for you today.

22
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,740
Here.

23
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,740
I don't want to eat.

24
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,740
It's so disgusting.

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,740
Last time, I made it for you.

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,740
This time, I will make it for you.

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,740

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,740
Please come in.

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,740
Please watch the play.

30
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,740
New play.

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,740
Good.

32
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,740
Good.

33
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,740
Good performance.

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,740
Good.

35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,740
Isn't this the class leader?

36
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,740
Why is he watching his own play?

37
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,740
He is so good.

38
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Good.

39
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,740
Good.

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,740
It seems that it's a good play again.

41
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,740
Good.

42
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,740
Good.

43
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,740
Great.

Kill.

72
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
Where is the killer?

73
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,740
Let's go.

74
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,740
Let's go.

75
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,740
Class leader.

76
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,740
Class leader.

77
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,740
Xiao Pan.

78
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,740
Your father died so suddenly.

79
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,740
My father usually doesn't have any enemies.

80
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
He died so suddenly.

81
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,740
Please help me to make the decision.

82
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,740
Class leader died so suddenly.

83
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,740
What should we do in the future?

84
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,740
There is also Acai.

85
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,740
Why hasn't the supplementary block come yet?

86
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,740
Why hasn't it come yet?

87
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
There is a Taoist.

88
00:03:51,740 --> 00:04:01,340
The

89
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,740
Murder.

90
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,740
Our class leader was killed.

91
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,740
Murder.

92
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,740
We were killed.

93
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Shut up.

94
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,740
You.

95
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,740
Me.

96
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,740
Tell me.

97
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,740
What happened?

98
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,740
At that time, the play was half-finished.

99
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,740
The shadow suddenly stopped moving.

100
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,740
Then the shadow on the wall suddenly moved by itself.

101
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
One stab.

102
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,740
The class leader suddenly died.

103
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,740
Ok.

104
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
ok.

105
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
Ah.

106
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,740
The Eyes of the God said that a deep wound on the body part of the victim's neck.

107
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,740
It should be known as a في.

108
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
Contemplate the shadows.

109
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,260
This shadow is a shadow

110
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,300
There is a light behind the screen

111
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,420
Can directly

112
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,860
A shadow is taken on the wall

113
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,940
Make yourself smart

114
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,300
This case seems complicated

115
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,620
In fact, you can see it at a glance

116
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,900
What did you say

117
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,220
The murderer is

118
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,580
you

119
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
I

120
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,420
The shadow on the hand

121
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,540
Shadow

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,700
This is a classic shadow murder case

123
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,100
There is a

124
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Who reported the case

125
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,980
We reported the case

126
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,780
Wait a minute

127
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
Ah Qing

128
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,300
Why are you again

129
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,500
You are a bad girl

130
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,660
What are you doing here

131
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,660
Hurry up

132
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,700
Sir

133
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,740
I'm not here to get a party today

134
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,820
This is a real god

135
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,820
God

136
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,300
This pure goods

137
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,580
If he wants to be a god

138
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,580
I am the god

139
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,580
His father

140
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,020
What's going on

141
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
Go

142
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,740
Who dragged the ground so slippery

143
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,260
God

144
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,780
Why are you here

145
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,740
Why do they all call me god

146
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,300
I'm breaking the case

147
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Don't talk

148
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,060
See

149
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,820
This is the god of the six gates

150
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,940
My man

151
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,940
Everyone listen to me

152
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,020
Ten years ago

153
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,700
There was a similar

154
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,180
Same shadow murder case here

155
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,500
At that time

156
00:07:34,940 --> 00:08:04,660
Mm

157
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,940
The case is solved.

158
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,940
Forget, forget him, forget him

159
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,940
Forget the flowers blooming in the wound

160
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,940
Forget the little boat going home

161
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,940
Forget, forget him, forget him

162
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Forget the hill in the old days

163
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,940
How silly the love song is

164
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,940
Forget the brush, goodbye, I can't see it anymore

165
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,940
Turned the face

166
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,940
Forget the three lives, three lives

167
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,940
A kiss is sealed in the past

168
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,940
Forget the black fog, your white clothes

169
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,940
The gray summer rain

170
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:40,940
But I don't dare to see you again

171
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,940
Forget everything

172
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,940
Forget, forget him, forget him

173
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Forget the big flower, the flowers you see

174
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Forget the hangzhou, the battlefield

175
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,940
Forget, forget him, forget him

176
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Forget the world that is full of rain

177
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,940
How silly the love song is
