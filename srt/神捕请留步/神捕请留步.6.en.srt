***

5
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,000
Hold him!

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You have the guts!

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sit down.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You are so cruel!

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You think I am a coward?

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Stop talking nonsense.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Sit down.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I came back this time

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to tell you

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I want to escape.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can't catch me.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You...

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What do you mean?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We both know

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
he is not the murderer.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why do I care so much?

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
As long as I can explain to the superior.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What is the superior?

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The governor.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Where is the superior?

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
At the entrance.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sir.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I think so too.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This thing

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
is really a bit strange.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Three days.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Three days.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I will help you find the real murderer.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What if you can't do it?

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I am willing to bear the consequences.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This hot pot is very fragrant.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Three days.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I can't stop you from eating.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What if we can't find the murderer in three days?

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You will die, sir.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you a ghost or a ghost?

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I am a ghost.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't believe it.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
A ghost or a ghost,

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
who knows?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why did you suddenly become a ghost?

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why did you frame me as a murderer?

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Explain it to me.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I just asked the county magistrate to cooperate with me

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to play a play.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Wait for me.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wait for me.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You will constantly change between these two states.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can understand it like that.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
When did it start?

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't really remember.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Then how do you explain that you framed me as a murderer?

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Only when you are caught

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
can the murderer relax his vigilance.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This way, he will be able to show his feet.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Did you catch the murderer?

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have been observing in Piying West Building for five days.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I want to find some clues.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When did you start to bury me?

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
According to the custom,

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
at least the first seven days.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
One can't be reborn after death.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But the person who survived

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
should still live well.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It doesn't matter anymore.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
After the master died,

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
his daughter was depressed all day.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And the others...

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Master,

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
your death has nothing to do with me.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sister Pan,

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I will take care of her for you.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Master,

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I didn't kill you.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't come to me.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
By then,

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I will burn more paper for you.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have been waiting for you to die.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's not early to die.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Where is Tianqu?

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't know where Tianqu is.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I miss you.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not appropriate to be here.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Stop it.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Look, the leader is still here.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Stop it.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He is dead.

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you afraid of?

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Did you hear the sound of the stone?

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No one is here.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why are you so stubborn?

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The old man is not a coward.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why are you afraid of him?

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's go.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So you...

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I didn't find the dead horse.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It means that the murderer is very cunning.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But it's interesting to have such an opponent.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's interesting.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are interesting.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you know how many crimes I have committed?

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How do you plan to compensate me?

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
How do you want me to compensate you?

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
From now on,

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
wherever you go,

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
you must take me with you.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't get hurt.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then you can be my assistant.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't open my eyes.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll show you.

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll show you.

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But use my method.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The clue is to use the money to buy it.

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,180
I'll go to the

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
store.

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll go to the store.

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll go to the store.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll go to the store.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll go to the store.

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll go to the store.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll go to the store.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll go to the store.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll go to the store.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll go to the store.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll go to the store.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll go to the store.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll go to the store.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll go to the store.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll go to the store.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll go to the store.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll go to the store.

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll go to the store.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll go to the store.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll go to the store.

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll go to the store.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll go to the store.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Forget, forget him.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Forget him.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Forget the flowers that the wound opened.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Forget the little ugly thing that is going home.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Forget, forget him.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Forget him.

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Forget the rest of that year.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How silly is the love song.

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Forget the frosty mountains.

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I can't see the face that turned past again.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Forget the three lifetimes.

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
A kiss is sealed in the past.

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Forget the black mist.

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Your white clothes.

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The gray next day.

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But I dare not to see you again.

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Forget everything.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Forget, forget him.

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Forget him.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Forget the flowers that the wound opened.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Forget the little ugly thing that is going home.

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Forget, forget him.

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Forget him.

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Forget the rest of that year.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
How silly is the love song.
