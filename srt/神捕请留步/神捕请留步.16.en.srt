Ramadan

3
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,460
I'm fine. I'm here.

4
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,460
I'm fine. I'm here.

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,460
tantan

6
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,460
Excellent!

7
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,680
Great!

8
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,540
A bright world,

9
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,680
May the light shine.

10
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,680
The plan to kill me was made by Acai to protect you.

11
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Why did he protect me?

12
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Because he loves you.

13
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Pan and Acai?

14
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Acai is too smart, but he is too stupid.

15
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,680
This sword is very special to you and Acai.

16
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,680
He was dragged away on the day of the execution.

17
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
He kept looking back at this.

18
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Now I will take it back.

19
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,680
Now I will take it back.

20
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,680
I want to see him off.

21
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,680
The time has come.

22
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,680
Sir.

23
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Stop!

24
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Go back!

25
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Go back!

26
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Acai!

27
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Acai, I'm coming!

28
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Kill me!

29
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
Kill me!

30
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Kill me!

31
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Kill me!

32
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Kill me!

33
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Kill me!

34
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
Kill me!

35
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Kill me!

36
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Kill me!

37
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Kill me!

38
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Sir, please wait.

39
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
What do you want?

40
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Acai is not the murderer.

41
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
You are the murderer.

42
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
You pushed him over.

43
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,680
If you are wrong, you will not fulfill the three-day agreement.

44
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
I am willing to bear the consequences.

45
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Do you have any evidence to prove what you said?

46
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Sir, we have enough evidence to prove that he is not the murderer.

47
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Ridiculous!

48
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
This is a execution ground.

49
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,680
What you said is iron evidence.

50
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Sir, although we do not have direct evidence,

51
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
we have enough evidence to prove that he is not the murderer.

52
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
But we have enough evidence to prove that we...

53
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Enough!

54
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
This is not a execution ground.

55
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
This is not a game.

56
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Stop making trouble!

57
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
This is not a game.

58
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Sir, please think about it.

59
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Sir...

60
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
This man is a traitor.

61
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Drive him away!

62
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Sir, you will regret it.

63
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Sir, you will regret it.

64
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Sir, you will regret it.

65
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
You will regret it.

66
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Qin Xiu!

67
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Stop!

68
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
It was me.

69
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
I killed him.

70
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
I killed my father.

71
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Forget him, forget him

72
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Forget the flowers in the wound

73
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Forget the little boat going home

74
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Forget, forget him, forget him

75
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Forget the summer of that year

76
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Forget the sound of the flute

77
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,680
How silly the song is

78
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Forget the sound of the flute

79
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Goodbye, I can't see you again

80
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
The face that turned

81
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Forget the three lives, three lives

82
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
A kiss is a sword

83
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
The past is sealed

84
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Forget the black fog

85
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Your white clothes

86
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,680
The gray summer

87
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I dare not see you again

88
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,680
Forget everything

89
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Forget, forget him, forget him

90
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Forget the flowers in the wound

91
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Forget the little boat going home

92
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Forget, forget him, forget him

93
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Forget the summer of that year

94
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Forget the sound of the flute
