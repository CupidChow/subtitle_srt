1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,640
Well, I asked him to come, but he just 그런데Then I'm really going to confront you yourself

2
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,680
Prepare to get —

3
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,000
It's not…

4
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,900
What?

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,780
Don't do it!

6
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,580
We have missed a big clue.

7
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,580
Shadow killed someone, but the shadow didn't move.

8
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,380
In the West Tower, someone is controlling the shadow.

9
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,780
You mean...

10
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,380
Ah Cai and his accomplice?

11
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,580
Not accomplice.

12
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,180
Ah Cai is so careful.

13
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,980
He won't allow anyone to interfere in his criminal process.

14
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,780
The more people involved, the more flaws are revealed.

15
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,980
Then, besides accomplice, who else could it be?

16
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,380
It's the real killer.

17
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,380
The real killer?

18
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,580
We were all fooled by Ah Cai.

19
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,180
Ah Cai has such a deep plot.

20
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,580
How could he choose such a criminal method that is so eye-catching?

21
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,780
Why does he know that the clues we found didn't escape?

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,380
Because...

23
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,780
he is blaming others.

24
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,380
Then why did he do that?

25
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,780
How did he do it?

26
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,580
This is a perfect crime.

27
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,380
He even thought about the finger movement of the victim.

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,780
He even left me a clue to the case.

29
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,380
He told me to find him through blood and believe in it.

30
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,380
The case is already so complicated.

31
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,580
There is still a twist.

32
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,180
It's too late.

33
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,580
We have to find the real killer before he gets killed.

34
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,180
Let's go.

35
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,580
It's too late.

36
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,780
No way. You want to change your mind now?

37
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,780
Pay attention.

38
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,580
You must pay attention to the direction of the shadow's head.

39
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,580
And...

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,180
And...

41
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,580
And...

42
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,980
And...

43
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,180
What else?

44
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,980
What else?

45
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,780
Tell me. What else?

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,980
What else?

47
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,980
There is food.

48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,980
I'm so hungry.

49
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980
Eat.

50
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
How could this happen?

51
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,980
It was like this last time.

52
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,380
If God doesn't come back,

53
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,380
do I really have to solve the case alone?

54
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,780
How could I solve such a complicated case?

55
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,380
Solve the case?

56
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,980
Solve the case?

57
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,980
Can you solve it?

58
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,380
Solve the case?

59
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,980
Why do we have to solve the case?

60
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,980
We sent the fake killer into the prison.

61
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,580
Now he is going to be beheaded.

62
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,980
What is beheaded?

63
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,980
It means he is going to die.

64
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,380
I am just a cook.

65
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,780
My stall hasn't opened for days.

66
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,180
It's all yellow now.

67
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,580
I am not a real cook.

68
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,180
What if I go there and clean the street?

69
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,580
What if I run away?

70
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,980
I don't want to live there.

71
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,580
But it's not easy to escape.

72
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,780
Am I right, Bu Bu?

73
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,980
You are right.

74
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
I will listen to you.

75
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,180
So this is over?

76
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,180
Yes.

77
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,580
It's over.

78
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,180
What case?

79
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,780
It's none of my business.

80
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,380
Yes.

81
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,580
Now the most important thing is

82
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,380
to reopen the stall.

83
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,380
Yes.

84
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,580
But I will be in charge of the food and you will be in charge of the work.

85
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,380
Okay. How?

86
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,180
We will make the stall bigger and stronger.

87
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,180
And make it more glorious.

88
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,980
Make it bigger and stronger and make it more glorious.

89
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Yeah.

90
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,780
Wow.

91
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,780
Bu Bu, write down the details.

92
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,780
I'm ready.

93
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,380
Bu Bu.

94
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,980
Bu Bu, your food and drinks are over.

95
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,580
This is series one.

96
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,980
Why are you still asleep?

97
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,980
Take the lead in the third episode.

98
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,980
How I long for you

99
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,640
Oh, you worked out for me

100
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,820
You have lost weight

101
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
I try to realize that once I am an alien

102
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,460
I don't believe in aliens

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,100
Wait for me

104
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,860
For course

105
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,980
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,980
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,980
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,980
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,980
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,980
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,980
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,980
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,980
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,980
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,980
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,980
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,980
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,980
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,980
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,980
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,980
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,980
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,980
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,980
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,980
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,980
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,980
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,980
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,980
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,980
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,980
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,980
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,980
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,980
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,980
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,980
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,980
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,980
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,980
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,980
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,980
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
I'm sorry.
