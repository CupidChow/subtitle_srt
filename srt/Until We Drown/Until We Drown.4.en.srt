1
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:23,333
Yamada!

2
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,000
Cheng Yu!

3
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,333
I came to apologize.

4
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,125
No need.

5
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,875
Give me just one minute. One minute.

6
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,208
Ever since I got beaten that day,

7
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,583
I knew I was wrong.

8
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,666
I've been feeling terrible these past few days.

9
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,125
So I had to apologize in person.

10
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,291
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,291
Okay.

12
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:54,833
I accept.

13
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,708
Thank you, Cheng Yu.

14
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,291
I just liked you too much.

15
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,291
But don't worry.

16
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,375
I'll never be that impulsive again.

17
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:21,625
I'm sorry, Cheng Yu.

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,708
I really like you too much.

19
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,250
From now on,

20
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,791
I'll be good to you.

21
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:14,875
Bro...

22
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,375
Still calling him at a time like this?

23
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:17,875
Huh?

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,916
He doesn't love you at all!

25
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,750
He doesn't have you in his heart at all!

26
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,500
Stop!

27
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,833
Stop!

28
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,541
Stop! Stop it!

29
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,958
You dare hit me!

30
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,333
How dare you hit me!

31
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,166
Cheng Yu!

32
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,750
Cheng Yu!

33
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,791
Cheng Yu!

34
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,416
Cheng Yu!

35
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,291
I'm calling the police right now!

36
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,833
I waited for so long.

37
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,500
It felt like a century.

38
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,708
Save me...

39
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,958
Cheng Jiang... save me...

40
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,833
Save me, Bro...

41
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,083
Save me...

42
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,208
That's how my previous life ended.

43
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,750
If time could turn back,

44
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,875
if I had a chance to start over,

45
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,041
I would never love someone so pathetically again.

46
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,375
Is this the world after death?

47
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,000
Or... have I been reborn?

48
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,791
Your brother's here. Get up.

49
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,333
Oh... okay.

50
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,583
You're up.

51
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,750
Here.

52
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,166
A Tamagotchi?

53
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,416
Yeah.

54
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,833
You got all shy now that you've grown up?

55
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,750
Long time no see.

56
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,458
Yeah, it's been a while.

57
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,041
Must be 10 years.

58
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,666
I understand now.

59
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,041
Heaven let me be reborn on this day

60
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,291
to make you pay the price.

61
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,583
You said it yourself—

62
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,333
the best way to destroy someone

63
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,458
is to make them fall in love with you,

64
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,000
then abandon them.

65
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:46,875
Not taking the grad exam?

66
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,208
Then what do you want to do?

67
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,625
Keep loafing around like a hoodlum?

68
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,375
Or be a loser like your dead father

69
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,666
for the rest of your life?

70
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,833
You tigress!

71
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,583
When are you gonna fix this awful temper?

72
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,833
You've been nasty your whole life!

73
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,166
Beat up my dad, now you're beating me!

74
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,625
If I weren't harsh, you two would've starved to death long ago!

75
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,875
If I weren't harsh, would you have the life you have now?

76
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,583
Mom,

77
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,541
where are you going?

78
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:33,916
Business trip.

79
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,416
Move.

80
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,041
Morning, Cheng Jiang!

81
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:42,375
Morning.

82
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,041
Hey, who's this?

83
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,750
Language school classmate, right?

84
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:45,458
Ah.

85
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:45,958
Yeah.

86
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,041
Ah, you guys go ahead. Bye!

87
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,041
Ah, hahaha!

88
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,625
Bye bye bye!

89
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,291
Alright, I've done my part for you.

90
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,875
Let's see how you repay me.

91
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't worry.

92
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:11,916
Wow!

93
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,041
Did you bring this from China?

94
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,875
Yeah! You know me so well!

95
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,625
Alright, I'm off!

96
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,791
Bye!

97
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,375
Hey, thanks!

98
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,708
Cheng Yu!

99
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,791
What are you hiding?

100
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,625
You found out so fast?

101
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,625
Nothing to do with me.

102
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,625
Your brother asked me to play his girlfriend.

103
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,791
So...

104
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,666
it was all fake?

105
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,708
I don't know why either.

106
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:52,958
We didn't even kiss.

107
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,166
Don't ask me.

108
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,333
Well, in that case,

109
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,541
you'll just do whatever someone tells you if they give you cigarettes?

110
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,958
Not even saying hi

111
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,333
before barging in?

112
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,791
Whoa, your bed's more comfortable!

113
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,291
What the hell are you watching?

114
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,041
Since you asked,

115
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,333
I'll tell you.

116
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,333
This is a story about two brothers.

117
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,416
The older brother fell in love with the younger brother.

118
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,250
Go go go, go read it in your own room!

119
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,000
Bro,

120
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,500
have you ever liked a guy?

121
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,750
Have you ever kissed a guy?

122
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,750
I'm your brother.

123
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,958
What kind of disrespectful nonsense is this?

124
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,416
But I've never thought of you as my brother.

125
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,333
Hey, Cheng Yu! Cheng Yu!

126
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,750
I'm your brother!

127
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,916
What are you doing?

128
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,250
Your technique

129
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,250
isn't that great.

130
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,041
I'm leaving.

131
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,333
Good night.

132
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,208
He should be here by now.
