1
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:16,625
Hey!

2
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:18,458
Yamada!

3
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,166
Cheng Yu!

4
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,500
Did you finish the manga I lent you last time?

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,708
Not yet.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,916
Not yet?

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,333
Then let me bring you a few more!

8
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,750
Look, I have lots of the same type.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,625
Hey, how about this—

10
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,208
come to my place and read them!

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,250
Come check them out at my place!

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:37,958
Nah, I'll pass.

13
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,125
Also, that one you lent me—

14
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,375
the manga about guys dating guys,

15
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,083
and the main characters are actual brothers—

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,458
it's too weird.

17
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,458
I can't accept it.

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,500
What's weird about it?

19
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,166
There are all kinds of strange love in this world.

20
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,000
Some men like women.

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,500
But some men

22
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,458
like men.

23
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,000
Whatever.

24
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,083
I'm not interested in that kind of thing.

25
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,375
Here, take it back.

26
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:02,958
Thanks.

27
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,875
Okay then, I'm going now.

28
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,750
Cheng Yu! Come set the table for dinner!

29
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,833
Okay, Bro! I'll be right there after taking out the trash!

30
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,416
Wow, Bro, it smells amazing!

31
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,250
Taste and see if it's salty enough.

32
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,000
How is it?

33
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,375
It's good!

34
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,666
This is your favorite rice cake.

35
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,708
I went to several supermarkets to find it.

36
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,041
Hurry up then!

37
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,166
I can't wait anymore!

38
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:41,500
Okay.

39
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,333
Quick, quick, quick!

40
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,708
Coming!

41
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,583
Have some shrimp.

42
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,666
You eat too, Bro.

43
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,291
Have some rice cake.

44
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,166
It's your favorite. Why aren't you eating?

45
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,583
Egg.

46
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,583
Thanks, Bro.

47
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,333
Hey, no problem.

48
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:17,916
Eat the rice cake.

49
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,833
Ah, okay.

50
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,916
Doesn't it taste good?

51
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:22,958
No, it does.

52
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,208
My classmate's asking me to work on a group project.

53
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,000
I might be back a bit late.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,458
Okay.

55
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,083
Mm.

56
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,083
Then eat some more before you go.

57
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,250
Bro, my classmate's rushing me.

58
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,416
I'll be back later.

59
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,458
See you tonight.

60
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,791
Hey, eat some more!

61
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:02,958
You're here.

62
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,083
That was pretty fast!

63
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,125
Yamada, what's going on?

64
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,458
What do you mean, what's going on?

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,208
You lied to me!

66
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,750
Didn't you say you don't like guys?

67
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,625
Yamada, you might be misunderstanding.

68
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,875
Misunderstanding?

69
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,375
I crouched under your window all afternoon.

70
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,791
I saw everything clearly.

71
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,416
What you drew was you and your brother.

72
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,500
That drawing was just something I sketched randomly.

73
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,166
Give it back to me.

74
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,708
Sketched randomly?

75
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,958
So you liking your own brother is "random" too?

76
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,333
What do you want from me?

77
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,916
It's simple.

78
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,791
Since you can like your own brother,

79
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,625
that proves you like guys.

80
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,166
Cheng Yu,

81
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,000
the first time I saw you at the manga club,

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,416
I fell for you.

83
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,625
You said liking your own brother is weird,

84
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,083
but we're not brothers.

85
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,833
Cheng Yu, be with me.

86
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,833
Let go! I don't like you!

87
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:18,916
Don't like me?

88
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:19,916
Why don't you like me?

89
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,041
Huh?

90
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,583
If you don't get together with me today,

91
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,916
tomorrow—

92
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,333
I'll let the whole world know your secret.

93
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,375
You know?

94
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,458
What secret?

95
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,125
What secret?

96
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,875
The secret that he likes you!

97
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,500
What do you want?

98
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,083
Hand over the drawing.

99
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,208
I'm only saying this once.

100
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,458
What are you gonna do?

101
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,625
Hand it over!

102
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,083
Fine.

103
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,375
Let's go.

104
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,000
Mom, you're back?

105
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,458
Where did you two go?

106
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,625
Uh, we went to exercise for a bit.

107
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,583
Ah, yeah.

108
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,791
Went to exercise.

109
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:30,916
Cheng Jiang,

110
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,750
come here for a moment.

111
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:23,958
Bro,

112
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,375
what did Mom say to you?

113
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,458
Nothing.

114
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,833
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

115
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,583
Go to sleep.

116
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,958
Hey Mom, where's Bro?

117
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,333
He's not having breakfast?

118
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,041
He left.

119
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,708
Left?

120
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,000
What do you mean?

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,458
Exactly what it sounds like.

122
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,791
He won't be coming back.

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,291
Mom,

124
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,041
did you kick him out?

125
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,500
He left on his own.

126
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,083
I gave him money.

127
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,083
From now on, he can do whatever he wants.

128
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,041
That's impossible.

129
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,500
How could he leave without saying goodbye?

130
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,666
You're lying!

131
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,083
You think he's a good person?

132
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,041
He came here to destroy this family.

133
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,500
See for yourself.

134
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,958
I should never have brought him back.

135
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,333
The best way to destroy someone

136
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,083
is to make them fall in love with you,

137
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:55,875
then abandon them.

138
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,625
How is this possible?

139
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,958
How could this be?

140
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,166
I'm going back to China tomorrow.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,916
I'll be gone for quite a while.

142
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,458
I've already transferred living expenses to your card.

143
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,166
No.

144
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,500
No!

145
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,041
I have to go find him!

146
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,166
You're not allowed to go!

147
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,833
He's my brother!

148
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,375
We're family!

149
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,375
You know he's your brother?

150
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,666
He's your own brother!

151
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,458
What did you two do?

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,958
Do you even have the face to say it?

153
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,583
Ah!

154
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,750
Hey, Cheng Yu!

155
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,708
Cheng Jiang!

156
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:40,750
Come home with me.

157
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,875
What home?

158
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,500
That's not my home.

159
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,083
I don't care. You're coming home with me today.

160
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,333
Let go!

161
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:53,958
Bro...

162
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,500
You don't want me anymore, do you?

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,291
If it weren't for you and your stepdad,

164
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,666
my family wouldn't have fallen apart.

165
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,625
My dad wouldn't have died of depression.

166
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,083
All of this—

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,625
it's all because of you!

168
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,291
Now I've got the money.

169
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,375
It's all over now!

170
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:34,750
Goodbye.

171
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,708
Bro, you're lying, aren't you?

172
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,541
This isn't real, is it?

173
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,541
Oh, and one more thing.

174
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,291
Hahaha!

175
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,500
Fantasizing about your own brother—

176
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,250
that's really perverted.
