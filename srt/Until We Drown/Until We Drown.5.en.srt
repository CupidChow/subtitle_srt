1
00:00:10,023 --> 00:00:11,691
He should be here by now.

2
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:34,922
You're here!

3
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:36,841
Thanks, Yamada.

4
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,843
I'm really not interested in this kind of thing.

5
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:39,719
Here you go.

6
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:42,513
Oh, by the way,

7
00:00:42,513 --> 00:00:44,724
my dad still needs to check my math homework.

8
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:47,727
So I won't walk you out. Bye!

9
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:08,664
This time, I won't even draw that picture.

10
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:15,755
Coco,

11
00:01:16,964 --> 00:01:18,841
I'm already at the location you sent.

12
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:21,886
It's way past our meeting time.

13
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,638
You're not answering your phone.

14
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:25,264
When are you coming?

15
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:47,370
Who are you waiting for?

16
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:50,790
Ah...

17
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,126
I'm waiting for a friend.

18
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:55,128
Why are you...

19
00:01:58,047 --> 00:01:59,173
Stop waiting.

20
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:02,260
The person you're waiting for is me.

21
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:04,929
What do you mean?

22
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:13,062
Have you

23
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,189
been here before?

24
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:21,821
Of course you haven't.

25
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:30,079
When I first came to Japan,

26
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:32,248
I got bullied a lot.

27
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:34,792
I'd come here alone to watch the sea.

28
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:38,087
Back then, I kept thinking—

29
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:42,300
where did the person who used to protect me go?

30
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,178
When would he appear?

31
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,973
Why are you telling me this?

32
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,772
Because that person is you.

33
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,324
Cheng Yu,

34
00:03:08,326 --> 00:03:09,285
I'm unlucky.

35
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:11,245
No matter how unlucky you think you are,

36
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:15,625
I'll never leave you.

37
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,211
We'll always be family.

38
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:11,264
How do you have this?

39
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,932
Someone gave it to me.

40
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:35,162
That's right.

41
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:37,873
We're family.

42
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:38,726
I'm thirsty.

43
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,979
Wine won't quench your thirst.

44
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:43,356
Get some water.

45
00:05:43,814 --> 00:05:46,275
Don't wanna go. It's too cold out there.

46
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:58,412
When did you get so big?

47
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:00,665
Big?

48
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,418
Where did I get big?

49
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:19,475
Come on, have another drink.

50
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,144
I'm not drinking anymore.

51
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:24,146
I drank too much earlier.

52
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:37,159
Hey!

53
00:06:38,577 --> 00:06:40,955
No respect for your elders, huh?

54
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:41,956
Ah?

55
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:45,584
Still going? Haha!

56
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:48,045
Haha!

57
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:08,607
Cheng Jiang,

58
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:13,946
why can't I control myself whenever I see you?

59
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,201
Me too.

60
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:55,589
I can't be without you.

61
00:08:59,343 --> 00:09:00,719
What should I do with you?

62
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,356
I finally have him completely.

63
00:09:13,315 --> 00:09:14,984
Which means

64
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:18,112
it's time to abandon him.

65
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:23,868
Then hold me tight.

66
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:00,571
Cheng Yu!

67
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:04,575
Cheng Yu!

68
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:23,552
You're the one I hate the most.

69
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:28,641
You're the one I hate the most!
