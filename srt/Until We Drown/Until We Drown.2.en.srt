1
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:10,958
Which way are you even going?

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:12,083
Huh?

3
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,666
You're the one in my way.

4
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,208
Hey, didn't you just use the bathroom?

5
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,541
You need to lock the door.

6
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,041
Didn't I teach you that when you were little?

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,708
You're the one who barged in!

8
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,000
Don't you know manners?

9
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,666
What are you doing?

10
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,416
Don't move. You'll cut yourself.

11
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,083
You can't even shave properly.

12
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:26,875
What a mess.

13
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,250
If the hair's tough, rub it a bit more.

14
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:34,541
It's best to shave in the morning.

15
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:27,916
Hey, Bro.

16
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:28,458
Mm?

17
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,291
Are you familiar with the route back and forth?

18
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,833
It's been several days. I know it inside out.

19
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,125
Who's here so early?

20
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,625
Should be my classmate. I'm off!

21
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,125
Hey—

22
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,791
You have classmates?

23
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,041
Morning, Cheng Jiang!

24
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:45,916
Morning.

25
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,625
Huh?

26
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,291
Who's this?

27
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,916
Ah, this is my brother.

28
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,958
Wow! Your brother's so handsome!

29
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,000
Um... You are?

30
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,333
Hi, I'm Coco.

31
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,708
Nice to meet you!

32
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,958
Ah, she's a classmate from our old high school back home.

33
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,333
She's also studying at the language school.

34
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,625
Alright, we're gonna be late.

35
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,666
We're heading out!

36
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,916
Bye!

37
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,208
Bye.

38
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,500
Hey!

39
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:53,666
You—

40
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,000
Get out.

41
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,500
Let me soak for a bit.

42
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,583
I don't wanna talk to you.

43
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,291
You actually came back, huh?

44
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,291
Whoa, what's with you?

45
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,416
Where's this random anger coming from?

46
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,625
I'm not angry.

47
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,333
You're even stealing Mom's wine?

48
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,583
Hahaha.

49
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,708
Mind your own business!

50
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,916
If you keep acting like this,

51
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,833
I'm squeezing in there with you!

52
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,041
This is so small.

53
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,500
There's no room for two people.

54
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,208
Go steam in the sauna for a bit.

55
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:37,500
Hey!

56
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,250
Ahh, so comfy.

57
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,041
Why do you keep getting angry over nothing?

58
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,541
Life's too short not to enjoy it!

59
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't let a golden cup

60
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,500
sit empty under the moon!

61
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,375
Hey, how much longer? Hurry up!

62
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,250
Alright, alright, just a sec!

63
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,000
Come on, have a drink with your brother.

64
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,458
Alright, stop being mad.

65
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,208
Let's have a drink.

66
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,708
I already got it for you, right?

67
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,333
Mom won't even know.

68
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,708
Come on, that's better.

69
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,916
You know, this Japanese house—

70
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,833
it's got a bathtub

71
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,083
and a sauna room.

72
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,625
This...

73
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,416
we never had it this good back in China.

74
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,166
Well, now you've moved to Japan.

75
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,125
You can soak every day, steam every day.

76
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,708
Just don't get all swollen up.

77
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,541
Pour me another.

78
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,625
No.

79
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,875
Then I'll get it myself.

80
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,750
What's going on?

81
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,916
Ahhh!

82
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,666
Ugh, this feels amazing!

83
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,041
Why's your little guy getting hard?

84
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:58,833
Huh?

85
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,375
Hahaha!

86
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,666
Shut up!

87
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,375
Did you get hard?

88
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,541
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

89
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,958
Okay, okay, I won't say it anymore.

90
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:10,833
Fine.

91
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,375
Ha!

92
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,125
I really can't hold it in!

93
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,416
Ugh.

94
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,458
Alright, fine.

95
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,791
Okay, okay.

96
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,833
I won't say it, I won't say it.

97
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,500
I won't say it, I won't say it.

98
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,916
An electronic pet

99
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,416
for 10 years.

100
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,083
That's crazy.

101
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,041
Move over.

102
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,166
Ugh.

103
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,041
Paper books are still the best.

104
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,500
Can you go read in your own room?

105
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,208
Why do you have to be here?

106
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,458
These are all in Japanese.

107
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,666
Hey, find me one I can actually read.

108
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,166
How is it?

109
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,250
I raised my little chick pretty well, right?

110
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,375
Oh yeah.

111
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,791
I forgot to tell you something when we were in the bath.

112
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,125
Stop. Can you not mention the bath thing?

113
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,708
Okay, okay, I won't mention it.

114
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,208
Coco said you're really cute.

115
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,791
She said girls must really like you.

116
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,083
Hey, she wants to introduce you to her sister.

117
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,000
She told me to ask you

118
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,250
if you have a girlfriend.

119
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,541
Have you even memorized the hiragana yet?

120
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,250
All you ever talk about is girls, girls, girls.

121
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,666
Isn't that annoying?

122
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,041
Hey.

123
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,166
What's this?

124
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,041
Give it back!

125
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,375
So you like reading this kind of manga?

126
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,916
Hahaha!

127
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,708
Why are you embarrassed?

128
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,583
Ah?

129
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,250
It's just a manga.

130
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,625
Did you learn this from the book?

131
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,166
If there's anything else you don't know,

132
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,250
just ask me directly.

133
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,208
Sleep.
