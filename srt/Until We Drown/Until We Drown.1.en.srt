1
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:13,541
What are you doing?

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:20,875
Stop!

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,000
Stop it!

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,125
Stop!

5
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,500
You dare hit me?

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,208
How dare you hit me!

7
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,125
Cheng Yu!

8
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,166
Cheng Yu!

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,791
Cheng Yu!

10
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,541
Save me... Bro...

11
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,375
Save me...

12
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,625
So you really don't care about me.

13
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,458
It was all your lies.

14
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,916
If I could have another chance,

15
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,333
I'd never let you ruin my life again.

16
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,708
Bro...

17
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,958
I hate you so much.

18
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,750
That was a month ago.

19
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,583
Cheng Jiang,

20
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,000
my half-brother,

21
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,458
came to Japan from China.

22
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,916
We hadn't seen each other in 10 years.

23
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:27,625
Cheng Yu!

24
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,416
Your brother's here. Get up.

25
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,333
Okay, I know.

26
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,666
Bro?

27
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,791
You're up.

28
00:02:59,083 --> 00:02:59,916
Catch.

29
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,958
This is...

30
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,541
A Tamagotchi.

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,875
I promised you, didn't I?

32
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,750
When you're an adult, you'd inherit my game console.

33
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,125
That was ten years ago.

34
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,083
I'm all grown up now.

35
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,250
Still a little kid who blushes, huh?

36
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,833
You're only four years older than me.

37
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,333
Mm.

38
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,041
Cheng Yu!

39
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,166
Ah, Mom!

40
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,625
From now on, Cheng Jiang will live with us.

41
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,416
You brothers haven't seen each other in so long.

42
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,625
Give him a hug.

43
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,083
Mom!

44
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,875
You used to love your brother when you were little.

45
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,750
When we immigrated, you hid under his bed

46
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,291
and refused to leave.

47
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,625
Come on, give him a hug.

48
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,166
Come here.

49
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,625
Not taking the grad exam?

50
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,000
Then what do you want to do?

51
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,375
Keep loafing around like a hoodlum?

52
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,291
Or be a loser like your dead father for the rest of your life?

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,500
You haven't contacted me in over ten years.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,666
Why call me here now?

55
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,583
Do you pity me?

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,041
Or is one son not enough to support you in old age?

57
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,166
And my dad's early death was partly your fault.

58
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,583
You have no right to talk about him!

59
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,458
You tigress!

60
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,250
When are you gonna fix this awful temper of yours?

61
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,500
You've been nasty your whole life!

62
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,166
Beat up my dad, now you're beating me!

63
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,500
If I weren't harsh,

64
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,666
you two would've starved to death long ago!

65
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:46,041
If I weren't harsh, would you have the life you have now?

66
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,333
I'm done with you two.

67
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,291
Mom, where are you going?

68
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,250
Business trip.

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,125
Move.

70
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,291
Bro, look.

71
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,416
This is the language school Mom enrolled you in.

72
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,916
It's the best one nearby.

73
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,833
After a year in the language program, you can apply for grad school.

74
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,166
Then you won't have to face Mom every day—

75
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,541
What does my business have to do with you?

76
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,666
Of course it does.

77
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,625
You're my brother.

78
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,416
We're family!

79
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,791
When were we ever family?

80
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,375
What are you laughing at?

81
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,791
You were like this when we first met too.

82
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,708
But whenever I got bullied,

83
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,625
you'd still stand in front of me to protect me.

84
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,416
Won't admit it, huh?

85
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,833
That's because you looked pitiful.

86
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,958
Like a stray dog.

87
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,000
Then I'm a big dog now!

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,208
Woof! Woof! Woof woof!

89
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,791
Alright, alright.

90
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,041
Ugh.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,416
I really can't deal with you.

92
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,083
Hold this for me.

93
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,958
Do the Japanese gods

94
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,166
have time to look after foreigners?

95
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,208
Don't say that!

96
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,625
As long as you're sincere enough,

97
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,416
the gods will help.

98
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,708
Hey.

99
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,833
This is...

100
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,583
For me?

101
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,458
Yeah.

102
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,416
To bless you

103
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,291
with everything you wish for.

104
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,916
Look at your beard—

105
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,208
here, here...

106
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,000
You can't even shave properly.

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,833
How old are you?

108
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,125
Ha! Mind your own business.

109
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,416
Give me back my popsicle!

110
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,083
Bro,

111
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,750
when you got in that fight as a kid,

112
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,583
do you remember what you said?

113
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,666
I don't remember.

114
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,500
You said,

115
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,125
"He's my weakness.

116
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,000
No one can touch him."

117
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,041
This tastes awful.

118
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:28,875
Here.

119
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,541
Didn't you say you weren't eating it?
