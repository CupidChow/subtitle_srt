1
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,166
God, I feel so miserable.

2
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,250
Why?

3
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,541
I should be happy.

4
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,541
But why?

5
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,500
Why does it hurt so much?

6
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,250
Cheng Jiang!

7
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,416
Cheng Jiang!

8
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,375
Cheng Yu!

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,833
Cheng Jiang!

10
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,000
Go away!

11
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,666
Cheng Yu, go away!

12
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,583
Cheng Yu, what's wrong?

13
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,500
Let's talk about this!

14
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,750
There's nothing to talk about.

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,416
If you come any closer,

16
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,041
I'll jump from here!

17
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,250
It hurts, doesn't it?

18
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,291
You're in pain, aren't you?

19
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,791
This is what you should feel!

20
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,166
Cheng Yu, it's my fault.

21
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,666
Calm down, calm down!

22
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,375
Whatever I did wrong, I can change!

23
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,291
I'm very calm.

24
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,000
Get lost!

25
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,125
Don't ever let me see you again!

26
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,416
Okay, okay.

27
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,333
I'll go back.

28
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,666
I'll go back and wait for you!

29
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:07,416
And one more thing—

30
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,500
from today on,

31
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,416
you move out of my house.

32
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,291
That's my home.

33
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,333
Not your home!

34
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,791
Then where do I go?

35
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,458
I don't care where you go.

36
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,750
But from today on,

37
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,541
if I see you again,

38
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,583
either you die or I die!

39
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,458
Cheng Yu...

40
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,166
Get lost!

41
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,208
Get lost!

42
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,750
I was afraid of killing him,

43
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,166
so I reduced the dose quite a bit.

44
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,500
Cheng Yu!

45
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,583
Cheng Yu! Cheng Yu!

46
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,500
Are you okay?

47
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,250
Are you okay?

48
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,375
This can't be.

49
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,666
This is from my past life.

50
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,541
Ah!

51
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,208
Ah!

52
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,916
Cheng Yu! Cheng Yu!

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,416
Wait for me! Wait!

54
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:26,875
Cheng Yu!

55
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,041
Cheng Yu!

56
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,250
How are you? Don't scare me!

57
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,958
Wake up!

58
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,041
Wake up!

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,625
Bro, I'm fine.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,208
You're okay.

61
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,916
You're okay.

62
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,541
It's okay. It's okay.

63
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:48,875
Bro,

64
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,250
I don't hate you.

65
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,666
It was my fault.

66
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,750
I know.

67
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,000
I know now.

68
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,625
It's okay now.

69
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,166
It's okay.

70
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:09,750
Bro,

71
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,291
why is this drawing here?

72
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,041
Is there something you're not telling me?

73
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,041
Yes.

74
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,166
At first, I wanted revenge on you.

75
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,708
But when I saw you,

76
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,250
my world didn't seem so dark anymore.

77
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,666
I thought if I just hung up your call and didn't save you,

78
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,791
I could complete my revenge with a clear conscience.

79
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,333
But...

80
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,250
I regretted it so much.

81
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,250
I hated myself.

82
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,958
So much.

83
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,416
If time could turn back,

84
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,541
I'd never let you get hurt again.

85
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,416
If someone has to die,

86
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,458
then let me die.

87
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,958
It seems heaven really heard me.

88
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,250
It gave me a chance.

89
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,916
So this rebirth was the result of your prayer?

90
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,625
You also traveled through time?

91
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,000
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

92
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,166
If I can't have something,

93
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,750
no one else can either.

94
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,041
Bro!

95
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,541
Bro! Bro!

96
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,166
Bro!

97
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,333
Bro!

98
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,125
Bro!

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,791
Bro!

100
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:17,916
Bro!

101
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,166
Wait, I'll call an ambulance!

102
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,958
Listen to me.

103
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,083
Listen to me.

104
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,250
I made a deal with God.

105
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,500
If one of us has to die,

106
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,208
it'll be me.

107
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:48,208
Bro, what deal? I want you alive!

108
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,250
Bro!

109
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,250
God,

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,916
I fell in love with the person I shouldn't have.

111
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,791
Let our fates be exchanged.

112
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,625
I'm willing to die in his place.
