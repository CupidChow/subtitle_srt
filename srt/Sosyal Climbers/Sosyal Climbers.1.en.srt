1
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,412
My condolences, sir.

2
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,937
It's never easy to say goodbye to someone.

3
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,359
It's even harder when it's a parent.

4
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,532
That's kind of you. Excuse me.

5
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,661
Hey, wait.

6
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:28,713
Uh… He was always such a thoughtful man,
Mr Chavez. I was truly devastated when I

7
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,758
heard what happened.
But, you should know…

8
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,675
Yeah?

9
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,221
Before your father passed away,

10
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:40,391
he was going to buy your mom this
property for their 40th wedding

11
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,727
- anniversary.
- Uh, hang on a second, Mr.

12
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,854
- Huh?
- Chavez isn't my father.

13
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,817
I'm his financial advisor, but
um, he was always so kind to me.

14
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,151
He was like a father.

15
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,119
There! Those are his children.

16
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,210
Were you actually sorry or were
you just trying to sell me a house?

17
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,879
- Excuse me, I'm grieving too.
- I just thought that since

18
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,966
his kids were gonna be here,
it was a good opportunity

19
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,217
to speak face to face.

20
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,012
How do I look?

21
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,477
You look great. Um… Just smile.

22
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,158
Who told you that? No way,
it's not gonna happen. Yes?

23
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,827
- Good evening. Hello.
- I'm Jessa Baluarte.

24
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,704
I'm a licenced real estate agent.

25
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:49,252
I just want to offer my deepest
condolences to you guys. Anyway, before

26
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,548
your father passed, there
was a property that he was…

27
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:57,510
- Thank you.
- Seriously? At our father's wake?

28
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,346
Can't you see our family's still grieving?

29
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,142
- No, no. I mean, I mean no disrespect.
- Don't you have an ounce of decency?

30
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,686
Oh, God

31
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,106
Ahh…

32
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,985
Hi, I'm Ray Cruz, your
dad's financial advisor.

33
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,780
Actually, your father was
planning on buying this house.

34
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,783
He thought it would
bring you back together.

35
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,952
We're not a broken family.

36
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,457
Uh, oh, in a sense. Yes, that's true.

37
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,629
Although he did often tell me
that as each of you grew older,

38
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,964
you stopped coming to visit.

39
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,885
He wondered if your childhood
home was too small,

40
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,053
too ugly…

41
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:49,270
He was hoping that a new property that's
bigger and more elegant might encourage

42
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,775
you to visit more often.

43
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,112
Dad!

44
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,364
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

45
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,001
You know that's the biggest property I've
ever sold. Thank you for the endorsement.

46
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,379
No problem. People like us need to

47
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,797
look out for each other.

48
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,590
People like us?

49
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:23,429
Yeah. You know,
those of us in the aspirational class.

50
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,599
Trying to climb the social ladder,

51
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,686
to reach the level of the
elites that we work for.

52
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,188
We're the struggling middle class.

53
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,151
What makes you think I'm part
of the struggling middle class?

54
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,320
You were at a funeral to sell property.

55
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,198
You saw an opportunity to make money,

56
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,616
and you took it.

57
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,994
You're saying I'm a social climber?

58
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,498
I'm saying that you're determined,

59
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,042
and I respect you for it.

60
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,420
I mean it.

61
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,383
What?

62
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,011
That's bull.

63
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,888
- It's not bull!
- It's bull!

64
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,017
You're only saying that
because you wanna sell me insurance.

65
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,269
I'm not trying to sell you anything.

66
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,730
So you're only here cause I
offered to buy you a meal?

67
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,480
No.

68
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,607
- So, what do you want?
- I want you.

69
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,404
What was that?

70
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,657
I want you.

71
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,413
You available?

72
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,385
What is it?

73
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,057
Hey, hey. Are we really doing this?
Are we really doing this? Right here.

74
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,100
- What?
- Yeah? Here's good. Mm… Mhm, it's

75
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,145
- fine. Don't you like the view up here?
- Right here? Are you

76
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,563
sure it's not too cramped?

77
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,024
I do.

78
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:02,820
Whoa.

79
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,991
I think I saw God.

80
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,162
Thanks for picking me up and
for taking me back home.

81
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,998
Can we go to a drive through?

82
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,125
- I am getting really…
- Oh, you're hungry?

83
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:23,841
Oh, what? Oh, what? What's that?
Huh? No way! What's that? Huh? No way!

84
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,093
Here. Ahhh…!!

85
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,888
- Hmm?
- We cuddled.

86
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,847
We cuddled!

87
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,766
- We were cuddling?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,727
Wasn't that against the rules?

89
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,729
It's fine, it's just cuddling.

90
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,193
Hey, hey, what's wrong?
Hey… Um, you wanna talk about it?

91
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:47,198
I worked so hard for that client and they
bought from another agent instead.

92
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,832
- Ra!
- Oh, Jessa!! That's it. I'm not watching.

93
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,210
- You're gonna be the first one to strip.
- What? No,

94
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,170
- you will be.
- You were so scared!

95
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,755
It wasn't funny.

96
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,340
Loser!

97
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,552
I worked so hard and it
was all for nothing.

98
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,054
Hey.

99
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,563
Safety first!

100
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,040
Nothing.

101
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,837
It's nothing. I'm not, I'm not. It isn't
finished yet. No, it isn't ready. It's not

102
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,214
- finished. No, it isn't finished.
- What are you doing? Show me! You better

103
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,341
not be making fun of me. Let me see? Give
it to me! Let me see.

104
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,260
- What is it? What is it?
- I'll show you when it's ready, ok.

105
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,553
- Come on! Give it here!
- It isn't done.

106
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,430
- Give it here!
- Not yet, I'm still working on it.

107
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,599
Come on,
you have to show me. Give it here!

108
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,475
It isn't finished!

109
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,230
I just started drawing again.

110
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,152
- It's amazing! It really is.
- Really?

111
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,321
Because you're amazing.

112
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,949
I mean it. Seriously, you're really good.

113
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,830
Why doesn't your work have
anything to do with art?

114
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,625
I can't afford to be an artist.

115
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:25,546
There's no money in art.
I'll get back into it properly

116
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,925
one day when I'm wealthy. Until then…

117
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,427
I'm chasing a different dream.

118
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,431
What do you dream about?

119
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,683
You wanna know what my dream is?

120
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:42,063
- Mm. Brace myself? OK!
- Brace yourself. Give me a minute.

121
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,150
I want to be wealthy. I mean,

122
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,029
so wealthy that I could
buy whatever the hell

123
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,366
I want. A mansion with a pristine view.

124
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,243
It'll have 3 floors,

125
00:08:55,326 --> 00:09:00,873
the most contemporary architecture,
except on the facade. Victorian detailing.

126
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,209
A portico entrance with Greek columns.

127
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,920
Hardwood double doors
and when you open them,

128
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,507
a grand staircase with
a crystal chandelier.

129
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,009
I want a pool with mosaic tiles!

130
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,598
And I'll sleep in a four poster bed with
velvet upholstery and silk curtains.

131
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,308
That's it.

132
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,102
Kinda like this?

133
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,520
Hm?

134
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,656
Ok. Now, this is my dream too.
I want a house just like that.

135
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,699
Did you just…?

136
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,868
Stop stealing my dream.

137
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,869
I'm not.

138
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,539
You know Jessa,

139
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,084
I grew up in an orphanage.

140
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:50,756
So I mean it when I say that I've always
dreamt of having my own home,

141
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,134
with someone I love.

142
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,886
Someone who loves me.

143
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,515
I'll do anything to make
your dream come true.

144
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,560
Because,

145
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,645
now you're my dream.

146
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,398
Jessa,

147
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,485
will you be my girlfriend?

148
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,540
- Loving me isn't easy.
- Are you sure about this?

149
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,916
Of course I am.

150
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,214
There's so much that I still want to do.

151
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,093
I'm dramatic. I'm moody.
You sure you can deal with that?

152
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:41,766
Whatever it takes to be with you.
You'll always be worth it.

153
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,895
Do you want to be with me?

154
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,398
Well?

155
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,694
Huh?

156
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,449
- OK!
- Ok?

157
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,159
Yes!

158
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,954
Yes! Thank you! I love you.

159
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,085
- I love you.
- Who was that for?

160
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,086
For you!

161
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:15,341
I promise that I will make
our dream come true.

162
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,052
- Promise? Promise?
- Promise.

163
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:18,969
I promise.

164
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,806
Don't cry.

165
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,058
- I'm not crying!
- You really are dramatic.

166
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,788
Shoot! Hon, how do I look?

167
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,582
You look great, but your
clothes are all wrinkled.

168
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,333
Ugh…

169
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,422
Madam Adele suddenly moved the viewing
from next week to this week!

170
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,465
I haven't properly cleaned the property.

171
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,759
OK, that's the best I can do.

172
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,845
- Just show them your pretty smile.
- A pretty smile isn't going to work.

173
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,930
All right, all right.

174
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:09,937
Relax, relax. Inhale, inhale. Exhale.
OK, one more. Inhale… Exhale.

175
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,816
You're skilled,

176
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,652
you're smart and you're so pretty.

177
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,404
You've got this.

178
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,699
Thank you, hon. I gotta go.
What?

179
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,160
Hon. You forgot something.

180
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:24,785
What?

181
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,580
What is it?

182
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,750
I gotta go.
What's that?

183
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,293
Two years today.

184
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,085
Happy anniversary!!

185
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,546
It's today.

186
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,466
- I'm sorry. I can't believe I forgot.
- It's ok!

187
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,217
I love you.

188
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,095
Any special requests
for our feast tonight?

189
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,848
- Ice cream!
- Double Dutch? Bye bye.

190
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,141
- Yes!
- Bye, I love you. I love

191
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,644
- you. Take care. See you later.
- I love you. Take care, have a good day.

192
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,401
This house was designed by
a renowned Polish architect.

193
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,360
As you can see,

194
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,737
it's very modern in design.

195
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,532
The open floor layout is what
gives it its unique atmosphere.

196
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,410
Right behind you is the dining area.

197
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,747
Miss, miss. Uh, please slow down.
My wife would like to take it in.

198
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,414
Yes?

199
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,832
Oh, sorry.

200
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,128
Oh, look at the ceiling fan, it's hideous.

201
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,880
Um, ma'am?

202
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:23,969
That's a feature of the room. It's modern
architecture, it's the fashion right now.

203
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,555
- It's big in Europe. Yes.
- Really?

204
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,185
- Scary.
- What the hell?

205
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,858
Now this is your master bedroom.

206
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,193
Beautiful, isn't it?

207
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,697
The bright walls and earthy tones really
complement the wooden furniture.

208
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,951
And from here,
you can gaze at the expansive backyard,

209
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,577
starting with this koi pond.

210
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,997
And behold your personal oasis, you know,

211
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,918
just picture yourself out
here during the weekends.

212
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,170
You might have kids swimming over here.

213
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,508
And the adults are here seated on
chair beds, sipping on cold drinks.

214
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,884
Just divine.

215
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,264
It looked nice in the photos,
but in person it's shoddy.

216
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,223
- Hm.
- Um, I understand.

217
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,724
I really do apologise,

218
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,684
sir, ma'am.

219
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,978
Just so you know,
I only took over this property recently.

220
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,688
I'm so sorry.

221
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,527
Well, the potential is there.
What I'm having a hard time

222
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,612
figuring out is, the vibe.

223
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,865
I feel like it just needs a little clean.

224
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,909
Please. Just give this
house a chance. Great.

225
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,453
- Fine.
- Let's schedule another viewing.

226
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,329
This time,

227
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,122
for my sister.

228
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,542
Her name is Regine.

229
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,169
Now, if she approves, we'll take it.
But if she doesn't…

230
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,214
- I'm sorry.
- Great. OK.

231
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:48,304
- Bro. Sorry I'm late. Traffic, huh.
- So… how's things?

232
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,350
Ray, I'm gonna have to fire
you as my financial advisor.

233
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,311
Why?

234
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,188
What happened to my investment
in ProsperFast?

235
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,902
Bro, just give your investment some time.

236
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,447
Our investment Even Jessa
and I have invested.

237
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,911
Then we're all screwed, bro.
Tell me about the CEO of ProsperFast?

238
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,287
Hansel?

239
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,456
He's reliable, I've known him for ages.

240
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,124
Really?

241
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,887
There is absolutely no
way that he did this.

242
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,348
Why would he scam us? The guy's rich.

243
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:38,145
The guy's rich coz he's a scammer! What?
You you think the rich don't scam people?

244
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,064
Are you really that naive?

245
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,099
Hi hon. Happy
anniversary! How are you going?

246
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,352
- Hi!
- Happy anniversary. I'm all right. Wait,

247
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:22,773
- not now. I feel gross. The commute took
- forever. The pollution

248
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,109
- is so bad in Manila.
- Mm mmm.

249
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,695
And it was so cramped.

250
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,365
How did the viewing go?

251
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,491
It's a no…

252
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,201
for now.

253
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,080
But I convinced Madame Adele
to give me a second chance.

254
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,750
That's great! I think
you've earned yourself a reward!

255
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,459
Oh!

256
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,294
I completely forgot!

257
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,841
It's melted.

258
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,636
Didn't I tell you the fridge
needs to be repaired?

259
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,809
We don't have a working freezer. Come on,
honey. How many times have I told you?

260
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,105
Hon, just leave it. I'll take care of it,
it's probably a broken part.

261
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,899
Whatever.

262
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,741
I'm sorry, hon.

263
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:19,204
Sorry? Don't be
sorry, it's just ice cream.

264
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,333
Unless there's some other
reason that you're sorry?

265
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,421
- Course not.
- I'm sorry that this is our life.

266
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,721
Hm?

267
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,808
But we're happy, aren't we?
Happy two years! I love you.

268
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,352
Very happy. Happy two years. I love you.

269
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,981
Hey! Hey, you! Hey. Get
out here. Come on. Hey! Hey.

270
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,192
- Hey! Hey, Ray!
- Hey, you two get your

271
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,569
- asses out here right now.
- What kind of scam have

272
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,695
you got us into, huh?

273
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,158
This is why it's been nothing for
months. Now we know how Hansel got rich.

274
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,785
This is unbelievable!

275
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,955
Yeah! Everything I have… I put
everything I have into ProsperFast, Ok?

276
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,000
What is this? A sick joke?
Huh? 10 years of savings!

277
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,461
- Is that right? Oh, wow.
- Listen to me. Please.

278
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,546
I'm going to get everyone's money back,
just be patient.

279
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,632
- Oh… Ok, yeah.
- Sure you are. Yeah.

280
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,966
Yeah. Like I believe you.

281
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,639
Hey, you should probably know, a lot
of us borrowed money from Boss Gil.

282
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,642
- Yeah, boss Hill. What you gonna tell him?
- Woah… you hear that?

283
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,645
He only invested cause you
promised him a jackpot too.

284
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:29,108
I just need to find Hansel and then
I can get everyone's money back.

285
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,442
Like that's gonna happen.

286
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,570
The police can't find him. Think you can?

287
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,448
And when Boss Gil finds
out about ProsperFast,

288
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,283
both of you are screwed!

289
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,494
You heard the man.

290
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,413
Didn't you vet Hansel?

291
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,751
Hon, you're the one who told
me to recruit the neighbours.

292
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:53,465
Can we not blame each other?
We have 2.6 million to pay back.

293
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,011
This is worth 20,
000. You're really going to sell them?

294
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,598
I think I can get around 50,000.

295
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,187
I've got an idea.

296
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,651
I'll make 3 million commission
on this place,

297
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,570
more than enough to fix our problems.

298
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,446
But hon, that's your money.

299
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,159
I don't feel right about using
it to pay back the residents.

300
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,286
You got a better idea?

301
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,418
Go and get a mop and a vacuum.
We're cleaning up.

302
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,396
Are you all right?

303
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,814
Fine

304
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,741
- Hon? Hon, hon!
- Please be careful, that's expensive.

305
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:04,244
- Yeah.
- My bad. You're pretty when you're mad.

306
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,079
I love you so much.

307
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,497
Cheeky.

308
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,250
Why do you need that much money?

309
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,044
Ray got scammed, Dad.

310
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:17,257
I need to borrow money so we can pay back
the downline investors what they're owed.

311
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,177
Scammed!? Have you learned nothing Jessa?

312
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,891
I thought I told you that this was a bad
investment, huh? Stop listening to Ray!

313
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:30,646
Leave him. Come live with me on the farm.

314
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:35,400
I'm not going to do what mom did when you
got scammed. That's not who I am, Dad.

315
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,570
I love Ray. I'm not going to leave him.

316
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,371
Good afternoon,
Madam Adele. How are you? Uh,

317
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:52,918
I'm just following up to see when your
sister wants to view 12 Cassiopeia?

318
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,713
Oh, she's on sabbatical!

319
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,802
Well, update me if anything changes,
ok? Thanks, bye. God bless.

320
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,559
Hon, how about a break?

321
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,283
To us! My love!

322
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,911
Ray!
Where did you get this wine from?

323
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,996
Huh?

324
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,375
- That was so good.
- I know, right?

325
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,293
So good.

326
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,213
I think that one might have been my
favourite. You should see yourself,

327
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,298
you're wasted!

328
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,301
You know, hon, you deserve this.

329
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,470
- I know, yeah. Oh?
- We do! Ooh, this could be our

330
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,180
early celebration for the sale.

331
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,099
Soon this place will sell.

332
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,185
I'm sure of it. Look how nice this
place is. Oh! Should I get more wine?

333
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,229
I know, right? But you know what though?

334
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,314
That stupid mask,

335
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,898
I keep forgetting about it!

336
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,525
You're seriously drunk.

337
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,402
- You're so wasted.
- No, I'm not. Are you

338
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,404
- seriously calling me drunk?
- Yeah.

339
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,363
You're drunk.

340
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,241
I'm not! I'm not drunk, ok? I'm
not. Are you calling me a drunk?

341
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,701
I know a drunk when I see one.

342
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,702
I'm a drunk?

343
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,245
You should see yourself!

344
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,539
You look like you just crawled out of bed.

345
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,458
You are so full of crap.

346
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,835
What is your wish, my princess?

347
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,672
Anything you want shall be yours.

348
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,720
You're something else,

349
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,056
I mean it.

350
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:35,979
Haven't you said before you'd do anything
to make my dream come true? What happened?

351
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,607
What happened? Where is it?

352
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,237
You were cute back then though,

353
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,238
such a cute boy.

354
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,990
I just got so hooked on you,

355
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,950
like you just reeled me in.

356
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,913
I thought by now we'd be living
somewhere like this!

357
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,123
But no, where are we?

358
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,460
In that rundown sweaty sunshine condo!

359
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,797
Do you have any idea what
it's like when we have sex?

360
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,217
That place is disgusting,
everything's so sticky.

361
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,177
That's not the life I want.

362
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,394
But I just can't leave.

363
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:23,151
Ugh, I said it.
I can't leave. Because you just get me.

364
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,780
You excite me.
You know everything about me.

365
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,825
You make me happy despite the way you are.

366
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,042
Do you regret choosing to be with me?

367
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,046
No.
Maybe.

368
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,054
Hey, come on, what are you doing?

369
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,472
Ray?
Ray.

370
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,184
Can't we just calm down a bit?

371
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:57,727
Ray.

372
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,560
Hah! Ooh la la!!

373
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,604
Here we go!! You're coming with me!

374
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,485
Oh, Ray.

375
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,034
- Mommy! Help!!
- Mommy can't help you. I've got you.

376
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,203
- Gosh! Who are they? What are they doing?
- Oh my God! Who is

377
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,913
- that? What are they doing?
- No, stop! No. Stop.

378
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,080
Did Mrs. Segovia finally sell the place?

379
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,248
- Come here! Come here!
- Oh! They must be our new neighbors!

380
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,167
Oh, they must be our new neighbours.

381
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,483
Good… Good morning.

382
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,818
Actually… afternoon!

383
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:30,987
Oh!

384
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:37,577
I'm Madeleine Montecillo and I'd like you
to meet my husband, Chief Superintendent

385
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,704
- Fidel Montecillo!
- Retired!

386
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,916
Actually, we live next door.

387
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:49,589
So you and your husband are the
new homeowners of 12 Cassiopeia?

388
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,758
- Yeah!
- My… my husband?

389
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:55,387
Uh, it's just me here at the moment.

390
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:02,435
We saw you both last night in the pool!
Huh?! May I just say that's an interesting

391
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:09,150
- way to, uh, bless a house!
- Puppy, stop it!

392
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,946
Well, welcome to Vineyard Hills!

393
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:20,495
A little something from us.
This is a chocolate Belgian truffle,

394
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,998
homemade by me and my daughter,

395
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,833
Carlotta.
Enjoy!

396
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:32,882
- Mm… thank you.
- Oh! Oops.Ooh, I am so sorry.

397
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,428
Ooh! Wow, it's really heavy.

398
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,228
Ok, thank you.

399
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,063
Uh, wait!

400
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,191
Oh!

401
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,945
This used to be a splendid
mansion when Mrs.

402
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,864
Segovia used to live here.

403
00:26:55,947 --> 00:27:00,535
But, you know,
when she decided to migrate to Europe,

404
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,494
it, um…

405
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,456
- Lost its charm.
- Actually we're not the…

406
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,459
Honey, they're still decorating it.
They'll have it renovated.

407
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:11,129
They just moved in.
You must be the man of the house!

408
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,340
Hi neighbour!

409
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,055
Good morning.

410
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,809
- Actually, afternoon.
- Actually, afternoon! You see, we're on

411
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,646
the same wavelength! We should be friends.

412
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,733
Honey, honey!
Why don't we invite them to the

413
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,526
event later, at the Country Club.

414
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,446
The costume party! You should come!

415
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,828
Who are these people?

416
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:48,958
Um, I'm not sure if we can,
um, because… Close your robe. Um…

417
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,210
We don't have any costumes and
it's kind of short notice.

418
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,461
Uh, no need!

419
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:56,466
It doesn't matter if you
don't have any costume.

420
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,762
I want you to get to know
the other homeowners.

421
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:06,017
It's just you won't be eligible
to win the cash prize.

422
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:11,439
- There's a cash prize?
- The household with the best

423
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,442
costume will win 100,000 pesos.

424
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,779
100000.0

425
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,052
- Who is that?
- I thought this party was

426
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,556
- exclusive to homeowners.
- Hon! Hon! I managed to get hold of these

427
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,976
- costumes that one of my clients had made
- for a pageant. Come on,

428
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,186
- let's go get dressed.
- Hon, did you see their costumes?

429
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,439
I don't know if I can go
through with this, hon.

430
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,733
I don't think I can go
out there and fake it.

431
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,360
It's 100,000 pesos.

432
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,821
Oh… Look at them.

433
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:04,576
We're going to be scamming homeowners!
Homeowners!

434
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,785
No, it isn't…

435
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:12,792
This is different and it's not like they
need the money. We need that money. Hon,

436
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,796
please. Let's just try. Please?

437
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,506
I don't think I can.

438
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,885
I know you can.
We're in this together. OK?

439
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,428
OK. OK!

440
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,847
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

441
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:33,396
Welcome to the 5th Vineyard Hills
Homeowners Dress-up Gala. Organised by the

442
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:40,862
Vineyard Hills Homeowners Association.
Tonight is special because our theme is…

443
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,363
Yeah!

444
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,658
Save Mother Earth!

445
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:53,374
Mr. Theo and Mrs. Danica Divinagracia.

446
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,462
The Tanjuatco Family, headed by Mr.

447
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:03,968
- Gerry and Mrs. Ivy Tanjuatco!
- The newlyweds, Mr. Blue Jimenez and Mrs.

448
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:09,432
Carlotta Montecillo Jimenez. Last but not
least, Mr Kiefer and

449
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,894
- Mrs. Penelope Regalado.
- Mr Kiefer…

450
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,522
Hon, why aren't we on the list?

451
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,399
Those are our names.
I'm Penelope, your Kiefer!

452
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,609
Kiefer?!

453
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,180
Who are they?

454
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,473
What are they wearing?

455
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,059
Are those spoons?

456
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,570
Hey, hey, hey,
Penelope, I'd like you to meet my ladies.

457
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:08,867
They are Ruby,
Genevieve, Elise and Lavinia!

458
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,996
They were among the first
homeowners here at Vineyard Hills.

459
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,163
Oh! Ok, Ok. Hmm.

460
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:20,670
Yes, actually way back in 2012 we
bought. Back then it was basically just me

461
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,880
- and Elise here.
- Mm

462
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:28,761
- Wow, nice to meet you!
- Oh wow! Nice to meet you all.

463
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,265
What? Oh!

464
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,725
Hello,

465
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,353
I'm… I'm Mr Wendell Tecson.

466
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:44,193
I'm the president of the Vineyard Hills
Homeowners Association and I would like

467
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,655
to personally, cordially, Hi.

468
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,910
Formally welcome you to our
humble village. Right, girls?

469
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,411
Yes. Yes.

470
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:58,416
Welcome.
By the way, who made your costumes?

471
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,502
They're so out of the box.

472
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,256
- I made the costumes myself.
- Wow, they're very unique.

473
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,676
- Interesting.
- Interesting.

474
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,054
I wish you well tonight.

475
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,890
Good luck and enjoy the night.

476
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,308
Cheers!

477
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:16,935
Cheers!

478
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:22,482
All right, all right! Announcing our top
two finalists. Mr. Blue Jimenez and Mrs.

479
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,735
- Carlotta Montecillo Jimenez.
- Oh! Thank you! Hi! Hi.

480
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,570
Go, babe!

481
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:29,864
Wow!

482
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,326
- Oh!
- Oh!! Penolope!

483
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,332
Wonderful. Simply wonderful.
Bravo, bravo! Bravo, bravo everyone.

484
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,542
Amazing! Well done.
Great costume! Amazing.

485
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:50,593
All right. Blue and Carlotta,
what can you tell us about your costumes?

486
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:59,477
Flowers. Who doesn't like flowers, right?
They're pretty, colourful, fragrant even.

487
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,188
Right, babe?

488
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,193
I just can't imagine a
world without flowers.

489
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:13,366
I think if we want to save our planet,
we should plant more flowers. Thank you.

490
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:20,206
Thank you so much! Thank you so much! And,
how about Mr Kiefer and Mrs. Penelope?

491
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:41,769
A pleasant evening to our fellow
Vineyard Hills homeowners.

492
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:47,150
My husband and I are thrilled to be
part of this vibrant and socially

493
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,192
conscious community.

494
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,530
When we found out the theme of the
event was 'Save Mother Earth',

495
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,616
we thought this would be
a fitting costume concept.

496
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,661
Art made of recyclables!

497
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,790
- Bravo! Well done!
- Oh, isn't that just darling!

498
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:11,924
We aim to show that one person's garbage
can be another person's masterpiece.

499
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,720
That if we become aware
of the carbon footprints

500
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,889
left by our daily activities,

501
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:23,019
we would think twice about disposing
of single-use plastics.

502
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,937
Recycling is King!

503
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,485
Well done. Bravo.
Wonderful. Excellent. Yes.

504
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,904
Brilliant Bravo! Bravo! Well done.

505
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,406
- Oh!
- What?!

506
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,080
What?!

507
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,877
Woohoo, yeah! Excellent! Bravo!

508
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,881
- Bravo!
- Just wonderful. Alright.

509
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:58,679
Thanks so much, that's very kind of
you. You see, I told you we'd win!!

510
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,265
Hey, these costumes
turned out to be perfect!

511
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,520
They're only the perfect costumes
because of that speech that you made. You

512
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,522
- heard me!
- What was that? I didn't

513
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,815
hear you. Say it again.

514
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,654
- Damn it. Whose name's on the cheque?
- What's wrong?

515
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,739
Look. Yours.

516
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,077
But if my real name's on the cheque,
won't they find out?

517
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,247
Don't worry,
I told them our financial advisor is Mr.

518
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,793
Raymond Cruz who has special power of
attorney and is authorised to manage

519
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,585
our accounts.

520
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,213
You are a genius.

521
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,216
Hang on.
Who are we going to pay back first?

522
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,927
Right. Who first?

523
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,515
Boss Gil, we're here to pay up.

524
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,979
How much you got?

525
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,106
100000.0

526
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,900
Shit!
God damn it!

527
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:04,871
You borrowed half a million from
me and you only brought 100,000?

528
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:10,334
Boss Gil, that's just the first payment.
We're still getting the rest together.

529
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,837
How long?

530
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,424
Answer!

531
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,218
Can you give us 3 months?
We'll pay you back in 3 months.

532
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,136
Angry muttering.

533
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,597
- Where's our money? Give us our money!
- Yeah, we want our money back!

534
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,140
- There they are. I can see them.
- Yeah, where is it?

535
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,893
Hey, we're not going anywhere. We'll
pay all of you back as soon as we can.

536
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,103
- Oh my god. Can you believe this?!
- Oh! Pay us back, huh?

537
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,438
Oh, what the hell?
You're so full of shit.

538
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,981
We all got scammed here.
Please try to understand…

539
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,107
- Huh?
- That's enough.

540
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:48,623
I'm giving you 2 months to pay all of
the money back and not just my money.

541
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,750
- Everyone's money.
- Mm, mm, mmmm.

542
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,460
Hm, that's right. Hm.

543
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:56,672
And if you don't, I'm going to
throw both of you off of this building.

544
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:01,469
Ouch! Boss Gil! Boss Gil, Boss Gil Boss
Gil Boss Gil, Boss Gil, Boss Gil, Boss

545
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,389
Gil, Boss Gil, Boss Gil,
Boss Gil, Boss Gil, Boss Gil.

546
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:09,227
Yeah. Boss Hill Boss Hill Boss
Hill. Boss Hill Boss Hill Boss hill.

547
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,857
So, Madame Adele said it would be a
month before her sister comes back.

548
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,735
In the meantime,
we keep being Penelope and Kiefer.

549
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,864
Hon, are we really going
to go through with this?

550
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,828
Here's the plan.
We'll have a housewarming party.

551
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:32,166
Invite everyone in Vineyard Hills.
We can sell all the gifts they bring.

552
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,044
There must be another other way.

553
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,630
We need 2.5 million in two months.

554
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,840
We have no choice but
to keep the charade up.

555
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:44,679
What if I find some new
clients and start working on…

556
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,346
Ray,

557
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:46,806
we need to be practical.

558
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,226
Do you really think anyone will
trust you after the scam?

559
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,103
But won't they find out?

560
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,315
That's why, if we're going to do this,

561
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,485
we have to do it right.
These are our biographies,

562
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,279
educational attainments,

563
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,699
list of accomplishments, skills.
This is our history as a couple.

564
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,451
When we met,
when we got engaged, when we got married,

565
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,578
and where we went on our honeymoon.

566
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,872
They'll believe it as long
as we're confident.

567
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,919
What if they don't bring any gifts?
Then this will all be for nothing.

568
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,089
You're so negative,
of course they'll bring gifts.

569
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:20,965
Hi, you made it!

570
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,177
Of course! We are your friendly
neighbours and I brought a little

571
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:30,016
- something for your house warming! Mmmm!
- Oh! My gosh, you really didn't have to.

572
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,351
What if what they bring isn't enough?

573
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,312
Then we'll just dance for them.

574
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,857
- One, and two. One, and two. Throw it!
- Yeah!!

575
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,192
I just throw it?
Wait, so then everyone will

576
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,403
just start throwing money?

577
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,195
Yeah.

578
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,324
That's how they do it
back in my dad's province.

579
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:49,410
Wait, wait. If Kiefer and Penelope are
married, don't they need wedding rings?

580
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,703
Oh shit, you're right.

581
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,372
Here, this one looks bougie.

582
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,248
- How much?
- Ok.

583
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,585
- 100 each.
- 100?! You have to work on your

584
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,796
dancing. One, and two. One, and two. Hon!
Hon?

585
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,132
100? All right, I'm trying.

586
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,760
- Hi ladies!!
- Hon. Ah, boys in here. In here, boys.

587
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,969
Yeah! Why'd you look so stressed?

588
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:07,887
Smile.

589
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,513
Is that a TV?

590
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,058
Hey, I just thought of something.

591
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,895
We'll create our own foundation
and ask them for donations.

592
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:17,688
Hon.

593
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,273
Hon, you said it yourself.

594
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,068
They don't need that money. We do.

595
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,111
We really need it.

596
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,530
What about this? Who are they?

597
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,908
Scholarships.

598
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,828
- Scholarships?
- You can't just use pictures of

599
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:38,167
- random kids. Where did you get these?
- Relax. They're just AI. Hon, we're in

600
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:43,214
- this together, ok? As long as we're
- together it'll be all right.

601
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,090
Just AI?

602
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,342
- Jessa, I…
- Shhh.

603
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,680
Penelope. Call me Penelope.

604
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,480
Like I said,
all of them come from economically

605
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,773
challenged communities.

606
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:05,403
What always gets me is when you talk
to the kids. They always say,

607
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,364
please help our parents,
like, with agriculture.

608
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,242
That means more to them
than their education.

609
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,910
Oh, how sad.

610
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,454
So that they don't have to worry,

611
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,039
on top of funding their studies,

612
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:21,168
Kiefer and I provide a monthly stipend
to each of their families.

613
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,213
Oh, you're too kind.
Too kind! How generous.

614
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,257
Thank you, it means a
lot. It means a lot.

615
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,467
- I love it. I love it. I love it.
- Yes.

616
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,512
- How can we contribute to your mission?
- Yes.

617
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,304
Yeah.

618
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,808
Good question. Is
anybody familiar with Kuratsa?

619
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,600
Yes.

620
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,478
- What's that? Uh… can someone Google it?
- Kuratsa!

621
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,813
What is she talking about?

622
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,607
Oh Kiefer! Show them!

623
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:54,118
In the province my dad comes from when
we raise funds, we do it through dance.

624
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,836
Oh, impressive.

625
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,339
- They're so charming!
- Yeah. Oh.

626
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:14,847
- How delightful!
- Wow, yes. Oh, beautiful. So graceful. Oh!

627
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,224
Beautiful couple.

628
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,312
Guys, if you'd like to donate,
throw your money on the dance floor!!

629
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:25,733
- Oh, looks like we have our first!
- Oh, Mrs. Lavinia! Our biggest

630
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:30,154
- donator. Show her how it's done, Madeline!
- Are you going to let

631
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,948
- her beat you, Madeline?
- Of course not!

632
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,658
Woo! Guys.

633
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,077
- Guys, feel free to join us.
- Come on, everyone!

634
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,705
Yeah, join us, join us,
join us. Join us, yes.

635
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,750
Come on. Come on! Everybody! That's
it, that's it, that's it! Yes. Perfect!

636
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,835
Perfect! Yes, everybody!
Good, good good. Let's go!

637
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,836
For education!

638
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,738
46, 47, 48. 248,000!

639
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,241
40K,

640
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:20,913
40K plus 248,000 in cash, equals
328,000 and we still need to sell off the

641
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,833
- housewarming gifts.
- We should be able to get about

642
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,586
- 300,000 so we have 630,000.
- Yes!

643
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,338
Thank you, Lord.

644
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,881
Just 1. 9 million more and we can pay

645
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:35,135
back everyone at Sunshine.
Looks like all that time

646
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,889
I spent socialising with my rich
block mates in college paid off.

647
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,600
You're beautiful and talented.

648
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,359
What?

649
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,777
Nothing.

650
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,657
What are you up to?

651
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:03,330
Nothing. You look hot in that suit.
You look like a modern prince.

652
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,502
Oh no! Oi oi.
Hey!

653
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:14,592
What are you doing?
Hey, don't do that. Don't!

654
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:19,763
If you think I look hot in this.
Just wait until I take it off.

655
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,266
No, don't, don't, don't.

656
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,601
Don't take it off.

657
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,560
Keep it on.

658
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,894
I like seeing you wear it.

659
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,354
Hm?

660
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:33,319
You look so good in it and
I'm really tired. So tired.

661
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:40,367
What if… you just relax and
let me do all the work? Yeah?

662
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,871
- Hmm.
- Oh, not tonight. Can't we just

663
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:48,000
- cuddle. Please? Please? Thanks.
- Ok.

664
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,004
Mm.

665
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,139
Love you.

666
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,018
I love you too, Kiefer.

667
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,652
Kiefer.

668
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,170
Good morning husband!! Morning! You're
awake. You look so handsome. Are you

669
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,505
- hungry?
- Morning. Mm,

670
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,590
you've really gone all out here.

671
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,342
Yes, what do you want?

672
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:42,304
Do you want cheese from
Espana or from France?

673
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,305
Or sourdough?

674
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,014
Pick.

675
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,141
Do we have any pan de sal?

676
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,357
- Joking! I want sourdough. Sourdough.
- Sourdough? Mm, sourdough.

677
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:59,238
Hey, I got an invite to join Madeline
for a spa day. She said it's her treat.

678
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,823
Go, enjoy yourself.

679
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,741
Because after this,

680
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:07,871
it's back to DIY facial masks and
back to eating pan de sal again.

681
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,501
- What's wrong with you?
- You're being an ass.

682
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:16,130
- Why do you have to ruin it?
- Hey, I'm sorry. Here, I'll take that. Ok?

683
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,507
Go, get ready. I'll clean up.

684
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,066
Mr. Tecson.

685
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:41,739
Good morning, Kiefer. I'm sorry I wasn't
able to attend your housewarming. But I

686
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:47,161
hope it's not too late to give you my
housewarming gift. Where should I put it?

687
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,162
Good morning.

688
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,163
Just put it here.

689
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,125
Thank you.

690
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,297
This piece is by a new artist.

691
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,969
Do you like it?

692
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,640
Well, if you don't like it now,
wait for its value to increase.

693
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:11,894
You know it could go up.

694
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:15,272
It could go up to 4 million…?

695
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,734
Then you could sell it.

696
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,238
Sir, I couldn't sell this, it was a gift.

697
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,115
I buy and sell art,

698
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,075
I won't get offended.

699
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,749
If you have any art that you want
to get rid of, like this piece…

700
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,795
Then we can do business.

701
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:45,135
Well, actually, you know I'm something
of a painter myself, but it's more of a

702
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,846
- hobby at the moment. Yes, sir.
- A hobby!

703
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,058
Many hobbies have become
successful businesses.

704
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,811
Why don't you join us for golf?

705
00:46:54,937 --> 00:47:00,442
Then we can further discuss
your art and business.

706
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,868
- Oh!!
- Whoa! Way to go Kiefer! You're too

707
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:13,372
modest! I thought you'd never played golf
before? You're really good.

708
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,917
- It's just beginner's luck!
- Yeah. You got lucky, Kiefer.

709
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,670
- Let's do equestrian next time.
- Or polo?

710
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,463
I'll devour you for sure.

711
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,298
Sure, any time I'm not busy.

712
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:28,679
So Kiefer, have you ever thought
of auctioning off your paintings?

713
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,513
Sir,

714
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,893
Um, I don't really know what
people look for in paintings.

715
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,270
Uh, you know,

716
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,187
Kiefer,

717
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,023
rich people spend their
money on the things

718
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,359
they don't see in their everyday lives.

719
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,988
Like agriculture, poverty,

720
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,408
indigenous rituals.

721
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:53,370
That's perfect,
those are the exact subjects that I paint.

722
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:58,333
Hey, what about portraits?
Do you ever paint your beautiful wife?

723
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,960
She's my muse,

724
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:00,878
of course.

725
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,338
Does she pose for you?

726
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,717
I'm sure she poses for you, huh?

727
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,677
If you know what I mean?!

728
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,394
When we first got together, me and Fidel,

729
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:22,107
we would frequently go at
it like horny rabbits!!

730
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,944
But as time went by, he's gone cold.

731
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:33,243
At least you had a romantic stage in the
beginning. George and I were literally an

732
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:37,915
arranged marriage by our
parents. How mediaeval can you get?

733
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:38,749
Oh!

734
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,502
At least your husband
isn't cheating on you.

735
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,173
- Huh?
- Have you confronted him about it?

736
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,633
What's the point?

737
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,636
He'll only get better at hiding it,
That asshole.

738
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,762
Oh,

739
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,889
I'm sorry, Penelope.

740
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:59,561
- You can't relate to what we're talking
about. Forgive me. I told them

741
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:04,775
everything about what Fidel and
I saw you and Kiefer doing -Um…

742
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,320
- the night before we first met!
- Wow!

743
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:15,953
- I can't believe you told everyone.
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.

744
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:21,375
- You have the perfect marriage, you know.
- You have economic prosperity and yet you

745
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,628
- still have so much passion for each other.
- How?

746
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,215
Please! Tell us your secret.

747
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,759
- Go on, tell us!
- Go Penelope!

748
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,177
Go on.

749
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:40,394
Well… I actually have
something to share with you. Ready?

750
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,062
Yeah? Oh, yes! Yes!

751
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,608
- Hon!
- Hon!

752
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:48,819
What are you doing?

753
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,406
- It's part of my portfolio for Mr. Tecson.
- It's another way we can

754
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,324
- make money. What do you think?
- Ok.

755
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,952
There's something you
need to see. Come with me.

756
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,123
Hon, what is this?

757
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:06,628
I discovered today that all the couples
here got married for economic reasons.

758
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:11,258
Merging the family business,
estate planning, tax breaks.

759
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,135
So?

760
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,597
So, I think we can profit from
their boring marriages.

761
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,391
Ok, ladies!

762
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,892
- Yeah? Oh, ok. Ooh, wow.
- Mhmmm?

763
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,061
When I first got together with Kiefer,

764
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,897
we went to this couples therapy,

765
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,065
in Germany.

766
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,443
- Mmm?
- It's a fusion of scientifi

767
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,360
c th

768
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,778
eories and esoteric wisdom

769
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,947
from various native cultures.

770
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,365
It's super effective!

771
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,827
- Tell us everything!
- Actually, Kiefer and I are

772
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,496
licenced to hold these kinds of seminars.

773
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,666
- Are you guys willing to try it?
- Yes, yes! Sign me up.

774
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,544
- Yes, we're willing to pay any amount.
- I will pay!

775
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,630
- What the hell are you thinking?
- We don't know anything about therapy.

776
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,007
Hon, this is gonna be easy.

777
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,800
You love me, I love you.

778
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,470
We don't have any problems, do we?

779
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:01,183
Of course not.
Especially Kiefer and Penelope.

780
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,642
We're experts in

781
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,146
love and romance, right?

782
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:17,699
Welcome to the first out of 7
days of this couple's therapy.

783
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:24,331
Who is ready to commit to bringing
passion back to your marriage?

784
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:28,627
I want to hear everybody
shout 'los geht's'.

785
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,505
That's 'let's go' in German!
One,

786
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,673
two, three!

787
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:37,803
- Los geht's! Los geht's!.
- Louder! Perfect.

788
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,515
Now Kiefer will distribute
all of the welcome kits.

789
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,476
This is included in the
package you purchased.

790
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,353
How many have signed up?

791
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,522
10 couples,

792
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:53,985
90,000 pesos each for a total of 900,
000 pesos.

793
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,278
Now,

794
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,032
get the sacred cloth from your kit
and I want you to feel the texture.

795
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,242
And now,

796
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,455
put it over your head

797
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:09,000
and gaze deep into your partner's eyes.

798
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,587
Speak to them with your eyes.

799
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:18,635
It won't pop! It won't pop! 3…2…1…
los geht's! C'mon guys, get that butt!

800
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:24,558
It didn't pop, you have to push. Three,
two one. Los geht's! Let's go. Come on,

801
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,476
- everyone.
- Yeah!

802
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,815
Now, speak with your touch.

803
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,277
Take your right hand and pinch
the cheek of your partner.

804
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:42,576
Now feel your partner's energy. Mmm.
Feel their soul. And, with your left hand,

805
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,496
- pinch your partner's nose. Harder!
- Mmm.

806
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,169
Now everyone scream for one minute. Go!

807
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,131
Louder!

808
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,972
Alright! Happy last day, everybody.

809
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,934
I hope we've ignited some
sparks in your marriages.

810
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:14,149
Yes, yes. Nice, oh, sweet. I hope you
guys live a happy married life like me and

811
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,151
- Kiefer.
- Sparks? We got all

812
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,945
- kinds of sparks. Oh, yeah.
- Yes! Awww…

813
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:23,950
Um, guys? I'll leave you with Penelope,
while I go get your certificates, OK?

814
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,410
- Thank you! Bye. Bye.
- Yeah! Thank you!

815
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,328
Bye!

816
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,173
Uh Sir? I didn't see you come in.
When did you get here?

817
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:43,428
Ha, you were all busy with your seminar,
I didn't want to interrupt.

818
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,680
How's the portfolio coming along?

819
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:50,143
I'm just putting the finishing
touches on it.

820
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,188
Hm. Quality control.

821
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:57,776
Fuck!

822
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:03,615
You know,
you're not just good. You are great!

823
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,701
You really think so?

824
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:13,166
All living things on this earth have
different forms of vibrations.

825
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,210
Does everyone agree?

826
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:22,717
So now what I want you guys to do, is
to simply vibrate. Yes, vibrate. Vibrate

827
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,136
- like…
- Huh? Vibrate? What?

828
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,349
- You got it? Go!
- Oh, OK.

829
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,308
Do it guys!

830
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,309
Do it. Vibrate!

831
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,938
- Feel your senses awaken down there.
- With our eyes closed?

832
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,774
Yeah. Vibrate. Vibrate.

833
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:38,692
Yes!

834
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,906
Oh, vibrate.
Feel it! Don't stop, don't stop it.

835
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:50,537
Don't stop, keep vibrating.
Uh, hello? Madam Adele?

836
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,790
My sister just arrived.
She wants to see the property, now.

837
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:56,668
What?

838
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,921
Um, Ma'am, um, it's a bit out of the blue.

839
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:04,676
Regine is a very spontaneous person.
If she doesn't view it now,

840
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,804
I doubt she ever will.
She'll be there in an hour.

841
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:12,726
Wait. In an hour?
Uh ok, uh, see you then.

842
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,738
Why don't we showcase all your new
paintings through a grand exhibit!

843
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,365
I think it's about time for the Filipino
art scene to know Maestro Kiefer Regalado.

844
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,410
Maestro Kiefer Regalado.

845
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,705
I'm not sure I deserve it.

846
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,249
I'm not sure I deserve it!?

847
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,294
Huh? Of course you freakin' deserve it.

848
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,297
That's why I'm organising
your first exhibit.

849
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,675
- Ray. Ray! Sir, um…
- Hon?

850
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,218
Who's Ray?

851
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,014
Oh, I said, babe, Babe!

852
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:56,144
You should check your hearing. -Babe,
can I talk to you for a second? Bye, sir.

853
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,438
What are we gonna do? -Excuse me.

854
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,775
I don't know. Can't we just tell them
there's been an emergency and they need to

855
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,318
- leave? Why?
- We need a plan. Are you

856
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,527
kidding? There's no way.

857
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,904
Sorry, they paid for this.

858
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,157
If we don't think of something
we'll be discovered.

859
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:11,701
What?

860
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:12,911
I have an idea.

861
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:15,830
Ladies and gentlemen.

862
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,166
- Please stop vibrating.
- What?

863
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,000
Ok.

864
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:24,214
I was thinking since it's our last day
together, instead of a group picture, how

865
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,925
about a group painting
at the country club?

866
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:27,801
Oh?

867
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:34,349
I agree. I agree. Ah, painting to
memorialise this, um, momentous gathering.

868
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:39,187
- Right? Yes. Right? What do you say? Game?
- Right.

869
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:43,149
Yes! You up for it? Ok, everyone's on
board Then let's proceed to the country

870
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,693
- club. OK, everybody. Let's go!
- So you're in? Yes!

871
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,112
Yes. Go. Yes. Go. Go. Go.

872
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,531
- Ok ok ok, let's go.
- How exciting.

873
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,617
I know. I like it. I love it. I love it.

874
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:07,382
It's taking so long, ha ha ha ha my
cheeks are hurting. Ah ha ha ha ha…

875
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:14,848
Ha ha ha. Keep it together, mom!
It's a good way to reduce buccal fat.

876
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,022
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Mojave. I'm Jessa Baluarte,

877
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,816
and welcome to 12 Cassiopeia.

878
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:28,862
Please call me Regine,
and you can call him Giovanni.

879
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:30,864
Oh!

880
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:35,577
This house was designed by a renowned
Polish architect. And as you can see,

881
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,663
it's very modern in design. And the view…

882
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:44,252
Let Giovanni do his thing. He
will decide if this house is the one.

883
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,003
What?

884
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,213
How does he let you know if he likes it?

885
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,467
As a vegetarian and a direct
ascendant of the ancients,

886
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,927
I have a spiritual connection
with animals.

887
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,930
Giovanni, will let me know. Mhmm.

888
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,085
That's strange.

889
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,670
What happened?

890
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:35,553
Giovanni never barks unless he finds
some thing or someone! Giovanni! Giovanni!

891
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:39,474
- What's in there? Is someone in there?
- Huh?

892
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:43,645
- That's the study.
- We're the only ones here.

893
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,690
This house is inhabited by bad spirits.

894
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,068
- Even Giovanni knows it!
- No, no, ma'am, you're wrong!

895
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,069
Giovanni, you're wrong!

896
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:51,819
- No! -I can assure you we've

897
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:52,570
I will tell my sister not
to buy this ghost house.

898
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,905
Had it blessed by a monk.

899
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,367
Agh! Miss Regine, please,
just one more chance. Oh.

900
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,118
We can book another viewing for you.

901
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,870
- Let's go. Just drive!
- Giovanni!

902
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:09,546
- 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! Woah… hmm?
- 10, 9, 8, 7,6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Yay!!

903
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,597
What the fuck is that?

904
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:24,018
- Oh. Oh, puppy!
- Which one am I?

905
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,689
Oh, you're right there.

906
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,859
Unbelievable!

907
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,280
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

908
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,910
- Kiefer's talent never ceases to amaze me.
- What?

909
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:47,083
Pieces of this calibre are usually on
big displays in places like Galerie des

910
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:51,504
Merveilles, in France or the
Palazzio Ca' d'Oro in Italy.

911
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,839
Ooh?! Ahh! Wow.

912
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,633
- What? No way.
- Hmm…

913
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:00,888
- Oh, yes! Yes. Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo! Yes.

914
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:01,889
Yes, yes. Brilliant.
It's such a good painting.

915
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:02,515
Yeah, ok. Yeah.

916
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:11,190
Oh, no. No. I think I will buy it.
No… I'm buying it. No, no, no. I will…

917
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,025
Uh…

918
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:12,609
No, I want it. How
much does he want for it?

919
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:12,984
No, I would like to buy it. I would
love it in my house. I think it would look

920
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,485
perfect in my loungeroom.

921
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,448
Ok, Ok, Ok. Guys.

922
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:23,494
Guys.
There is a classier way of going about

923
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:27,415
this. Why don't we try it this way?

924
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,796
- Bidding!
- Ooh ya ya me, me, me, me! Oh my

925
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,216
- goodness. You can't be serious?!
- 25000.0

926
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,219
- 50,000 pesos!
- 50.0

927
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,012
55000.0

928
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,222
- 65!
- 75000.0

929
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:49,228
- 75000.0
- It's getting up there!

930
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,363
- 250?!
- 250,000 pesos.

931
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,616
250,000!
Sold!

932
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:15,129
Hon, Miss Regine just left. Bye,
take care. See you. Bye. Take care.

933
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,257
Ok. Bye guys! Get home safe. Bye!

934
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:34,482
Look, 750,
000. Our problems are over! It's from the…

935
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:38,236
Where'd this come from? Wait, wait.
Oh crap, it's Madame Adele! Just a second.

936
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,195
Hello, ma'am.

937
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:44,158
I've spoken with my sister, we'll take 12
Cassiopeia! We'll move in next year. So,

938
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,994
- get the house ready. That house is mine!
- Huh?

939
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,330
I thought your sister didn't like it?

940
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,331
Well,

941
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:54,252
she's changed her mind because when she
got home Giovanni wouldn't stop barking.

942
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,629
His way of telling her
to buy the property!

943
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,215
How strange!
Anyway,

944
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,759
just fix the paperwork and
call me when it's ready.

945
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:02,844
Bye.

946
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:06,347
What?

947
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:10,768
What is it?

948
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,109
She's decided to buy it.

949
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:23,239
Hon, congrats!
Seriously? Congrats!!

950
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:27,410
That means we can pay everyone
back at Sunshine

951
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,454
and we'll still have 2 million left.

952
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,580
Woohoo!

953
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,750
We can finally give up this charade.

954
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:37,670
Woo!

955
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:42,592
Congrats, hon. Congrats.
You were so brilliant.

956
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,846
- Aren't you excited?
- Mhm.

957
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:49,557
Congrats.

958
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:57,356
Here.

959
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,233
After 10,000 years.

960
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,110
Thank you, Han.

961
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:05,323
Wow! You should be thankful I didn't
report you to the police.

962
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:09,327
You expect me to thank you?
What the hell do you think this is?

963
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:11,579
Boss Gil.

964
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:12,997
Is that all of it?

965
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,292
Of course,
Boss Gil, that's the full amount.

966
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,252
I told you we weren't going anywhere.

967
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,214
Never pull anything like this again, ok?

968
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:25,301
People around here are
just scraping through.

969
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:28,930
Are you gonna provide for
Jessa by scamming people?

970
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:31,307
You're lucky she hasn't left you.

971
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,815
Congrats on the sale!

972
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:43,736
- It must have been a good commission.
- Huh? When are you coming to visit?

973
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,824
Life is better out here.
You've paid everyone back, haven't you?

974
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,660
Come and stay with me.
You need to leave Ray.

975
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,578
Oh, sorry, sorry. So sorry.

976
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:56,040
Unless you want to keep
living the way you are.

977
01:03:59,126 --> 01:03:59,836
Hon!

978
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,255
Uh dad,
I'll have to call you back. Bye bye.

979
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:03,881
Yeah?

980
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,635
I got pan de sal and bananas.
Let's go and eat.

981
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:09,762
I need to get some laundry done.

982
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,682
- Do you want a hand? I can come.
- No, it's fine. You go

983
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,225
ahead and enjoy your pandesal.

984
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,664
What are you still doing up here?
You haven't eaten.

985
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,835
I wanted to tell you something.

986
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,049
What is it, hon?

987
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,387
You look serious.
What's going on?

988
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,809
I'm thinking about…

989
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,191
About what's going to happen to us.

990
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:11,616
Maybe it's best if I go and
stay with my dad for a bit.

991
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:16,996
Are you leaving?

992
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,298
I need to take a look at my life, Ray.

993
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,216
Your life?

994
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:35,097
It's here. Everything's back to normal.

995
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,309
Normal?
Is that all?

996
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:44,607
There's this.

997
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:51,405
Ray.

998
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,201
What are you doing?

999
01:05:56,702 --> 01:06:00,164
Jessa I know that we're still
a long way from our dreams.

1000
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:04,085
But as long as we're together
I know that we can do anything.

1001
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:16,639
How would it work? How?
What would happen if I said yes right now?

1002
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,641
What would our life be like? Like this?

1003
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:28,109
Well, maybe we could start over. We can
find a new place, we still have 2 million

1004
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:29,193
- left!
- Wait.

1005
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:33,155
I'm the one with 2 million.

1006
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,073
Me.

1007
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,160
But Ray,
that's nothing in the scheme of things.

1008
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,914
Let's say I said yes right now,
it'll only get harder.

1009
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,874
We'll have children. I do.

1010
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:49,046
How? How can we afford it?

1011
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,382
I'll find another job,
whatever I have to do.

1012
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:52,299
Whatever?

1013
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,178
That's your plan, huh?
That's not a plan, Ray!

1014
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,724
You need to ask yourself,

1015
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,225
in 5 years,

1016
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,352
where are we going to be?

1017
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:08,149
- We'll be together.
- Why did this become a job interview?

1018
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:11,485
Because you promised you'd
make our dreams a reality!

1019
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:14,739
That's what you've always promised,

1020
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,158
so tell me how you're going to do it?

1021
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:23,122
- I don't know!
- I just want us to be together. Don't you?

1022
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:27,376
Wasn't that the dream for us
to be together, no matter what?

1023
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:32,048
How can you still think that way
after everything we've just done?

1024
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:35,593
Is that enough for you?
Cause it's not enough for me.

1025
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:38,554
This isn't the life that I want.

1026
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,274
Do you still love me?

1027
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,361
Ray, I love you.

1028
01:07:56,447 --> 01:08:00,201
This is hard for me too but I just
can't see how this is going to work.

1029
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:07,249
I don't know if I can still trust
you to keep your promises.

1030
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:49,810
Jessa, I'm sorry.

1031
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:55,816
You're right.

1032
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:03,032
You've waited so long for me
to deliver on my promises.

1033
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:06,952
I've told you before.

1034
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:12,625
I'll never give up on you.

1035
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,880
Jessa, please don't give up on me.

1036
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,018
I hope one day you'll wear this.

1037
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,093
Hon!
Where are you going?

1038
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:55,227
- Good morning! Anybody home? Oh!
- Ugh.

1039
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:01,317
Are you going somewhere?
Let me guess, vacation!

1040
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:04,695
Ok, ok.

1041
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:05,821
Vefore you leave,

1042
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:08,365
uh, I have another business
proposal for you.

1043
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,535
Sir, I'm sorry. Now is
really not a good time.

1044
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:14,163
Just hear me out, this
is about Kiefer's exhibit.

1045
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:21,587
I have some ideas to maximise the impact
of the event and probably make more money!

1046
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:23,380
Huh?!

1047
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:28,385
If you wanna keep doing this,
we can, just please don't leave. Please.

1048
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,474
Penelope is leaving?

1049
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:40,564
As in leaving you?
But your marriage is perfect!

1050
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:43,901
We can figure this out, can't we?

1051
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,946
What do you say, huh? Jessa?

1052
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:50,783
I have to go.

1053
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:52,951
Hon.

1054
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,420
What did you just…?

1055
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:05,714
Mm?

1056
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,806
- Did you hear him? He just called me…
- God damn it!

1057
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:17,476
You know I'm sick and
tired of this pretence.

1058
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:22,022
Ok, all right. I dare both of you to

1059
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,360
step out of this house.

1060
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:32,324
Jessa Baluarte.

1061
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:37,454
Raymond Cruz.

1062
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:53,429
Agh!

1063
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:55,764
Sir.

1064
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,766
Don't come any closer.

1065
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:03,647
Over there. Come on. Face the window.

1066
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:14,032
Do as I say or I will call the police. Go!

1067
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:19,705
You sneaky,

1068
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:23,375
sleazy social climbers.

1069
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:28,881
You managed to play just about
everyone in Vineyard Hills.

1070
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:32,509
What do you think they would do
if they found out the truth?

1071
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:34,553
Opportunists.

1072
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:39,141
You're frauds. You're scammers!

1073
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,980
I'll admit though I'm impressed.

1074
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:51,987
Especially when you came up with that
fucking fake organisation.Which,

1075
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,864
by the way,

1076
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:56,033
we're going to use.

1077
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,995
All right, turn around.

1078
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:07,878
Here's the plan.
We're going to have an exhibit with Ray's,

1079
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:09,671
uh, excuse me,

1080
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:14,134
I mean Maestro Kiefer's artwork.

1081
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:20,224
And we're going to invite the
richest and the upper crust,

1082
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:21,934
the 1%.

1083
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:30,943
And we're going to tell them that your
organisation will be receiving all of

1084
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:34,446
the proceeds from your painting sales.

1085
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:38,659
How did you figure it out?

1086
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:41,036
Huh? By accident.

1087
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:02,182
- Giovanni! What's in there?
- Is someone in there?

1088
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:05,060
- That's the study.
- We're the only ones here.

1089
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,439
I honestly don't care about
this scam you've got going.

1090
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,358
As long as we do business.

1091
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:15,821
In fact, I want to use your talent for

1092
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:22,035
fooling people. Especially you.
You and your silver tongue.

1093
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:24,538
Remember the costume party?

1094
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:29,418
Your big speech about carbon footprints,
recycling.

1095
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:32,462
That's what we're going to use.

1096
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,800
Oh, your silver tongue! Your…

1097
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,145
Sir, why are you doing this?

1098
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:51,648
Why else? For money.

1099
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:54,568
Power.

1100
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,320
Money is power.

1101
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:57,154
And,

1102
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:01,533
everyone that you scammed
here in Vineyard has both.

1103
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:06,997
Do you know all the charges that they
would file against you if they ever

1104
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,208
learned the truth about
what you did to them?

1105
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:17,341
Sir, please don't expose us.
We were desperate. We had no other choice.

1106
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,137
What's the split?

1107
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:29,936
Jessa's down to play!
Considering my leverage over you… 80 - 20.

1108
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,571
If we agree, you have to promise that

1109
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,324
you won't tell anybody.
And that you'll let us

1110
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,784
leave after all of this.

1111
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:47,245
Deal!

1112
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:53,919
Ray, what's this painting about?

1113
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,589
Are we really going along with Mr Tecson?

1114
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,842
We don't have a choice.
It's either this or jail.

1115
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:05,472
But won't this make it worse for us?
Jessa.

1116
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,935
- Let's find another way.
- Please.

1117
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,395
There is no other way.

1118
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:15,315
Once this is over we're both on our own.

1119
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:21,822
You should get back to work. 7 years ago,
Kiefer went on a vacation in the rural,

1120
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:22,948
rural parts of

1121
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,492
rural parts of Arayat Pampanga.

1122
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:30,664
Welcome to this very special exhibit
featuring the works of up and coming

1123
01:18:30,747 --> 01:18:31,331
visual artist,

1124
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:35,168
my loving husband, Kiefer Regalado.

1125
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:41,216
How's my artist?
And his, um, beautiful wife?

1126
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:44,469
- Kiefer.
- Sir.

1127
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,473
It might take a little longer to
finish my paintings than we anticipated.

1128
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:49,391
No!

1129
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:56,064
Do you think I don't know what you're
doing? You are buying time.

1130
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:04,406
I'm sorry,
but you're poor. You cannot afford time.

1131
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:07,617
So, fucking get to work, now!

1132
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:19,337
Ray?
Ray?

1133
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:27,554
What's going on in here?

1134
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:34,644
Agh!

1135
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:44,154
Don't get too close to me.
You'll only get hurt.

1136
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:06,092
Come on,

1137
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:09,346
give it to me. Come on.
You've had enough, OK. Give it to me.

1138
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:15,811
You OK?

1139
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,441
Can we really do this?

1140
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:32,035
Didn't your dad lose everything to a scam?
What the hell happened to us?

1141
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,664
Now we're the scammers?

1142
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:38,208
Ray.

1143
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:42,128
God damn it, this is all my fault.

1144
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1145
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:51,012
Hey, come here. It's all right.

1146
01:20:55,308 --> 01:20:58,436
We'll get through it, ok? Look at me.

1147
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:03,900
We can do this as long as we're together.

1148
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:07,362
We can do this ok?

1149
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:15,120
Calm down. Inhale.

1150
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:17,289
Exhale.

1151
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,084
Inhale
Exhale.

1152
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:26,047
Inhale.

1153
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:28,675
Exhale.

1154
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,763
Inhale
Exhale.

1155
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,528
Oh marvellous. Oh, I
love it. He's so clever.

1156
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:51,656
Oh yes. That one. I want that one. That
is it. That is the one. I want that. Yes.

1157
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,657
- Yes.
- Oh! Yes, madam!

1158
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,535
Uh, that's the one you want? Ok. Oh
wait, wait. Let's have a photo. Let's have

1159
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,037
- a photo taken, ok.
- Hey, how are you?

1160
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:57,913
Oh, hey… how are you?

1161
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:00,749
Esteemed guests and fellow
art enthusiasts,

1162
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:06,004
welcome to this very special exhibit
featuring the works of up and coming

1163
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:09,633
visual artist,
my loving husband, Kiefer Regalado.

1164
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:21,436
Of course this event wouldn't be possible
without the help of the ever revered

1165
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:22,646
art dealer, Mr.

1166
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:23,480
Wendell Tecson.

1167
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:31,988
All the proceeds from this event
will go to Sunshine Foundation for

1168
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:36,409
educational empowerment and assistance
for underprivileged children.

1169
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:39,537
If you're interested in buying
one of Kiefer's works,

1170
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:40,622
just go see Mr.

1171
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:41,790
Tecson. However,

1172
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:46,836
if you have any questions regarding the
artistry or technical aspects of Mr.

1173
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,548
Regalado's masterpieces,
feel free to ask me or Mr.

1174
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:53,385
Kiefer himself right
after our guided tour.

1175
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:03,895
Let's begin.

1176
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,776
Oh, cheers!

1177
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:19,703
After this exhibit is done,
I want you to start on a whole

1178
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:20,829
new set of paintings.

1179
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:22,664
I can submit them to the auction house.

1180
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:26,001
I'll tell them I paid 500,
000 but we should be able

1181
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,377
to sell it for 700…

1182
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,671
- just quietly. No, no, no, no.
- But I thought this was

1183
01:23:29,754 --> 01:23:30,839
the last time we were…

1184
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,634
Ray,

1185
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:42,058
I know the truth about you and
the truth is worth your life.

1186
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:47,022
- Hello, hello, hello! Wendell!
- Oh, Madam Senator, you made it!

1187
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:50,692
- Mm hm… Of course!
- Thank you.

1188
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:54,446
Kiefer, I want you to meet Madam
Senator Leah Lamaroza.

1189
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:57,949
Nice meeting you,

1190
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,869
- Kiefer. Everything is brilliant.
- Good evening, madam.

1191
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:02,245
Oh,

1192
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:06,166
you know we're actually looking for a
mural artist for the new wing of the

1193
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:08,209
Senado Palacio. I'll endorse you!

1194
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,211
Oh, fantastic!

1195
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:13,590
- Wendell!
- Hi Sir! Uh…

1196
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:17,802
Kiefer, I want you to meet, uh, Dr.

1197
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,555
Hubert Decena, Director General of the

1198
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:23,475
Manila International Visual Arts Museum.

1199
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,478
Uh, starting next week,

1200
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:31,232
we'll be hosting delegates from
various countries at our museum.

1201
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,277
I'd like to invite Mr
Regalado to take part

1202
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:38,990
in our monthly lecture series as
part of our upcoming symposium.

1203
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:02,722
Oh shit. What the fuck?

1204
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:05,141
Excuse me.

1205
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:08,770
Where are you going?

1206
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:11,231
Sir, I'm done. This ends here.

1207
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:17,862
We're only just getting started.

1208
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:29,374
How are you going? Are you all right?
Do you need to take a minute?

1209
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,381
I can't do this.

1210
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:38,216
Ray.

1211
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:43,054
- Look at me.
- We can do this, I know we

1212
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:47,767
- can. We're so close, please.
- This is only the start for Mr. Tecson.

1213
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:52,689
He'll never let us go, he's going
to keep holding this over our heads.

1214
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:54,399
I know, but…

1215
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,527
Ray, what else can we do?

1216
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,827
- Ray… Ray!
- You should get out of here.

1217
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:08,454
Please, just let me do this, all right.

1218
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:19,257
Jessa,
I'm sorry that I didn't keep my promise.

1219
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:24,721
That I didn't make your dreams come true.
I believe in you.

1220
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:26,681
You deserve so much more.

1221
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,434
Ray.

1222
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,313
You should leave. Get out of here.

1223
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:35,023
Don't do this.

1224
01:26:39,235 --> 01:26:40,361
Ray. Ray.

1225
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:44,824
Get out of here while you still can.

1226
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:45,825
Ray!

1227
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:58,755
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

1228
01:26:58,838 --> 01:27:00,924
- Yes. Yes, Kiefer?
- Hey!

1229
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,344
I have an announcement
that I need to make.

1230
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,139
- Uh, Kiefer.
- You stay there!

1231
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:10,850
- Don't come any closer, you hear me?
- Oh,

1232
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:17,023
Everyone should hear the truth.

1233
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:22,278
I'm not Kiefer.

1234
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,280
- Huh? No. What?
- Huh? What? I don't understand.

1235
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:25,114
What?

1236
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:28,910
The truth is,
my real name isn't Kiefer Regalado.

1237
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:30,495
It's Raymond Cruz.

1238
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:35,124
He never existed,

1239
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:36,876
Kiefer Regalado.

1240
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:39,921
I'm not a painter,

1241
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:43,591
and the Sunshine Foundation,

1242
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:46,844
that was just something I came up with.

1243
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:48,471
Huh?

1244
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:52,600
Sorry.

1245
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,521
I've deceived all of you.

1246
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:06,072
I did it all because we
were desperate for money.

1247
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:09,200
I'm not like you,

1248
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:11,536
your dreams are within your grasp.

1249
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:14,789
Anything you want in life
you can just have.

1250
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:19,919
I tried my best.

1251
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:23,464
I did it for the person I love.

1252
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:28,636
I wanted to be able to give her,

1253
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,721
her dream house.

1254
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:31,597
A beautiful life

1255
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:37,770
Because that's what you
do when you love someone.

1256
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:41,983
You do everything you can
to give them a better life.

1257
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:45,320
But I failed.

1258
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:50,742
I couldn't do it.

1259
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:53,911
I couldn't.

1260
01:28:56,622 --> 01:29:01,419
The only thing I can do now,
is come clean and tell you the truth.

1261
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:05,715
Kiefer. I mean, Raymond.

1262
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:10,803
You know we have to call the authorities,
right?

1263
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:12,138
Oh, yeah. I guess we have
to. We have to call the police.

1264
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:13,097
Hmhm. Yeah. We have to.

1265
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:14,891
We should call the police.

1266
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:17,518
And where's Penelope?

1267
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,437
Did you trick her into this?

1268
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:24,317
- Wendell? What is he talking about?
- Uh, I'm sorry, Madam

1269
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:28,738
- Senator, but this is all news to me.
- So you're a scammer?!

1270
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:34,118
He told me he'd spent years making these
paintings and that your work had

1271
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,496
been displayed abroad.

1272
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:38,915
You are so full of shit!
Me? I was desperate,

1273
01:29:38,998 --> 01:29:44,420
but you did this because you're a greedy,
money hungry two-faced psychopath.

1274
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,297
Ladies and gentlemen!

1275
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:51,427
Especially those of you who made
a cheque out to Mr Wendell Tecson.

1276
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:54,639
Meet the mastermind.
He found out who we were and

1277
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,307
used it to blackmail us.

1278
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:02,688
You're a liar! Why should anyone believe
you? You and your wife should be charged

1279
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:06,109
- for this deception. Who's with me?
- You son of a…

1280
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:09,487
I knew it from the very
first time I saw you two!

1281
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:12,156
Copulating in the pool like savages.

1282
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,201
From the very beginning, I knew
you weren't one of us. I knew it!

1283
01:30:15,284 --> 01:30:16,202
That's right.

1284
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:18,037
It's disgusting. I'm so
outraged. I can't believe it.

1285
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:20,790
I hate that guy. How dare he. How dare
he do this to us. After everything we've

1286
01:30:20,873 --> 01:30:23,668
been through. Ugh, what an asshole. I hope
he gets what's coming to him. I hope the

1287
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:26,963
- police come and handcuff him.
- Copulating in the pool like… ugh.

1288
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:35,096
No. No, no, no, you don't understand.
No, it's like this. No, really.

1289
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:21,327
I can't believe they would do that to us.
I mean, we were so nice to them. We were

1290
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:21,994
so nice. The country club. The
costume party. I can't believe it.

1291
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:22,578
Everything that we gave
them. I feel terrible.

1292
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:23,037
- What is he doing?
- Yes. Do that right now.

1293
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:23,412
- How could they… How dare you.
- Here we go.

1294
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:23,829
After everything that's happened.
This whole night is ruined.

1295
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:24,330
I can't believe this. Kiefer is my friend.
I thought they were our friends.

1296
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:24,747
And to think we've been traitored
this whole time.

1297
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:25,248
Ugh. I feel like my whole life is ruined.
How will I ever trust anybody again.

1298
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:25,998
Ugh, get off me.

1299
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:28,417
Stay close.
Just hold on to my hand.

1300
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:39,470
Oh my God!

1301
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,016
- You've ruined everything.
- Oh! Oh my god. What

1302
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,518
- is he doing? Oh, oh no.
- Wait. Stop. Wait, wait. Look, look, look.

1303
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:47,395
Oh my God, he's got a gun. He's got a gun.
A gun? Where did he get a gun?

1304
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:49,021
- Sir. Sir…
- I'll make you pay for this!

1305
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:50,439
Sir.

1306
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:54,026
Do you think I'll let you walk away
from this to live happily ever after.

1307
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,111
Sir, please.

1308
01:32:55,861 --> 01:32:58,656
- Sir, just put the gun down.
- Shut up! Do you really think

1309
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,157
that they'll take your side in this?

1310
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:03,452
Do you think they'll believe you?

1311
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:10,042
I have a respectable reputation and
both of you are nothing but fucking

1312
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:12,378
social climbers.

1313
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:14,005
And I'm sorry,

1314
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:17,883
but I have to end your
love story right here,

1315
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:20,720
- right now.
- No, sir!

1316
01:33:20,803 --> 01:33:21,721
Sir!

1317
01:33:24,473 --> 01:33:25,099
Ray,

1318
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,767
let's get out of here!

1319
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:28,519
- Ray! Ray! Ray,
- Everybody get down. Oh my god, be

1320
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,896
careful! It could go off at any moment.
Violence is never the

1321
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:31,981
answer. Please be careful.

1322
01:33:32,064 --> 01:33:34,984
We have to go!
Ray, let's go! The police are here!

1323
01:33:36,193 --> 01:33:37,987
- Come on, Ray!
- Ahh!

1324
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:40,197
Jessa, go!

1325
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:07,808
Ray…

1326
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:14,023
- Ray, are you ok?
- Please.

1327
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:14,940
Jessa!

1328
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,902
I thought I couldn't live like we were.

1329
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:19,862
But you're all I really need,

1330
01:34:19,945 --> 01:34:22,406
Ray.
Ray, please don't go.

1331
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:24,325
Please don't leave me Ray.

1332
01:34:42,968 --> 01:34:44,845
Please don't leave me, Ray.

1333
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,098
Someone call an ambulance,

1334
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:48,015
please.

1335
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:49,809
Don't just stand there,

1336
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:55,272
call an ambulance! He's been shot! Ray…
What do you know, huh? You think you're

1337
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:59,068
- God? You think you're God?
- He's going to be fine.

1338
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:01,529
You don't know shit, so shut up.

1339
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:04,865
- Ray… Ray. Oh God,
- Oh!

1340
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:06,867
Please don't leave me.

1341
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:10,079
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Aren't we both on our own now?

1342
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:11,747
I take back everything I said.

1343
01:35:12,331 --> 01:35:13,082
Please don't go.

1344
01:35:13,165 --> 01:35:14,041
Don't leave me, Ray.

1345
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,459
Ray!

1346
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:19,922
Why are you laughing?

1347
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:23,718
It didn't hit me!!

1348
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:28,889
- You fucking dumb ass!
- Ow!

1349
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:32,017
- Hey, that hurts. I tripped over.
- Why are you on the ground?

1350
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:35,312
Are you kidding? How are you
that clumsy? So, who got shot then?

1351
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,231
I've got a bit of a buzz going.

1352
01:35:37,314 --> 01:35:38,691
Ughh, ohh,

1353
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:41,861
aghh…

1354
01:35:42,361 --> 01:35:44,822
You fucking police. What are you doing?
Don't you know who I am? That's right,

1355
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:47,825
Wendell Tecson! I'm a personal
friend of Senator Leah! Unhand me! Ugh!

1356
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:51,370
What? What, no! How could he? He tricked
us. We should do something. Let's get him.

1357
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:54,248
I can't believe this. This is
outrageous. I know the general!

1358
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:56,876
I'm very close with a congressman.

1359
01:35:57,793 --> 01:35:59,712
- Everyone is my friend!
- You ok?

1360
01:36:02,214 --> 01:36:02,965
What are you doing?

1361
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:04,091
I just told you who I am!

1362
01:36:04,675 --> 01:36:08,345
- You have the right to remain silent.
- I know, ok. You already got us.

1363
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,514
We're not going anywhere, so just wait!

1364
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,691
I am Jessa Baluarte.

1365
01:36:23,402 --> 01:36:24,779
25 years old.

1366
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,950
Social climber. Scammer.

1367
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:33,037
And, I'm guilty of taking
advantage of you all.

1368
01:36:36,081 --> 01:36:37,291
And worst of all,

1369
01:36:38,417 --> 01:36:42,838
I'm guilty of not appreciating
what I have.

1370
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:46,342
Ray, I love you.

1371
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:51,138
Sorry.

1372
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:53,557
Sorry,

1373
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:55,518
I kept looking for something else,

1374
01:36:56,352 --> 01:36:58,020
the dreams I was chasing.

1375
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:05,069
Ray, what I really wanted was
someone who loves me as I am.

1376
01:37:06,737 --> 01:37:07,613
That's you, Ray.

1377
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:13,369
I'm sorry that I didn't appreciate you.

1378
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:16,580
Sorry.

1379
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:26,048
- All right. Wait here.
- Mm?

1380
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:26,966
Why?

1381
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:29,468
Um.

1382
01:37:30,135 --> 01:37:30,970
Jessa

1383
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:33,389
Uh…

1384
01:37:41,772 --> 01:37:42,606
Ray…

1385
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:46,402
Mr. Raymond Cruz.

1386
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:49,864
Will you marry me?

1387
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:52,408
Aww, do it!

1388
01:37:55,995 --> 01:38:02,126
Wait a sec Do you only wanna get married
so that I can't testify against you?

1389
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,921
I wanna get married coz I love you.
Asshole.

1390
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:08,090
So you're ok with getting married.

1391
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:09,675
Even if we're poor?

1392
01:38:10,634 --> 01:38:11,594
I don't care about money.

1393
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:15,264
But I'm a criminal.

1394
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:18,851
We're both criminals.
Couple shirt?

1395
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:21,353
- Yes!
- I thought you wanted

1396
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:22,730
to live in a mansion.

1397
01:38:22,813 --> 01:38:24,648
Mansions aren't as big as prisons!

1398
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:25,524
Mm.

1399
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:28,527
Ok.

1400
01:38:29,945 --> 01:38:33,657
- But we won't see each other for a while.
- I don't care! I just want

1401
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:35,409
- to be Mrs. Raymond Cruz!
- Now,

1402
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:37,786
say yes. Right now for God's sake. Please.

1403
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:40,414
- Yes! Say yes!
- Say yes!

1404
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:43,584
You've been ordered by the police.

1405
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,881
- Yes. Put it on. Put it on!
- Yes!!

1406
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:52,134
- Oh yeah.
- All right!

1407
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:53,844
I love you.

1408
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:55,846
I love you more. No, I
love you more! Call it even.

1409
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,390
No, I love you more.
Agree to disagree. All right.

1410
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:02,227
Oh, they're kissing!! Yes!!

1411
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:06,690
Los geht's!

1412
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:30,881
Uh… Can we take you guys into custody?

1413
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,199
We'll be in the car when you're done, ok?

1414
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:23,475
It's beautiful.

1415
01:40:24,643 --> 01:40:25,394
Yeah.

1416
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:28,856
In fairness though you picked
the perfect flowers.

1417
01:40:29,356 --> 01:40:32,609
Not as perfect as you. Really.
You're perfect and so beautiful.

1418
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:33,819
- Really?
- Is that right?

1419
01:40:33,902 --> 01:40:35,821
- What are you doing?
- Hey, cut it out!

1420
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:38,699
- What?!
- I feel like this would be the perfect

1421
01:40:38,782 --> 01:40:41,410
place to hold birthday parties for our
future kids,

1422
01:40:41,493 --> 01:40:42,995
- don't you think?
- Yeah, totally.

1423
01:40:43,078 --> 01:40:44,955
- You know what else I think?
- It's so nice.

1424
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:45,706
What?

1425
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:47,833
I think you'd be an amazing mother.

1426
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:53,088
And I think, you'd be a perfect dad.

1427
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:55,049
Jessa? Ray?

1428
01:40:55,758 --> 01:41:00,012
- Sorry, ma'am, we got a little distracted.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

1429
01:41:01,388 --> 01:41:05,059
I like what you've done with the house.
Exceptional staging too.

1430
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:07,102
- Thank you, ma'am.
- That's very kind of you.

1431
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:10,898
You really understand the client.
How is that?

1432
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,112
- Experience!
- Huh! Well, I'll leave you two to

1433
01:41:17,196 --> 01:41:19,406
finish up. The buyer should be here soon.

1434
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:22,242
All right, Thanks. See you later.
Bye. Let's do it. I got it. Yep!

1435
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:25,621
Ok, bye. Ma'am, thanks for your
help. Ready? Ok. You ok with that?
