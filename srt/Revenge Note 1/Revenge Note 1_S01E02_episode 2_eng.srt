  Episode 2

10
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:47,077
You look gorgeous, really.

11
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:50,040
How can you get drunk on soda?

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,562
Just don't drink alcohol later on. You're going to turn wild.

13
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:04,474
Are you all right?

14
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:15,605
Hey! You know Gi Jeong Wu, right?

15
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:17,527
Weren't you pretty close to him,

16
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:19,038
Ho Gu Hui?

17
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,001
- We're not close. 
 - Oh, really?

18
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,403
I thought you liked him.

19
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:26,385
Then I guess I can show you this.

20
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:28,659
  What is that? Did a guy make it?

21
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,540
  I don't really like paper cranes.

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,002
  I'd get food instead.

23
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:35,405
  You don't have anyone to get it from, so mind your own business.

24
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,316
  I didn't know that leech had this side to him.

25
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,467
What do you mean by   leech?

26
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:49,839
Didn't you know?

27
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:53,072
Guys who feed on easy girls are

28
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,323
called "leeches."

29
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,165
  He looks normal though.

30
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:59,379
Are you blind? He's a complete loser.

31
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,862
He stuck around me so much,

32
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:03,614
I got so annoyed with him.

33
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:06,617
  He gave me presents, but it was so obvious

34
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:08,719
  that he got them from someone else.

35
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,910
  Gi Jeong Wu? He's total garbage.

36
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,474
  What if those paper cranes were made by someone else, too?

37
00:02:14,474 --> 00:02:17,046
What I don't understand are the ones who fall for it.

38
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:20,731
How desperate do you have to be to date a loser like him?

39
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:23,362
It's so pathetic.

40
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:27,797
  It's so pathetic.

41
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,427
Revenge Note...

42
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:50,871
I got it again.

43
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,512
  Would you like to join Revenge Note?

44
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:55,434
  Welcome to Revenge Note

45
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:01,350
  Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

46
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,612
  Enter target's name

47
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:09,719
  If this is real,

48
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,302
  please let him hurt just as much as I do.

49
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:14,244
 Gi Jeong Wu

50
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:16,855
  We will proceed with the revenge

51
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,394
Eat one at a time. What do you think you're doing?

52
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:28,267
 You have been selected as a revenge target

53
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,100
What is this?

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,001
Is it spam?

55
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:36,345
Ouch, it's hot.

56
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:40,048
I don't need a receipt.

57
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,882
Thank you.

58
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,533
My shoes are gone.

59
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,196
Which bastard was it? They were new.

60
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:58,556
We're late for the cram school. Hurry up.

61
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:10,778
- What's he wearing? 
 - Look at him.

62
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:16,306
  You have been chosen as the winner of an event

63
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:18,108
  Chicken is being sent to your classroom

64
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,749
Hey, it's chicken.

65
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:20,870
What is it?

66
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,201
- Chicken. 
 - Guys.

67
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,253
- He won an event. 
 - That's amazing.

68
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,586
I'm treating you guys.

69
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:28,177
Mr. Gi Jeong Wu.

70
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:29,799
That's me.

71
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:31,130
That was really fast.

72
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,592
- Wow. 
 - There's a lot, too.

73
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:33,703
My goodness.

74
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:35,154
This is on the house.

75
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:38,198
- Thank you. 
 - They even gave you a free drink.

76
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:40,659
I wonder where it's from. Was it from a game?

77
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:43,483
Anyway, I am the man of luck.

78
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,385
- Eat up. 
 - Let's eat.

79
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,851
Hey.

80
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:23,702
- What are you doing? 
 - Don't hold me.

81
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:26,535
- Don't hold me! 
 - Hey!

82
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:36,945
I told you not to hold me, you jerk.

83
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,300
That's gross.

84
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:46,555
My gosh.

85
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,602
What is this?

86
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:08,898
  I've got big news. This is Gi Jeong Wu, right?

87
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:12,881
  How is he going to live with this? His life is over for sure.

88
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,272
  Bizarre Diarrhea Boy in the Classroom

89
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:35,695
What's happening?

90
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,106
Why did this suddenly happen?

91
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:47,707
  Your revenge is complete

92
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,131
What is this?

93
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:53,771
Who would do this?

94
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:22,531
  Delete my account

95
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:25,154
  Would you like to delete your account?

96
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,349
  Goodbye,

97
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,870
  my first love.

98
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,292
  Allstagram 
 Your account has been deleted

99
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:46,095
  Because I wrote a name on Revenge Note,

100
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:50,290
  I had my revenge? Does that make sense?

101
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,142
  Who sent it, though?

102
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:54,583
  If it really was revenge against Jeong Wu,

103
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,515
  that person must know me very well.

104
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:02,892
  No, it doesn't make sense.

105
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:04,693
Hey!

106
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:09,517
  What are you doing? You should've knocked!

107
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,552
I did knock. You just didn't hear it. So why didn't you hurryâ€”

108
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:17,356
Oh, my. That's disgusting.

109
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:18,418
Close the door and poop!

110
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:20,839
That's disgusting. Seriously!

111
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:24,483
My goodness.

112
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:28,517
I don't know who it is, but it's definitely not him.

113
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:30,529
That's disgusting.

114
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,873
 Jeong Deok Hui

115
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:35,305
The keyboard's going to break.

116
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,296
Are you doing homework?

117
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:38,408
No way.

118
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,899
I'm compiling quotes from Oppa Eun Woo.

119
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:44,734
To easily identify what, when, and where Oppa Eun Woo said something.

120
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,695
I'm making a database.

121
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:48,697
It's not even a thesis.

122
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,670
Why would you need a database?

123
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,352
Aren't you even tired?

124
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:56,485
It's tiring because my ears are melting.

125
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:59,088
Every word he says is so sweet,

126
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:00,850
that my ears are melting away.

127
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,901
Do you want to hear it, too?

128
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:05,885
  Hi, I'm Cha Eun Woo of Astro.

129
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:09,178
By the way, I heard your brother's voice last time.

130
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:10,819
It was really similar to Eun Woo's.

131
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:12,412
  Good luck. I love you.

132
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:14,544
It's not similar. How can this voice...

133
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:16,615
It's not even close.

134
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:25,805
Hey!

135
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:28,428
You are really good at drawing.

136
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:30,780
I'm not good at these things at all.

137
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,122
You can do anything if you're a fan.

138
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:37,086
I wanted to photoshop Oppa's pictures,

139
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:39,757
so I even got licenses.

140
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:44,403
Goodness.

141
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:47,055
You should've used such passion in your studies.

142
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:55,954
  Come to think of it, there's nothing she can't do.

143
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,507
  Could it be...

144
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:00,979
  Deok Hui be the Master?

145
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,444
Everyone knows the rules of partner dodgeball, right?

146
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:05,524
Yes.

147
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:08,137
If guys get hit, it doesn't count.

148
00:10:08,137 --> 00:10:10,269
But if girls get hit, that's an out. Okay?

149
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:11,451
Yes.

150
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:14,574
And the last team standing

151
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:17,465
gets an A on their performance evaluation. All right?

152
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:21,180
Let's pick partners now. Gu Hui,

153
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,791
you're with Ji Hun.

154
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,464
You two are partners.

155
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:27,025
  Of all people, why do I have to be partners with him?

156
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,889
  - I'm so bad at dodgeball. 
 - You two are partners.

157
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:33,593
  - And you two.   
 - Ji Hun, I'm not so good at sports.

158
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:36,455
We might get an out right away. I'll apologize in advance.

159
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:38,777
Just stay right behind me.

160
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:44,722
- Get it. 
 - Good.

161
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,765
Let's go.

162
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:51,841
- Nice. 
 - Good job.

163
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:59,688
Open your eyes when you're dodging. Why are you closing them?

164
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:01,570
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

165
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,781
I told you, just stay right behind me.

166
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:11,781
- Yes. 
 - This is the last round.

167
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:14,264
Here we go. Catch this!

168
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:16,124
Hurry and pass!

169
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,280

170
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:28,487
Gu Hui, don't you feel sorry for Ji Hun?

171
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,199
How could you not dodge a single ball?

172
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:31,240
Aigoo!

173
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,124
Our Ji Hun got hit so many times that he lost weight.

174
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:37,456
Stop talking. Do you play dodgeball with your mouth?

175
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:39,157
Deok Hui.

176
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,863
 Gu Hui, let's catch the ball just once.

177
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:55,204
Gu Hui!

178
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,148
Out!

179
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:05,254
I'm sorry. It's my treat, so eat up.

180
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:08,637
Don't worry. I'm going to eat more after I'm done with this.

181
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:12,722
I fainted for the first time in my life.

182
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:14,073
My head still hurts.

183
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:15,975
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:18,597
I thought Ji Hun would block it for sure.

185
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:21,270
Who knew you would block it with your face?

186
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,364
But is there something going on between you and Ji Hun?

187
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:26,655
What?

188
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:27,766
- Gu Hui 
 - Hey.

189
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:31,341
  When you fainted a while ago, Yamete tried to carry you on his back,

190
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:35,173
  but Ji Hun panicked and carried you out instead.

191
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:37,246
Ji Hun did that?

192
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:45,043
Maybe Ji Hun likes you.

193
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:47,245
Gosh. What are you talking about?

194
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:50,589
I know it doesn't make any sense,

195
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:55,434
but my intuition keeps telling me so.

196
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:58,227
You're really serious with this joke.

197
00:12:58,227 --> 00:12:59,938
More radish pleaseâ€”

198
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:02,330
Ji Hun is here.

199
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:17,915
Why is he looking at me like that?

200
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,499
Does he

201
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,394
really like me?

202
00:13:24,394 --> 00:13:26,625
Excuse me.

203
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,717
I can't see the menu.

204
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:32,251
Can you move your head?

205
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:38,927
Okay.

206
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:47,676
Just give it up already.

207
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:50,139
- Hey. 
 - Don't you have it?

208
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:51,290
Come on.

209
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:55,253
- Let's go. Kids these days are scary. 
 - Look at this.

210
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,716
What do you mean they're scary?

211
00:13:57,716 --> 00:13:59,888
They're around the same age as my kids.

212
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:02,501
- These punks... 
 - Look at this guy.

213
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:03,892
He has a lot of money.

214
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:05,414
He's rich.

215
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:07,557
- Come on. 
 - Okay. Nice.

216
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:09,559
- Great. 
 - Goodness me.

217
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:12,170
Hey, what are you guys doing?

218
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,813
What are you doing?

219
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:16,485
Friends should get along. Why would you steal their money?

220
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:18,448
What is this old man doing here?

221
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:21,059
Ajussi, you should leave when we tell you nicely.

222
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:22,321
These kids...

223
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,575
You should stop when I tell you nicely.

224
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:28,107
- Come on. I'll take you home. 
 - Gosh.

225
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:29,788
- What's with him? 
 - Why are you doing this?

226
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:32,130
- This punk. 
 - You old man!

227
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,334
You kids...

228
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,386
- You shouldn't do that. 
 - What's with this old man?

229
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:41,741
- He's annoying. 
 - You shouldn't be like that.

230
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,333
- What's wrong with him? 
 - Gosh.

231
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,745
You punks. Seriously!

232
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:48,447
- He's seriously... 
 - Rough him up.

233
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:52,852
- Don't mess with us. 
 - Hey.

234
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:55,854
- My gosh. 
 - You should've left.

235
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:59,489
You punks, stop right now!

236
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:00,929
How dare you do that to an adult?

237
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,461
You punks!

238
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:04,394
- Gosh. 
 - Oh, my.

239
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:07,305
Oh, no. I am so sorry.

240
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:10,328
- You punk. 
 - Oh, my goodness.

241
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:12,652
I am very sorry. Are you okay?

242
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:15,313
- Oh, my. 
 - I'm okay.

243
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:18,447
I was going to call the police,  but they looked like students.

244
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:20,679
- So I called you instead. 
 - I see.

245
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,372
- It's okay. 
 - Please take care of this.

246
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:24,623
All right.

247
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,766
Hey, your parents won't be happy

248
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:29,608
if you go around acting like this.

249
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:32,230
- Please take care of this. 
 - Aigoo, yes, of course.

250
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,773
Follow me, you punk.

251
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:35,494
You jerks!

252
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:37,896
- These punks... 
 - It hurts.

253
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,697
You rascals...

254
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,282
- Come on. 
 - Gosh.

255
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:45,102
Come here, you scumbag.

256
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:48,037
Dad.

257
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,579
Dad.

258
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,412
What's going on? What is this?

259
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:58,568
Your dad did it again. It was a close call.

260
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:01,239
But what happened to your face?

261
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,553
- I fell down. Go in. 
 - All right.

262
00:16:03,553 --> 00:16:05,343
- Take this. 
 - All right.

263
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,176
- Let's go. 
 - Goodbye.

264
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:12,311
- What is it? It looks serious. 
 - No, it's all right.

265
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:14,132
  Isn't it your turn with weekly duties?

266
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:17,986
If it's your turn, you should be changing the water bottle on time.

267
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,758
Don't you think so, Ho Gu Hui?

268
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:22,861
I couldn't even drink water because of you.

269
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:27,185
I'm sorry. I'll go change it now.

270
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:29,398
Is that it?

271
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:31,660
If you're really sorry, buy us something to eat.

272
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,984
That's right. We were so thirsty.

273
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,545
Buy us some juice.

274
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,667
Make sure it's a 100% real fruit juice.

275
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:42,200
Gosh, I'm thirsty.

276
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,743
You'll buy it, right?

277
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:46,705
  Am I your wallet or something?

278
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,828
Please give me those chocolate crackers, two breads,

279
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:52,670
that juice, and some jelly, too.

280
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,630

281
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,688
Hey.

282
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:03,662
Ji Hun.

283
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:09,809
Eonni* Yu Ra asked me to bring you to the clubroom sometime.
 ("older sister", for a female - also said to any older girl)

284
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,561
When are you free?

285
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:13,412
I don't have time.

286
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:17,416
Hey, don't you know it's an honor to be called over by Yu Ra?

287
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,550
So many people want to be friends with her.

288
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,441
Then bring those people to her.

289
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:26,375
I'm not interested.

290
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:38,046
Guys, I bought these.

291
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:39,589
- It's a lot. 
 - What are these?

292
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:42,632
- Thanks. 
 - Thanks for the food, Gu Hui.

293
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:46,846
Don't thank me. I got them all under Ga Eun's name.

294
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:48,848
Oh, my. Are you all right?

295
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,668
Ho Gu Hui,

296
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,112
you are so cool.

297
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,441
Here's one bite for you.

298
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:05,243
There. Good boy.

299
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:06,944
Do you want to die?

300
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:12,581
How long do we have to do this for? A month?

301
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:15,975
We're doing this all because of that old man.

302
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,226
Are you going to let it go?

303
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:20,008
Are you crazy? I'm going to pay him back.

304
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,760
Who are we?

305
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,914
We're the "Zombies" who don't die even if you kill them.

306
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:28,646
We're going to show that old man who he's messing with.

307
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:32,221
Hey.

308
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:38,037
Isn't that the girl with the old man last night?

309
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:40,980
- Hey, friend. Come here. 
 - Hey.

310
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,021
Hey.

311
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,294
Hooray.

312
00:18:45,294 --> 00:18:47,415
Yes! Great!

313
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:51,929
What's your name?

314
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,143
Why are you asking for my name?

315
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,747
Hey, your seonbaes* are asking you.
 (seniors in school or at the workplace)

316
00:18:57,747 --> 00:18:59,727
What is your name?

317
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:02,421
Ho Gu...
  (Homonym with "pushover")

318
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:06,965
- It says   pushover.   
 - Ho Mi* would be better. 
 (A hoe)

319
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:10,179
Ho Gu... Hui?

320
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,971
I like your name.

321
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:14,543
I really like pushovers.

322
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:17,135
Are the chickens selling well these days?

323
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:21,209
How do you know about our restaurant?

324
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:22,441
Well,

325
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:25,073
I am indebted to your dad.

326
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:27,215
Thanks to your old man,

327
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:29,427
we are going through all this trouble.

328
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:33,281
Do you understand or not?

329
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:37,607
Then do you mean...

330
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:39,098
Yesterday...

331
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:40,810
Gosh, this kid...

332
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,063
Is the daughter going to apologize or not?

333
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:47,897
I'm sorry. My dad likes to get involved in other people's businessâ€”

334
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:50,528
You're only going to apologize in words?

335
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,321
You should do it properly.

336
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,352
- Yes. 
 - That's right.

337
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:56,204
Isn't that right,   Pushover?

338
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:59,107
It's 37,000 won  (â‰ˆ $35) .

339
00:19:59,107 --> 00:20:01,499
- Pardon? 
 - It's 37,000 won  (â‰ˆ $35) .

340
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:08,127
Ajumma, I'll make sure to pay back next time.

341
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:10,069
Could you let me pay later just this once?

342
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:14,162
  No, this is way too expensive. Don't buy if you don't have money.

343
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:16,915
- I'm in an urgent situation. 
 - No.

344
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,626
Please use this.

345
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,880
- It's 37,000 won  (â‰ˆ $35) . 
 - All right.

346
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,932
Add one bottle of water, please.

347
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:26,815
Seonbaenim*...
 (respectful way to address a seonbae)

348
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:29,527
It's okay. You can take your time paying me back.

349
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,494
Thank you.

350
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:40,097
You eat a lot for your size.

351
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:47,777
  He's handsome and even kind.

352
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,719
  He's an angel for sure.

353
00:20:55,764 --> 00:20:57,386
Look at these cheeks.

354
00:20:57,386 --> 00:21:00,469
You would look good with a dimple. Should I make one for you?

355
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,811
If you make that face, it looks like we're bullying you.

356
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:04,143
Hey, it's going to fall.

357
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:05,563
Let's just have fun together.

358
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:08,147
Yes, stop frowning. You should smile.

359
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:10,940
- It's going to fall. 
 - Make three funny faces.

360
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,333
- Just make three.
 - Just three.

361
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,864
Make your nostrils bigger.

362
00:21:15,864 --> 00:21:19,527
Smile. One, two, three.

363
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,813
You should do this faster so we can all go.

364
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:25,544
Aren't you going to class?

365
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:28,107
Let's try again. Make a funny face.

366
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:31,070
Make your nostrils bigger. Smile.

367
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,590
- Smile. 
 - It's going to fall.

368
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,824
One, two, three.

369
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:37,896
Nice, you're doing well.

370
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,648
Look at this.

371
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:41,339
Let me see.

372
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:42,711
- Look at her face. 
 - Let's see.

373
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:45,362
It's uploading.

374
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:48,627
Hey,

375
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:51,030
you should come out immediately when we call you.

376
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,010
Do you understand?

377
00:22:07,246 --> 00:22:10,198
What's wrong? Did something happen?

378
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,507
They're the Zombies, known for their long grudges.

379
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:21,720
You fell into the wrong hands.

380
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,754
My dream is to have a quiet and normal high school life.

381
00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:28,927
Is that too much to ask?

382
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:40,179
  Big punch stupid Zombies!

383
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:42,992
  Apologize!

384
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:45,424
- Who is it? 
 - Hello.

385
00:22:45,424 --> 00:22:48,626
- Your chicken is here. 
 - I didn't order any chicken.

386
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:52,791
Your chicken is here.

387
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,833
We didn't order any.

388
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:00,108
Your chicken...

389
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,431
Chicken...

390
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:15,150

391
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:19,277
Mom, what's wrong? Are you sick?

392
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:24,513
Some people wrote nasty comments on social media

393
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:27,866
that our chicken tastes bad.

394
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:31,368
There were barely any customers all day.

395
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,365
Why are you bringing back the chicken?

396
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:39,989
They said they didn't order any.

397
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:43,081
What? Why would they order and then say they didn't?

398
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:46,264
- And you just brought it back? 
 - Then what am I supposed to do?

399
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:48,866
How many times has it been today?

400
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:50,809
You should've talked them into buying it.

401
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:54,092
If you keep bringing it back, how are we going to make money?

402
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,386
Dad, you drive me crazy!

403
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,389
This wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you.

404
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:05,854
What's wrong with you? Did you eat something bad?

405
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:08,786
Why did you have to get involved in other people's business?

406
00:24:08,786 --> 00:24:11,620
Look at how I ended up because of you!

407
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,112
What's wrong with how you are right now?

408
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:17,676
What do you think I am? I'm a delivery girl and an easy target.

409
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:20,158
This is all because of you, Dad! It's so annoying!

410
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,940
I'm back.

411
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:27,424
What is it? What's going on here?

412
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:31,540
Is something going on?

413
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,258
Gu Hui,

414
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:42,941
what was that about a while ago?

415
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:46,184
You're not the kind of kid who talks to your dad like that.

416
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,525
It's all because of my dad.

417
00:24:49,747 --> 00:24:52,750
All I wanted was to live peacefully like others do.

418
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:56,203
But because of my dad...

419
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,161
Do these pictures...

420
00:25:06,594 --> 00:25:09,138
have something to do with it?

421
00:25:09,138 --> 00:25:11,399
You didn't take these, right?

422
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:14,773
How did you know about those?

423
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:19,376
Why did you take these photos? It's not something you would do.

424
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,997
I...

425
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:31,940
I really didn't want to take them.

426
00:25:33,162 --> 00:25:36,894
They told me not to tell my family

427
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:41,899
and threatened me...

428
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,842
They were so scary...

429
00:26:10,828 --> 00:26:12,269
Oppa!

430
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:16,745
Gu Hui? What is it?

431
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:20,109
Please don't tell my mom and dad

432
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:22,920
what I told you a while ago.

433
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,364
If my dad finds out,

434
00:26:25,364 --> 00:26:28,046
it's going to become a bigger problem.

435
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:33,330
Okay.

436
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:37,755
And I just need to put up with it for a few more days.

437
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:40,648
They're probably going to stop after a while.

438
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,784
But you need to tell me if anything happens.

439
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:47,365
Okay?

440
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:52,020
No, you're a public figure, Oppa. You can't get involved in this.

441
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,832
You're worrying too much.

442
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:56,524
Come here.

443
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,929
It's okay. Don't worry.

444
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:16,533
I don't want to go to school.

445
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:21,749
I don't want tomorrow to come.

446
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:28,006
My stomach hurts.

447
00:27:28,986 --> 00:27:32,230
My stomach is reacting to stress again.

448
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,062
My stomach hurts.

449
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,342
  Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

450
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:55,533
I got this again.

451
00:27:57,095 --> 00:27:59,226
Should I use it?

452
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:04,741
No.

453
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:07,024
It doesn't feel right.

454
00:28:07,024 --> 00:28:08,817
It feels iffy.

455
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,378

00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:40,679
Please listen to me.

459
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,851
You have a lot of reported cases.

460
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:45,273
- What? 
 - We had no choice either.

461
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:48,046
Even your office ordered from us a lot.

462
00:28:48,046 --> 00:28:51,690
You know that we use good oil and chicken.

463
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,092
They said they got food poisoning after eating the chicken here.

464
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:58,096
Then what do we do?

465
00:28:58,096 --> 00:28:59,668
We need to do our job, too.

466
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:03,021
The investigation results aren't even out yet.

467
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:04,292
Are you allowed to do this?

468
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:06,694
How would you know that the food poisoning is from our chicken?

469
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:09,267
I eat it every day and I'm fine.

470
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:10,769
My gosh.

471
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:13,462
We'll know after the inspection.

472
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:16,454
Anyway, it's better to not do business

473
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,556
until the results come out.

474
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:22,349
If something happens again, this could get more serious.

475
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:24,293
- No. 
 - Wait.

476
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:26,895
This is unfair. That's not what happened...

477
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,656
Oh, my goodness.

478
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:29,878
- Excuse me. 
 - Oh, my.

479
00:29:29,878 --> 00:29:31,229
I'll look into it.

480
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:32,341
What?

481
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:36,345
We just need to find out if there is *salmonella enteriditis in our chicken.   (*Food poisoning-causing bacteria)

482
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:37,685
W-What, a salmon?

483
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:40,918
Anyway, I'll figure this out.

484
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:42,390
What do we do?

485
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,644
We were almost done paying off our debt. What is happening?

486
00:29:45,644 --> 00:29:47,306
My head hurts.

487
00:29:47,306 --> 00:29:49,077
Oh, my.

488
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:50,288
This is so upsetting.

489
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,763
Honey, don't worry too much. I will figure it out.

490
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:56,715

00:30:04,222 --> 00:30:05,543
Hey!

493
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:08,996
Ho Gu Hui, where are you going?

494
00:30:08,996 --> 00:30:11,380
I'm going home. I need to hurry.

495
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,742
You're talking back now.

496
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:16,575
I told you we would protect you so no one can bug you.

497
00:30:16,575 --> 00:30:19,457
We'll protect you and you'll feed us.

498
00:30:19,457 --> 00:30:22,891
Since your chicken restaurant is doing well, it shouldn't be a problem, right?

499
00:30:22,891 --> 00:30:25,833
Our restaurant isn't doing well.

500
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:28,986
Business is slow, too. It's just a small restaurant.

501
00:30:28,986 --> 00:30:31,319
So you're going to defy us?

502
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:34,192
Maybe you don't understand because we're talking to you nicely.

503
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:36,394
- Should I justâ€” 
 - Seonbaenim!

504
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:42,060
- Who are you? 
 - Let her go first and then we'll talk.

505
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,042
Gosh. Look at this punk.

506
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,734
He's brave.

507
00:30:46,734 --> 00:30:50,569
I like kids like you. You have a good build, too.

508
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:53,382
Do you know who we are?

509
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:55,833
We're the Zombies.

510
00:30:57,445 --> 00:30:58,916
That's funny.

511
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:01,409
If you're Zombies, then I'm immortal.

512
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:03,521
- Has this punk lost his mind? 
 - Come here.

513
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:05,283
- Hey, the teacher's coming. Run! 
 - Darn it!

514
00:31:05,283 --> 00:31:08,186
- Run! 
 - What are you guys doing?

515
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:10,027
Stop right there!

516
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,402
It just ended like that?

517
00:31:13,402 --> 00:31:14,753
Are you all right?

518
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:17,114
No, I'm not all right.

519
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:19,887
Next time, don't mind me and be on your way.

520
00:31:19,887 --> 00:31:23,211
Don't get involved and make this worse.

521
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:28,847
What's wrong with her? We just saved her

522
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:30,908
and she's acting like that.

523
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:40,620

524
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:43,260
I'm home.

525
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:49,306
Why is there a fruit basket?

526
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,521
What are you doing? Let's go.

527
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:55,072
  This place is currently undergoing a Food Inspection

528
00:31:55,072 --> 00:31:59,878
  Korea University Hospital

529
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:07,035
The person with food poisoning is here, so let's try to talk it out with him.

530
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:10,318
The results aren't even out yet.

531
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:11,850
Why are we apologizing in advance?

532
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,092
We still need to talk face-to-face

533
00:32:14,092 --> 00:32:15,964
in order to solve any misunderstandings.

534
00:32:15,964 --> 00:32:18,395
- Let's go in. 
 - Hurry up.

535
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,424
Excuse me.

536
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:37,905
Are you Mr. Cha Gang Bae?

537
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:41,068
- Who are you? 
 - He's from the chicken restaurant.

538
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:45,262
We are looking into itâ€”

539
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:47,725
He has already become like this. What else is there to look into?

540
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:49,928
He fainted after eating your chicken!

541
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:52,831
But the results are not out yetâ€”

542
00:32:52,831 --> 00:32:56,173
Be quiet! Are you here to make things worse?

543
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:57,575
Get out immediately!

544
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:58,787
- Darn it. 
 - That'sâ€”

545
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:00,137
Get out!

546
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:02,820
I told you to get out!

547
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,141
- Get out! 
 - Oh, my!

548
00:33:04,141 --> 00:33:06,294
Honey! Oh, no!

549
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:08,246
Why would you do that?

550
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:10,087
- Let's go. 
 - All right.

551
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:11,099
- That woman... 
 - Gosh.

552
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:14,402
I mean, why would you stand there?

553
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:17,595
Do you think we're beggars? Take this with you!

554
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,596
Be careful.

555
00:33:24,341 --> 00:33:26,515
This way.

556
00:33:26,515 --> 00:33:28,537
Over here.

557
00:33:28,537 --> 00:33:30,407
My goodness.

558
00:33:35,352 --> 00:33:36,854
Be careful of your head.

559
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:40,428
- Careful. 
 - Dad, are you all right?

560
00:33:40,428 --> 00:33:42,119
Mom, I'll go buy some water.

561
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,891
All right.

562
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:49,047
  Your patient gown looks nice.

563
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:50,599
Isn't it cool?

564
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:53,780
- Even my mom fell for it. 
 - Goodness.

565
00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:57,305
Your acting is great.

566
00:33:57,305 --> 00:33:59,798
  - You're crazy. 
 - That's hilarious.

567
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:02,651
  It's only a matter of time until their pushover restaurant closes.

568
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:05,323
  They shouldn't have messed with us.

569
00:34:06,383 --> 00:34:08,244
  What?

570
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,811
  Revenge Note 1

571
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:14,472
  Yu Ra wouldn't be happy with her.

572
00:34:14,472 --> 00:34:16,505
  Yu Ra called dibs on Ji Hun.

573
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:20,318
  I think I have a heart disease. My heart keeps pounding.

574
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:22,471
  Aren't these the Zombies? Oh, my goodness. It's a mess.

575
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:25,724
  If you don't want to get beaten up, come see us immediately after class.

576
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:27,536
  Are you ready?

577
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:29,024
  Yes.

578
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:37,626
