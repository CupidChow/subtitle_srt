 Episode 8

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,674
 I told you to keep it to yourself. Why did you share it?

11
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:48,078
 If you waited a little longer, we could've seen something better.

12
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:50,581
 Shut up, you punk.

13
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,222
 Whatever.

14
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:56,016
 She'll be too embarrassed to go around telling people anyway.

15
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:57,668
Hey.

16
00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:01,910
 Anyway, I'll see you later.  Okay.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,532
I can't believe this.

18
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:26,657
They were talking about the photo of her body, right?

19
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:30,289
I would never have guessed.

20
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,853
Did you see him? Did you?

21
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:34,234
Yes.

22
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,466
Do you think it's really him?

23
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,781
 God Ji Hun

24
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,746
Hello?

25
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:54,554
What did you say?

26
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,578
Are you sure about that?

27
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:02,312
Seriously?

28
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:05,465
That's crazy.

29
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:09,889
Okay, I got it.

30
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:21,081
 You don't deserve to join our club.

31
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:25,134
 You deceived us, you wench.

32
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:28,438
 I lost my appetite.

33
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:31,119
 I'm done.

34
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:40,950
Ga Eun can't even come to school these days.

35
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,024
But how is everything going well for you?

36
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,576
You piece of trash.

37
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:54,134
 Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

38
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,805
 Yang Ah Jun

39
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:57,436
 We will proceed with the revenge

40
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:06,856
- Is your presentation coming along well? 
 - Yes.

41
00:03:06,856 --> 00:03:09,508
Some of my fellow assemblymen said they would come.

42
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:10,991
Make sure you do a good job.

43
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,061
Yes, I will.

44
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:23,814
 You have been selected as a revenge target

45
00:03:23,814 --> 00:03:27,246
What is this? Is it spam?

46
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,011
 Oppa, let's talk.
(Oppa =Elder brother, is also said to one's boyfriend)

47
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,203
 I'm too busy preparing for the international competition.

48
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:34,955
 I'll message you later.

49
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:39,409
 Why did you do it? Just say something.

50
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:42,532
 Shouldn't you talk to me first, no matter how busy you are?

51
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:45,704
 You weren't the one who did it, right? It was a mistake, right?

52
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:46,896
 Oppa

53
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,620
 please answer me before I go insane!

54
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:00,669
Do you have any questions? 
 (In English)

55
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:06,706
That was the end of my presentation.

56
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,967
Thank you for listening.

57
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:17,535
Please give him a round of applause.

58
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,351
Next up is Yang Ah Jun, a representative from Seoul, South Korea.

59
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:24,684
He is currently a sophomore at Hanjong High School.

60
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:27,226
He will be giving a presentation on robot journalism

61
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,998
of the next generation.

62
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:31,279
Give him a round of applause.

63
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,248
Thank you for inviting me.

64
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,161
It's a great honor to be here.

65
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,454
Let me start my presentation on

66
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:59,978
robot journalism of the next generation.

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,562
What is robot journalism?

68
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:06,796
- Is it really you in the profile picture? 
 - Yes, I can prove it.

69
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:09,768
Why don't we do a video chat? I'll show you how to have a good time.

70
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:14,193
I usually don't show my face, but today is an exception.

71
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:16,725
I look this handsome, and I'm really smart, too.

72
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:21,521
Now that I showed you my face, what are you going to do for me?

73
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,881
What do you want?

74
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:25,444
Things that high school students aren't allowed to see.

75
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:30,359
Something like this?

76
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:32,741
You've got an attitude!

77
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:36,887
Why is the screen shaking?

78
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:38,538
Can you see me?

79
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,220
You can't? Is there something wrong with the camera?

80
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,483
You go first. Let me see what kind of underwear you wear.

81
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:47,235
Are you looking down on me because I'm a high school student?

82
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:57,576
What a good boy!

83
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,462
Am I handsome?

84
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,722
Darn it. I'm sorry!

85
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:15,364
- Don't take pictures! 
 - How did that happen?

86
00:06:15,364 --> 00:06:17,828
For those who are here for the competition,

87
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:22,591
please wait for a while and the presentations will resume.

88
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,473
We ask for your cooperation.

89
00:06:24,473 --> 00:06:27,596
Please don't leave your seats.

90
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,349
I apologize for the trouble.

91
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,738
 People are demanding Assemblyman Yang,

92
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:42,822
 who gained popularity for the congressional hearing, to step down

93
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:46,125
 due to his son's inappropriate video chat scandal.

94
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,835
That serves him right.

95
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:59,527
That brought some major shame.

96
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:03,774
By the way,

97
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:07,897
is it okay for me to keep using this?

98
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:14,273
 Oh my goodness! Did you watch the news?

99
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:17,526
 What happened? I was going to beat him up in front of the school gate tomorrow.

100
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:20,240
 I feel really satisfied. Did someone avenge her?

101
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,450
 Scary!

102
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,403
 I got scared all of a sudden. I'm shaking.

103
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,056
 - Behind you! 
 - Hey!

104
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:31,121
 Your revenge is complete.

105
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:38,008
I'm sure one of these three is

106
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:40,831
lying.

107
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:42,952
It's you, isn't it?

108
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:44,954
Or, is it you?

109
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,895
Is it you?

110
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,776
 The assemblyman's son descends from an ideal son to a trouble maker

111
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:00,569
 Assemblyman Yang is demanded to step down

112
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:08,357
You evil bastard.

113
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:12,581
 Ho Gu Hui

114
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:17,067
 You will get a zero if you don't submit your  English assignment by tomorrow.

115
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:19,757
 You better hand it in.

116
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:31,489
Ga Eun!

117
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:35,794
Hey, come here!

118
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:37,676
Why did you get the strawberry flavor?

119
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:39,028
It's mixed with kiwi flavor.

120
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,899
You should've gotten the orange-flavored one.

121
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,520
Just eat it.

122
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:46,065
What are you looking at?

123
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:49,889
 Right! That's more like you, Ga Eun.

124
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,691
 People are not supposed to change that fast.

125
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:54,163
 A photo of a freshman's body

126
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:56,254
 The post deleted

127
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:10,760
 The file is deleted

128
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:13,263
What is that?

129
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:15,545
- Tell me now. 
 - No.

130
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:18,017
- It's in downtown. 
 - Does that make sense?

131
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,818
He's stupid.

132
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,893
How did you even get caught with that?

133
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:28,347
I have no idea!

134
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:30,139
Hacking is my expertise.

135
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,931
I mean you know I'm good at it.

136
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:35,565
I have no idea where the crack was.

137
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,806
Just take a semester off.

138
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:40,420
Then everyone is going to forget about it, you know?

139
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,531
These kids aren't that smart.

140
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:50,039
I have a hunch.

141
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,820
A hunch?

142
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,113
I thought

143
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,907
this was just spam.

144
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,811
But something's strange.

145
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:05,154
 You have been selected as a revenge target

146
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,256
What is this?

147
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:20,830
 Your misfortune will continue until the revenge is complete

148
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:28,210
♫  Credimi almen ("Please believe me") ♫   (Italian aria "Caro mio ben" by Tommaso Giordani, written in 1783)

149
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:40,240
♫  Senza di te languisce il cor  ♫ 
("Without you my heart is languishing")

150
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:49,870
♫  Caro mio ben, credimi almen ♫ 
("My dear love, at least believe me")

151
00:10:49,870 --> 00:11:03,380
♫  Senza di te ♫    
("Without you")

152
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:14,500
♫  languisce il cor ♫ 
("my heart is languishing")

153
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:29,888
Listen up, everyone.

154
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:33,602
You will have to sing this song for the final.

155
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:36,245
It's too high, though.

156
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:39,909
I won't require you to sing it well like you would in an audition.

157
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:43,362
Make sure to articulate the difference between bilabial and plosive consonants.

158
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:47,376
You have to make yourself really melt into the music.

159
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:48,857
This is so annoying.

160
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:50,509
You know I always tell you that.

161
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,010
Yes.

162
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:57,126
That's it for today's class.

163
00:11:57,126 --> 00:12:00,210
How can we sing that?

164
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,582
I'm so sleepy.

165
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:05,504
Our music teacher is really handsome.

166
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:08,237
But doesn't he look gross when it comes to tests?

167
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:11,149
When it comes to tests, he must be the toughest teacher

168
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:12,792
in the whole country.

169
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,113
- I agree. 
 - What should I do?

170
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:17,727
I failed the midterms already.

171
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:20,289
We'll just have to take our minds off it and fail again.

172
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:23,953
If I could sing Astro songs, I would get a perfect score for sure.

173
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:28,046
How could he refuse to hear even one verse?

174
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:31,550
Wasn't there only one person who got more than 90 on the midterms?

175
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,451
Who was it again?

176
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:36,785

Look at him.

184
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:58,787
He couldn't even finish the word "spring".

197
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:17,135

00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:20,619
Min Ah, you sounded very nice. Good job.

199
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:25,524
She got to sing two verses.

200
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:29,487
Was there someone like that in our class?

201
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,424
Should I ask her to tutor me?

202
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:39,448
Forget it. I'll just fail the music test.

203
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:44,453
You sound as if music is the only subject you don't care about.

204
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:48,086
Ho Gu Hui, you are so sneaky.

205
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:51,840
Are you posting couple photos now?

206
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,305
I shall press the "like" button for you.

207
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:00,249
Aren't you new to Instagram?

208
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:02,070
How did you get so many likes?

209
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,453
I didn't use it much before.

210
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:06,955
Oh, Lee Gang Min liked your photo.

211
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:08,707
I didn't know he had a social media account.

212
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,969
 Do you want to know who I am?

213
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:11,780
 Every photo I take is a pictorial.

214
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,182
 Her sweet touch

215
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,795
 Why are you so clumsy like a child?

216
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:18,767
What is that?

217
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:22,451
Look at him showing off.

218
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:26,475
I really like his personality,

219
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:28,768
but his face is an obstacle.

220
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,539
You two kind of look good together.

221
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:34,043
You are not the prettiest either.

222
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:36,815
What did you say? Come on.

223
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,138
What?

224
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:41,890
Who is she?

225
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:48,326
 Dating for 59 days, being loved

226
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:50,769
 Watching the sunset, I'm happy that you're here.

227
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:52,581
 My boyfriend bought me flowers for spring

228
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:55,903
Oh my goodness!

229
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,907
She's a total romantic.

230
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:01,910
My gosh. She seemed so quiet at school.

231
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,943
But it looks like she is really enjoying her life. She's so cool.

232
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:09,628
She has so many pictures.

233
00:16:13,563 --> 00:16:14,983
Is it your turn to clean up?

234
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:17,856
Why does your turn come around so fast?

235
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:19,357
I know.

236
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:22,500
That is what I want to find out.

237
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,863
It's obvious it's because you cover for others too often.

238
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:27,295
I'm busy, so I have to go. Bye.

239
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:34,484
Gosh. She never helps me.

240
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:36,235
Gu Hui.

241
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:38,947
Would you like me to help you?

242
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,300
Sure. Thanks.

243
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,747
I love the fried chicken from your family's restaurant.

244
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:49,427
Isn't it good? Please tell others about it.

245
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:52,121
Okay. That's right.

246
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:54,532
This is the chicken

247
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:56,675
- from your family's restaurant, right? 
 - Yes.

248
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:59,979
My boyfriend got it for me, and it was so good.

249
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:03,201
Judging from all the meat there is on the chicken, I'm sure it is ours.

250
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:04,673
- Isn't it good? 
 - Yes.

251
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:07,056
- You should always order from my place. 
 - Okay.

252
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:09,498
Let's clean up there.

253
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,109
I haven't seen anything like it.

254
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,450
Where did you buy it?

255
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,322
It was purchased from a different country.

256
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:26,083
It'll be hard to find it in Korea.

257
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:28,787
My boyfriend bought it for me.

258
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:30,959
This must be it.

259
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,790
It's pretty.

260
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:36,004
- Can I see other photos? 
 - Yes.

261
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:38,146
 A gift from my boyfriend

262
00:17:38,146 --> 00:17:39,497
 Going on a drive with my boyfriend

263
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:43,902
Your boyfriend has a car? Isn't he a high school student?

264
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:47,426
Well... Actually,

265
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:49,478
he is a bit older.

266
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:52,621
How old is he? Is he a college student?

267
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:56,244
No. He is a bit older than that.

268
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,282
One chicken. Got it.

269
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:07,075
Hello. One original chicken, please.

270
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:10,138
Long time no see.

271
00:18:10,138 --> 00:18:13,832
I'll prepare a generous portion for you very soon.

272
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:15,574
Thank you.

273
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,629
I'm home.

274
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,650
Hello, Teacher.

275
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,412
You are Ho Gu Hui from Class Seven, right?

276
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:24,863
Is this your parents' restaurant?

277
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:28,446
- Yes.
 - Are you Gu Hui's teacher?

278
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:32,170
You should have told us. We would've given you a lot of freebies.

279
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,551
Wait a minute!

280
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:35,574
You don't have to...

281
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,496
- Put this in. 
 - Thank you.

282
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:39,749
We gave you some more radish.

283
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,960
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

284
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,593
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

285
00:18:43,593 --> 00:18:44,883
Wait a second.

286
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,796
You don't have to give me anything next time.

287
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:48,758
I could be violating the Kim Young-ran Act.

288
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:50,388
Getting delicious chicken is enough for me.

289
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:52,551
- But still... 
 - He's right.

290
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:56,835
Then, we'll give you an even more generous portion for you next time.

291
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,597
Thank you.

292
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,299
Gu Hui, see you at school.

293
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,772
- Yes, sir. Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

294
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:04,553
Goodbye.

295
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:06,194
My goodness.

296
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:09,969
Your teacher is so handsome.  He is my type.

297
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:11,630
Dad is your type.

298
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,210
What?

299
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,417
You are right. Yes.

300
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:22,090
That's good. Cover your face like that.

301
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:29,327
Teacher!

302
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:30,729
Hi, Min Ah.

303
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:32,431
- Are you coming back from work? 
 - Yes.

304
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:34,632
Is that chicken?

305
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,446
I got it on my way home.

306
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:39,297
Where did you get it?

307
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,221
What's going on?

308
00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:53,181
 Get on the 7:50 a.m. bus in front of your house, okay?

309
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:55,353
 Good night.

310
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:58,046
 We'll see. I'll try to get up by then.

311
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:00,187
 Good night to you too.

312
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:02,990
Wait for me!

313
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:07,155
Ajussi! Wait for me! Stop!

314
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:09,177
Thank you so much!

315
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,105
Don't let more people in!

316
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:28,407
Don't let more people in! Gosh.

317
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:30,239
Please.

318
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,591
- Gosh. 
 - Darn it.

319
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:34,322
There are too many people in here.

320
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,565
It's too hot in here.

321
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:39,878
Stop pushing.

322
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:41,600
Stop.

323
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,912
Ajussi, this bus is full!

324
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:44,192
I guess you got up on time.

325
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:46,265
What? Yes.

326
00:20:46,265 --> 00:20:48,757
I didn't run or anything.

327
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:51,539
It just worked out.

328
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:05,754
- Oh. 
 - What's up?

329
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:08,025
- What? 
 - Did you see something strange?

330
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:10,729
Well...

331
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,732
No, I didn't. It's nothing.

332
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:23,392
Hey.

333
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:26,484
Have you ever liked a teacher?

334
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:29,447
No. I don't find men over 22 sexy.

335
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:31,409
They're like old grandpas.

336
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,826
Wait. Do you like a teacher?

337
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:38,536
Were you just using Ji Hun?

338
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:40,999
Who is it? Is it the Math teacher, Physics teacher,

339
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,122
or the gym teacher, Yamete?

340
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:45,052
Be quiet.

341
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,275
This wouldn't be like what Ye Ri went through, right?

342
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,952
 Eating chicken again

343
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:04,873
 Today's date is a late-night movie

344
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:06,915
 We didn't want to go home, so we watched two movies

345
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:08,787
 just because...

346
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,825
No. This time, I'm sure they are dating.

347
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:20,297
That's why she said her boyfriend's older.

348
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:29,760
♫  Caro mio ben, credimi almen ♫

349
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:37,290
♫  Senza di te, languisce il cor ♫

350
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:44,820
♫  Caro mio ben, credimi almen ♫

351
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,500
♫  Senza di te ♫

352
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:58,210
♫  languisce il cor ♫

353
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:00,138
That was so good!

354
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,362
Good job!

355
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:10,269
Did you see how her voice sounded so natural with the music,

356
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:12,690
as the first word of the lyrics blended into the sound?

357
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,872
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

358
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,884
Heo Min Ah, good job.

359
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:18,155
Give her a round of applause.

360
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,821
Next.

361
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:25,784
That was so biased.

362
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:29,067
- What? 
 - What?

363
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:31,649
I meant Min Ah sings really well.

364
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:33,621
I agree.

365
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,843
Guys, I have big news! Teacher Eum is getting married.

366
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:58,547
I saw him in the main office, handing out wedding invitations.

367
00:23:58,547 --> 00:24:01,489
Is Oppa Eum Chi Hun finally getting married?

368
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:03,491
When? Where? How?

369
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:04,953
I don't know about that.

370
00:24:04,953 --> 00:24:06,995
That's no big news.

371
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:08,746
Big news is something like the department head

372
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,788
getting divorced or the vice principal having an affair.

373
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:12,500
You are such a mean person.

374
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,792
But these are indeed more interesting.

375
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:16,525
Yes!

376
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,978
You two should just date. You look good together.

377
00:24:19,978 --> 00:24:22,591
What do you mean? I'm too good for him.

378
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,552
See for yourself who's better. I'm better for sure.

379
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:27,446
If you're worth 50 won, I am worth 500,000 won.

380
00:24:27,446 --> 00:24:30,088
Hey, 50 won is too low.

381
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:32,981
Teacher... It isn't true, right?

382
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:34,372
What?

383
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,605
You aren't getting married, right?

384
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,957
They're lying, right?

385
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:41,538
What do you mean? I am getting married.

386
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:46,895
How could you do that?

387
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:53,691
Teacher Eum, how could you do that?

388
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:57,206
Min Ah, calm down and let's go talk somewhere else.

389
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:58,696
Teacher...

390
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:03,362
Didn't you love me?

391
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:06,315
Min Ah, calm down.

392
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:10,668
You and I spent time together every day.

393
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:12,170
We had such a special relationship.

394
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,045
How could you do this to me?

395
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:19,088
How could you do this to me?

396
00:25:19,088 --> 00:25:22,280
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

397
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:27,206
How can he get married?

398
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:28,987
This can't be.

399
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,418
How could this happen?

400
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,395
- How could this happen? 
 - I can't believe this.

401
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:46,935
Go back to your classroom. Come on!

402
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:48,746
Go back in! Hurry up!

403
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:50,578
Hurry!

404
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:55,302
Go inside!

405
00:25:58,977 --> 00:26:00,379
Go!

406
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:02,591
Oh my goodness.

407
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:04,082
Did Min Ah really do that?

408
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:06,154
Min Ah cried so much.

409
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:08,076
Would she do that if there was nothing between them?

410
00:26:08,076 --> 00:26:12,660
Now that I think about it, Teacher Eum was really nice to her.

411
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,433
He gave her good grades and all.

412
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:15,623
That's true.

413
00:26:15,623 --> 00:26:17,886
- Wait. I also thought something was up. 
 - What is it?

414
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:19,377
I was collecting cellphones in the classroom.

415
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,500
I saw Min Ah's phone case and thought it was pretty.

416
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:26,094
Teacher, here are the phones.

417
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:28,166
Okay. Thank you.

418
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,302
What's wrong?

419
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:36,184
Do you have the notebooks?

420
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:38,006
I finished checking them. You can hand them back.

421
00:26:38,006 --> 00:26:39,308
Thank you.

422
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:42,731
Teacher Eum's and Min Ah's phone cases spell out "love".

423
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:45,814
They had matching phone cases.

424
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:49,137
Oh my goodness. Matching phone cases?

425
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:52,781
As for the phone case,

426
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:55,973
it could be that Min Ah got a matching case herself.

427
00:26:55,973 --> 00:26:57,576
We need better evidence.

428
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:00,298
Do you think it was one-sided then?

429
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:12,551
You should hear both sides of the story.

430
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:14,763
Hey, Ho Min Ah.

431
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:17,105
Are you sure you didn't like him by yourself?

432
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:22,049
Do you think I'm lying?

433
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:29,556
Do you think I did all this by myself?

434
00:27:33,491 --> 00:27:36,634
We two liked each other.

435
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,397
We were in a relationship.

436
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:56,574
I can't see his face,

437
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,147
but he does kind of look like Teacher Eum.

438
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:19,908
Something seems off with you, Gu Hui.

439
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,789
You didn't even finish your lunch.

440
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:24,462
You love banana milk. What's wrong with you?

441
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:37,135
What you're saying is you saw him with her at the apartment

442
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:40,978
and in his car on the way to school, right?

443
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:43,602
The man's face isn't in the picture.

444
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:47,156
But his finger length and delicate knuckles are

445
00:28:47,156 --> 00:28:50,218
similar to Teacher Eum's.

446
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:53,181
I look at men's hands very closely.

447
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:54,843
How is mine? Isn't it sexy?

448
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:57,024
Move the chicken feet.

449
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,304
Those plastic bags in the picture are from our restaurant.

450
00:29:06,304 --> 00:29:10,218
I saw him buying chicken from our restaurant.

451
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:16,033
Let's not talk about this. I don't think we should involve ourselves in this.

452
00:29:17,676 --> 00:29:20,107
Would Teacher Eum really do that?

453
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,360
I'm having trouble believing it.

454
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:29,476
Are you all right? Didn't you throw up just before?

455
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:33,532
You're the student from building 107.

456
00:29:33,532 --> 00:29:35,763
Are you feeling sick?

457
00:29:35,763 --> 00:29:38,136
Why didn't you come with your teacher today?

458
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:40,708
Why didn't you get a ride from him?

459
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,151
If the security guard recognizes her,

460
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:56,153
everyone here would know about it already.

461
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:00,308
You're right.

462
00:30:00,848 --> 00:30:03,350
Something is strange.

463
00:30:06,143 --> 00:30:08,356
- You worked hard today. 
 - My son's the best.

464
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:11,340
- Let's have some fruit. 
 - Thank you.

465
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,361
What is my daughter doing?

466
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:16,444
Are you texting your boyfriend?

467
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:20,268
Oh, I know her.

468
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:24,783
How do you know her?  I never brought her here.

469
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,334
Is she your friend?

470
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:28,286
Yes.

471
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,799
Why was she there then?

472
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,691
Gosh. My stomach.

473
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:51,088
Your chicken's here.

474
00:30:51,088 --> 00:30:53,471
- Wait a moment. 
 - Yes.

475
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:57,926
- Hi. 
 - Hello.

476
00:30:57,926 --> 00:30:59,196
Here you are. It's 20,000 won.

477
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:00,698
Thank you.

478
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:02,391
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy your food.

479
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:03,872
Thank you.

480
00:31:03,872 --> 00:31:06,224
I'm sorry...

481
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:07,586
Yes?

482
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:10,528
May I use the bathroom?

483
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:13,129
Sure. You can use it.

484
00:31:18,797 --> 00:31:20,718
I don't normally

485
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:23,471
cause others inconvenience like this.

486
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:25,473
It's fine. It can happen if you're in a hurry.

487
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:28,096
- I'm sorry. Here. 
 - Yes?

488
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,519
I'll give you a coupon as a token of gratitude.

489
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:31,899
Thank you.

490
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:34,523
- Goodbye. 
 - Thank you.

491
00:31:34,523 --> 00:31:35,733
Goodbye.

492
00:31:35,733 --> 00:31:37,134
Bye.

493
00:31:37,134 --> 00:31:38,946
Teacher!

494
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:40,657
Min Ah.

495
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,862
This is for you.

496
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,953
It turned out so well, so I brought it for you.

497
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:48,186
You didn't have to do this.

498
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:49,857
It's all right.

499
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:52,169
It smells good.

500
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:53,861
Really?

501
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:56,024
Did you make it yourself?

502
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:57,614
Yes.

503
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:06,774
 ~ Revenge Note 1 ~

504
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:08,847
 You make my heart flutter once every day.

505
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:10,559
 God Ji Hun doesn't disappoint me.

506
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,770
 You must be Ji Hun. I heard a lot about you.

507
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,483
 Oh my goodness! Min Ah told everything about her relationship.

508
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,195
 So she even went to his place?

509
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:18,435
 I really don't deserve this.

510
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:19,777
 I may have to even break my engagement.

511
00:32:19,777 --> 00:32:21,489
 - Miss. 
 - Yes.

512
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:24,272
 I'm pregnant.

513
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:29,868
