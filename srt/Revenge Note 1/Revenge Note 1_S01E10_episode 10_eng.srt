10
00:00:34,374 --> 00:00:37,568
Oppa Eun Woo, I'm here.

11
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:38,749
Hi.

12
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:41,551
Hyeong, I'm a huge fan of yours. Can I take a picture with you?

13
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:45,064
What are you doing? You're only here because of me. Go away.

14
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:47,788
You must be Ji Hun.

15
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:49,939
I heard a lot about you.

16
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:58,628
Eun Woo, you're on standby.

17
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:05,955
- Gu Hui, I'll see you at the set. 
 - Okay.

18
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,953
He's always fresh and electrifying! Being handsome is the best!

19
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:16,586
Celebrities are definitely different. They shine.

20
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:17,648
Really?

21
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:21,230
I think Ji Hun is much more handsome.

22
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:25,284
Whatever.

23
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:28,197
Student! Are you a model?

24
00:01:28,197 --> 00:01:32,070
- No, I'm not. 
 - Would you be interested in being one?

25
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:34,894
Not really.

26
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,668
One of our main models didn't show up today.

27
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:39,898
Can you help us just for today?

28
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,263
You'll be paid, of course.

29
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:46,505
A main model's pay is pretty high, too.

30
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,558
- Really? 
 - Of course!

31
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:50,550
Follow me.

32
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,733
- I'll be back in a minute. 
 - Okay.

33
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:58,818
Awesome.

34
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,479
I said I would do it just this once.

35
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,732
They also need extras. Are you interested?

36
00:02:02,732 --> 00:02:05,264
- Of course. 
 - Of course.

37
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:14,735
I didn't know I'd see you here.

38
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,186
I just came to visit.

39
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:17,648
Anyway,

40
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:21,001
it feels like we're destined to meet.

41
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,212
What are your plans after the photo shoot?

42
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:25,574
I'm here with my friends.

43
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:32,582
When do you have time, then?

44
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:34,814
I'm busy with school work.

45
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:37,847
Oh, school work...

46
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:47,027
That seonbae is shameless. She's so thick-skinned.

47
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:49,660
I didn't know Han Yu Ra was a uniform model.

48
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,623
I bet my arm that it's because of her connections.

49
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,434
Come on.

50
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:56,136
She has a pretty face.

51
00:02:56,136 --> 00:03:00,431
Are you blind? It's all plastic surgery and makeup.

52
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,922
By the way,

53
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:04,603
since when did Nan Hui become close friends with Yu Ra?

54
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:06,716
I heard she's on television these days.

55
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:08,758
Maybe it's because of Yu Ra.

56
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:12,020
That explains why she is being so clingy.

57
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,688
Hey,

58
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:20,169
shouldn't they be done by now?

59
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,271
They'll be done soon.

60
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:26,305
It's what the company wanted, so she's the boss.

61
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,970
- She's here. 
 - Ah, good.

62
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,952
The cue light is over here, right?

63
00:03:31,952 --> 00:03:33,263
Yes, you're right.

64
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:35,425
Everyone, let's do this well.

65
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,208
All right. Let's do it. Please move towards the middle.

66
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,181
- Make it quick, please. 
 - Okay.

67
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,833
  Here we go. Pose naturally.

68
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,983
  Go.

69
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:45,755
  Now, pose a little differently.

70
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:47,987
Very nice. Change it once more.

71
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:49,608
Pretend you're taking a selfie.

72
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,300
Good. Let's do this.

73
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,892
Here we go.

74
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:54,034
Stop.

75
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,695
Mr. Director, actually,

76
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:59,479
my right side is better, so we'll shoot it looking the other way.

77
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,402
- Well...
 - Everyone, turn around.

78
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:04,123
We're going for the same pose.

79
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:06,947
  All right. Go!

80
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,699
  Very nice. Let's do it one more time.

81
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,200
  All right.

82
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,783
  Now, smile big and bright. Here we go.

83
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:16,165
One, two, jump!

84
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:17,608
  Jump!

85
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,059
  One last time. Okay?

86
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,680
How much longer do we have to jump?

87
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,432
Just one more time.

88
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,364
One, two, jump!

89
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,595
This time, I want Ji Hun and Eun Woo

90
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:28,928
to slightly lean in, okay?

91
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:30,220
Stop!

92
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,974
If you do that, my face will look so big!

93
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,435
How about Oppa Eun Woo and Ji Hun scoot forward a bit?

94
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:40,519
Eun Woo and Ji Hun, sit up with your backs straight.

95
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,521
Very nice. Your face looks small now.

96
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,313
  Everyone, look at the camera.

97
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:46,945
  All right. Let's go.

98
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,243
What's this?

99
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:55,984
There's a shadow over my face.

100
00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:01,210
You have the best equipment here. How can you shoot like this?

101
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,573
- Well... 
 - I can't believe this! Gosh.

102
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:05,594
We'll adjust the lights now.

103
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:09,218
- We need to do this again. 
 - We'll adjust the lights and do it again.

104
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:10,769
Oh, my gosh.

105
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,974
  This time, let's take it more seriously.

106
00:05:14,974 --> 00:05:16,767
Yes, go ahead and sit down. Look here. High cue!

107
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:19,119
All right. Good.

108
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,041
  Great. Here we go.

109
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,732
Stop!

110
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:24,834
It's so hot.

111
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,798
Bo Nan Hui, water.

112
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:30,079
Gosh, it's so hot.

113
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,886
Get off the set. Quick.

114
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,789
- Let's get back to it. 
 - All right. Here we go again.

115
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:40,049
  Let's take it more seriously.

116
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,331
  Ready. Here we go.

117
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:45,724
  Look at the camera. Great.

118
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:48,107
  Maintain the distance. It looks great.

119
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,109
  Look at the camera lens.

120
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:51,841
  Here we go.

121
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:53,653
Great. Cut!

122
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,406
Okay! Good job, everyone.

123
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:58,117
Good work, everyone!

124
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,289
Good work.

125
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:01,912
Good job.

126
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:05,244
- Good work. 
 - Thank you.

127
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:08,457
- You were all so cute. How cute! 
 - Thank you.

128
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:09,999
- Good work! 
 - Bye.

129
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:12,041
Thank you.

130
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:17,297
- Thank you so much. 
 - Thank you.

131
00:06:17,297 --> 00:06:20,008
Thank you.

132
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,594
I'm sorry guys. Something came up on my schedule,

133
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,047
so I need to head out first. I'm so sorry.

134
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:30,229
It's okay. We can just go without you.

135
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,063
Wait. Gu Hui, Isn't your birthday coming up soon?

136
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:36,066
I'll see you then. I prepared a gift for you.

137
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:39,398
You even got a gift for me? You're the best.

138
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:42,241
I'll get going now. Bye.

139
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:45,575
Oppa Eun Woo, my birthday is August 25th.

140
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:47,796
I'm just letting you know.

141
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:50,048
Okay. Gu Hui, I'll call you later.

142
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,337
He really looks out for you.

143
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:59,719
He's been like that since we were young.

144
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,880
He's more like a brother than my real one.

145
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,887
Do you know how much those earrings cost? How could you lose them?

146
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,390
I'm sure I gave them to you earlier.

147
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,962
I don't have them.

148
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:16,194
I never got it from you.

149
00:07:25,284 --> 00:07:29,208
Since you lost them,

150
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,771
you are going to have to pay for them.

151
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:33,832
Find them somehow

152
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,314
and bring them to my house.

153
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:47,576
Ji Hun, are you leaving now?

154
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,889
Do you want a ride?

155
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,131
No, thanks.

156
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,243
Really?

157
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:56,026
Well, today's not the only day.

158
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:58,536
See you later, then.

159
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,835
Oh.

160
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,988
Here it is.

161
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,551
I wonder when it slipped out.

162
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,648
Let's go.

163
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,091
What are you looking at?

164
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,064
Music!

165
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:37,847
Han Yu Ra is worse than the rumors. She is tyrannical.

166
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:42,232
I suddenly feel so bad for Nan Hui.

167
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:46,666
Don't you think seonbae Yu Ra's interested in Ji Hun?

168
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,347
No way.

169
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:49,489
No, I think I'm right.

170
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:52,501
She seemed totally interested in you.

171
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:56,146
I think you need to make yourself clear.

172
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:57,566
How?

173
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,989
Why are you asking me?

174
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,410
You need to ask the right person.

175
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:14,873
Gu Hui.

176
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:18,487
I have some additional shooting. I have to go now.

177
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:21,171
I guess you have to go alone today. Sorry.

178
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:22,861
Well,

179
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,704
it's okay. I'll see you later.

180
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:27,065
- Okay. See you later. 
 - Bye.

181
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,632
Hey, wake up!

182
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,234
Why are you staring like a fool?

183
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:08,968
You won't be able to keep Ji Hun away from Han Yu Ra this way.

184
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:11,029
Are you...

185
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,261
worried about me?

186
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:16,505
Why would I be?

187
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,591
  Do you need a wallet?

188
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:36,665
  Yes, I do. Why?

189
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:40,669
  I have an MGM wallet. Do you want it?

190
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,483
  Why are you doing this? You're scaring me.

191
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,155
  You don't want it?

192
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:48,658
  No, let me see it.

193
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:50,599
  It's pretty.

194
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:53,062
  Let me see the inside. Open it up.

195
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:54,713
  I can't open it up.

196
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:56,414
  Why not?

197
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:10,348
Gosh. I thought it was real.

198
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:16,786
How annoying! I'm already in a bad mood.

199
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,777
Darn it! I'm going to kill you, Gu Jun.

200
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:20,639
You punk.

201
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:23,492
  Ho Gu Jun

202
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:24,843
You're dead.

203
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:26,215
  Transmission Error

204
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,257
What's wrong with it?

205
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:31,160
Why isn't this working?

206
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,301
This is so annoying.

207
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,930

208
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,453
My goodness. So many of them are here.

209
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:57,626
This is amazing. You are definitely God Ji Hun!

210
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:00,580
Take a look at this.

211
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,061
It says,   "A new star is born."

212
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:04,423
You're coveted by the entertainment agency.

213
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,236
Who did you get calls from? CM, IG, JP?

214
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:08,637
I don't know.

215
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:10,509
- I'm not even interested. 
 - Come on.

216
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:14,992
What a waste of that handsome face! Give it to me. I will make a good use of it.

217
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:19,518
People are even trying to steal your life-size cutouts.

218
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:21,770
Is it you?

219
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,983
Hey, God Ji Hun.

220
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:26,295
- Can I get an autograph? 
 - Hey, we're friends.

221
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:29,859
Please, do one for me, too Oppa!

222
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:31,760
- Please! 
 - Do one for me.

223
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,032
Stop being so annoying. Get out.

224
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:36,054
- No way. 
 - He looked at me!

225
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:41,178
  Ji Hun is going to get even more popular.

226
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,620
  Don't they even go to school?

227
00:12:57,155 --> 00:13:00,170
More of them are coming. What do you want to do?

228
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,100
Maybe, I shouldn't go with you guys.

229
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,582
Gu Hui, I'll get going.

230
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,756
I turned off my phone because I got too many calls.

231
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,679
I'll text you later.

232
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,800
I'll text you, too.

233
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,479
Get in.

234
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:23,372
I'll let you out after we get past them. Come on.

235
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:25,614
Ji Hun, hurry. Get in.

236
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:30,458
Come on.

237
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,092
Watch out!

238
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:35,374
Careful!

239
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:37,156
Back off!

240
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:40,479
Watch out!

241
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,641
Come on. It's dangerous!

242
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:44,122
Hey!

243
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:46,336
Get out of the way.

244
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:48,277
Get out.

245
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:50,169
Seonbaenim Yu Ra.

246
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:52,842
I'm not interested in you at all.

247
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:56,905
Well, easy guys aren't as attractive.

248
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:59,178
But don't overdo it.

249
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:01,900
If you keep acting like that, it won't be fun anymore.

250
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:06,336
Is your brain made of rock?

251
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:09,459
Seonbae, I've told you so many times, but you're still not getting it.

252
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:10,949
What?

253
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:14,614
Are you serious about what you just said?

254
00:14:14,614 --> 00:14:16,905
Why? What do I lack?

255
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:18,427
I don't like your face.

256
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:21,310
I have a weak stomach, so I can't stand looking at what I don't like.

257
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,503
And I don't like your face.

258
00:14:23,503 --> 00:14:24,904
What?

259
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,286
What did you just say?

260
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,530
I could put up with you being ugly if you were kind,

261
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,931
but you have a bad personality.

262
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:37,696
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:40,889
I shouldn't have said that you're ugly even if you are.

264
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,972
Please don't bother me anymore.

265
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,411
Sin Ji Hun!

266
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:05,474
I will make you kneel down in front of me!

267
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:10,168
I swear I will make you cry like a baby in front of me!

268
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:39,357
Hey, what's up? Why are you calling instead of texting me?

269
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:42,510
Hey, you've got to see this. Look on the Internet!

270
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:50,108
  Shocking Private Life of a High School Model

271
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:51,960
  Controversy on his personality

272
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:55,314
  Teen Star's Personality Issue

273
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:57,046
Is this really Ji Hun?

274
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:00,228
  No way.

275
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:01,840
  I knew this was coming

276
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,092
  He has bullied other kids since middle school

277
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:18,487
  Your call is being forwarded to voice mail.

278
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:21,008
  Additional fee will be charged after the beep.

279
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,873
Are you a student at this school?

280
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:37,716
Do you know Sin Ji Hun, a freshman in class seven?

281
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:40,028
Yes, we're in the same class.

282
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:43,031
Really? Then you must know him well.

283
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:46,866
Normally, how is Ji Hun at school?

284
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:50,459
- What do you mean? 
 - I mean, what is Sin Ji Hun really like?

285
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,102
There are reports of him being different in real life.

286
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:56,665
Everything you share will be kept confidential. Tell me honestly.

287
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:59,859
I'm sorry, Ajumma. Are you writing a novel or something?

288
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:01,230
It's all a bunch of nonsense.

289
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,771
- Hey, wait... 
 - Please excuse me. I'm busy.

290
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:08,016
Excuse me, Reporter.

291
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:09,668
Do you know Sin Ji Hun?

292
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:11,369
Really?

293
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:16,625
Ji Hun did what? No way.

294
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,628
But I don't think this was photoshopped.

295
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:22,991
A lot of kids smoke and drink anyway.

296
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:24,854
Ji Hun could just be one of them.

297
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:27,156
But Ji Hun...

298
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:29,328
Shut up.

299
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,710
Don't say another word about Ji Hun,

300
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,141
or you'll be sorry for it.

301
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,574
What? What's wrong with him?

302
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:39,807
- Is he going to kill us or what? 
 - Is he his boyfriend or something?

303
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,951
Where is Ji Hun?

304
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:47,805
He's at home.

305
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:50,809
His family is probably upset as well.

306
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:54,353
The uniform company might sue them for the damage.

307
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:56,324
It's complicated.

308
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,316
Is it because of the rumor?

309
00:17:58,316 --> 00:18:00,829
None of that is true though.

310
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,281
I don't know. It's part of the contract terms.

311
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:06,195
Gosh. What do we do?

312
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:08,447
We need to straighten this out before it gets worse.

313
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:12,290
If we don't take any actions against it, it will be considered true,

314
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,942
just like Oppa Eun Woo's case.

315
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:15,904
What should we do?

316
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:20,188
But... Don't you sense something strange?

317
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:23,172
Ji Hun could have gained some popularity, but he's still just a high school student.

318
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:26,845
So it's just weird that so many malicious comments have been put up overnight.

319
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:31,349
You are right. It seems to have been done systematically.

320
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:33,422
And this photo...

321
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:36,826
Ji Hun would never do this. I don't know what happened.

322
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:39,698
It hasn't been photoshopped. I've looked into it.

323
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:47,035
I've seen this photo somewhere before.

324
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,532
Wait, isn't this...

325
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:01,811
That's what it was!

326
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:04,392
They cut it out from the original photo.

327
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:09,368
Which means that all the other photos were...

328
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:11,239
  God Ji Hun

329
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:17,326
But who would do something like this?

330
00:19:17,326 --> 00:19:19,417
The person who uploaded the photo first

331
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,860
is the worst one.

332
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,012
But this person acts so dumb.

333
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:25,414
  I knew this was coming

334
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,256
  He is trash known for leeching off of girls

335
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:30,719
  He has so many messy relationships with girls

336
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:34,303
What can we do?

337
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:37,836
We need to write an explanation first.

338
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:41,129
Gather all the malicious comments, and then find out who wrote them.

339
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:43,131
This could be taken to court.

340
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,140
Why is she so surprised to see us?

341
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,582
She's acting as if she stole something.

342
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,346
  Computer Room 2

343
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,692
You know that girl who just walked out? Where was she sitting?

344
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,724
I think she was sitting over there.

345
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,403
- What is it? 
 - Hold on a minute.

346
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:17,475
  Computer Usage

347
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,433
I think she's the one that's been putting up the malicious comments.

348
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,400

349
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,575
Mo Nan Hui, it's you, isn't it?

350
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:41,200
- What? 
 - You spread rumors about Ji Hun.

351
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,192
How could you do this to Ji Hun? You used to like him.

352
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:48,656
Do you have proof? You can't even prove that it was me.

353
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:52,211
I have screenshots of everything you wrote.

354
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,743
I can report you even just with these.

355
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:57,956
So hurry and write an explanation for what you did and apologize to Ji Hun.

356
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,368
What if I don't want to?

357
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:02,420
- What? 
 - Report me? Go ahead and do it.

358
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,233
Let's see who will end up suffering more loss.

359
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,444
  Will you proceed with Revenge Note?

360
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:17,696
  Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

361
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,078
  Enter target's name

362
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:27,235
 Next up is the issue on teen stars' personalities.

363
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:30,499
- Gu Hui, come. Ji Hun is on the news. 
  - Park So Young reports.

364
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,402
  Controversy continues on teen star's personality issues.

365
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:36,805
  Recently, a school uniform model Mr. Sin, known to be an exemplary student,

366
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:41,790
  had photos of him exposing him drinking and smoking.

367
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,312
  What kind of a student is he?

368
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,265
  I knew this would happen someday.

369
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,967
  The teachers look out for him because he performs well in school,

370
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:52,610
  but in reality, he is a different person. He picks on a lot of students.

371
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:56,345
  My face is being blurred out, right?

372
00:21:56,345 --> 00:22:00,279
Gosh. People who watch this news will think that Ji Hun is a total jerk.

373
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,121
But everything's a lie. Are they allowed to do that?

374
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,504
Well, they didn't reveal his name.

375
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,778
Who's the girl that did the interview?

376
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:12,010
Is she an anti-fan of Ji Hun?

377
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:15,544
I can't believe this.

378
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:26,725
  Mo Nan Hui

379
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,256
  We will proceed with the revenge

380
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,392
 It's done! How do I look?

381
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:46,145
  I only did one side of my face so you can see the difference.

382
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:47,605
  Which side is prettier?

383
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:48,957
  It's pretty on both sides

384
00:22:48,957 --> 00:22:50,558
  I want to be good at makeup, too

385
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:52,590
  Excuse me for a minute.

386
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:57,256
  You have been selected as a revenge target

387
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,140
  Your misfortune will continue until the revenge is complete.

388
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,680
  Message

389
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:09,727
  She looks amazing without makeup. What lipstick are you using?

390
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:12,661
  I hope to see you again on the television show next time.

391
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:14,753
 I ask for your continued support,

392
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:17,827
 and be sure to leave comments on what makeup you would like to see me do next.

393
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:19,297
  So long!

394
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,349
  Your face made up for everything 
Queen Nan Hui's Amazing Makeup

395
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,230
Yes.

396
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,884
They want to report me.

397
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:49,627
I think they found out that the photo was fabricated, too.

398
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:51,419
The revenge note is

399
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,713
also getting on my nerves. Do you think I'll be okay?

400
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:57,485
You blurred me out on the news, right?

401
00:23:57,485 --> 00:24:00,497
Don't worry. I won't say a word about it.

402
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,370
  It's not the Nan Hui I knew

403
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,122
  She was acting as if she didn't have any makeup on.

404
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:16,875
  I regret seeing her without makeup. Where are your eyebrows?

405
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,741
  Look at her face without makeup

406
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:24,472
  It's fraud

407
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:26,054
  I feel betrayed

408
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:27,676
  I'm so disappointed

409
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,328
 Your revenge is complete

410
00:25:03,091 --> 00:25:04,673
You deserved it.

411
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:13,131
  Can you come out to the park now?

412
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:24,983
Are you all right?

413
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,845
Yes.

414
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:28,536
The culprit's been caught,

415
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:30,688
and because of the explanations you all wrote,

416
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:34,142
everyone knows what actually happened. Thank you.

417
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:38,067
I didn't do much. It was all Gang Min.

418
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:39,968
I almost forgot.

419
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:42,801
Happy birthday.

420
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:46,255
- You knew? 
 - Of course, I did.

421
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:48,176
I'm glad it's not too late.

422
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,548
- Go ahead and open it. 
 - Okay.

423
00:26:00,189 --> 00:26:01,799
Oh.

424
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,034
- This... 
 - You liked it, right?

425
00:26:05,034 --> 00:26:06,724
H-How did you know?

426
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:08,716
Your face tells it all.

427
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:11,980
I just didn't have enough money then.

428
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:17,436
Is this why you worked as a model?

429
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:20,399
Yes, but I won't do it anymore.

430
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:23,092
You must feel disappointed. You were really good at it.

431
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:25,883
Once is enough for me.

432
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:28,646
I'm already tired of it.

433
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,222
Ji Hun.

434
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:36,994
Will you...

435
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:39,837
put this on for me?

436
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,618
There you go.

437
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:06,634
- How do I look? 
 - You look beautiful.

438
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:27,105
  Oh, no. I don't know what to do!

439
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:31,119
  Did I brush my teeth? I can't remember.

440
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:47,925
  Ho Gu Hui, are you at the park? What are you doing there?

441
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:50,589
  Why aren't you picking up the phone? Answer me.

442
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:53,361
  Dad and I are going to come and get you.

443
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:55,634
Hold on just a second.

444
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:58,247
  What do you want? I am with my friends.

445
00:27:58,247 --> 00:28:02,130
  Friends? Aren't you with your boyfriend?

446
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,672
  You better come home right now.

447
00:28:04,672 --> 00:28:07,275
  Give me a break. Let it slide, just this once.

448
00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:08,647
  I don't care.

449
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,750
  If you don't come home in ten minutes, I'm going after you with Dad.

450
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,891
  How can you expect me to be there in just ten minutes?

451
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:16,494
  Why are you doing this to me?

452
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,657
  Enough is enough. I'm counting down now.

453
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:21,230
  One, two, three...

454
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,061
  Why do you have to do this on a day like today?

455
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,924
Is it your oppa?

456
00:28:25,924 --> 00:28:27,515
What did he say?

457
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:30,618
Well...

458
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:34,952
My dad is looking for me.

459
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:36,804
I'm sorry. I think I have to go.

460
00:28:36,804 --> 00:28:39,177
Okay. You can go ahead.

461
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:40,689
Well,

462
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:43,711
it's probably nothing though. Should I just stay?

463
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:47,586
But your dad is looking for you. I'll walk you home.

464
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:51,279
That's right. I should go back.

465
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,661
Let's go.

466
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:54,281
Okay.

467
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,520

468
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:19,847
Go on in now.

469
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:23,921
It's okay. You can go first.

470
00:29:25,684 --> 00:29:27,425
All right, then.

471
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:40,708
I'm leaving for real now, okay?

472
00:30:25,162 --> 00:30:28,486
I was just about to go after you.

473
00:30:28,486 --> 00:30:29,958
How did you know?

474
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,520
- Know what? 
 - How did you know where I was?

475
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,543
Are you a stalker? Are you watching me?

476
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:38,846
♪  Happy birthday to you ♪

477
00:30:38,846 --> 00:30:43,000

480
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,463
What is this? You knew about it?

481
00:30:55,463 --> 00:30:58,195
Of course. It's our girl's birthday.

482
00:30:58,195 --> 00:31:01,058
What's the use? Now, that she has a boyfriend—

483
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:02,599
What?

484
00:31:04,032 --> 00:31:05,813
Goodness.

485
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:08,526
- Come, blow this out. 
 - Come on.

486
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:10,407
Ready?

487
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,151
Yes!

488
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:14,833
Well done. That's my girl.

489
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,545
Here you go. Happy birthday.

490
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:18,135
You got me a present?

491
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:19,838
Of course!

492
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:21,469
Our beloved daughter, happy birthday!

493
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:23,011
Thank you.

494
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:25,523
Stop eating. Look at the size of that tummy!

495
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:27,606
  I'm 17 years old.

496
00:31:27,606 --> 00:31:30,648
  I think this will be one of the most memorable birthdays

497
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:32,270
  of my life.

498
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:36,093
Ji Hun, I'm so happy right now!

499
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:38,455
Are you happy, too?

500
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:08,787
  Revenge Note

501
00:32:08,787 --> 00:32:11,109
  If you bother her, I won't hold back anymore.

502
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:14,131
  She has such a gentle face but she is a gamecock.

503
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:15,894
  Ji Hun's at the police station!

504
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,735
  I suppose this is the end of God Ji Hun.

505
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,317
  That's a load of bullshit.

506
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:20,778
  I can take care of Ji Hun's problem.

507
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:22,099
  Break up with Ji Hun.

508
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,912
  Where is my phone?

509
00:32:23,912 --> 00:32:26,374
  I can't afford to lose it right now.

510
00:32:28,536 --> 00:32:30,538
