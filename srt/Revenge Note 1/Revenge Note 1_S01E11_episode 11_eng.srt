 Final Episode

10
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:35,545
Ji Hun!

11
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:37,797
What happened?

12
00:00:37,797 --> 00:00:40,030
- Are you all right? 
- What happened?

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,951
We have been presented with a case of assault.

14
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:43,733
What?

15
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:56,266
 I have to see him in secret because you always misunderstand me!

16
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:59,149
 - Excuse me!  
 -  Please help me!

17
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,491
 Are you all right?

18
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:02,733
-  Who are you? 
- Let's talk this out.

19
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:05,514
 Move. Move out of the way.

20
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:12,601
 You hit me.

21
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:15,145
 Oh no!

22
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:16,747
 Honey, are you all right?

23
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:20,591
 Why are you doing this to me? I already said I was sorry.

24
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:23,924
 How can you do this to my honey? He didn't deserve this.

25
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:26,886
 Let me see. Oh no! His face got scraped.

26
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,258
 It got scraped. What do we do?

27
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:33,604
What's going to happen to our son?

28
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:35,665
Well, you see...

29
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:39,610
Does it hurt a lot? How is it?

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,902
He hit me so hard. I feel like my head is about to explode.

31
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,904
I might have to be hospitalized.

32
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,737
Let's go to the hospital right away.

33
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:51,150
- Can we leave now? 
- Yes, you may go.

34
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:54,824
Oh no.

35
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,536
Be careful.

36
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:10,080
I never even touched him.

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,092
He is the one who hit himself.

38
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:15,936
He said he didn't even touch him. There must have been a misunderstanding.

39
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,749
That's right. Our son would never do such a thing.

40
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:21,852
He hasn't had a single fight with his friends until now.

41
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:25,696
That's what all parents say, but I think he has made a mistake.

42
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:28,448
What has Ji Hun done?

43
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,601
Is it wrong trying to help someone?

44
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,242
This kind of thing happens sometimes.

45
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:34,033
He got hurt,

46
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:36,116
and the woman's testimony is different from what your son said.

47
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:39,969
In this case, there were no security cameras or other eyewitnesses.

48
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:42,291
Don't make this case bigger than it is. Just settle this with the victim.

49
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,993
Otherwise this will only hurt the student.

50
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,842
 Ji Hun, where are you?

51
00:02:58,187 --> 00:03:01,751
Gang Min, where is Ji Hun? Why is he absent?

52
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,963
I didn't get a call from him either.

53
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:06,496
Do you know? You were with him yesterday.

54
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:10,991
He was fine. Maybe something came up.

55
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,303
Guys, Ji Hun is at the police station!

56
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:14,363
- What? 
- What?

57
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:16,314
I heard from Yu Ra...

58
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:19,228
- Ji Hun? 
- What?

59
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,411
- What happened? 
- What's going on?

60
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,543
So what happened to the guy?

61
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:26,046
I heard he was hospitalized. He has a concussion.

62
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:28,919
Really? Then what will happen to Ji Hun?

63
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,770
Well, I suppose this is the end of God Ji Hun.

64
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:37,517
What do you mean? Why is Ji Hun at the police station?

65
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,379
He is probably out by now.

66
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,892
He picked a fight with a couple on the street,

67
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:44,784
and apparently beat up the guy.

68
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:46,986
That's a lie. How would you know?

69
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:48,898
My family has a lot of connections.

70
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:50,900
The advertising company is in trouble too.

71
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,593
They're going to withdraw Ji Hun's commercial.

72
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:58,497
Ji Hun is going to have to pay full compensation for it.

73
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:03,522
It's going to cost him a fortune. Is his family rich?

74
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:05,946
That's a load of bullshit.

75
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,058
Let's go. We don't need to hear any more of this.

76
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,465
Well... we'll see

77
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:17,816
who's right.

78
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:20,060
Do you think that story about Ji Hun is real?

79
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,392
Are you stupid? He may be a whiner, but he would never do something like that.

80
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:26,725
Ji Hun is absent, so there has to be some truth to what they're saying.

81
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,727
Girls, take a look at this.

82
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,649
Omo! It's true.

83
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,152
There's an article!

84
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:37,097
"School uniform model Mr. A sued for assault."

85
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:41,370
"Suspect of midnight assault is high school model Mr. A."

86
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,264
"Victim Mr. B adamantly refuses to come to an agreement."

87
00:04:45,264 --> 00:04:47,877
 - Oh, really!  
-  What do we do?

88
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:49,568
 What's going to happen to Ji Hun?

89
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:52,342
- Oh no. 
  - Do you think he did something wrong?

90
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:54,733
 Look. What's this?

91
00:04:58,387 --> 00:04:59,889
 It's unbelievable.

92
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,640
 How could this happen?

93
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,262
 But it looks like it really happened.

94
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:19,558
What happened? Why didn't you answer our calls?

95
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,643
I'm sorry. I've been a bit overwhelmed.

96
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:28,357
What happened? What's with the articles?

97
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:30,199
Actually...

98
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,293
That's crazy! Aren't they scammers?

99
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,674
Then what happens now?

100
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:39,328
We can either settle it, or take it to court.

101
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:43,102
Then are you just going to settle? You did nothing wrong.

102
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:47,086
We can't even settle. My parents went to the hospital,

103
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:48,978
but they refused to even see them.

104
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:51,440
They're scammers for sure.

105
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,594
I don't know.

106
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:58,107
Even if they are, there is no evidence.

107
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:04,064
But don't you think something's fishy here?

108
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,624
What? What's fishy?

109
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:08,247
If they are scammers, they should ask for money.

110
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:13,582
But they're refusing contact and they're hanging on Ji Hun.

111
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,225
That's true.

112
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:19,638
Maybe they're after you and not after money.

113
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,670
Does anything come to your mind?

114
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:24,234
 Sin Ji Hun!

115
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:27,146
 I will make you kneel down in front of me!

116
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:30,899
 I swear I will see you cry like a baby in front of me!

117
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,632
It's here.

118
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:46,226
No, wait! This is too much.

119
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:48,918
We're only high schoolers. What can we possibly say to them?

120
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,471
We should at least try to beg them. We can't just sit and watch.

121
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:56,675
- Well... 
- Who are you?

122
00:06:56,675 --> 00:07:01,290
We are here because of Ji Hun, the student that tried to help you.

123
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:07,136
What do you mean, he tried to help? He totally wasted a man.

124
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,018
Who are you? Are you his girlfriend?

125
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:11,381
You're being rude at our first meeting.

126
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:13,812
Ji Hun did nothing wrong in the first place.

127
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:16,926
I heard the ajeossi is the one who hit himself around here and there.

128
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:20,499
Is that what he told you? That's a bunch of nonsense.

129
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:22,031
Do you want to end up in jail too?

130
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:24,473
No, we're just hoping that if there is any misunderstanding,

131
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:25,754
we could make it right.

132
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:29,658
That's enough. I have nothing more to say to rude girls like you.

133
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,851
Tell your friend to brace himself.

134
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,323
We'll make sure he ends up in jail.

135
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:38,096
Get out of my way.

136
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:53,852
Maybe we shouldn't have come. I think they're angrier now.

137
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:56,065
What do we do?

138
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:59,649
I got so mad earlier. I'm sorry.

139
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,993
But I sense something strange about that girl.

140
00:08:03,993 --> 00:08:06,725
My intuition reacted when I saw her.

141
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:10,900
Insisting on putting Ji Hun in jail

142
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,753
definitely seems strange. I should look into it.

143
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,235
 Go So Mi

144
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:18,777
Like you said, something is fishy.

145
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,609
Take a look at this.

146
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:30,610
 Go So Mi 
 Gorae

147
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,253
- Do you see it? 
- What about it?

148
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:34,474
That is...

149
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,376
It says  Gorae . Yu Ra's family owns the company.

150
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:38,547
Gosh. I knew it!

151
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:40,719
Even Ji Hun said that Yu Ra came to his mind.

152
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,384
Nan Hui is also Yu Ra's follower. Yu Ra must be behind all this.

153
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,475
Do you think this might be because Ji Hun refused to go out with her?

154
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,687
For sure. She's completely insane.

155
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:52,130
I'm 100 percent certain, but we have no proof.

156
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,916
Hello.

157
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:02,171
Oppa, how have you been?

158
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:03,922
Good.

159
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:05,804
What are you guys watching?

160
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:08,707
We're trying to figure out something for our friend.

161
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:12,042
Do you want to see something cool?

162
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,022
What?

163
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,876
Look at this.

164
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:20,049
Here.

165
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:25,484
Cool technique, right?

166
00:09:25,484 --> 00:09:28,928
There were celebrities who had affairs exposed this way.

167
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:32,121
 Press the Button

168
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:48,396
Here is the magazine you asked for.

169
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,043
Can't you see that I'm busy?

170
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:55,394
Leave it there.

171
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,146
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:58,667
Hey.

173
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,149
Bring me some water.

174
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,941
- Quickly. 
- Yes, ma'am.

175
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:05,134
Yu Ra.

176
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:06,905
Yes?

177
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:11,140
What is it this time? You even made a company employee do the job.

178
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,432
Don't ask. Something just came up.

179
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:18,378
Who in the world could have

180
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:21,111
irritated our dear princess?

181
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:23,072
Whoever it is will need to get a piece of my mind.

182
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,214
That's what I'm saying.

183
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:31,641
So all of this happened because of Yu Ra?

184
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:33,792
Yes.

185
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:35,325
That's why my dad's company...

186
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:38,397
Why? Did something else happen?

187
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:41,960
 What do you mean?

188
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,693
 We've prepared all the supplies because you asked us to hurry,

189
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:46,636
 and now you're canceling it?

190
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:50,449
 Don't you know that if you cancel this, it will ruin us?

191
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,571
 Director Jo!

192
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:54,462
 Director Jo!

193
00:10:57,367 --> 00:11:01,051
 My dad supplied Yu Ra's company,

194
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:03,472
 but all this happened because of me.

195
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:07,977
It's not because of you. It's because of Yu Ra.

196
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:11,230
Eat first. Eat and cheer up.

197
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,881
Here.

198
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,012
 Hang in there, Ji Hun.

199
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:36,935
 We have the Revenge Note.

200
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:50,689
 Let's meet up tomorrow, it's about Ji Hun.

201
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,729
You're here early.

202
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,274
What do you want to tell me?

203
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:11,090
How is Ji Hun these days? He's having a hard time, right?

204
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,842
Yes, thanks to you.

205
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:17,155
Do you want me to help him?

206
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:20,358
I can take care of Ji Hun's problem.

207
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:21,931
You want to help after giving him the problem?

208
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:24,273
But with a condition.

209
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:27,905
You need to break up with Ji Hun.

210
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,633
If I break up with Ji Hun, is he going to go out with you?

211
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:37,565
- Maybe— 
- That will never happen.

212
00:12:45,143 --> 00:12:47,507
If you bother her, I won't hold back anymore.

213
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:50,999
It looks like you're really stupid, so I'll say this one more time.

214
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,442
I'm disgusted dealing with you.

215
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:58,176
Act familiar with me one more time, and you're dead.

216
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:03,352
Hey!

217
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,094
Stop right there. Sin Ji Hun!

218
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:07,004
Sin Ji Hun!

219
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,844
But... how did you know I was there?

220
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:59,498
Ga Eun told me that Yu Ra was bothering you.

221
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,903
You irritated her even more now. What are we going to do—

222
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:16,565
It's all right.

223
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:24,061
I'll do the worrying. Just think of happy things, okay?

224
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:37,045
Where's my phone?

225
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:40,698
I can't afford to lose it at this moment!

226
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,931
Oh no!

227
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:47,686
Don't worry, princess.

228
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,088
Yes, everything is being prepared.

229
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:54,462
We will have it ready as soon as possible. See you soon.

230
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:57,607
I can't put up with this any longer.

231
00:14:57,607 --> 00:15:00,429
How long am I going to live like this?

232
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:01,660
My goodness.

233
00:15:03,242 --> 00:15:05,363
Thanks.

234
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:11,329
Ji Hun said that he'll take care of everything.

235
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:13,953
What if he ends up taking the blame?

236
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:17,075
No way. Let's not worry in advance.

237
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:21,749
You left this earlier.

238
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,203
Thank you.

239
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:30,108
I accidentally dropped it in water though.

240
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:32,571
I'm so sorry.

241
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,732
Oh no. The Revenge Note has to work!

242
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:54,900

243
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,047
Are you sick?

244
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:00,169
My phone...

245
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:02,891
My cell phone...

246
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:05,283
Why? Is it broken?

247
00:16:05,283 --> 00:16:08,027
Is that why you're like this?

248
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:10,419
Oppa, can you fix this for me?

249
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:13,082
You're good at this. Please fix it for me.

250
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:16,754
Finally, you're recognizing my skills. Let me see it.

251
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,546
Hey! I told you to wait in the front.

252
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:40,148
Don't you know how much I hate to wait?

253
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:42,070
This is a no-parking zone.

254
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,673
Oh my god! So now you're trying lecture me?

255
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:47,516
Then why is it that a smart man like you

256
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:51,100
has to drive me around in a car?

257
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,291
Don't you ever do this again, do you hear?

258
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:17,095
Hi, there.

259
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:22,991
Hello. You are Yu Ra's...

260
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:27,366
What happened to your face? Are you all right?

261
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:29,167
I'm all right.

262
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,642
I have to give this to Ji Hun,

263
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:35,143
but I don't know where to find him.

264
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,027
What is this?

265
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:40,398
It's the dash cam footage from this car.

266
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:43,612
This will help Ji Hun get cleared of his false charge.

267
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:47,135
Really?

268
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:51,040
But if you give this to me, what will happen to you?

269
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,082
Han Yu Ra will be furious.

270
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:54,813
It doesn't matter.

271
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:59,148
They know they're guilty. Whatever happens, happens.

272
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:01,629
If they try to harm us, we're all going down together.

273
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:07,907
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have done those things.

274
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:10,368
Money's always the problem.

275
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:15,955
Thank you.

276
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:17,745
Don't mention it.

277
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:35,604
 Driver, wait outside.

278
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:37,386
 All right.

279
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:40,629
 Make sure you don't get caught.

280
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:43,461
 Don't worry.I was a prospective actress, you know.

281
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:46,946
 Even if you get caught, you know I have nothing to do with this.

282
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:49,117
 Of course!

283
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:50,868
 Come on, honey.

284
00:18:55,724 --> 00:18:59,127
 As soon as my dad showed them this, they backed down.

285
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:01,100
 They dropped the charges.

286
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,232
Isn't it their turn to be punished now?

287
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,205
Sure thing.

288
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:09,948
It serves them right. Let them suffer in jail.

289
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:15,614
Then what about Han Yu Ra? What will happen to her?

290
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,517
Nothing more can be done about Han Yu Ra.

291
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:20,908
They say they're lacking evidence.

292
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:28,327
We wouldn't have made it without the USB.

293
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:30,709
It's all thanks to you.

294
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:33,271
I didn't do anything.

295
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:34,872
Aigoo!

296
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,057
Thanks.

297
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,140
Do you mean it?

298
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:45,844
Here. Drink this too.

299
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:22,881
Here.

300
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,021
Delivery!

301
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,918
Leave it there.

302
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:04,774
Ten half-and-half sets, right?

303
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:08,116
It's 170,000 won  (≈ $150) , you can pay...

304
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:09,498
in cash.

305
00:21:09,498 --> 00:21:11,889
Here.

306
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:13,771
Keep the change.

307
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,091
Here.

308
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:27,435
If you gather ten coupons,

309
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:31,930
you can get one for free later. Enjoy your meal.

310
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,912
Wait.

311
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,863
It smells so oily.

312
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:49,518
That's why this chicken is so cheap.

313
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:54,471
Do you want us to eat this?

314
00:21:57,615 --> 00:21:59,698
I eat it every day.

315
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:02,210
My dad's chicken is the best.

316
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,933
You haven't even tried it.

317
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:06,815
Really?

318
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:08,886
Then,

319
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,490
why don't you eat it?

320
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,033
Guys, make sure you study hard.

321
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:19,307
You don't want to become a chicken delivery girl like her.

322
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:52,921
You little brat!

323
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:54,944
Are you all right?

324
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:56,795
You're dead!

325
00:22:56,795 --> 00:22:58,837
You think my mom will let you get away with this?

326
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,178
You!

327
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,901
Stop!

328
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:05,064
Let go!

329
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:07,155
Apologize to my dad!

330
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:12,521
You need to apologize to my dad!

331
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:20,609
You have such a gentle face, but you're a fighting cock.

332
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:24,392
Look at your face. It must hurt.

333
00:23:24,392 --> 00:23:27,765
My face is nothing compared to hers.

334
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:30,358
About now, Han Yu Ra must be—

335
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,232
Fess up.

336
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:36,154
Who made my daughter's face like this?

337
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:37,655
Who is it?

338
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:40,028
Is it you? You?

339
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:41,380
- Mom. 
- Yes.

340
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,591
It's her.

341
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:50,889
Let go. What is this?

342
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,480
What's between these two?

343
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,294
Are you joking? You're still kids.

344
00:23:55,294 --> 00:23:57,475
I said, let go. Let go!

345
00:23:57,475 --> 00:24:00,009
Hey, do you think I'll just let you go?

346
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:02,361
- I won't let you get away with this. - My gosh!

347
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:04,202
- Ma'am! 
- Let me go!

348
00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:06,475
- Please, calm down! 
- Who are you?

349
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:09,018
You shouldn't do this at school.

350
00:24:09,018 --> 00:24:11,060
- Are you the homeroom teacher? 
- Yes.

351
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,611
- You don't even look like a teacher. 
- Pardon?

352
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:16,114
Expel her right now.

353
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:18,907
- Well— 
- If you don't,

354
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:22,321
I'll talk to the minister of education and fire you first!

355
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:24,162
Ma'am!

356
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,644
This is so annoying!

357
00:24:25,644 --> 00:24:29,178
I'm doing the best I can, ma'am.

358
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,700
There's no more need for words.

359
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,800
You need to expel her right now.

360
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:38,987
Ma'am, we need to understand the situation entirely before—

361
00:24:38,987 --> 00:24:40,859
Just look at her face.

362
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:43,821
Do you expect me to be sane after looking at this?

363
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:46,995
Look at Gu Hui's face. She also got hurt a lot.

364
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:49,347
She attacked me first.

365
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:52,730
I was only standing still when she suddenly attacked me

366
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,923
like a mad girl.

367
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:59,587
Ask Bong Hui and Sang Eun.

368
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:03,551
Mom, I was so frightened.

369
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,824
She's saying she was frightened!

370
00:25:05,824 --> 00:25:09,566
Teacher Jeong, I have something to show you.

371
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:17,355
 Why don't you eat it?

372
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:19,757
 Guys, make sure you study hard.

373
00:25:19,757 --> 00:25:23,920
 You don't want to become a chicken delivery girl like her.

374
00:25:44,592 --> 00:25:46,365
 Let go!

375
00:25:46,365 --> 00:25:49,066
 Apologize to my dad!

376
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:54,641
Gu Hui was right.

377
00:25:58,687 --> 00:26:00,418
So what?

378
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:02,610
Did Yu Ra say something wrong?

379
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,901
It's true.

380
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:06,095
You're just a chicken delivery girl! Why are you so cocky?

381
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:08,277
Watch your mouth.

382
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:11,029
How dare you say such a thing to my beloved daughter?

383
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:14,533
You delusional ****! What do you think you're doing?

384
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,375
What? How dare you insult me like that!

385
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,987
- Hey! You better take that back. 
-  Hey?

386
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:20,749
- Take that back! 
- Gosh!

387
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:22,880
- There's nothing to take back. 
- I will just—

388
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,672
- Ma'am! 
- Fine! Let's put this to an end.

389
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:27,756
Let's get this over with!

390
00:26:27,756 --> 00:26:29,197
How dare you!

391
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:30,719
You crazy little...

392
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,480
Let go!

393
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:34,983
- Let go! 
- You....

394
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:36,014
Hey!

395
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:39,728
It hurts!

396
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,020
You know, I used to be called

397
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,153
the Tiger Moth of Dobong-dong. Know who you're messing with!

398
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:46,444
Hey!

399
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:47,486
You...

400
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:50,868
You just wait and see. I'm not going to walk away from this!

401
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:52,571
Let's go. Listen!

402
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:55,163
I'm going to put you all in jail. Do you hear?

403
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:58,876
Aigoo! I've never seen such an awful woman in my life!

404
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:02,269
My gosh! I could have killed her!

405
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,455
Goodness me.

406
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:10,138
She's here!

407
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:11,639
She's getting out.

408
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:13,431
Excuse me.

409
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,333
- Please say something. 
- Don't take pictures.

410
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,765
Please get out of the way.

411
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:19,377
Stop it!

412
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:21,520
Don't take pictures! Stop it!

413
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,052
Don't take pictures!

414
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:26,764
I said, don't take pictures!

415
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:33,282
Chairman Choi Young Sil of Gorae Corporation

416
00:27:33,282 --> 00:27:37,616
has been accused of physically and verbally assaulting her driver.

417
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,578
There has been controversy over the abuse of power.

418
00:27:39,578 --> 00:27:42,791
Aigoo... It serves her right.

419
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:46,953
She threatened us with jail, but it looks like she'll be put in jail instead.

420
00:27:46,953 --> 00:27:50,479
She's probably still recovering from your blows.

421
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:52,591
Dad, I have to say Mom was

422
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:55,133
incredibly awesome.

423
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,764
Of course, I know.

424
00:27:56,764 --> 00:27:59,267
The Tiger Moth of Dobong-dong wouldn't change so easily.

425
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:01,690
She had made up her mind to get killed.

426
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,141
Gosh.

427
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:05,294
That's my mom.

428
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:08,526
- You're so amazing. 
- Come on.

429
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,649
I should have just...

430
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,571
- You should've knocked her out. - That little...

431
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:16,464
Just like that!

432
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,593
Here you go.

433
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:30,088
I really worked hard to fix this. You better not drop it again.

434
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:32,049
Awesome. You're the best!

435
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:45,334
 Revenge Note

436
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:47,635
 What am I going to do?

437
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,392
 Can I make it without Revenge Note?

438
00:28:56,324 --> 00:28:57,995
  Would you like to leave Revenge Note?

439
00:28:57,995 --> 00:28:59,698
 Pressing the link below will delete your account.

440
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,771
 That's right.

441
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:06,264
 I might not need this anymore.

442
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,588
  Your account has been deleted.

443
00:29:10,588 --> 00:29:13,010
 I should put this to an end.

444
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,819
  Thank you for watching Revenge Note.

445
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:33,882
So long, Revenge Note.

446
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:35,993
Thank you.

447
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:45,623
 Who could be the Revenge Note Master?

448
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:55,173

449
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:17,754
I've been curious about this for a while.

450
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:20,489
Can I ask you?

451
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:21,979
What is it?

452
00:30:26,495 --> 00:30:28,515
Why do you like me?

453
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:32,369
Did you like me since you first saw me?

454
00:30:35,423 --> 00:30:37,455
Do you really want to know?

455
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:42,210
You might not like this.

456
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:47,376
You look like Min Ah.

457
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:49,357
 Who is that?

458
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:51,058
Min Ah?

459
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,702
 Is it his first love?

460
00:30:54,702 --> 00:30:57,716
Who is Min Ah?

461
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:59,646
Do you want to see her?

462
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:22,710
I thought of her when I first saw you.

463
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:27,044
The way you are so cute, the way you eat,

464
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,986
and the way you fart like her.

465
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:38,356
I thought of Min Ah when I first saw you,

466
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:41,019
but now Min Ah reminds me of you.

467
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,210
It's weird, right?

468
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:57,414
Min Ah and I kiss every day...

469
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:03,000
and we sleep together every day.

470
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:08,847
What a lucky dog.

471
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:10,488
What?

472
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,471
I envy that dog.

473
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:23,460

474
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:26,124
You need to study.

475
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:28,135
No, you need to study.

476
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,712
