00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,300
  Do you like me?

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,400
  If I drink this, does it mean we're a couple?

11
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:08,817
  That's how my first love began.

12
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:11,481
  It was our first day as a couple.

13
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,155
  Gi Jeong Wu. Ho Gu Hui's first love.

14
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,288
  You know it's our 100-day anniversary, right?

15
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:20,810
  - What is it? 
 - It's a present. They're paper cranes.

16
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,441
  It's already been a 100 days?

17
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,913
  Wait. There's more.

18
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:29,258
  I've been so busy with exams that I forgot.

19
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:34,614
  I wanted these. How did you know?

20
00:01:34,614 --> 00:01:37,025
  I saw it on your Instagram.

21
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:39,289
  - Do they fit well? 
 - They fit perfectly.

22
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,972
  Really? By the way,

23
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:44,463
  they say if you give someone shoes, they'll run away.

24
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:46,985
  You can't wear them and run away, okay?

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
  Awesome.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,832
  They look nice.

27
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:59,318
  It would be nice if we could go to the same high school.

28
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:01,931
  - It's too bad. 
 - No, not really.

29
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:04,754
  You can't betray me now that we're going to different high schools.

30
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:06,616
  What are you talking about?

31
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,081
  This is our last day here.

32
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:13,583
  We should take a picture together.

33
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:16,906
  Come here. Let's take a picture.

34
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:18,999
  They're taking a picture.

35
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,060
  - Me too. 
 - Let's take it.

36
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:27,657
  I'll count to three.

37
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:30,029
  One, two, three.

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,492
  Even then,

39
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:34,373
  my first love at the age of 17 was

40
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:37,567
  as sweet as honey.

41
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:39,019
  Dinner is ready.

42
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:40,590
  Okay.

43
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,381
It's grilled croaker fish.

44
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:43,774
Here you go.

45
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:45,925
- Thank you. 
 - Stop.

46
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:47,776
Your oppa* eats first.
 ("older brother", for a female)

47
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:51,741
What is this? I like grilled croaker fish, too. You only think about Gu Jun.

48
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:54,785
I'm not favoring him over you. He's my retirement plan.

49
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:57,417
I'm sure the smarter child will give me more money.

50
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:00,771
  Gu Mi Seon. My mom, whose love for her son knows no bounds.

51
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,601
  She can do without her husband and daughter,

52
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:04,103
  but not without her son.

53
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:07,047
If you think it's unfair, raise your rank by 20 in high school.

54
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:09,849
Gosh, people are just...

55
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,062
- I was doing the recycling... 
 - You should go tend to the restaurant.

56
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:15,054
- People throw away garbage shamelessly— 
 - Aigoo!

57
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:16,706
We're going to get a lot of delivery calls soon.

58
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:18,909
Without me, the neighborhood would be a garbage heap.

59
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:21,580
Do you have to talk about garbage when we're trying to eat here?

60
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,413
  Ho Nam Hyeong. My dad,

61
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:26,506
  who always has my back, but has no power whatsoever.

62
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,169
  He is known to be good-natured. In other words, a pushover.

63
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,300
Gosh.

64
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,262
You should eat up and go help with the deliveries.

65
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:35,125
Why is it me again? What about Oppa?

66
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,596
With your bad grades, wouldn't you need to take over the restaurant?

67
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:39,710
If you don't want to, forget it.

68
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,350
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

69
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,863
Have some more.

70
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:44,925
  Ho Gu Jun, my oppa.

71
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,867
  A medical student at a prestigious college.

72
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:51,010
  He is my mother's pride and joy and my enemy.

73
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,694
  I, a 17-year-old pushover with absolutely no presence. I am

74
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:56,575
  Ho Gu Hui.

75
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,962
Are you sure Astro moved their dorms here?

76
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:07,025
Did someone order chicken?

77
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,010
Who ordered a half-and-half flavored chicken?

78
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,712
Excuse me. Sorry.

79
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,304
Who ordered chicken?

80
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:15,746
- Over here. 
 - Yes?

81
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,867
Okay.

82
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:20,819
That will be 17,000 won (≈ $15.00).

83
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,714
It's so hot.

84
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:26,824
- Just a moment. 
 - Oppa! They're here!

85
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,087
What's going on?

86
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,832
  You have insufficient funds.

87
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:05,013
  You have insufficient funds.

88
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:08,358
- Why isn't it working? 
 - Can you move aside?

89
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:09,988
All right.

90
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:19,158
  Please charge for two.

91
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,328
Thank you.

92
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:41,692
It's for me and him.

93
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,501
Thank you.

94
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,607
  He's wearing our school uniform.

95
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,362
  Kid, tag your card.

96
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:55,594
Yes, give me a moment.

97
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:57,808
  Whatever. Let's give it a try.

98
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,068
Excuse me.

99
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,710
Pardon me.

100
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,942
Excuse me.

101
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:08,527
I promise to pay you back next time.

102
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:11,529
Can you lend me your card just this once?

103
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:17,927
I don't want to.

104
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:22,491
- Hurry up and tag your card. 
 - Gosh, what's with her?

105
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,374
Let's hurry it up.

106
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:27,988
Don't be like that to a middle-schooler.

107
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,479
Ajussi*, could you... 
 (*Respectful way to call an older man)

108
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,243
Could you let me off this once?

109
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:35,065
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,717
I forgot to recharge my card.

111
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:40,278
Please charge for one student.

112
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:43,862
Can't we leave now?

113
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:50,519
  Why couldn't he lend it to me sooner? What a jerk.

114
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,833
  What kind of embarrassment is this on my first day of school?

115
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:04,934
  Welcome Freshmen of 2017

116
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:12,641
All right. I'm in high school now.

117
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,904
Hold your head up high.

118
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,553
Hey, middle schooler.

119
00:07:24,553 --> 00:07:26,374
Me?

120
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,271
What is a middle schooler doing here?

121
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:34,023
I'm a freshman...

122
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:43,242
Gosh. What did she wear to school?

123
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:46,825
I'm so sorry. I was so out of it this morning.

124
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,227
Why am I wearing this?

125
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:50,921
I've seen students forget to wear a tie,

126
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:53,411
but what is this middle school uniform?

127
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,026
I can't believe this.

128
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:58,756
She must have been nervous for her first day.

129
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,783
Let her off since she's a freshman.

130
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,095
Are you really a high school student?

131
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:07,307
Aren't you a middle school student?

132
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:10,540
No, I'm really not.

133
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,153
If you go to the auditorium, you'll find some hand-me-down uniforms.

134
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:16,346
Hurry and get changed.

135
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:19,419
Thank you.

136
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,511
  What a disaster. This is so embarrassing on my first day.

137
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:30,819
All right. That could have gone a lot worse.

138
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:36,006
Okay, get yourself together now.

139
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:38,407
You can do this, Ho Gu Hui.

140
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,883
  She got disqualified in the fourth round and won the fifth.

141
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:48,097
- Oh, my. 
 - Look who it is. It's Ho Gu Hui.

142
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:49,808
  Oh, my god.

143
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:52,101
Yeo Ga Eun. We went to the same middle school.

144
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,163
  She's more of an enemy than a friend.

145
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:55,914
We're in the same class again.

146
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:57,987
I hope we can get along.

147
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:01,490
Okay. Hi.

148
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,013
  - I wanted a fresh start. 
 - Where did you get your hair done?

149
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:07,626
  - My hair is just... 
 - Why do you have to be here?

150
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:10,260
  - Where should we go? 
 - Let's go to karaoke.

151
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,273
  Fine. It's my birthday today,  so it'll be my treat.

152
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:15,854
  You're so cool.

153
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,566
  - As expected from Ga Eun. 
 - How generous.

154
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,399
  Happy birthday. I made this for you.

155
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,302
  - Isn't this cute?
 - Thanks.

156
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:25,675
  You have to go home and work, don't you?

157
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,987
  - Let's go. 
 - Let's eat first.

158
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:30,410
  - Shall we eat first or karaoke? 
 - Hurry.

159
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,011
  - Let's eat first. 
 - Where should we go?

160
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,383
  - I'm so hungry. 
 - I'm hungry.

161
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:36,666
  I know a good place.

162
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:40,339
  Doesn't it smell like flowers?

163
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,423
  - Is that Promise? 
 - Yes.

164
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,726
  Ga Eun, did you bring the notebook you borrowed from me yesterday?

165
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,267
  I forgot.

166
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,773
  Without it, I'll get a zero on my performance assessment.

167
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:57,876
  It's not like I didn't bring it on purpose. You know,

168
00:09:57,876 --> 00:10:02,981
  I don't think it's going to make much difference for you anyway.

169
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:07,065
I...

170
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,740
Hi, I'm Ho Gu Hui.

171
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,372
Can I sit here?

172
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:15,684
Yes. I'm Jeong Deok Hui.

173
00:10:15,684 --> 00:10:17,506
Okay.

174
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,297
Are you his fan?

175
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:31,180
Yes. Call me Eun Woo's wife.

176
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,681
His wife?

177
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:34,412
Okay.

178
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:38,537
Are you a fan of Oppa Eun Woo, too?

179
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,481
No, it's not that. He comes to our restaurant a lot.

180
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:43,352
Really? Where is that?

181
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,735
Well, I even have his autograph.

182
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:48,317
What is important?

183
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:49,808
An autograph is important.

184
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:51,729
Nice to meet you, friend.

185
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,838
Oppa! Eun Woo!

186
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:02,502
This is really dear to me. Do you want one?

187
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:04,774
Let's be close friends.

188
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:07,446
  Jeong Deok Hui. Her nickname is Cannon Goddess.

189
00:11:07,446 --> 00:11:10,579
  Her future aspiration is to become Eun Woo's wife.

190
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,228
  - Oh, my. 
 - My goodness.

191
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,099
  - He's so handsome. 
 - Gosh.

192
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:23,562
He's the most handsome guy I've ever seen.

193
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:24,774
He's tall, too.

194
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:26,145
I can't believe it.

195
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,277
How dreamy.

196
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:29,879
Isn't he Sin Ji Hun?

197
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,010
- He's in our class. 
 - He's so handsome.

198
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,453
He's that jerk.

199
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,994
 I don't want to.

200
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,292
Deok Hui, are they famous or something?

201
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,122
Did you live under a rock?

202
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:46,625
Everyone in this neighborhood knows them.

203
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,257
  Sin Ji Hun from Baekjae Middle School.

204
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:51,129
  He's perfect and has it all, so he's known as "God Ji Hun".
("Sin", his surname, is a homonym with "god" in Korean)

205
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:52,822
  Next to him is his puppy, Lee Gang Min.

206
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:54,263
They're a famous duo.

207
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:57,275
I see.

208
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,692
  Jeong Jeong  Ah

209
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:15,184
I'll be your teacher for a year.

210
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:16,855
At Hanjong High School,

211
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:18,897
I'm known as the beautiful teacher.

212
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:20,730
I'm Jeong Jeong Ah.

213
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,553
All right. You are no longer in middle school.

214
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:24,913
You're in high school now.

215
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:27,896
It'll be the most important time of your lives.

216
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:31,129
As for me, I can forgive you for not getting good grades.

217
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:33,382
But bullying, betraying,

218
00:12:33,382 --> 00:12:36,305
bread shuttles, and other such behaviors will not be tolerated.

219
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:38,176
The student sitting next to you

220
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:40,669
may become your lifelong friend,

221
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:44,123
so help each other and get along. That is all.

222
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:45,934
Teacher, how old are you?

223
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:47,627
Me?

224
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:49,448
I'm as old as the morning sun.

225
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:51,361
Let's just say I'm old enough.

226
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:52,882
Oh, my.

227
00:12:52,882 --> 00:12:54,183
  Unbelievable.

228
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,765
  Let's not get discouraged.

229
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:59,747
 Again, you can do it, Ho Gu Hui.

230
00:13:04,374 --> 00:13:05,664
  Are they second-year students?

231
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:06,795
  They look so cool.

232
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:10,669
They're the most famous club in Hanjong High School, HIVA.

233
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:13,753
They're the kids of chaebols, judges, prosecutors, and national assemblymen.

234
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:17,555
To become global leaders or whatever, they take part in various activities.

235
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:21,630
  Han Yu Ra. The leader of Club HIVA and the queen of Hanjong High School.

236
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,681
  She's the daughter of a wealthy family.

237
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:29,087
  Yang Ah Jun. The vice president of Club HIVA

238
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:31,690
  and the son of a national assemblyman.

239
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,943
He was recently invited to take part in US efforts to help global refugees.

240
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:36,585
He was even on the news for it.

241
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:38,007
Our school has a program like that?

242
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,479
How could you know so little?

243
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,334
Hello, I'm first-year student Yeo Ga Eun.

244
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,995
And?

245
00:13:46,995 --> 00:13:49,488
I met you at the party last time.

246
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:51,999
How is your father?

247
00:13:57,346 --> 00:13:58,967
Heol! Do you know him?

248
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:01,489
No, I don't.

249
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,703
Of course. You shocked me for a second.

250
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:05,163
He's the vice president of HIVA,

251
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:08,377
so he's probably the most popular guy in his year.

252
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:10,859
I like doing volunteer work,

253
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:13,511
so please call me next time.

254
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:20,538
You must be Ji Hun.

255
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:26,405
I'll see you around.

256
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:36,345
My goodness. Even second-year students know you.

257
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:38,447
You're so famous.

258
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:41,371
Isn't she the girl we saw on the bus?

259
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:44,744
- Who? 
 - The one you rejected earlier.

260
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:46,844
  E-Excuse me.

261
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:51,800
  I promise to pay you back next time.

262
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,203
  Can you lend me your card just this once?

263
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:08,006
- She's ignoring me. 
 - Mind your own business.

264
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:10,268
Over here. Pass.

265
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:17,026
Why is everyone so crazy about Ji Hun?

266
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:19,117
He doesn't even look like a nice person.

267
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:20,660
Are you blind?

268
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,162
He's not as handsome as my Oppa Eun Woo,

269
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:25,543
but he's still the cream of the crop.

270
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:28,377
My boyfriend is a lot cuter.

271
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:30,890
What? You look like the type who's never dated.

272
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,030
You have a boyfriend?

273
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,496
Here.

274
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:40,969
You little vixen.

275
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:45,062
So you were dating a guy behind that unassuming face.

276
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:50,408
What are you doing after school? Are you free?

277
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,911
- Why? 
 - Well...

278
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:56,165
Can you do my duties for me? Something urgent came up.

279
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:59,408
- Can you, Gu Hui? 
  - Why should I do your duties?

280
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:01,780
 I don't want to do that anymore.

281
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,322
You'll do them, right?

282
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:05,133
Okay. Sure.

283
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:08,285
- I'm off then, Ho Gu Hui. 
 - All right.

284
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:12,861
This is the last time.

285
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,488
  Chicken

286
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:24,193
Enjoy.

287
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:27,706
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

288
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:28,997
Hi, Gu Hui.

289
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:31,790
  Cha Eun Woo. The leader of a popular boy band, Astro.

290
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,292
  He's the perfectly handsome best friend of Ho Gu Jun.

291
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,425
Long time no see.

292
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:37,816
- Oh, my. 
 - Hello.

293
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:41,090
Eun Woo, why has it been so long?

294
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,842
We moved close by, so I'll be able to come more often.

295
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:45,244
You did? Have a seat.

296
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:46,805
Eun Woo? Is Eun Woo here?

297
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,056
- Hello. 
 - I'll fry you some chicken.

298
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:49,538
Eun Woo,

299
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:51,309
can you sign some autographs before you go?

300
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:53,703
Kids love seeing your autograph on the wall.

301
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:56,314
I'll sign a hundred for you.

302
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:58,508
- Here, give this to Eun Woo. 
 - Okay.

303
00:16:58,508 --> 00:16:59,968
- Eat up. 
 - Here.

304
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:01,370
Here's your chicken.

305
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,251
Thank you.

306
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:08,016
Here are some drinks.

307
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:09,678
Thank you.

308
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,770
Oppa, you are so popular.

309
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,673
My classmate's aspiration is to become your wife.

310
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:16,595
So I was thinking...

311
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:19,127
Can I tell Deok Hui about you, Oppa?

312
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:20,539
No.

313
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,071
Right.

314
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:24,873
Of course, not.

315
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:29,498
To Deok Hui ♥

316
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:32,891
Here. How have you been these days?

317
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:35,714
She's busy. She's even dating.

318
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:37,236
She's dating?

319
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:39,217
You have a boyfriend?

320
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:41,800
Why hasn't Jeong Wu been coming?

321
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,802
Well...

322
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:45,614
I guess he's a bit busy.

323
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:47,096
Are you done with your promotions?

324
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:48,767
Yes.

325
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,730
I'm going to take a break and come see you every day.

326
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,899
  Oppa Eun Woo is so sweet.

327
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:02,942
  If it wasn't for that incident,

328
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:07,446
  he could have been my first love.

329
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:09,198
  It's clogged again.

330
00:18:09,198 --> 00:18:11,649
  It happens every time.

331
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,315
  - Hurry. 
 - What's wrong?

332
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:18,417
  Come on.

333
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,008
  Did you go in your pants?

334
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,532
  - When did you get here? 
 - Just now.

335
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:27,305
  Eun Woo,

336
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:29,628
  what's wrong?

337
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,992
  Gu Hui,

338
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:35,034
  I told you to take it easy with the poo.

339
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:38,077
 - Are you okay? 
 - The damage will last for a while.

340
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:40,690
  Don't be too harsh on Gu Hui.

341
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,420
  - Drink some water. 
 - I need water.

342
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,824
  That's how my first love ended

343
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,998
  before it could even begin.

344
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:57,596
  Jeong Wu, how was your first day of school?

345
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,197
He still hasn't read my message.

346
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,305
He changed his profile picture.

347
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:53,021
Jeong Wu...

348
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:10,768
  No, it can't be.

349
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:15,544
  Jeong Wu, that wasn't you, right?

350
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:34,764
Gosh.

351
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:39,017
Is my stomach reacting to stress again?

352
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,886
- Gosh. 
 - Oh, my.

353
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:50,547
Who farted on a full bus?

354
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:54,824
This is awful.

355
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:58,896
You should have gotten off before letting out a poop fart.

356
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:01,931
I'm sorry.

357
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:05,423
I have weak bowels, so I couldn't help it.

358
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:08,256
It was you? You don't look like it,

359
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:09,799
but your fart really stinks.

360
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,960
  Incredible. A guy looking like him let out a poop fart?

361
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,372
  Really? I can't believe it.

362
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:16,305
  What's going on?

363
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:18,296
  Did he fart, too?

364
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,411
  It's mine though.

365
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:25,004
  Did he

366
00:21:25,004 --> 00:21:27,646
  save me from the fart?

367
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:29,397
  Why?

368
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:38,467
  I noticed you looked like you had let out a foul one,

369
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:42,150
  so I, King Sin Ji Hun, very heroically

370
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,042
  took the fall for you.

371
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:48,417
  Thank you. I will never forget your kindness.

372
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:50,568
  Good.

373
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:53,022
  I want you to repeat what I say three times.

374
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:57,064
  I'm the one who farted on Bus 271.

375
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:02,141
  "I'm the one who farted

376
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,162
  - on Bus 271."   
 - Say it louder.

377
00:22:04,162 --> 00:22:06,605
  "I'm the one who farted on Bus 271!"

378
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:08,998
  - Enunciate clearly. 
   - "I'm the one

379
00:22:08,998 --> 00:22:12,041
  who farted on Bus 271!"

380
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,443
  Well done.

381
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,465
  For the price of ruining my reputation,

382
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:19,327
  you will do whatever I say for the next month.

383
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:21,069
  You are...

384
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:24,592
  my servant now.

385
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:30,188
  I'm really thankful,

386
00:22:30,188 --> 00:22:32,521
  but isn't making me your servant

387
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,742
  taking it a bit too far?

388
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:41,740
  "I'm the one who farted

389
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,393
  - on Bus 271." 
 - Say it louder.

390
00:22:44,393 --> 00:22:46,145
  - Then should I just
 - "I'm the one who farted

391
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:47,746
-   leak this? 
 - on Bus 271!"

392
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:50,908
  "I'm the one who farted

393
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:52,460
  on Bus 271!"

394
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,542
  Well done.

395
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:09,938
  Hanjong High School

396
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:14,253
You, come over here.

397
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:16,103
Over here.

398
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:20,098
Don't you think your skirt is

399
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,440
too short? It's too short.

400
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,453
What is this? You should lower it.

401
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:28,917
I can see you've got nice legs, but let's tone it down from now on.

402
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:31,258
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Good.

403
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,754
Just my luck. I got caught by Yamete this morning.

404
00:23:36,754 --> 00:23:39,577
That's why I lowered my skirt before coming to school.

405
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:41,780
He makes me want to barf.

406
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,183
Deok Hui, what's Yamete?

407
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:46,084
Don't you know? They say it in porn.

408
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:48,497
"Yamete!"

409
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:50,228
What?

410
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:55,044
It's his nickname because he's cheesy and gross.

411
00:23:55,044 --> 00:23:56,966
On top of that, he's the Physical Education teacher.

412
00:23:56,966 --> 00:24:00,399
Apparently, he has touched quite a few students.

413
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,511
It gives me the creeps.

414
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:06,265
There's nothing you don't know.

415
00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:08,477
Are you really a freshman?

416
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:10,939
Don't underestimate the resourcefulness of otakus*.
 (people with obsessive interests, particularly in anime and manga)

417
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:13,632
There's nothing I can't unearth if I put my mind to it.

418
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:16,485
Do you want me to look into your boyfriend?

419
00:24:16,485 --> 00:24:18,286
What?

420
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,953
Deok Hui,

421
00:24:24,953 --> 00:24:28,075
what do you think this means?

422
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,549
Maybe it means that they're in love?

423
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:36,564
He has never done this before. The change is so sudden.

424
00:24:36,564 --> 00:24:39,717
Maybe he suddenly met a girl he likes.

425
00:24:39,717 --> 00:24:42,151
Look, I changed my profile picture, too.

426
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:44,572
What is this?

427
00:24:44,572 --> 00:24:46,615
I thought it was real. That's so fascinating.

428
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:49,537
It has been 571 days since Eun Woo debuted.

429
00:24:49,537 --> 00:24:51,549
I've been a fan ever since.

430
00:24:54,123 --> 00:24:55,204
Oh, my god.

431
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,775
It's called the morning kiss GIF.

432
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:59,068
Oppa Eun Woo, good morning.

433
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:00,859
Gosh...

434
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:06,465
By the way, you want his autograph, don't you?

435
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:10,478
Of course! I want it so badly. When will you give it to me?

436
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:15,213
Can I ask you a favor first?

437
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,925
What?

438
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:19,066
Can you look into someone?

439
00:25:23,531 --> 00:25:26,684
Are you sure he goes to this academy?

440
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:30,209
My gosh. Are you doubting my ability?

441
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:33,731
Humans are bound to leave traces of themselves.

442
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:35,914
The same holds true for cyberspace,

443
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:38,236
such as posts, comments, likes, follows, and more.

444
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:42,639
Follow those traces and you can look into anything.

445
00:25:44,592 --> 00:25:47,205
- Hey. He's coming. 
 - What?

446
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:49,058
- Come here. 
 - What do we do?

447
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:52,100
- What are we going to do? 
 - What do you mean? You're already here.

448
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,052
- You have to face him. 
 - Hey.

449
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,238
Jeong Wu...

450
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:04,133
Gu Hui, how did you know I was here?

451
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:06,114
The thing is...

452
00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:07,636
I was just passing by and saw you.

453
00:26:07,636 --> 00:26:09,627
Hey, isn't that Ho Gu Hui?

454
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,581
It's been a long time.

455
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:16,395
I've been a bit busy lately.

456
00:26:16,395 --> 00:26:18,916
- How have you been? 
 - Oh, you were busy.

457
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:23,292
You didn't even read my message. Were you that busy?

458
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:26,183
- Well, about that—  
   - Jeong Wu.

459
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:29,507
Did you wait long?

460
00:26:30,848 --> 00:26:32,610
Who is this?

461
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:34,602
Oh...

462
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:39,057
You really don't know when to give up, do you?

463
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:42,110
You followed me all the way here? Are you out of your mind?

464
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,672
Jeong Wu.

465
00:26:43,672 --> 00:26:47,264
She's the stalker you told me about?

466
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:49,638
- Stalker? 
 - Oh, my.

467
00:26:49,638 --> 00:26:50,989
What did you just say?

468
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:54,102
Look! She's not his stalker. She's his girlfriend.

469
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:55,373
What are you doing?

470
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:57,936
Why aren't you saying he's your boyfriend?

471
00:26:57,936 --> 00:27:00,918
Have you been lying to people that I'm your boyfriend?

472
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:03,681
I was nice to you out of pity, but you seem to be mistaken.

473
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,633
Enough is enough.

474
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:08,876
She's ugly, too. Let's go.

475
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:15,153
Jeong Wu...

476
00:27:15,153 --> 00:27:18,226
- It's a love triangle.
 - What the!

477
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:19,558
I think she's being dumped.

478
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:22,501
What a jerk. Gu Hui, are you okay?

479
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:25,642
What a piece of garbage. Unbelievable.

480
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:30,028
You promised you wouldn't wear those shoes to run away.

481
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,500
You jerk...

482
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,131
What a spectacular sight.

483
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,965
It's heart-wrenching, isn't it?

484
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:06,965
Gu Hui, hurry up! It's a green light!

485
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,676
Ho Gu Hui!

486
00:28:08,676 --> 00:28:10,928
It's a green light!

487
00:28:10,928 --> 00:28:13,891
Ho Gu Hui.

488
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:17,580
Hurry up!
♫  I always  ♫

489
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,720
♫  I always  ♫

490
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,564
He was my first love.
♫  want to tell you all the time  ♫

491
00:28:26,564 --> 00:28:31,140
Why is love like this?
♫  I always  ♫

492
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,993
♫  I always  ♫

493
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:37,395
This is so annoying.
 I always want to tell you

494
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,770
♫  the feelings in my heart  ♫

495
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:47,390
♫  The world always changes  ♫

496
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:54,220
♫  even you don't want it to be changed  ♫

497
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:02,540
♫  Even though you don't want or feel  ♫

498
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:08,230
♫  Open your heart and look at the sky  ♫

499
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,864
Here. We can't drink since we're underage.

500
00:29:15,864 --> 00:29:17,536
Drink this instead.

501
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:19,697
I increased the caffeine content.

502
00:29:19,697 --> 00:29:22,259
He called me a stalker.

503
00:29:24,852 --> 00:29:26,854
Seriously...

504
00:29:26,854 --> 00:29:30,339
I've never seen anything so insane in my 17 years of life.

505
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:34,852
Why did you just stand there? You should've at least pulled some hair.

506
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:38,056
But...

507
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:39,638
You're not really a stalker, are you?

508
00:29:39,638 --> 00:29:41,038
Hey.

509
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,142
It makes me mad the more I think about it. Should we kill him?

510
00:29:47,044 --> 00:29:48,747
He...

511
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:52,261
He made it so obvious

512
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:54,742
that he wanted those shoes.

513
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:57,556
I fried so many chickens

514
00:29:57,556 --> 00:29:59,957
to buy him those.

515
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:02,960
But...

516
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,414
do you know what he got me?

517
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:08,286
What? What did he get you?

518
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:11,129
Nothing.

519
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:13,901
There was nothing.

520
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:17,335
Why did you do that? Are you a pushover?

521
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:20,077
Pushover...

522
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,451
I am a pushover.

523
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,123
I'm a pushover.

524
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:29,648
Don't drink so fast. It's really strong.

525
00:30:29,648 --> 00:30:31,689
Hey.

526
00:30:36,674 --> 00:30:38,386
Gu Hui is really late today.

527
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:40,949
- You should call her. 
 - I'm sure she'll be home soon.

528
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:42,700
Are you really her brother?

529
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,374
Hey.

530
00:30:45,374 --> 00:30:47,944
Her face is a weapon.

531
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:58,987
I'm Gu Hui's friend, Deok Hui.

532
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:01,930
I think Gu Hui is a bit sick.

533
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,143
- Hey, pull yourself together. 
 - Hang on. I'll be right out.

534
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:06,975
Stop crying and go inside.

535
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:11,068
My parents keep calling me, so I'll leave you here.

536
00:31:11,068 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm leaving. Bye.

537
00:31:15,504 --> 00:31:16,805
Gu Hui, are you okay?

538
00:31:16,805 --> 00:31:18,746
Yes.

539
00:31:25,303 --> 00:31:27,405
Was that Gu Hui's brother?

540
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:31,148
He sounded really familiar.

541
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:36,954
Are you okay?

542
00:31:36,954 --> 00:31:38,857
Are you sick?

543
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,157
No...

544
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,321
Gu Hui,

545
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,765
your face...

546
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:48,396
looks ugly.

547
00:31:48,396 --> 00:31:50,439
Hey.

548
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:53,261
Let me take a look at you. Did you cry?

549
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:55,524
What is it? Did something happen?

550
00:31:55,524 --> 00:31:58,054
Did you get dumped?

551
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:00,779
- Be quiet. 
 - Darn it.

552
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,581
Yes, I got dumped!

553
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:08,336
Are you happy that your sister got dumped?

554
00:32:08,336 --> 00:32:10,588
Jeong Wu, that jerk...

555
00:32:10,588 --> 00:32:15,633
He cheated on me and called me a stalker.

556
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,607
I fell into a pile of garbage

557
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:20,488
and I was in pain...

558
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,641
Why doesn't anything ever

559
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,974
work out for me?

560
00:32:25,974 --> 00:32:28,156
I'm always such a pushover.

561
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:38,667
I'm not going to take this anymore.

562
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:40,917
I'll tear all of them to pieces.

563
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,072
What...

564
00:32:44,072 --> 00:32:45,813
That's a tissue...

565
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:52,530
She's my sister,

566
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,343
but she's kind of scary.

567
00:32:56,685 --> 00:33:00,699
  That's how my first love at the age of 17 was shattered to pieces.

568
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:03,830
  All that was left were embarrassing moments.

569
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:10,327
Gu Hui,

570
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,689
are you awake?

571
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:15,782
I'm coming in.

572
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:23,960
Is she still sleeping?

573
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,572
I'm insane.

574
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:47,884
Why did I do that?

575
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,079
Darn it.

576
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:55,442
What's wrong with me?

577
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,803
  Would you like to join Revenge Note?

578
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:09,578
What is this?

579
00:34:09,578 --> 00:34:13,712
  Back then, I had no idea how that message

580
00:34:13,712 --> 00:34:15,504
  would change my life.

581
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:17,225
  Would you like to join Revenge Note?

582
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:19,797
  Click on "register"

583
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:21,570
  ~ Sweet Revenge ~

584
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,623
  You know Gi Jeong Wu, right? Weren't you pretty close to him?

585
00:34:24,623 --> 00:34:26,615
  I am the man of luck.

586
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:29,277
  How desperate do you have to be to date a loser like him?

587
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,890
  They're the Zombies, known for their long grudges.

588
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,331
  You fell into the wrong hands.

589
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:34,993
  Let her go first, and then we'll talk.

590
00:34:34,993 --> 00:34:37,178
  Gu Hui!

591
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:45,080
