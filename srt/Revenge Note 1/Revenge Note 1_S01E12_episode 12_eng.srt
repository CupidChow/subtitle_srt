 Series Recap/Highlights  

2
00:00:03,663 --> 00:00:05,376
   
This is my family.  

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,806
Your oppa eats first.

4
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,830
I'm not favoring him over you. He's my retirement plan.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,483
I'm sure the smarter child will give me more money.

6
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,725
  She can do without her husband and daughter,  

7
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:16,506
  but not without her son.  

8
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:18,749
  She is my mom, whose love for her son knows no bounds. 

9
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:21,051
- Is it good? Eat up. 
 - It's delicious.

10
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:23,923
  He is my mother's pride and joy and my enemy.  

11
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:26,516
  Oppa Ho Gu Jun is a medical student at a prestigious college.  

12
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:28,377
People throw away garbage shamelessly.

13
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:30,100
The neighborhood is a garbage heap.

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,982
Do you have to talk about garbage when we're trying to eat here?

15
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:36,295
  He always has my back, but has no power whatsoever.  

16
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:38,008
  He is my dad.  

17
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,999
  And as for me,  

18
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:43,013
  I, a 17-year-old pushover with absolutely no presence.  

19
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:44,435
  I am Ho Gu Hui.  

20
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:48,458
  This is how I met my first love at the age of 17. 

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,643
  Do you like me? 

22
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:16,536
  If I drink this, does it mean we're a couple? 

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,925
  First day as a couple. Who is this kind and cute boy?  

24
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:27,828
  This is Gi Jeong Wu, my sworn enemy 

25
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:29,648
  and a womanizer. 

26
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,083
Gu Hui,

27
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,493
come over here.

28
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:37,546
What are you doing? Get over here.

29
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:40,730
It's so nice to see you.

30
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,452
We must be fated.

31
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:45,234
I'll have the Beijing Spicy Chicken Burger set

32
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:46,926
and Coke with a lot of ice.

33
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:49,929
  The smell of a pushover. What is this feeling?  

34
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,945
Are you wearing makeup?

35
00:01:57,937 --> 00:02:00,298
You look a lot better. Keep it up.

36
00:02:04,153 --> 00:02:06,176
You have insufficient funds.

37
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:09,089
You have insufficient funds.

38
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:11,581
- Why isn't it working? 
   - Can you move aside? 

39
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:13,322
Oh, yes.

40
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:21,842
  Please charge for two. 

41
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:32,812
  This is Sin Ji Hun, 

42
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:35,896
  a perfect guy from the heavens, 

43
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:37,647
  also known as "God Ji Hun". 

44
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:40,110
  Sin Ji Hun, 17 year old God Ji Hun from the heavens  

45
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,943
  Is my stomach reacting to stress again? 

46
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:50,890
- Gosh. 
 - Oh, my.

47
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,551
Who farted on a full bus?

48
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,170
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,423
I have weak bowels, so I couldn't help it.

50
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:05,644
My gosh. He let out a poop fart looking like that?

51
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,157
Really? I can't believe it.

52
00:03:08,157 --> 00:03:09,819
  What's going on? 

53
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,080
  Sniffs  

54
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:15,324
  It's mine though. 

55
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:17,247
  Did he... 

56
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,769
  save me from the fart? 

57
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,831
  Why? 

58
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:23,964
She must have been nervous for her first day.

59
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:26,066
  Heart fluttering  

60
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:29,028
This is Yang Ah Jun,  

61
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:32,662
  Vice President of the famous Club HIVA at Hanjong High School. 

62
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:35,415
  Yang Ah Jun, the 18-year old son of a National Assemblyman  

63
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:37,958
It's 37,000 won   (≈ $35). 

64
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,949
- Pardon? 
 - It's 37,000 won.

65
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:47,006
Ajumma, I'll make sure to pay you back next time.

66
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:48,908
Could you let me pay later just this once?

67
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:53,242
  No, this is way too expensive. Don't buy it if you don't have money. 

68
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:55,094
I'm in an urgent situation.

69
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:57,646
- No. 
   - Please use this. 

70
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,913
Why are you, Seonbaenim...

71
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:05,024
It's okay. You can take your time paying me back.

72
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:08,307
He's handsome and even kind.

73
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:11,460
  He's an angel for sure. 

74
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:15,494
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

75
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:17,607
- Hi, Gu Hui. 
  - Long time no see.

76
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:20,119
  This is the perfectly handsome Cha Eun Woo. 

77
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:23,752
He's the leader of popular boy group, Astro, and my brother's best friend.

78
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:26,255
Here. How have you been these days?

79
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:30,058
I'm going to take a break and come see you every day.

80
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:35,034
- Good night, Gu Hui. 
 - Good night.

81
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:36,635
You're worrying too much.

82
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:39,549
Come here.

83
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,273
It's okay. Don't worry.

84
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:47,025
  Oppa Eun Woo is so sweet. 

85
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:51,099
  Who will become my first love? 

86
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:56,496
  After living as a pushover for 17 years with absolutely no presence, 

87
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,377
  I'm hoping for a new life at school. 

88
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:01,621
Okay, get yourself together now.

89
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,962
You can do this, Ho Gu Hui.

90
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:09,418
  She got disqualified in the fourth round and won the fifth. 

91
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:12,662
- Oh, my. 
 - Look who it is. It's Ho Gu Hui.

92
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:14,773
  Oh, my god. 

93
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,637
This is Yeo Ga Eun, my enemy from middle school.

94
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:19,769
I can't believe we're meeting here again.

95
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:21,430
We're in the same class again.

96
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,543
I hope we can get along.

97
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:27,397
Okay. Hi.

98
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:30,239
What are you doing after school? Are you free?

99
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,211
Well... Why?

100
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:35,114
Can you do my duties for me?

101
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:38,038
Can you, Gu Hui? You'll do them, right?

102
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,618
Okay. Sure.

103
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:42,162
- I'm off then, Gu Hui. 
 - All right.

104
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:43,914
  My fears always come true.  

105
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:47,047
Hey, Cleaning Duty, the classroom is so messy.

106
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,399
  Gu Hui is back to being a pushover just like in middle school  

107
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,739
Hey!

108
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:54,013
Ho Gu Hui, can't you even refill the water cooler on time?

109
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:56,565
  I wanted a fresh start. 

110
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,517
  Why do you have to be here? 

111
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:07,396
Are you sure Astro moved their dorms here?

112
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:10,399
Did someone order chicken?

113
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,822
I have a half-and-half delivery here.

114
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:14,483
Excuse me. Sorry.

115
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,235
Who ordered chicken?

116
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:17,636
- Over here. 
 - Yes?

117
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,038
Okay.

118
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,952
That will be 17,000 won   (≈ $15).  

119
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:23,892
Oppa's here!

120
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:32,301
- Astro! 
 - Oppa Eun Woo!

121
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:34,714
Who is important? Eun Woo is important.

122
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:37,256
- Who is important? 
 - Eun Woo!

123
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:39,638
  This is Jeong Deok Hui is also known as Cannon Goddess. 

124
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:42,741
  Her future aspiration is to become Eun Woo's wife. 

125
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:46,106
Hi, I'm Ho Gu Hui. Can I sit here?

126
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,397
Yes. I'm Jeong Deok Hui.

127
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:49,668
Okay.

128
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:51,941
Are you his fan?

129
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:54,864
Yes. Call me Eun Woo's wife.

130
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:58,027
His wife? Okay.

131
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:59,578
Are you a fan of Eun Woo,  too?

132
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:02,581
No, it's not that. He comes to our restaurant a lot.

133
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:04,494
Really? Where is that?

134
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:06,876
Well, I even have his autograph.

135
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:10,780
What is important? An autograph is important.

136
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,091
Nice to meet you, friend.

137
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:13,743
This is really dear to me. Do you want one?

138
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:17,407
Let's be close friends.

139
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:20,429
And these are my other friends.

140
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:23,082
  "His nose approached and touched mine." 

141
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:25,624
  Classmates of Year 1, Class 7  

142
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:27,936
It's not holding hands this time.

143
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:29,408
- It's a kiss. 
 - It's a kiss.

144
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,260
Oh, my goodness.

145
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,743
- It's so heart-fluttering. 
 - My gosh.

146
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:36,306
  Jeong Jeong Ah  

147
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:38,837
I'll be your teacher for a year.

148
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:42,421
At Hanjong High School, I'm known as the beautiful teacher.

149
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,883
I'm Jeong Ah.

150
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:47,846
This is Ms. Jeong Ah, who calls herself the pretty teacher of our school.

151
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,579
- That is all. 
 - Teacher, how old are you?

152
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,322
Me?

153
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:54,153
I'm as old as the morning sun.

154
00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:56,426
Let's just say I'm old enough.

155
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:59,579
You, come over here.

156
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,780
Over here.

157
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,801
  The teacher who guards the school gate  

158
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:05,334
Don't you think your skirt is

159
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,746
too short? It's too short.

160
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:10,689
What is this? You should lower it.

161
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:14,293
I can see you've got nice legs, but let's tone it down from now on.

162
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,454
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Good.

163
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:21,891
Just my luck. I got caught by Yamete this morning.

164
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:24,433
That's why I lowered my skirt before coming to school.

165
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:27,486
  Byeon Tae Seon, also known as Yamete, is the Physical Education Teacher  

166
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,799
You don't know? They say that in adult videos.

167
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:32,071
"Yamete."

168
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:33,932
What?

169
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:38,777
It's his nickname because he's cheesy and gross.

170
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,649
On top of that, he's the Physical Education teacher.

171
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:44,153
Apparently, he has touched quite a few students.

172
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:45,584
It gives me the creeps.

173
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:48,187
You know that space in the middle?

174
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:49,369
Yes.

175
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,080
She was climbing up the stairs

176
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,354
and because she felt something was off, she turned her head

177
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:57,746
and made eye contact with Yamete.

178
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,530
That's crazy. So Yamete was looking up from there?

179
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,991
- Yes. 
 - You can see everything from there.

180
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:05,614
- I know. 
 - It's giving me the chills.

181
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:08,007
I heard a story, too.

182
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,498
Someone saw him looking all happy

183
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:11,370
while watching his computer screen.

184
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,001
- What was he watching? 
 - It's obvious.

185
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,514
He was definitely watching

186
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:16,064
porn.

187
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:17,817
He is such a pervert.

188
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,689
He even looks like a pervert.

189
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:25,343
Guys, Teacher Kim Yi Jeong is coming.

190
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:34,233
  Next class is Korean language. Everyone's getting dolled up. 

191
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:38,107
  The one who even gets the Eun Woo fan grooming herself is 

192
00:09:38,107 --> 00:09:40,239
  this man. 

193
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:44,712
Let me do it. It's too heavy for you.

194
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:52,202
Who brought these here? Tell me.

195
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:58,108
I will save it

196
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,298
in my heart.

197
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,420
  This is Mr. Kim Yi Jeong who teaches the Korean language. 

198
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,432
  He is the most popular teacher at our school. 

199
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,933
  HIVA, Hanjong International Volunteer Association  

200
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:22,362
  Han Yu Ra. The leader of Club HIVA and the queen of Hanjong High School. 

201
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:23,733
  She's the daughter of a wealthy family. 

202
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,657
She was recently invited to take part in US efforts to help global refugees.

203
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:30,299
She was even on the news for it.

204
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:31,760
Our school has a program like that?

205
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,382
How could you know so little?

206
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,300
Let's go.

207
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,813
  The Queen of Power Harassment, Han Yu Ra.  

208
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:46,585
What are you looking at?

209
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:49,588
Music!

210
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,832
Delivery!

211
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,829
Leave it there.

212
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:06,526
Ten half-and-half sets, right?

213
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:09,748
It's 170,000 won   (≈ $150)  , you can pay...

214
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:11,079
in cash.

215
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,452
Here.

216
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:15,393
Keep the change.

217
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:21,390
  Revenge Note?  

218
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,273
  What is this? 

219
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:26,555
  Why is this suddenly showing up? 

220
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:30,469
  Vengeance is exacted when I write someone's name on Revenge Note? 

221
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,432
  The Zombies rob a student.  

222
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:33,983
Gosh, just give it up already.

223
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:36,315
- Hey. 
 - Don't you have it?

224
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:37,856
What are you doing?

225
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:40,690
Friends should get along. Why would you steal their money?

226
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,562
What is this ajeossi doing here?

227
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:45,053
Ajeossi, you should leave when we tell you nicely.

228
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:46,485
These kids...

229
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:50,218
You should stop when I tell you nicely.

230
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:52,452
These punks...

231
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,313
- That hurts. 
 - Gosh.

232
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,734
Dad.

233
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:58,217
What's going on? What is this?

234
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,800
  What's going on? I've got a bad feeling about this.  

235
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,083
- What is it? It looks serious. 
 - No, it's okay.

236
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:08,968
Isn't that the girl with the ajeossi last night?

237
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:11,349
- Hey, friend. Come here. 
 - Hey.

238
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,382
- Over here. 
 - Come on.

239
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:15,754
Hooray.

240
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:17,777
Yes! Great!

241
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:21,019
  Gu Hui gets bullied by the Zombies  

242
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:23,011
What's your name?

243
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,054
Why are you asking for my name?

244
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:28,708
Your seonbaes are asking you.

245
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,648
What is your name?

246
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:33,572
It's Ho Gu...

247
00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:37,096
- It says "pushover." 
 - Ho Mi would be better.

248
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:41,000
Ho Gu Hui?

249
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,021
I like your name.

250
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:45,644
I really like pushovers.

251
00:12:45,644 --> 00:12:47,926
Are you selling lots of chicken?

252
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:52,120
How do you know about our restaurant?

253
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,442
Well,

254
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:56,595
I'm indebted to your dad.

255
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:59,248
Then do you mean...

256
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:00,409
Yesterday...

257
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:02,611
Is the daughter going to apologize or not?

258
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:06,145
I'm sorry. My dad likes to get involved in other people's business—

259
00:13:06,145 --> 00:13:08,717
You're only going to apologize in words?

260
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:10,599
You should do it properly.

261
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,452
- Yes. 
 - That's right.

262
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:14,692
Aren't I right, Pushover?

263
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:20,369
Hey!

264
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:23,782
Ho Gu Hui, where are you going?

265
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:26,314
I'm going home. I need to hurry.

266
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:28,548
You're talking back now.

267
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:31,421
I told you we would protect you so no one can bug you.

268
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:35,132
We'll protect you, and you'll feed us.

269
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:47,466
What's wrong? Did something happen?

270
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,943
They're the Zombies, known for their long grudges.

271
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:56,275
You fell into the wrong hands.

272
00:13:57,285 --> 00:14:01,330
My dream is to have a quiet and normal high school life.

273
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,972
Is that too much to ask for?

274
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,840
  Big punch stupid Zombies  

275
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,712
  Apologize!  

276
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:17,855
I don't want to go to school.

277
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:23,051
I don't want tomorrow to come.

278
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:29,857
My stomach hurts.

279
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:33,031
My stomach is reacting to stress again.

280
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,883
  Will you be the Revenge Goddess?  

281
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:55,755
I got this again.

282
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,509
Should I type the name?

283
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:02,310
  Should I just go for it?  

284
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:11,319
  Now, it's time for Music class  

285
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:08,166
  Music teacher, Eum Chi Hun sings with half air, half sound  

286
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,831
Listen up, everyone.

287
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:16,064
You will have to sing this song for the finals.

288
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,939
That's it for today's class.

289
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,392
How can we sing that?

290
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:26,685
I'm so sleepy.

291
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,658
Our Music teacher is really handsome.

292
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:32,270
But doesn't he look gross when it comes to finals?

293
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,204
When it comes to finals, he must be the toughest teacher

294
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,955
in the whole country.

295
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,068
- I agree. 
 - What should I do?

296
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:41,771
I failed the midterms already.

297
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:44,452
We'll just have to take our minds off of it and fail again.

298
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:48,337
If I could sing Astro songs, I would get a perfect score for sure.

299
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:52,041
How could he refuse to hear even just one verse?

300
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,445
Wasn't there only one person who got more than 90% on the midterms?

301
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:58,037
Who was that?

302
00:16:58,037 --> 00:16:59,507
Gu Hui.

303
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:02,932
Would you like me to help you?

304
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:06,035
Sure. Thanks.

305
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:09,158
Your boyfriend has a car?

306
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:10,560
Isn't he a high school student?

307
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,893
W-Well... Actually,

308
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:15,695
he is a bit older.

309
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:18,908
How old is he? Is he a college student?

310
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:21,740
No. He is a bit older than that.

311
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,742
  My boyfriend is a bit old  

312
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,371
Teacher Eum!

313
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:33,683
Hi, Min Ah.

314
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:35,503
- Are you coming back from work? 
 - Yes.

315
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:37,716
  Is that chicken? 

316
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:40,298
I got it on my way home.

317
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:42,169
Where did you get it?

318
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:47,274
  What's going on? 

319
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:51,710
Hey.

320
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,773
Have you ever liked a teacher?

321
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,776
No. I don't find men over 22 years old sexy.

322
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,908
They're like old grandpas.

323
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:05,254
Wait. Do you like a teacher?

324
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:06,906
Were you just using Ji Hun?

325
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:09,368
Who is it? Is it the Math teacher, Physics teacher,

326
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:11,721
or the Gym teacher, Yamete?

327
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,522
Be quiet.

328
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:18,517
  No. 

329
00:18:18,517 --> 00:18:22,480
That's why she said her boyfriend's older.

330
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:31,390
  The day of the singing finals  

331
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:01,901
That was so good!

332
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:04,122
Good job.

333
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:08,658
That was so biased.

334
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:11,470
- What? 
 - What?

335
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,942
I meant Min Ah sings really well.

336
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:15,764
I agree.

337
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,688
Everyone, I have big news!

338
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:20,318
Teacher Eum is getting married.

339
00:19:20,318 --> 00:19:23,983
I saw him in the main office, handing out wedding invitations.

340
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:27,015
  Is Teacher Eum finally getting married? 

341
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:30,739
How could you do that?

342
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,721
Teacher Eum,

343
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:37,246
how could you do that?

344
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:41,339
Min Ah, calm down and let's go talk somewhere else.

345
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:45,444
How could you do this to me?

346
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:47,135
How?

347
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,247
  Is this really happening? 

348
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:51,679
I'm actually curious.

349
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,142
- My gosh. 
 - Hey.

350
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:04,734
  You're a sex offender under a handsome mask!  

351
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:06,776
  Do you reserve all the seats to not be disturbed?  

352
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:08,196
  We don't need a sex offender as a teacher!  

353
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:09,617
  Get out of this school!  

354
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:11,280
  And you call yourself a teacher?  

355
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:21,250
We're going to talk about music theory today.

356
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,141
Open up your books to page 28.

357
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,835
How can he call himself a teacher?

358
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:31,701
- You're a piece of trash. 
 - Get lost.

359
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,641
- You can't be a teacher. 
 - How could you do that?

360
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:35,783
  - Get out. 
 - How could you do such a thing? 

361
00:20:35,783 --> 00:20:38,767
  - Just get out of here. 
 - We don't need you. 

362
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:44,113
  Teacher Eum tries to be calm amidst the attacks  

363
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:45,733
- You came here to teach? 
 - Gosh.

364
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:47,026
  - Please get out. 
 - Exactly. 

365
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:48,987
  - Just get out. 
 - Get out of here. 

366
00:20:48,987 --> 00:20:51,538
  - We don't want you. 
 - Get out. 

367
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:56,704
  Enter target's name  

368
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:58,537
  Eum Chi Hun  

369
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:00,267
  Should I send it? 

370
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,200
  Should I not? 

371
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:06,375
  What should I do? 

372
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:10,299
  Should I do it? Should I not? What should I do?  

373
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:15,122
- All right. Get ready. 
 - Okay.

374
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:19,609
  The time has come! Moments before Astro's new release 

375
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,000
All right. Five seconds left.

376
00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:26,384
- Go! 
 - Okay!

377
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:27,695
  Astro.  

378
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:29,027
- Astro. 
 - More!

379
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:30,359
More!

380
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,031
They must top the search keyword list as soon as they release their album.

381
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:35,783
Type more. Search their names with every device you have.

382
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:37,946
More!

383
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:40,438
He's so cool.

384
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:42,931
Oppa Eun Woo.

385
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:45,164
Oh, right. Do you like soy sauce marinated crabs?

386
00:21:45,164 --> 00:21:46,714
What? Why do you ask?

387
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:49,879
I saw it earlier. Your mom is great.

388
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:52,421
- She was making soy sauce marinated crabs 
 - It's for my baby,

389
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:54,173
this late at night.

390
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:57,305
That's not for me. It's for  Oppa Eun Woo.

391
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:58,906
What?

392
00:22:00,308 --> 00:22:03,311
Play the entire song, not the preview.

393
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:05,023
Can't you do a better job with streaming?

394
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,525
  Deok Hui's mom, the original idol fan. Fangirling has no end  

395
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:10,840
Okay. Yes, ma'am. Aigoo! Seriously.

396
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,072
These two women go nuts whenever Asphalt or whatever makes a comeback.

397
00:22:14,072 --> 00:22:17,535
It's driving me crazy.

398
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:19,247
Their name is Astro.

399
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:21,020
It's Astro, not Asphalt.

400
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,080
You idiot.

401
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,041
- A. 
 - A.

402
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,053
- S. 
 - S.

403
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:24,874
- T. 
 - T.

404
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:25,833
- Ro. 
 - Ro.

405
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,355
- Astro. 
 - Astro.

406
00:22:27,355 --> 00:22:29,208
- So what should you be doing now? 
 - Astro.

407
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,170
- Streaming. 
 - Streaming. Oh, right.

408
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,351
- Do it already. 
 - All right. Streaming.

409
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,805
Deok Hui,

410
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:40,179
it's hard for me because my hands are slow.

411
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:42,972
You have to succeed no matter what.

412
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:45,563
Mom, I'm so nervous. What if I fail right away?

413
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:48,776
No, you can do it because you're my girl.

414
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:51,190
Make consecutive attempts so that you can secure my ticket, too.

415
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,582
If you succeed, I'll raise your allowance by a 100 percent, okay?

416
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:59,037
  "Please don't push me."
 (in Japanese) 

417
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:01,528
  "Please don't push me." 

418
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:06,165
Right. No matter how busy you are as an avid fan of theirs,

419
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:08,267
you have to study from time to time.

420
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:10,298
- Why are you studying Japanese though? 
 - Oppa Eun Woo is holding

421
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:13,591
a concert in Japan this summer. I have to get prepared to go with him.

422
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:16,344
Oh, my goodness. Eun Woo got involved in a scandal.

423
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:17,555
Goodness, check this out.

424
00:23:17,555 --> 00:23:18,928
- What? 
 - What scandal?

425
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:20,679
Gosh. Read this.

426
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,873
  Member of a popular idol group had late-night date with a high school girl. 

427
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:26,104
It must be real. There's a video this time.

428
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,776
  There's even a video now.  

429
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:31,480
  "The truth about Eun Woo." 

430
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,272
A video of another victim?

431
00:23:33,272 --> 00:23:35,194
  "Eun Woo habitually molested minors 

432
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:37,505
even before his debut"?

433
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:39,398
Isn't Cha Eun Woo the kindest-looking one?

434
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,050
He was totally wearing a mask.

435
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,511
  Hey! Guys like him always turn out to be the worst. 

436
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:45,634
He is totally a habitual criminal.

437
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:48,957
You guys don't know anything. Don't talk so lightly of him like that.

438
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,790
  Thank you The Avengers Team volunteers. We truly appreciate your hard work. 

439
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:57,575
Manager, may I have a moment?

440
00:23:57,575 --> 00:24:00,549
The cue sheet suddenly changed,

441
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:03,262
so their performance got canceled today. I'm sorry.

442
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:05,014
How could that happen?

443
00:24:05,014 --> 00:24:08,646
The fans are already here, and the damage won't be small either.

444
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:10,608
The decision was made by the higher ups.

445
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:13,022
There's nothing I can do about it.

446
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:14,924
Wait a minute. Producer!

447
00:24:14,924 --> 00:24:17,316
Producer.

448
00:24:17,316 --> 00:24:20,848
I wonder if we'll even be able to have our concert.

449
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:23,701
Hyeong Eun Woo, what is this?

450
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:25,913
You should at least give an explanation or take the blame.

451
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:28,255
Do something!

452

 - Eun Woo!

457
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,343
- Eun Woo! 
 - All right!

458
00:24:44,343 --> 00:24:46,555
- Let's do this! 
 - Let's go!

459
00:24:46,555 --> 00:24:49,417

482
00:26:09,977 --> 00:26:13,051
but please help!

483
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:15,684
  The Master of Revenge Note  

484
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:17,675
  Who are you?  

485
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:19,487
Who could it be?

486
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:21,279
Who would send this to me?

487
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,332
I feel like that person would know me very well.

488
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,065
  You can do anything if you're a fan. 

489
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:29,848
  I wanted to photoshop Oppa's pictures, 

490
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:33,450
  so I even got licenses. 

491
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:37,806
  Come to think of it, there's nothing she can't do. 

492
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:40,609
  Could... 

493
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:44,563
  Deok Hui be the Master? 

494
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:45,763
  Or... 

495
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:49,638
  I'm sorry guys. Something came up on my schedule, 

496
00:26:49,638 --> 00:26:51,890
  so I need to head out first. I'm so sorry. 

497
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,021
  It's okay. We can just go without you. 

498
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:55,413
  You're the best. 

499
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:58,165
  I'll get going now. Gu Hui, I'll call you later. 

500
00:26:58,165 --> 00:26:59,948
  Could it be Oppa Eun Woo? 

501
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:02,801
I forgot about someone.

502
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:04,542
  Excuse me. 

503
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:08,737
  Let her go first, and then we'll talk. 

504
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:10,708
  Look at this punk. 

505
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:18,296
  Come to think of it, he has always helped me when I was in danger.  

506
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:36,550
  Thank you to all the viewers of Revenge Note 1 for all your support. 

507
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:46,235
I brought ice cream

508
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:49,698
for my lovely sister. Here.

509
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:52,181
What? What's going on?

510
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:53,911
Give me a bite of your ice cream.

511
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:56,745
- Just take one bite. 
 - Okay.

512
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:59,076
- Just take one bite. 
 - Yes, just one bite.

513
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:02,720
Hey!

514
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,841
You crazy...

515
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:06,233
What is this? Why didn't you just eat it yourself?

516
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:09,247
Why did you give it to me in the first place?

517
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:25,023
So you're Gu Hui's classmate, Deok Hui?

518
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:26,894
That's right.

519
00:28:26,894 --> 00:28:28,417
Thank you for this.

520
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:31,089
See you again, Orabeoni.

521
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:33,282
Bye.

522
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:35,934
My gosh. Gu Hui is a total liar.

523
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:38,566
She said her brother was an idiot, but he's actually really cool.

524
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:41,569
He only acts normal outside of the house.

525
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:44,583
He's a completely different person at home.

526
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,173
  The sibling's true form  

527
00:28:46,173 --> 00:28:48,865
- Let go of me. 
 - This is survival training for you.

528
00:28:54,932 --> 00:28:56,474
- Why, you crazy... 
 - Hey.

529
00:28:56,474 --> 00:28:59,248
You're insane!

530
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:00,849
Get out.

531
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:04,451
Get out! Get out, you pervert!

532
00:29:05,983 --> 00:29:07,985
I can't believe this.

533
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:12,199
I'll take down Gu Jun even if I have to make a pact with the devil.

534
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:14,191
That imbecile.

535
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:24,983
  Who could be the Master of Revenge Note?  

536
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:28,446
  We will get revenge for you  

537
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:37,665
  You have been selected as a revenge target  

538
00:29:37,665 --> 00:29:39,517
What is this?

539
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:41,839
Does this mean someone wants to fight us?

540
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,231
What is this?

541
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:46,054
Is it spam?

542
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:48,607
I'm getting nervous.

543
00:29:48,607 --> 00:29:51,549
What if we actually get caught?

544
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:59,297
  Welcome to your first Revenge Note  

545
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,019
Just hit the side of the ball.

546
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:10,898
Be quiet!

547
00:30:10,898 --> 00:30:15,033
Teacher Byeon Tae Seon!

548
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:17,564
Follow me right now!

549
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:21,018

550
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:24,933
  A romantic, comical, action, mystery, school variety teen drama  

551
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:27,656
 I'm Ho Gu Hui, I've lived as a pushover for 17 years. 

552
00:30:27,656 --> 00:30:29,427
 I won't take it any longer. 

553
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,619
  Revenge Note 1
