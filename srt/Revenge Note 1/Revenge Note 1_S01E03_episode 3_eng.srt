  Episode 3

11
00:00:34,024 --> 00:00:36,155
  - That looks good. 
 - I'm so hungry.

12
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:37,958
  - Really? 
 - Is there some chocolate?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,130
What are you having?

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,513
- I really like these. 
 - These look good.

15
00:00:42,513 --> 00:00:44,103
That looks so good.

16
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:47,067
Your patient gown looks nice.

17
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:50,870
Isn't it cool? Even my mom fell for it.

18
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:54,144
Your acting is amazing.

19
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:57,017
- You're crazy. 
 - That's hilarious.

20
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:59,659
It's only a matter of time until their pushover restaurant closes.

21
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,532
They shouldn't have messed with us.

22
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:04,635
- I know. 
 - Did you get your snacks?

23
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:06,115
- Yes. 
 - Let's go.

24
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:07,638
- I'll get this. 
 - I'm treating you all today.

25
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:09,059
Yes!

26
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:10,561
Is he treating us?

27
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:14,252
 Those jerks hurt my dad...

28
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:29,850
  Will you proceed with Revenge Note

29
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:40,910
Okay.

30
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,984
It keeps swelling up.

31
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:47,637
Do you feel all right?

32
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:49,468
Have some water.

33
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:51,420
What do we do?

34
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,185
This is so upsetting. Look at this.

35
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:58,226
  - What? 
 - It hurts.

36
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,873
  What should we do?

37
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:10,009
  Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

38
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,891
  I won't forgive them for hurting my dad.

39
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:14,584
  Zombies. 
We will proceed with the revenge

40
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:22,421
- The angle isn't right. Let me start over. 
 - Come on.

41
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:24,604
- Use Pythagoras' theorem. 
 - Gosh.

42
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,788
Do you even know who Pythagoras is?

43
00:02:27,788 --> 00:02:30,159
Of course, I know.

44
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,342
What's this?

45
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:35,233
  You have been selected as a revenge target
Your misfortune will continue until the revenge is complete.

46
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:38,948
Does this mean someone wants to fight us?

47
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,440
How would I know?

48
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,113
Are you playing or not?

49
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:44,683
Move.

50
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:48,948
Just hit the side of the ball.

51
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:51,110
- Focus on this point. 
 - Okay.

52
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,481
- Hey! 
 - Gosh.

53
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,252
- Are you okay? 
 - Hey.

54
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:04,775
- Hey. 
 - Are you crazy?

55
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,526
The ball was weird.

56
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:08,567
Let go of me. Darn it!

57
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:11,241
- You're crazy. Do you want to die? 
 - Are you all right?

58
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,833
- I'm sorry. 
 - Gosh.

59
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,184
- It's all right. 
 - You better watch it.

60
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:15,474
All right.

61
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:17,507
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:19,118 --> 00:03:21,129
- Na Ri. 
 - What?

63
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,049
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's go have chicken.

64
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,570
Sure. Let's go to that chicken restaurant.

65
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,981
I'll treat you guys.

66
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:34,424
Oh, no. They might have shut down already.

67
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,475
- We're leaving. Get home safe. 
 - Bye.

68
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:37,847
- Bye. 
 - See you tomorrow.

69
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:39,569
Bye.

70
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:43,633
Hey.

71
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,154
- What is this? 
 - Darn it!

72
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:47,327
- What is this? 
 - My gosh!

73
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,240
- What is this? 
 - What's going on?

74
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,972
- Goodness! 
 - Gosh!

75
00:03:51,972 --> 00:03:54,403
- Gosh. 
 - My hair!

76
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,706
- Who did this? 
 - Who is it?

77
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:59,779
- Darn it! 
 - Gosh.

78
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,071
Hey, Ho Gu Hui.

79
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:15,014
When your seonbae* calls you to play, you show up immediately.
 (*senior in school or work)

80
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:17,466
You don't stay still.

81
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,719
I am...

82
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,233
busy being on duty.

83
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,315
Did you hear that? Her Highness has been busy.

84
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:27,067
- Are you kidding me? 
 - Hey!

85
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,320
If you don't want to get beaten up in front of your whole class,

86
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,752
come see us right after class, okay?

87
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:37,436
Hey, you should come with her.

88
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:40,670
If you don't show up, this girl isn't the only one we'll bother.

89
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,632
You know that, right?

90
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,079
What are these?

91
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:00,409
Hey, Gu Hui.

92
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:02,712
Hey, look at this. Aren't these the  Zombies?

93
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:04,293
Oh, my goodness. It's a mess.

94
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:06,065
- What is it? 
 - Check this out.

95
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:07,778
- What is it? 
 - Show us.

96
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,718
What is this?

97
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,491
What's going on?

98
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:14,023
Oh, my goodness.

99
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,076
This guy is really brave and was beaten up.

100
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:19,098
Oh, hey.

101
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:21,981
Their faces are all over the Internet.

102
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,994
- What's going to happen? 
 - It's obvious.

103
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:25,225
They're all going to jail.

104
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,147
- Oh, no. 
 - This poor man.

105
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:29,228
That's too bad.

106
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,785
I mean, it is our school uniform,

107
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:37,195
but you should investigate further.

108
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:43,101
No, Mr. Reporter. You shouldn't come to the school—

109
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:47,005
Mr. Reporter?

110
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,912
What are you going to do about this?!

111
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:57,136
You are at the top of the trending topics.

112
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,159
It's spectacular.

113
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,572
We can't shove it under the rug anymore. Your lives are over, you punks!

114
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,153
Gosh.

115
00:06:06,455 --> 00:06:09,088
We can't go down like this.

116
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,770

117
00:06:15,504 --> 00:06:16,926
You.

118
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,458
You're going to die today.

119
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:26,837
What's that?

120
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:29,148
Come if you don't want her dead.

121
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,300
What the heck is this?

122
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,726
- Are you going? 
 - Why would I?

123
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,902
Let's go to the hagwon*.
 (Korean cram school)

124
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,612
Okay.

125
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,927
She's really getting on my nerves.

126
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,440
Hey, taking the elevator is faster!

127
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,364
Why aren't these guys coming?

128
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:57,176
They'll come. That punk is her knight in shining armor.

129
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:59,378
It's pathetic.

130
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,281
He is not coming. There's nothing going on between us.

131
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:04,183
Just be quiet.

132
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:07,386
We'll just wait and see if they come.

133
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,639
Do you think he uploaded the video of us beating up her dad?

134
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:15,144
Let's take care of this one by one.

135
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,775
Was it really my father in the video?

136
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:18,597
Don't pretend you don't know anything.

137
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:20,649
Do you know what we had to go through because of that video?

138
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,502
You should be thankful you're still alive!

139
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:25,253
What the—

140
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,178
We'll have you dead first, bastard.

141
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,983
Are you ready?

142
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:36,006
- Yes. 
 - Bring it on.

143
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:37,947
You crazy bastard...

144
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,509
Let's go.

00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:50,270
Here they are.

165
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,142
Hey! Stop!

166
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:53,732
What's going on here?

167
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,794
- Let go! 
 - Come on!

168
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:57,836
Hold on. Listen!

169
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:59,208
We're the ones who got beaten up!

170
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,719
Let go of me!

171
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,382
Come here.

172
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:04,863
Sit down.

173
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:07,346
- Stay still. 
 - Don't touch me.

174
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,758
I told you we got beaten up!

175
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,219
- Be quiet! 
 - Come here!

176
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,410
- Let go of me! 
 - Quiet!

177
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,113
You know what you did, don't you?

178
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:16,235
You take money from other students,

179
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:19,188
beat them up, and steal things from the convenience store.

180
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:21,720
We have videos as evidence.

181
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:24,533
Be quiet. Stay still.

182
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:27,210
I'll get inside.

183
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,660
♫  I don't care I don't care  ♫

184
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,534
We almost got caught, too.

185
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:36,986
We were acting in self-defense.

186
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:43,982
Are you all right?

187
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:46,804
I'm all right.

188
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:18,127
  Are you all right?

189
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:20,919
  Yes. Thank you.

190
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,713
  Did you get hurt anywhere?

191
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:26,165
  No. You know I'm immortal.

192
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,428
  By the way, you and Gang Min weren't

193
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:33,602
  thugs or anything, right? You guys fought so well.

194
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:36,946
  Don't worry, we're not thugs. You should get some rest now.

195
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:38,847
  Good night.

196
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:58,248
  Your revenge is complete

197
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,424
How did this all happen?

198
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:09,497
Is someone watching over me?

199
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:19,429
  Look at the damage on his handsome face.

200
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:22,200
  I'm sorry, Dad.

201
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:28,907
  My dad is really ugly.

202
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,344
I thought we wouldn't be able to open for a month.

203
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:36,154
That was a close call.

204
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:39,719
I'm so glad they confessed that they made up the whole thing.

205
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,540
- Here it is! 
 - It's here...

206
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,132
- It's here. 
 - Well...

207
00:12:45,394 --> 00:12:46,795
What are you going to eat?

208
00:12:46,795 --> 00:12:48,567
This place was in Oppa Eun Woo's post, right?

209
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,530
- Could we have 20 fried chickens? 
 - This was in his post.

210
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,013
- Sure. 
 - Could you also take a picture with us?

211
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:55,804
- Hurry. 
 - A picture?

212
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:57,226
What?

213
00:12:57,226 --> 00:12:59,488
- Like this? 
 - I'll be in the middle.

214
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:10,839
  Cha Eun Woo, my favorite chicken restaurant

215
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,103
  Revenge Note

216
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,679
  Revenge Note for Tae Gyun who pulled my hair

217
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:26,364
What is this? It's just a kid.

218
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,130
Who could it be?

219
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,423
Who would send this to me?

220
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:36,825
Could it be Deok Hui?

221
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:39,668
Or could it be Eun Woo?

222
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:42,361
I forgot about someone.

223
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:04,980

224
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:27,235
Wake up!

225
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,653
You should have woken up when I told you to.

226
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:36,385
I'm busy, too. Hurry up.

227
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:39,137
How many times do I have to tell you to put your clothes in the laundry basket?

228
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:41,320
- Hurry up and get ready! 
 - Gosh.

229
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,512
Are you really my mom?

230
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:47,846
It hurts. Why did she have to hit me at the important moment?

231
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,129
Oh, my.

232
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:53,842
What did I just say?

233
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:57,095
Oh, my. I'm having dirty thoughts.

234
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,468
Don't think about those things.

235
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,869
Get the dirty thoughts out of your head.

236
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:09,918
Hi.

237
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:17,276
I don't see you on the bus these days.

238
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:18,596
That's right.

239
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:22,200
I've had a bad experience on that bus,

240
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,233
so I'm taking a different one.

241
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,437
Do you feel all right?

242
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:31,020
You got hit that day because of me.

243
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:32,580
I'm fine.

244
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:36,254
Besides, it's not your fault.

245
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:38,836
Those guys hated me from the start.

246
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,223
Are you feeling all right?

247
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:49,167
  My heart needs to stop pounding.

248
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:50,919
I'm good.

249
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:56,265
  Being next to him makes me nervous.

250
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:58,297
  Distance yourself, Gu Hui.

251
00:15:58,297 --> 00:16:00,699
What's up?

252
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:05,154
Your necktie...

253
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:15,293
It's fine. I'll just sneak in.

254
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:16,845
It's Yamete's turn today.

255
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,526
What?

256
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:22,651
Why him?

257
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,875
What should I do?

258
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,686
What do I do?

259
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,717
Darn it.

260
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:47,115
Okay.

261
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:56,795
Okay. Pass.

262
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,337
Hey, tall guy. Where do you think you're going?

263
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:01,820
Where is your necktie?

264
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,842
Where is it?

265
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:06,084
Gosh, Sin Ji Hun.

266
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:08,926
Go and join those guys over there.

267
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:14,232
Raise them higher.

268
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:17,195
Keep them straight. That's right.

269
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:26,984
What's with you? Are you sick?

270
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,869
Deok Hui.

271
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:32,361
I think I have a heart disease.

272
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,587
My heart keeps pounding.

273
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:39,589
Are you hungry?

274
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:41,769
Eat this.

275
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:47,597
Ji Hun looks like he came straight out of a magazine.

276
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:50,789
Watching him is the only reason I come to school.

277
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,934
That's right. Did you hear about that?

278
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:57,315
- What? 
 - This morning,

279
00:17:57,315 --> 00:18:00,138
Ji Hun gave his necktie to some girl.

280
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:03,152
And he did it right in front of the main gate.

281
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:05,574
My goodness. Then it must be true.

282
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:07,345
Who could that girl be?

283
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:10,119
Yu Ra called dibs on Ji Hun.

284
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,600
Yu Ra wouldn't be happy with her.

285
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,274
Come on. We'll take care of her before Yu Ra does.

286
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:17,676
I'll take care of her first.

287
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:25,013
Guys, Teacher Kim Yi Jeong is coming.

288
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:37,897
  The one who even gets the Eun Woo fan grooming herself is

289
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:39,958
  this man.

290
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,542
Let me do it. It's too heavy for you.

291
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:49,667
Thank you.

292
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:55,393
You don't need makeup. You are already so pretty.

293
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,958
- Hi. 
   - Mr. Kim Yi Jeong teaches Korean.

294
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,150
  He is the most popular teacher at our school.

295
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:07,995
Who brought these here? Tell me.

296
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:13,182
I will save it

297
00:19:13,182 --> 00:19:14,283
in my heart.

298
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:17,996
Please don't give me things like these.

299
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:21,230
Please don't. It could get you in trouble.

300
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,541
Let's begin.

301
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,324
  1. Standard Korean

302
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:28,878
Don't forget to turn in your assignment

303
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:30,759
by next class, all right?

304
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,633
Ye Ri, how are you doing?

305
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,974
I'm fine.

306
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,058
That's it for today.

307
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,689
It's all right.

308
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:55,710

309
00:19:57,867 --> 00:19:58,887
Oh, my.

310
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:01,510
I'm sorry for splashing water on you.

311
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,733
Are you all right?

312
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,685
- I'm all right. 
 - Good then.

313
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:18,066
Don't you get annoyed when you see her face?

314
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:20,909
She looks so gloomy.

315
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:24,713
I just can't understand why Teacher Kim likes her so much.

316
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,536
She's representing our school in the upcoming writing contest.

317
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:30,969
I heard that's why Teacher Kim tutors her.

318
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:34,472
If you get an award, you get a scholarship  and it's shown on your school record,

319
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:36,494
so it's really competitive,

320
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:38,307
but Teacher Kim chose her.

321
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:41,450
It's obvious that she pretended to be a good girl to flirt with him.

322
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,041
Who wouldn't do well after getting his help?

323
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,734
Even you would, too.

324
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:47,566
- Even me? 
 - Gosh.

325
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:49,357
Let's go.

326
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:04,301
Why did Ye Ri have to get on Ga Eun's nerves?

327
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:11,850
Then again,

328
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:16,373
I should be more worried about myself.

329
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:28,086
Look at you.

330
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,649
Eat or be on your phone, do one at a time.

331
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:32,270
What are you doing?

332
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:36,806
I made this.

333
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:39,387
My gosh. It's really well made for no reason.

334
00:21:39,387 --> 00:21:41,410
Did you really make everything?

335
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,413
I didn't have to do much since Oppa is so handsome.

336
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:46,104
He's making a comeback soon,

337
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,816
so I'll recruit more fans with these.

338
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:50,980
You would be so successful if you did this kind of thing as a career.

339
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,272
How did you know I wanted to be a producer for variety shows?

340
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,463
I want to become a variety show producer, marry Cha Eun Woo,

341
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:59,277
and have triplets. Dreams come true. I can do it!

342
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,450
But don't you have to be really smart

343
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,183
- to become a producer?
 - Gu Hui.

344
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:07,896
Your necktie looks a bit strange today. Is it really yours?

345
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:11,569
Of course, it's mine. Whose else could it be?

346
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:13,963
Your necktie used to be a bit crooked.

347
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:15,965
But it's straight today. That's strange.

348
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:18,847
Nothing is strange. Hey, just eat your bread.

349
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:22,021
Here. It must be delicious.

350
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:26,165
Girls, be careful of the staircase at the end of the first floor.

351
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:27,206
Why?

352
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:29,558
This happened to my friend's friend.

353
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:32,190
You know that space in the middle?

354
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,332
Yes.

355
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,885
She was climbing up the stairs

356
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:39,218
and because she felt something was off, she turned her head

357
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:41,931
and made eye contact with Yamete.

358
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:44,393
That's crazy. So Yamete was looking up from there?

359
00:22:44,393 --> 00:22:46,955
- Yes. 
 - You can see everything from there.

360
00:22:46,955 --> 00:22:49,578
- I know. 
 - It's giving me the chills.

361
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,860
I heard a story, too.

362
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,542
Someone saw him looking all happy

363
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,194
while watching his computer screen.

364
00:22:55,194 --> 00:22:57,046
- What was he watching? 
 - It's obvious.

365
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:58,466
He was definitely watching

366
00:22:58,466 --> 00:22:59,888
porn.

367
00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:01,389
He is such a pervert.

368
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:02,680
It's so dirty.

369
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,804
He even looks like a pervert.

370
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:07,997
  From now on,

371
00:23:07,997 --> 00:23:10,178
  I'll have to dismiss you from my team.

372
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:13,231
  If it's true that we traveled backwards in time

373
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:16,833
  and it's before the festival,

374
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,977
  we shouldn't be hanging around like this.

375
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:21,399
  What do you mean? We'll go on stage together...

376
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,033
Please don't act anymore.

377
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:27,036
Why did you have to act and get mean comments you don't need?

378
00:23:27,036 --> 00:23:30,648
That was my first time. I'll work harder.

379
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:33,751
You're still going to act after getting all those mean comments?

380
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,836
You have a really strong mindset.

381
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:40,869
Don't be so mean to Oppa Eun Woo.

382
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:43,561
Being this handsome, if he were also good at acting, he wouldn't be human.

383
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:44,883
Did your friend say that?

384
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,185
Gosh, that friend she made who's your fan

385
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:48,858
is rubbing off on her.

386
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:50,628
No, not at all.

387
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:53,591
Gu Hui, you still can't talk about me at school, okay?

388
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:55,203
Okay.

389
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,953
- You're going to sleep over, right? 
 - Yes.

390
00:24:04,953 --> 00:24:07,785
- I'm free these days. 
 - See you tomorrow.

391
00:24:07,785 --> 00:24:10,358
Good night, Gu Hui.

392
00:24:10,358 --> 00:24:12,560
Good night.

393
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:17,736
That was just too sweet.

394
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:19,568
What do you mean?

395
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:22,660
Gu Hui is really slow-witted,

396
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,242
isn't she?

397
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:27,375
I don't know who she takes after.

398
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:47,816
Would it be too much to give him a gift, too?

399
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,501
But how do I give this back to him?

400
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:58,847
As expected from God Ji Hun,

401
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:01,130
he is even good at basketball.

402
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,291
Look at his arm muscles. Oh, my.

403
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:09,097
Lee Gang Min looks like a cute boy,

404
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:12,110
- but he plays like a man. 
 - Oh, my.

405
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,004
By the way, this camera looks really nice.

406
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:18,466
Their photos are pretty popular.

407
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:20,778
Do you want one, too?

408
00:25:20,778 --> 00:25:23,170
No. Why would I want a picture?

409
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:27,234
Can I choose one then?

410
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:39,337
Thank you.

411
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,198
Sure.

412
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:48,407
I sense that there is something going on here.

413
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:50,608
Are you sure there's nothing going on between you two?

414
00:25:50,608 --> 00:25:52,850
Don't even mention it.

415
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,563
Me and him, it makes no sense.

416
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:57,626
Why is it impossible? It's possible as long as you like each other.

417
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:00,798
I'm jealous of your amazing confidence.

418
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:03,070
I wish I could be like that.

419
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:10,449
Hey, look at this.

420
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:11,980
What?

421
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,544
Isn't that Ye Ri with Yamete?

422
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:17,856
Why is Yamete with Ye Ri?

423
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:20,138
That's strange. You're right.

424
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:22,530
It's not even Teacher Kim.

425
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,033
I heard there's a teacher who's hitting on students.

426
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:27,325
Could it be Yamete?

427
00:26:27,325 --> 00:26:28,757
No way.

428
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:31,609
I heard it's true. Everyone's keeping quiet though.

429
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:15,433
  Will you proceed with Revenge Note?

430
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:29,080

431
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:34,412
Should I send it...

432
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:37,535
or not?

433
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:41,598
Should I just leave it alone?

434
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:51,239
  How many times do I need to tell you? Lower your skirt.

435
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:55,132
  - You can go now. 
 - All right.

436
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:06,734
  I heard there's a teacher who's hitting on students.

437
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:08,785
  Could it be Yamete?

438
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,613
That's right. I shouldn't let Yamete do this.

439
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:18,095
I feel bad for Ye Ri.

440
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:23,412
I'll use this just one more time.

441
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:26,413
Just once more.

442
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:31,199
  Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

443
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:33,592
 Byeon Tae Seon

444
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:38,637
  We will proceed with the revenge

445
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:42,920
  A few days later

446
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,643
- We want to go outside! 
 - Yes!

447
00:28:44,643 --> 00:28:46,184
- Please. 
 - Quiet!

448
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:48,065
Be quiet.

449
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:50,759
Since the weather is too hot today,

450
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:53,121
audio-visual class will be held indoors.

451
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:55,823
- It's not hot at all. 
 - Gosh.

452
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:00,728
You can't take your eyes off your phone. What do you keep checking it for?

453
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:03,231
It's just...

454
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:05,314
Why isn't this working?

455
00:29:05,314 --> 00:29:07,356
What's not working? Is it broken?

456
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:10,238
Focus.

457
00:29:10,238 --> 00:29:13,801
Focus on this. It will be on the exam, okay?

458
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:15,823
Okay.

459
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:22,210
  Bend your upper body at five degrees,

460
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,643
  look straight, and wave your arms

461
00:29:24,643 --> 00:29:27,136
  at your running speed.

462
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:28,826
  Also...

463
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:30,589
  Did you see that?

464
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:33,871
- What is that? 
 - What's going on?

465
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:35,732
Teacher!

466
00:29:36,695 --> 00:29:37,935
Gang Min, get down.

467
00:29:37,935 --> 00:29:39,587
What's going on?

468
00:29:39,587 --> 00:29:41,139
Oh, dear.

469
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:43,141
Why are you showing us this?

470
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:45,773
What is he doing?

471
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:47,295
It's hot!

472
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:50,819
Teacher, it's so hot!

473
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:53,341
It's hot! Teacher!

474
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:55,102
Be quiet!

475
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:59,978
Teacher, how dare you do this to our students?

476
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:03,140
This is not what it looks like. It's a misunderstanding.

477
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,474
This is not... I mean...

478
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:10,298
Mr. Byeon Tae Seon!

479
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:12,130
Follow me right now!

480
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,102
  Bring your laptop as well.

481
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:16,804
- Yes, ma'am. 
 - I can't believe this.

482
00:30:16,804 --> 00:30:18,875
How could you do this at school?

483
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:30,899
Did we just watch porn at school? Is this for real?

484
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:34,091
Yamete is in big trouble.

485
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:36,324
  It doesn't feel like he got all that he deserved,

486
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:39,618
  but I'm satisfied that the revenge happened.

487
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:43,441
  However, it turns out that I was mistaken.

488
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,274
  This place is scary because nobody's here at night.

489
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:58,586
Isn't that Ye Ri?

490
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:05,603
What?

491
00:31:05,603 --> 00:31:07,964
That's Teacher Kim.

492
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:11,758
Why is he with Ye Ri?

493
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:18,136
I don't want to.

494
00:31:18,136 --> 00:31:20,559
What is going on?

495
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,730
I don't want to. I'm going home.

496
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,192
Wait.

497
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:31,448
Ye Ri!

498
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,097
Let go of me.

499
00:31:58,046 --> 00:31:59,947
Ye Ri!

500
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:12,840
 It wasn't Yamete, it was Teacher Kim.

501
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,747
  Revenge Note 1

502
00:32:19,747 --> 00:32:21,449
  Even her eyes look so foxy.

503
00:32:21,449 --> 00:32:22,890
  Maybe she flirted again to get a ride.

504
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,553
  Go apologize to Ye Ri now.

505
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:26,475
  - Why don't you shut up. 
 - Hey!

506
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:28,536
  Oh, my goodness. Eun Woo got involved in a scandal.

507
00:32:28,536 --> 00:32:29,857
  He's suspected to be dating a minor?

508
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:30,909
  This is a conspiracy.

509
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,340
  I'll find this girl and give her a lesson.

510
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,362
  I will protect him.

511
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:43,921
