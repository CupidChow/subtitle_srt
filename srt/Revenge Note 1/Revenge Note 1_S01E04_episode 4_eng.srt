 Episode 4

10
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:37,708
That's why Ye Ri didn't react much when Yamete was in trouble.

11
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,370
Yamete had nothing to do with it.

12
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,993
What should I do now?

13
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:46,255
Can I send it again?

14
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:54,014
 Transmission error

15
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:56,727
Uh? What's this?

16
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,841
What's wrong with this? Is it because I used it already?

17
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:05,995
I'm an idiot.

18
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:08,600
I should've thought a little more before sending it.

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm such an idiot.

20
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:14,874
 Notice

21
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,417
 We're accepting applications from students interested in writing for a national writing competition.

22
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:19,169
 One of the applicants will be selected and awarded a 1 million won     scholarship.

23
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,671
 The results will be announced individually

24
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:23,633
I thought Ye Ri was going to participate in that contest.

25
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:27,598
Right, but why are they selecting another student?

26
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:29,850
I knew this would happen.

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,471
She was so arrogant because Mr. Kim doted on her.

28
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,724
To be honest, I didn't get why she made it to begin with.

29
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:38,589
Come on, girls, don't be like this. Ye Ri must be struggling so much now.

30
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:42,012
All her effort has turned to nothing.

31
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:44,043
Are you all right, Ye Ri?

32
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:51,140
Did you just see how they attacked her sarcastically?

33
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,683
Even her eyes look foxy.

34
00:01:52,683 --> 00:01:55,190
How dare she get in Mr. Kim's car?

35
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,430
She got in his car? Why?

36
00:01:57,457 --> 00:02:01,090
I don't know. She probably flirted again to get a ride.

37
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,635
Maybe that's how she's got selected for the contest.

38
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:06,425
No way.

39
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:09,840
She could've tried to flirt, but Teacher Yi Jeong isn't the person to be swayed by that.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,161
Of course, he has high standards.

41
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:18,498
Girls, I think you're crossing the line.

42
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:20,710
- What do you mean? 
 - You were just bad-mouthing Ye Ri.

43
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,674
What? We did? When did we bad-mouth her?

44
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:27,387
You don't even know what's going on.

45
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,199
Go to apologize to Ye Ri now.

46
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,761
Apologize?

47
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:32,031
Listen.

48
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:34,464
Even Ye Ri isn't saying anything, so who are you to tell us to apologize?

49
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:36,456
Teacher Kim Yi Jeong...

50
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:42,832
He's... he's not the type of person you think he is.

51
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:44,944
He's totally two-faced.

52
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:49,268
How dare you say that about him? You go apologize to him.

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,202
This is frustrating, but I can't say anything more.

54
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:56,427
Just don't butt in if you know nothing.

55
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,957
He's a scumbag...

56
00:02:57,957 --> 00:02:59,980
Shut up.

57
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,210
How dare you say that?

58
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,193
Hey!

59
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:04,754
Let me go.

60
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:07,617
You think I put up with you because I was scared of you?

61
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:09,568
- Why you... 
 - What?

62
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:10,801
You!

63
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,032
Let this go!

64
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:15,555
- Let go first! 
 - What's wrong with you?

65
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:17,356
- Goodness! 
 - The teacher is coming!

66
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:18,939
- Let go! 
 - The teacher is coming!

67
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,190
- Let go! 
 - The teacher is coming!

68
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,221
- Hey! 
 - Hey!

69
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:23,783
You little brat!

70
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:25,005
Hey!

71
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,047
- Let go! 
 - The teacher is coming!

72
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:31,071
Why do I have to get in this mess because of this crazy wench?

73
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:34,574
My image is ruined because of you. How are you going to take responsibility?

74
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:36,445
Tell me, Ho Gu Hui.

75
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:40,159
Who do you think you're glaring at? Lower your eyes.

76
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,562
Just don't freak out later.

77
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:44,835
- You crazy little... 
 - What?

78
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:48,027
- Goodness. 
 - Did you girls have lunch?

79
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,407
So what you're saying is...

80
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:04,384
Teacher Kim and Ye Ri...

81
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:08,658
So the bad guy in the rumor is Teacher Kim?

82
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:12,812
Right. I clearly saw it with my own eyes.

83
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:16,295
He kicked Ye Ri out right away because she wasn't obedient.

84
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:20,269
Can't you think of any good ideas?

85
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,573
Show me what you can do.

86
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,875
Reporting won't do any good.

87
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,677
It'll only harm Ye Ri.

88
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:29,878
No one's going to believe us.

89
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:34,453
Right? It'll only make us look crazy.

90
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:36,815
It's so hard.

91
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,411
How about we try this?

92
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:44,153
What?

93
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,052
You're a genius.

94
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:56,366
Can we do a good job though?

95
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:59,437
We can do it. Don't worry.

96
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,900
Right. You made the right choice.

97
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,823
Reporting me will only harm you.

98
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,275
Do you think people will take your side?

99
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,503
You're only going to be criticized as a girl who flirts with men.

100
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,480
If you do as I tell you,

101
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,663
I'll even get you into college.

102
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,201
All right. Come closer.

103
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,499
Give me your hand.

104
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,141
What?

105
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:15,295
Hey! You...

106
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,406
Who are you?

107
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:19,930
What's wrong? Are you surprised

108
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,590
because I wasn't the one you've had in mind?

109
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,834
Well, why...

110
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,845
Why are you here?

111
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,010
I sent you the message.

112
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:35,065
 Teacher Kim, I'm sorry.

113
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:37,856
 I'll do everything you tell me to. I'll wait in the special activities room.

114
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,491
Your joke went too far.

115
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:45,504
- This is beyond what I can tolerateâ€” 
 - Then don't tolerate.

116
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,767
I'm doing this because I can't tolerate you, too.

117
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,468
What?

118
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:01,579
 The video has been deleted

119
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:11,181
I'll let it slide just this once.

120
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,093
Don't ever pull such a prank on me again.

121
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:16,736
Don't think about telling this to other people either.

122
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:21,261
No one will believe you even if you tell them anyway.

123
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,051
Okay?

124
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:36,126
Did you get that?

125
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:38,067
Yes, I got everything.

126
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:41,340
 - Well, why... Why are you here?  
 - Good job.

127
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,414
Gosh, I was so nervous.

128
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:46,525
- I got goosebumps, seriously. 
 - My goodness.

129
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:47,977
Gosh, it's hot.

130
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,728
- Seriously. 
 - That evil bastard.

131
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,460
You did a great job!

132
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,631
 Your joke went too far.

133
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:06,424
 Do you think people will take your side?

134
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:11,750
 You're only going to be criticized as a girl who flirts with men.

135
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:16,525
 If you do as I tell you,

136
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:20,070
 I'll even get you into college.

137
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,911
- Can you believe it? 
 - I know, right?

138
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:24,604
- Seriously... 
 - How could he?

139
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,895
He's unbelievable.

140
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,477
Aren't you getting in?

141
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,317
Gosh.

142
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:35,524
 Doors are closing.

143
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:39,168
Hello.

144
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:42,111
Let's just go. That's Mr. Kim.

145
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,295
This is Teacher Kim, right?

146
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,891
It's really him.

147
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:15,504
I can tell right away by his face and voice.

148
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:18,768
This must be fabricated. How can this be Teacher Kim?

149
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,038
Right?

150
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:23,092
But the video captured him too well for it to be fake.

151
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:25,634
I had no idea he'd do such a thing.

152
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:28,336
I know, right?

153
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:30,160
Who is that girl by the way?

154
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,103
- This is so satisfying. 
 - Was there a girl like her in our school?

155
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:35,804
Who is she?

156
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:52,000
All right. Come closer.

157
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:56,485
Give me your hand.

158
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:07,116
Teacher Kim ended up getting arrested.

159
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:11,140
Other victims reported him after the video went viral.

160
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,942
Turns out there were several students

161
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:17,296
who were victimized in a similar way at his previous school.

162
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:18,997
Is that right?

163
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:23,322
Do you think Ye Ri reported him too?

164
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,545
I don't know, but I guess she did,

165
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:29,097
judging by her bright face.

166
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:38,356
Ye Ri.

167
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,939
How did the contest go?

168
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,603
I got selected among the applicants.

169
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,674
So I'm still participating in the writing contest.

170
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:48,207
I see. I knew it.

171
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:51,660
I guess it's better for you this way.

172
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,145
Otherwise, people would talk this and that about you because of Teacher Kim.

173
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,576
Gu Hui.

174
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:59,187
Thank you.

175
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,571
For what?

176
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:04,023
For taking my side back then.

177
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:08,878
Oh, that. It's not even a big deal.

178
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,660
It's nothing.

179
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,012
Wait, Ga Eun.

180
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:15,153
Apologize to Ye Ri already.

181
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:17,646
Ye Ri,

182
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:20,348
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:27,297
This is why I told you so many times

184
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:30,029
that you should look at personality more than appearance in men.

185
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,103
What are you saying? You lack in both personality and appearance, so get lost.

186
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:38,457
Bye, girls.

187
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:39,998
Bye.

188
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:45,073
We should go, too.

189
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:56,614
The girl in that video...

190
00:11:57,807 --> 00:11:59,187
It was you, wasn't it?

191
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,140
How did you know?

192
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:09,447
She was tiny just like you.

193
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:14,482
Forget about it. I don't know how I pulled it off then.

194
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:17,135
Why?

195
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:23,511
I'll remember it forever.

196
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:26,585
You were really cool.

197
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:35,073
Right. I need to give you something.

198
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:36,805
Wait here.

199
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:49,668
It's your necktie.

200
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,570
I'm sorry for giving it back so late.

201
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,342
It's okay.

202
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:55,704
I should've given it back earlier,

203
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:58,537
but you know, things were a little hectic.

204
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:02,340
And I put in a small gift with it.

205
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,943
Open it later.

206
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,400
How cute.

207
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:21,059
 Coupon

208
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,219
Are you ready?

209
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:33,452
- All right. In position. 
 - Okay.

210
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,956
This should be in position too.

211
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,999
All right. Five seconds left.

212
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:46,566
- Go! 
 - Go!

213
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:47,937
 Astro

214
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,127
- Astro. 
 - More!

215
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:50,289
More!

216
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,942
They must top the search keyword list as soon as they release their album.

217
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:55,494
Type more! Search their names with every device you have!

218
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:57,656
Cha Eun Woo...

219
00:13:57,656 --> 00:14:00,789
- Use the F5 hotkey. 
 - All right.

220
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,081
What should I search?

221
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,583
- Anything about them. Astro! 
 - Okay.

222
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,804
They're the best.

223
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:07,316
Astro is the best.

224
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:09,709
More!

225
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,340
He's so cool!

226
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:13,993
Eun Woo is

227
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:16,274
so cool.

228
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:18,517
Oh, right. Do you like soy sauce marinated crabs?

229
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:20,118
What? Why do you ask?

230
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:23,241
I saw it earlier. Your mom is great.

231
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:25,755
- She was making soy sauce marinated crabs. 
  - It's for my baby.

232
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:27,477
This late at night.

233
00:14:27,477 --> 00:14:30,510
That's not for me. It's for Eun Woo.

234
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,290
What?

235
00:14:33,713 --> 00:14:36,795
Play the entire song, not just the preview.

236
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:38,537
Can't you do a better job with streaming?

237
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:39,839
All right. Yes ma'am.

238
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,071
It's done.

239
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,973
When you go to work tomorrow morning,

240
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:45,283
have this delivered by courier.

241
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:46,976
Use express courier so it won't spoil.

242
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:48,897
- Express, all right. 
 - The address is written here.

243
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,459
Yes.

244
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,932
My baby Eun Woo will be so happy to eat this.

245
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,675
Aigoo!

246
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:59,718
These two women go nuts whenever Asphalt or whatever makes a comeback.

247
00:14:59,718 --> 00:15:03,112
It's driving me crazy.

248
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,894
Their name is Astro.

249
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:06,666
It's Astro, not Asphalt.

250
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,767
You idiot.

251
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:08,827
- A. 
 - A.

252
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:09,788
- S. 
 - S.

253
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:10,709
- T. 
 - T.

254
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,621
- Ro. 
 - Ro.

255
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:13,111
- Astro. 
 - Astro.

256
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:14,943
- So what should you be doing now? 
 - Astro.

257
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,776
- Streaming. 
 - Oh, right.

258
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:18,547
- Do it already. 
 - All right. Streaming.

259
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:20,278
I'll just...

260
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:23,201
- Streaming. 
 - Streaming.

261
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:24,433
- All right. 
 - Right.

262
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,416
Play all songs.

263
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,689
Did you watch the music video yesterday? I stayed up all night watching it.

264
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:33,462
Check this out. I captured the scenes by frame.

265
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,294
Awesome.

266
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:37,135
I love them so much.

267
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,388
Ta-da, I got JinJin's picture.

268
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:41,831
Ta-da, mine is MJ's.

269
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,002
Jeong Deok Hui, what about you?

270
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:46,615
You only have one each?

271
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:49,878
I bought ten albums and got so many pictures of Oppa Eun Woo.

272
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:51,830
Goodness!

273
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,112
You're the best!

274
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:57,366
To be honest, he's just average-looking.

275
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:00,017
I think I'm better. Don't you agree?

276
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:05,455
Sorry.

277
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:06,765
Exterminate him.

278
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,647
Are you out of your mind?

279
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:09,929
Sorry.

280
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,681
- You're crazy! 
 - How dare you say that?

281
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:14,934
Your dead-fish eyes can't be compared to his deep eyes!

282
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,886
- You idiot! 
 - How dare you?

283
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:18,487
I'll make you shut up!

284
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:21,259
What a scene.

285
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:23,031
 Astro Fan Tour

286
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,615
 Eun Woo set: half fried, half seasoned, one soy sauce chicken.

287
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,811
This is the fried chicken restaurant that was added to the fan tour list, right?

288
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:34,663
- It was posted on Oppa Eun Woo's Instagram. 
 - Really?

289
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:36,335
Don't stop me.  I'll buy ten fried chickens.

290
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:37,556
Let's go!

291
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:39,477
Excuse me.

292
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,092
Will he be here today?

293
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:44,633
- Oh my god. 
 - I always check his Instagram

294
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:47,346
and it always says that he comes here. Do you think he'll really be here?

295
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:49,137
- I think he will this time. 
 - Yes.

296
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:50,600
I'm really excited he's here.

297
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,321
They're foreigners.

298
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:56,255
- I'll leave it up to you. 
 - Can't you take an order in English when you're a high school student?

299
00:16:56,255 --> 00:16:58,658
Oh my god. He'll be like sexy...

300
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:01,411
- Hi, where are you from? 
 - No.

301
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,783
I'm from New York.

302
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:07,636
Gosh, my son is good at speaking in English too.

303
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:09,488
You're so handsome.

304
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,190
Can we take a picture together?

305
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:16,695
Even foreigners recognize handsome men.

306
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:18,397
Thank you.

307
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:22,200
It looks like my face will be exposed as well.

308
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,781
Okay.

309
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,245
One, two, three.

310
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,557
Thank you.

311
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,351
- Goodness. 
 - Gosh.

312
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,686
My son.

313
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:39,067
- Goodness, seriously. 
 - Gosh.

314
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,191
What was that?

315
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:46,023
All right. The food is on its way.

316
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,614
Forget about the Eun Woo Set.

317
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:06,516
I can't eat anymore.

318
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:09,048
Right. Stop eating now.

319
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:12,321
You've been eating fried chicken for days.

320
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,884
He only ordered delivery...

321
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:20,008
and didn't visit this place, right?

322
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,460
That's right.

323
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,783
He won't come even if you hang around this place all day long.

324
00:18:28,196 --> 00:18:30,768
I want to see him.

325
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,003
He's too busy to come these days,

326
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:37,265
so technically, I'm not lying.

327
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:39,578
Sorry, Deok Hee.

328
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:44,823
"Please don't push me".

329
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,335
"Please don't push me."
 (In Japanese)

330
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:51,991
Right. No matter how busy you are as an avid fan of theirs,

331
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:53,993
you have to study from time to time.

332
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:56,265
- Why are you studying Japanese though? 
 - Oppa Eun Woo is holding a concert

333
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:59,628
in Japan this summer. I have to get prepared to go with him.

334
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:01,479
"Please don't push me."

335
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,651
It means, don't push me.

336
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:04,774
"Please don't touch me."

337
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:06,154
It means, don't touch me.

338
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:07,235
- I see. 
 - Okay.

339
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:09,738
You must be really busy these days.

340
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:11,710
Of course, I am.

341
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,573
I wish I had at least ten bodies.

342
00:19:14,573 --> 00:19:17,977
I pulled off something again yesterday.

343
00:19:17,977 --> 00:19:21,419
Everyone, their promotions in Korea are expected to be short this time,

344
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,083
so we must organize things systematically.

345
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:27,025
And we have to buy gifts for each member.

346
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,977
Does anyone have an idea?

347
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:31,990
What about limited-edition sneakers?

348
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,203
During promotion, their health condition is the most important.

349
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:36,414
Red ginseng extracts could be a good idea.

350
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:37,847
Go on.

351
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,688
There is a lot of micro dust these days.

352
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:42,230
How about we send them a high-end air purifier

353
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,922
and a clothing refresher?

354
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:50,760
Everyone, only the last issue remains.

355
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,353
"Eun Woo's Wifey" from Mapo Gu, known for her craftsmanship,

356
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:57,266
has prepared something special this time as well.

357
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:00,188
It's 100 percent handmade.

358
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:02,161
It's a stuffed Eun Woo doll.

359
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,332
Ta-da!

360
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:06,965
- It's so pretty. 
 - It's 20,000 won per unit.

361
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:09,088
There are only ten dolls for sale. Who wants them?

362
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:11,129
- Me! 
 - Me!

363
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:12,510
Line up, please.

364
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,053
- Can I touch it? 
 - No.

365
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,725
- It's so pretty. 
 - Come and check it out.

366
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:17,847
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

367
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:19,178
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

368
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,639
Thank you.

369
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,710
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

370
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:26,123
- Thank you. 
 - It's so pretty.

371
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:35,364
You're so cute. I love you.
 (In Japanese)

372
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:40,159
I'm getting more and more scared of you.

373
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,540
I might have to sell my organs

374
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,654
if I want to go to their Asia tour during vacation.

375
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:48,107
Oh my goodness. Eun Woo got involved in a scandal!

376
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:49,507
Daebak, check this out!

377
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:50,709
- What? 
 - What scandal?

378
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,561
Daebak. Read this.

379
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,984
- Is this for real? 
 - "Shock! Member of popular idol group

380
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:57,165
had late night date with a high school girl."

381
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,577
"Suspected to be dating a minor"?

382
00:20:58,577 --> 00:21:01,069
Guys, look at the pictures.

383
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:03,392
He's hugging her.

384
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:04,853
Are you sure he's Cha Eun Woo?

385
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:06,575
Can't you tell? It's obviously him.

386
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:08,316
By the way, isn't this our school uniform?

387
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:09,968
- What? 
 - Look.

388
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,469
Daebak.

389
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:14,763
You're right. Who is this wench?

390
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:16,765
These pictures...

391
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:18,536
No way.

392
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:21,169
 Make sure you tell me when something comes up.

393
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:24,142
 Okay. Thanks.

394
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:42,211
This is a conspiracy.

395
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:44,683
Dispatch* would've revealed it first if it was real.
 (Korean news and gossip magazine)

396
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:48,067
These pictures were taken by an amateur. Something's fishy.

397
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,629
She's wearing our school uniform.

398
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,922
Right. She could be one of them.

399
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:54,944
I'll find this girl and give her a lesson.

400
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:57,054
I'll protect my oppa.

401
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,917
 Handsome idol, Cha Eun Woo, on secret date with a high school girl.

402
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:17,716
Hello?

403
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:20,659
Gu Hui, is everything all right?

404
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:23,272
Oppa, what about you? How are you doing?

405
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:26,053
I'm all right, so don't worry.

406
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:31,840
How can it be all right? It's getting crazy.

407
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,012
It's not a big deal.

408
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:37,554
It'll quiet down after a small fuss.

409
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,749
Oppa...

410
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:44,302
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

411
00:22:44,302 --> 00:22:46,214
Should I write a post on the Internet?

412
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:48,606
Don't even think about doing such a thing.

413
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:50,668
I'll take care of it myself,

414
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:54,131
so act like you don't know anything until the end, okay?

415
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:58,576
Okay.

416
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:01,650
Okay. Good night.

417
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:15,443
Yes.

418
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:19,258
Yes, Reporter Park.

419
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:21,810
How could you release an article

420
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,473
about something that hasn't been confirmed to be true?

421
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,515
Delete it.

422
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:30,769
Think about how we've been cooperating with you.

423
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:34,762
Yes, please do that. Bye.

424
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:40,239
Don't go to your dorm and stay here for the time being.

425
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,809
Who's she?

426
00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:47,556
You have to tell me if you want me to deal with it.

427
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:50,528
Hyeong, can't you trust me?

428
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,592
- It's not what you think. 
 - Then who is she?

429
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:56,645
Call her in and do a press interview or something.

430
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:00,889
That's not an option. Whatever I say at this point, it will cause a ruckus.

431
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:03,662
Let's go according to our schedule.

432
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:05,074
I'll take care of it.

433
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:08,267
A tiny tinderbox could burn down the entire house.

434
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:11,539
The other members will be in trouble because of you.

435
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:13,582
Who on earth is she?

436
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,525
 I must not reveal who she is.

437
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,206
 I don't know what will happen to her if I do.

438
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:27,596
 Bye.

439
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:29,678
 - Bye. 
 - See you.

440
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,684

441
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:47,685
â™ª  Dance excitedly and freeze just like that  â™ª

442
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:52,649
â™ª  Dance excitedly and freeze just like that  â™ª

443
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:57,735
 Now that you sang for me, I don't feel sick anymore.

444
00:24:57,735 --> 00:25:01,170
 Really? Ajumma, I'm going to marry Oppa Eun Woo,

445
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,062
 so I'll come and sing for you every day.

446
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:05,684
 Really?

447
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:09,968
 I'll be so happy if you become my daughter-in-law.

448
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:14,062
 I'll give you a massage before Oppa Eun Woo comes, so you should recover soon.

449
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:16,214
 All right, then.

450
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,927
 Aigoo, that feels so good.

451
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:20,978
 How nice.

452
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:24,193
 You're good at massaging. It feels good.

453
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:29,598
 - Mom. 
 - Mommy.

454
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:31,819
 Let's go.

455
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:41,420
 Oppa Eun Woo.

456
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,132
 - Gu Hui. 
 - I brought an umbrella for you.

457
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:46,425
 Your mom can't come because she's sick.

458
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:48,826
 Thank you, Gu Hui. Let's go.

459
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:09,678
Thank you.

460
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:11,809
The manager asked me

461
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:14,132
to feed you something.

462
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:16,384
Do you need anything else?

463
00:26:16,384 --> 00:26:18,497
I'm all right.

464
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:20,128
Isn't it tough practicing these days?

465
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:21,710
Like always.

466
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,033
Just worry about yourself, and take care of your health.

467
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,995
See you.

468
00:26:26,995 --> 00:26:28,596
Bye.

469
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:49,316
I think it's somewhere around here.

470
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:53,322
What?

471
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:56,753
Who ordered fried chicken in this large park?

472
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,743
What are you doing?

473
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:16,774
What do you mean? We're waiting for our delivery.

474
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:21,838
So there was a reason why you said you craved fried chicken all of a sudden.

475
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:26,744
You're slacking off while I'm working my butt off.

476
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:28,306
Here.

477
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:32,281
It's originally 34,000 won,

478
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:35,364
but with the coupon, it's 17,000 won.

479
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:39,457
Take a break. He ordered two so you could join us.

480
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,858
Eat before you go.

481
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:44,132
Don't do this. I need to go.

482
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:03,040
You're sloppy.

483
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,053
Deok Hui, it's hard for me because my hands are slow.

484
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:38,706
You have to succeed, no matter what.

485
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:41,559
Mom, I'm so nervous. What if I fail right away?

486
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,583
No, you can do it because you're my girl.

487
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:47,064
Make consecutive attempts so that you can secure my ticket too.

488
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:51,699
If you succeed, I'll raise your allowance by 100 percent, all right?

489
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,786
Come on.

490
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:00,258
Get ready.

491
00:29:00,258 --> 00:29:02,811
- All right. 
 - Five, four,

492
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:05,824
- three, two, one. 
 - Three, two, one.

493
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:07,676
Gosh! I can't get in!

494
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:09,497
Darn it! I can't access!

495
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,140
Hurry! Try again.

496
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,701
- Gosh, I can't get in! 
 - No!

497
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,473
Come on.

498
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:24,822
I see the grapes.

499
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:26,123
 Grapes (empty seats)

500
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:27,315
Hurry.

501
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:28,937
Wait, gosh.

502
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,729
- It's already taken. 
 - What?

503
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,912
Yes!

504
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,464
- Oh dear. 
 - Why did it have to be so hard?

505
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:47,044
All of them bought tickets.

506
00:29:47,044 --> 00:29:49,026
- It'sâ€” 
 - You useless brat.

507
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:51,750
Why are you so slow?  Did I give birth to a slug?

508
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,003
I made mustard leaf kimchi to feed my baby, what am I going to do with it?

509
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,396
Raising your allowance? Forget it.

510
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,907
Don't even bother to come home.

511
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,403
Congratulations!

512
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:20,579
Gosh, it's so tiring.

513
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:22,529
Put it in.

514
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:25,093
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

515
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:26,435
Hello.

516
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:27,885
- Hi. 
 - What's up?

517
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:29,858
Eun Woo Set is sold out today.

518
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:31,919
I couldn't buy the tickets for the concert.

519
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,363
It looked like my mom would beat me to a pulp,

520
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:35,965
so I came here.

521
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:40,448
I see. Go upstairs first. I'll come too, after I'm done with this.

522
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:42,079
Okay.

523
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,281
- Bye. 
 - Go upstairs.

524
00:30:45,893 --> 00:30:48,085
What was she talking about?

525
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:50,208
What tickets?

526
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:52,349
You don't have to know.

527
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:07,003
Who are you?

528
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:11,218
Here, drink this.

529
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:20,678
So you're Gu Hui's classmate, Deok Hui?

530
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,491
That's right.

531
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:24,453
Thank you for this.

532
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:26,555
I have to head outside again.

533
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:28,456
It must be boring to wait alone.

534
00:31:29,477 --> 00:31:31,469
Oh, hold on.

535
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:40,738
This will help you to kill time.

536
00:31:40,738 --> 00:31:42,971
Yes, sure. Thank you.

537
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:45,684
See you again, Orabeoni*.
 (*antiquated form of "oppa")

538
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,285
Bye.

539
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:53,971
My gosh. Gu Hui is a total liar.

540
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:57,635
She said her brother was an idiot, but he's actually really cool.

541
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:02,269
And his abs...

542
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:09,357
I should visit here often.

543
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:21,809
Orabeoni Gu Jun was so cute when he was little.

544
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:25,953
Gu Hui was quite adorable too.

545
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:28,526
She became uglier as she grew up.

546
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:42,419
What is this?

547
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:00,288
 ~ Revenge Note 1 ~

548
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,589
Let's share an umbrella.

549
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:02,990
But you go in the opposite direction.

550
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,692
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

551
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:07,906
I guess it's real. The video is going viral this time.

552
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:10,619
The cue sheet got changed suddenly, so we aren't shooting today.

553
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:13,330
I need to know who it is to do something.

554
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,063
Explain or take responsibility!

555
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:17,354
Do something!

556
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:24,462
