10
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:37,637
Gosh, that's a nuisance.

11
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,620
What should we do?  Do you want to go back inside?

12
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:45,094
No.

13
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,764
Gu Hui, why aren't you answering my calls?

14
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:55,505
Why would I answer your calls?

15
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:57,857
You're still mad?

16
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,149
I told you I was sorry.

17
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,091
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:02,943
I'll apologize, too. I'm sorry.

19
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:05,075
I won't see you ever again.

20
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:07,487
I'm doing this much for you. Aren't you being too hard on me?

21
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:09,028
You're ugly. You should know your place.

22
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,370
Do you think you'll find someone better than me?

23
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,603
That's right. Do you have someone behind your back?

24
00:01:14,603 --> 00:01:16,876
You have Jeong Wu, and you're flirting with Ji Hun.

25
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:18,749
- Is she a two-timer? 
 - She's not exactly a two-timer.

26
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:20,500
Do you think Ji Hun would even look at her?

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,132
All right. Nan Hui, stop it!

28
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:25,384
You should go fix your makeup if you've got time to gossip.

29
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:28,137
- You're ugly. 
 - Did I say something wrong?

30
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:31,470
Everything you said is wrong. Ji Hun was the one chasing after Gu Hui.

31
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,263
Gu Hui wasn't chasing after Ji Hun!

32
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:34,855
So Ji Hun's the one chasing after Gu Hui?

33
00:01:34,855 --> 00:01:36,356
That's nonsense.

34
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:38,747
What are you talking about?

35
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:44,945
Mo Ugly and Gi Trash!

36
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:47,987
Will you two get out of my sight?

37
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:50,300
Yes, I like Ji Hun!

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,203
And he probably isn't even interested in me!

39
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:56,245
But just because I like Ji Hun, does that mean

40
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:59,589
I deserve to be humiliated and ridiculed by you guys?

41
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:17,978
Gu Hui, it's raining. Let's go.

42
00:02:17,978 --> 00:02:19,598
Hurry up.

43
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,616
  Did he hear it? He must've heard it all.

44
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:48,377
  This is so embarrassing.

45
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,310
You dummy. You're wrong.

46
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:55,274
I am very interested in you.

47
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:26,385
  It was a moment to remember forever.

48
00:03:26,385 --> 00:03:27,637
  Everyone,

49
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:31,069
  this is how dangerous an umbrella can be.

50
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:36,125
Let's go. I'll take you home.

51
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:46,536
Mo Nan Hui, are you watching?

52
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:48,147
  Your revenge is complete

53
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:52,791
Gosh, what's taking her so long?

54
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,699
I tried so hard to prevent it,

55
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,761
but I guess things happen if they're supposed to.

56
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,132
  We're going in.

57
00:04:13,132 --> 00:04:16,096
  - I'm home. 
 - Is your sister home?

58
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,997
  - Gosh. 
 - This must be her room.

59
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:19,059
  - Hey. 
 - Show us.

60
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,219
  That's the master bedroom.

61
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,791
  - Show us. 
 - Come on.

62
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:26,086
  Do you really think I'd show my sister to a bunch of animals like you?

63
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:29,168
  - Wake up.  
 - He's so protective of his sister.

64
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,443
  If you keep guarding her like that, you might lose her to someone unexpected.

65
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:37,116
  It's none of your business.  I'll protect my sister in my own way.

66
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,839
  Guard her all your life. My goodness.

67
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,451
But...

68
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,844
Where on earth did that kid come from?

69
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,295
Whatever.

70
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:01,640
- Is there a dry towel inside? 
 - Yes.

71
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:15,444
  Med School Goddess

72
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:25,525
Hello?

73
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,206
  Isn't this Gu Jun's phone?

74
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:31,059
It is. He's taking a shower right now.

75
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,443
  Who is this?

76
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:38,697
I'm the one who showered first.

77
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:40,619
  Where are you?

78
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,472
I'm on top of a bed.   Should I tell him to call you back?

79
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:47,025
  No, tell him I don't want to see him ever again!

80
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,960
Yes.

81
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:56,665
The joke's on you.

82
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,322
Gosh, how could I leave my homework there?

83
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,315
I'm so stupid.

84
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,807
Oh, my. What's this?

85
00:06:12,882 --> 00:06:14,874
Incredible!

86
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:19,117
Isn't that Ga Eun?

87
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:28,047
What should I do?

88
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:30,419
Gosh, why do they have to be there?

89
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,241
That was cute.

90
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,874
  Listen to this one.

91
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,757
  She was just...

92
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,680
This song is really good.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,632
Isn't it good?

94
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,738
He sings well. He's my friend.

95
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:02,812
How about bright colors?

96
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:05,345
Well, it's very...

97
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:08,557
I know.

98
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,553
You there.

99
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:17,696
What are you doing here this late?

100
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:19,139
Well,

101
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,860
I just left something in the classroom.

102
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,015
You should go.   The lights will be out soon.

103
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:26,155
Yes.

104
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:27,717
Ah, yes.

105
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,909
Oh, my gosh, Ajussi!  It's a bug.

106
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,122
- What?  
 - What do we do?

107
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:35,375
It's so big and scary. Ajussi, I'm so scared.

108
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,827
Could you walk me to the schoolyard?

109
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:39,268
Gosh.

110
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:42,420
- All right. Come on. 
 - Thank you.

111
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:46,955
Thank you.

112
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,581
The bug flew by and it was so big.

113
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,342
- Gu Hui. 
 - You scared me.

114
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:05,635
Gosh, I told you to knock.

115
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,346
Why are you so surprised?

116
00:08:07,346 --> 00:08:09,448
- Were you watching porn? 
 - I'm not like you.

117
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,449
What is it?

118
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,181
I brought ice cream

119
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:15,734
for my lovely sister. Here.

120
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:19,449
What? What's going on?

121
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,011
Isn't she that girl?

122
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,113
Wasn't she close to you?

123
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:26,495
Is it Ga Eun?

124
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:29,459
Don't take pictures with pretty girls like her.

125
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,521
You look even uglier, Dear Sister.

126
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:35,293
- Get lost. 
 - Do you still hang out with her?

127
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:40,059
No, we're not close anymore.

128
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,983
We're not exactly close...

129
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:46,876
I don't know. Get out.

130
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,557
Okay.

131
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:51,290
But give me a bite of your ice cream.

132
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:54,744
I gave you the last ice cream, so you should at least give me a bite.

133
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,169
- All right. Just take one bite.  
 - Okay.

134
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,092
- Just take one bite.  
 - Yes, just one bite.

135
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:09,759
Hey.

136
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,600
You crazy... Hey!

137
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,533
What is this? Why didn't you just eat it yourself?

138
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,055
Why did you give it to me in the first place?

139
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,157
Enjoy your ice cream.

140
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,772
Oh, my gosh.

141
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:25,324
What do I do with him?

142
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:27,516
I'm so stressed out.

143
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:31,270
What is this? The filling is gone.

144
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,702
We're tightening control these days

145
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:36,536
over dating on school grounds.

146
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:40,209
A couple who were having a date in an empty classroom last night

147
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:42,091
were caught.

148
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,274
You sure have a lot of guts.

149
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:47,286
  Did she get caught?

150
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,299
The sophomores who got caught yesterday

151
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:52,182
were suspended and got a bunch of penalties.

152
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:54,973
It is absolutely prohibited.

153
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:56,055
  I guess it's not her.

154
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,806
In this class,

155
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:01,610
I don't think there will be any.

156
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,612
- Come on.  
 - What do you mean?

157
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:06,365
If you witness and report any dating on school grounds,

158
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:09,068
- you will be rewarded with points. 
 - Yes, Teacher.

159
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,990
It sounds too cruel to your friends, right?

160
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,114
So if you don't want anyone to witness something and fall into a dilemma,

161
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:19,229
don't do anything you'd be guilty of in the first place.

162
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,130
That's all.

163
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:23,741
Hi.

164
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,790
Hello, Yu Ra.

165
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,092
Hi, do you want to sit and join us?

166
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:35,053
Can I do that?

167
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:37,046
Sure. Sit down.

168
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
We were talking about

169
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,562
the short-term training in Europe during the break.

170
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:45,123
Is that so?

171
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:47,306
You can join in if you're interested.

172
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:50,319
I'm really interested in that.

173
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:53,031
So how many people can join?

174
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:54,964
Isn't it around 15 people?

175
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:57,476
Wouldn't it be full by now?

176
00:10:57,476 --> 00:10:59,438
It's probably full.

177
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:00,829
But

178
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:03,753
it's only one more person, so it'll be okay.

179
00:11:03,753 --> 00:11:05,655
Thank you.

180
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,836
Hey, Ga Eun must be

181
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:10,949
really close to those seniors now.

182
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:15,594
You could say she's almost an official member of HIVA now.

183
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:18,037
I'm so jealous.

184
00:11:18,037 --> 00:11:20,119
Why are you staring at them?

185
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,662
Are you interested in the short-term Europe training, too?

186
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:25,854
I don't think they'll let you in.

187
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:28,206
I'm not interested.

188
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:32,010
If my grades don't go up, I'll end up working part-time all day.

189
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,263
Your mom's very wise.

190
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:36,406
She supports the son with potential

191
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:38,997
and lets the hopeless daughter learn about the worth of labor early on.

192
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:40,698
Be quiet.

193
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,686
What a beautiful sight.

194
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:22,040
What's wrong with me?

195
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,152
Let's forget about it.

196
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:52,190
  Water

197
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:57,946
You surprised me.

198
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:01,170
Get your own water.

199
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,310
  What are you doing?

200
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,144
  I'm going to bed soon. Are you home from the hagwon?

201
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:16,774
  Yes.

202
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,930
  I see. Did you have dinner?

203
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,511
  Yes.

204
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:29,568
  Don't you use any emojis?

205
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:32,672
  I don't. I'm too lazy to use them.

206
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:35,293
  Is that so?

207
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:38,496
  You must be too lazy to text then. Good night.

208
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,472
Are you kidding me?

209
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:48,477
You held an umbrella for me in front of everyone,

210
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:52,322
and all you can say now is   "Okay" and "Yes?"

211
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:54,073
I'm speechless.

212
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,625
This is annoying.

213
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:08,958
  You're like a transportation card.

214
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,690
  What? What do you mean?

215
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,882
  You tag at my heart strings

216
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:16,245
  every single day.

217
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,529
  Do you want to play catch ball next time?

218
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,451
  Catch ball?

219
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:25,475
  I'm not good at catching balls.

220
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:30,228
  Then how did you catch my heart at once?

221
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:37,886
Where did Ji Hun learn all this stuff?

222
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:40,870
He's so cute.

223
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,081
  Texts that your girlfriend will love

224
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:54,372
  Patient: Your Name 
Name of Disease: Love

225
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:56,574
  Prescription: 100 kisses 
 Diagnosis: Call me anytime

226
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:16,615
It's expensive, so be  careful with it, Ho Gu Hui.

227
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:20,048
If it's that expensive, why doesn't she carry it herself?

228
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:25,053
- What is it? 
 - Look at this.

229
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:27,085
It's her?

230
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:28,707
- Isn't it her? 
 - I think it's her.

231
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:31,089
- What? 
 - I think it is her.

232
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:33,061
She's a freshman at our school.

233
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:35,884
  - How can she come to school?  
 - Seriously?

234
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,506
  - It's her.  
 - It's really her.

235
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:39,148
  It's definitely her.

236
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,260
  - Oh, my gosh. 
 - I know, right?

237
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,383
- Unbelievable. 
 - I know.

238
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,956
- It's her. 
 -  I don't think it's her.

239
00:15:47,956 --> 00:15:49,627
No way.

240
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:57,736
Hey, come here.

241
00:15:57,736 --> 00:16:00,549
Come here. Look at this.

242
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,372
What is it?

243
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:06,595
What is this?

244
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:09,538
What do you think it is?  It's a photo of a body.

245
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:11,650
You can tell who it is, right?

246
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,551
It's Yeo Ga Eun.

247
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,439
Your daddy's on a roll these days.

248
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:33,952
Everyone's talking about him after the hearing.

249
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:34,764
Yeah, I guess.

250
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:36,665
Oh, didn't you say you were going to attend

251
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:39,277
the International Science Fair as a Seoul rep?

252
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:40,459
Are you ready for that?

253
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,532
Yeah, I just finished writing the presentation speech.

254
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:46,215
VIPs from all around the country are coming.

255
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,317
Are you ready to become super famous?

256
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:52,622
Don't get ahead of yourself.

257
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:55,725
Eonni, I asked my mother about the training—

258
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:58,946
We don't have any vacancies for freshmen.

259
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:08,366
I lost my appetite.

260
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:10,108
I'm done.

261
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:40,469
What's wrong with me?

262
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:43,000
Gosh, it's bugging me.

263
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:45,735
  Hanjong High School

264
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:58,187
This is you, right?

265
00:17:58,187 --> 00:18:01,920
Look closer. It's you.

266
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,992
Isn't it?

267
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,905
I'm at a loss for words.

268
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,948
Why didn't you just take off everything?

269
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:10,159
You sure are something.

270
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,704
You don't deserve to join our club.

271
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:18,027
I completely fell for the façade she put on in front of me.

272
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:20,279
Do you think we're stupid?

273
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,602
You deceived us, you wench.

274
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,928
Oh, no. Your clothes are dirty.

275
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:33,222
Take it off. Are you still wearing the polka dot bra?

276
00:18:33,222 --> 00:18:35,173
Let me see.

277
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:37,125
It's not me.

278
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:40,128
I'm telling you it's not me!

279
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,871
Is it really Ga Eun?

280
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:56,665
Then did that guy spread that photo?

281
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:12,560
Why do you even care? Is your empathy working up again?

282
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:17,436
It's a bit weird to leave it here.

283
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:21,109
Why are you taking it when even her friends left it?

284
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:22,721
Do you know where she lives?

285
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:26,414
I do. I used to go there a lot.

286
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,488
  I'm going to introduce a new classmate.

287
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,953
  I'm Yeo Ga Eun from Gangnam.

288
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:35,433
  It's nice to meet you all.

289
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,336
  There's an empty seat next to Gu Hui. You can sit there.

290
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:45,272
  Okay. Let's start class.

291
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,800
  This is where we left off, right?

292
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,511
  You can look at mine.

293
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:54,933
  Thanks.

294
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:58,217
  Wow! You have a lot of cute stuff.

295
00:19:58,217 --> 00:19:59,618
  Is it only sold in Gangnam?

296
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:02,210
  My dad works in the States. He sent it from there.

297
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,852
  - Awesome. 
 - That's amazing.

298
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:07,677
  No wonder. It felt like it would be from the States.

299
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:09,607
  Your shoes are really cute, too.

300
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:12,822
  - They're trendy.  
 - My dad sent these, too.

301
00:20:12,822 --> 00:20:14,552
  Your dad has a good sense of style.

302
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:16,373
  It's really pretty.

303
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:26,856
  Here.

304
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:28,777
  You can wear mine. They're clean.

305
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:30,289
  No, you need them, too.

306
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:32,530
  Our gym teacher is really strict.

307
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,242
  You don't want to anger him on your first day.

308
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:36,555
  It's okay. You can wear it.

309
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:38,817
  - Thanks.  
 - Sure.

310
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,600
  What are you...

311
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,024
  Is this the new fashion trend these days?

312
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:47,026
  What did your mom wear today then?

313
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:50,438
  I've told you so many times that your attire is the basics.

314
00:20:50,438 --> 00:20:52,340
  Are you rebelling or what?

315
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,703
  Turn around.

316
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,176
  Hurry up.

317
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:58,847
  Run while squatting. Now.

318
00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:00,890
  Sir.

319
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,222
  I just transferred today and I didn't have my uniform,

320
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,423
  so Gu Hui lent me hers.

321
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:07,135
  Really?

322
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:11,480
  Then I shouldn't punish her.

323
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,682
  Were you expecting that?

324
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:17,274
  You should've prepared it. You turn around, too.

325
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:21,499
  You two run while squatting. Now.

326
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,850
  - Gosh. 
 - Gosh.

327
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:43,182
  - This is the cubic root of i. 
 -  Yes.

328
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:46,504
  You need to add these like that.

329
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:48,276
  Cheers.

330
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,462
  One, two, three.

331
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:17,366
  You had an affair and even left your daughter.

332
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:20,299
  Are you telling me to take this and leave you alone?

333
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:24,652
  Look at the divorce papers closely and send more money, you jerk!

334
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,924
  Stop drinking.

335
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:39,808
  Just go study.

336
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:43,222
  You wanted to move to another school because you were ashamed of my divorce.

337
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:45,063
  That's why we moved here.

338
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:49,428
  If your grades fall, I'm going to kill myself.

339
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:51,830
  - So keep that in mind. 
 - Stop it!

340
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,682
  I hate the smell of alcohol. I'm sick of it!

341
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:23,621
  You invited me to do homework together, and the door was open...

342
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:31,169
  Ga Eun!

343
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:45,034
  The seats have changed.

344
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:48,497
  Ga Eun said she couldn't see well,

345
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:50,418
  so she asked me to switch seats with her.

346
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:52,489
  Is that so?

347
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,322
  It smells really good.

348
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:06,945
  - Is it rose? It smells like rose.  
 - I think it is.

349
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,307
  I like this scent.

350
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:11,830
  Ga Eun, did you bring the notebook you borrowed from me yesterday?

351
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,063
  I forgot.

352
00:24:14,063 --> 00:24:17,445
  - Is this for cuticles? 
 - Yes.

353
00:24:17,445 --> 00:24:20,798
  Without it, I'll get a zero on my performance assessment.

354
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:23,301
  - It's unique. 
 - I know.

355
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:25,875
  How does this smell different though?

356
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,555
  - It's so soft. 
 - Yes.

357
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:29,538
  - Let's go to the noraebang* today. 
 - Okay. 
(*karaoke place)

358
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:32,230
  - Really? Okay. 
 - Let's just go.

359
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,353
  - I'm hungry. 
 - Hey, come on.

360
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,024
  -  No. 
 - Let's just go together.

361
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:39,148
  -  Do it later.  
 - Let's eat something at the noraebang.

362
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:41,289
  Hurry.

363
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:47,365
  This is

364
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,748
  my performance assessment notebook

365
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:53,280
  that Ga Eun borrowed from me.

366
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:56,165
  - Here. 
 - Pass.

367
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:59,678
  - Hey. 
 -  Over here.

368
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:01,170
  - Over here.  
 - Pass it.

369
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,641
  - Here. 
 - Pass it.

370
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:06,164
  - Are you all right? 
 - Are you okay?

371
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:09,018
  Are you all right?

372
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:10,389
  What happened?

373
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:13,421
  - Did you bump into Gu Hui?  
 - I don't know.

374
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:16,064
  Why did you push me all of a sudden?

375
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:18,106
  I didn't push you...

376
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:20,718
  She must be mad at me because of her notes.

377
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:24,443
  I didn't do it. Trust me, Gu Hui.

378
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:26,195
  What's wrong with you, Gu Hui?

379
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:28,197
  Are you okay, Ga Eun? Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

380
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:30,017
  Hold on.

381
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,616
  She got hurt because of you, so carry it.

382
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:11,700
  Here are your snacks.

383
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,501
  Leave it here.

384
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:18,836
  It looks good.

385
00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:59,127
  Ga Eun, we need to talk.

386
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:02,820
   I can't think of a reason why you're suddenly doing this to me.

387
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,583
  What do you mean?

388
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,174
  I mean...

389
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:09,217
  You suddenly changed seats and you...

390
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:12,511
  What did I do? Go tell everyone if you think it's unfair.

391
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:16,054
  Try telling them that I'm a liar.

392
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:18,035
  I won't let anyone believe you.

393
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:20,568
  I moved here for a reason.

394
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,882
  You saw everything.

395
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:28,145
  I don't like it. I just don't!

396
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,232
  Enjoy your meal.

397
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:38,396
  I didn't do anything wrong.

398
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:42,670
  But after a while, it was a mess.

399
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:45,734
  If there was Revenge Note back then,

400
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:48,676
  I would've written your name countless times.

401
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:14,682
You really like stepping into other people's business, don't you?

402
00:28:14,682 --> 00:28:17,906
- Did you think I'd be thankful for this? 
 - You said it was expensive.

403
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,558
Why would you leave it there?

404
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:21,620
Did you come to see if I was crying?

405
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,982
Why do you always have to witness situations like this?

406
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:26,024
Who do you think you are?!

407
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:29,367
Yes, I came to see if you were crying over your expensive bag.

408
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,509
I should've just left it there, not caring whether someone steals it or not.

409
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,581
I shouldn't have brought it here.

410
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:47,085
At least come to school.

411
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:48,897
The guy who uploaded it is the bad one.

412
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:51,128
He's not that kind of person.

413
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,282
It's not me.

414
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:56,543
What would you know?

415
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:00,097
Be quiet.

416
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:19,116
I need to know who it is to write a name.

417
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:20,508
  Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

418
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,573
I don't know.

419
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:27,695
Why am I even caring about that evil girl?

420
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:57,966
These are the perks of a co-ed school.

421
00:29:57,966 --> 00:29:59,918
God Ji Hun and Flower Boy Seonbae.

422
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:03,181
It's full of handsome people. This is the Idol Star Athletics Championships.

423
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:12,340
Lee Gang Min doesn't look so bad either. He's pretty good.

424
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:20,748
I guess someone has her eyes on only one guy.

425
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,894
Hey, those shoes...

426
00:30:25,894 --> 00:30:29,277
- What?  
 -  The shoes that this seonbae is wearing.

427
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:32,290
They're limited edition.

428
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,043
How could an unfashionable girl like you  recognize those?

429
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,966
Those are the 800,000-won  (≈ $700)  sneakers  that G-Dragon wore.

430
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:39,787
They cost 800,000 won?    (≈ $700.00)

431
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:42,210
Those sneakers cost 800,000 won?

432
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:46,805
I had to beg for a month  to get shoes that cost 80,000 won.

433
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:50,046
As expected, this Seonbae is definitely on another level.

434
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,182
Then

435
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:08,125
there wouldn't be many people with those shoes, right?

436
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:12,320
He would probably be the only one in our school.

437
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,382
Why? Do you want them?

438
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:16,964
Are you going to work all summer to buy a pair of sneakers?

439
00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:18,665
Are you crazy?

440
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:22,850
I was just curious.

441
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:28,796
  I'm pretty sure he was wearing those shoes.

442
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:32,099
  No way.

443
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:37,695
  ~ Revenge Note 1 ~ 
 Preview

444
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:40,197
  She's a total romantic.

445
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:42,490
  He's actually a bit old.

446
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,161
  - What? 
 - Guys, I have big news!

447
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:45,643
  Teacher Eum Chi Hun is getting married.

448
00:31:45,643 --> 00:31:48,286
  How could you do that?

449
00:31:48,286 --> 00:31:51,268
  How could you do this to me?

450
00:31:51,268 --> 00:31:53,732
  What? Are you sure?

451
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:55,596
  You piece of trash.

452
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:59,798
