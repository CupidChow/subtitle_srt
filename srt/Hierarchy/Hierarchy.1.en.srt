HIERARCHY

00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,229
Crazy.

3
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,647
Everyone is crazy.

4
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,818
Everyone in this school is insane!

5
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,863
I'm going to expose it all!

6
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,161
Everyone is crazy!

7
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:28,963
Every person in this school is insane,
teachers and students alike!

8
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,882
Forget it! I will expose it all.

9
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,385
I'll expose everything
that happened at this crazy school.

EPISODE 1
NEWBIE PARTY: TRUTH OR DARE

12
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,483
This problem is as good as solved
once you graph

13
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,152
the absolute value of f(x)…

14
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:39,909
That answer…

15
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,871
"I saw thee weep - the big bright tear

16
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,331
Came o'er that eye of blue

17
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,459
And then methought it did appear…"

18
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,331
FIRST SEMESTER OPENING CEREMONY

19
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,926
At Jooshin High, South Korea's
most prestigious private institution

20
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,972
celebrated for its history and tradition,
a new semester has begun.

21
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,020
Ahead of this new beginning,

22
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,941
we're putting into practice
Jooshin's motto "noblesse oblige,"

23
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,777
as we open the doors to a new semester.

24
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,863
Introducing our new scholarship student,

25
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,907
who was chosen through…

26
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,911
a rigorous selection process.

27
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,624
Mr. Kang Ha?

28
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,626
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,010
Why keep letting in scholarship students
when they never last very long?

30
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,513
"Poor kids deserve a chance too."

31
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,516
"Noblesse oblige." They won't let it go.

32
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,851
-The principal?
-No.

33
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,061
Jooshin's owners.

34
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,854
Ri-an's parents.

35
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,648
Good morning,

36
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,151
classmates, seniors, and underclassmen.

37
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,196
My name is Kang Ha.

38
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,077
I was the first to receive full marks on…

39
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,127
Hey.

40
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,894
As the first student to get full…

41
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,278
-So you came.
-You're late.

42
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,992
Please continue.

43
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,036
Oh, it's working.

44
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,413
Right. So I'm…

45
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,750
Right. Full marks.
Yes, I received full marks.

46
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,461
-He has a cute smile.
-I'm happy and excited…

47
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,463
Doesn't he remind you of a puppy?

48
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:42,508
…transferring to Korea's
best private high school, Jooshin High.

49
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,802
My time here began with full marks,

50
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,765
and I intend to do my best
to maintain that until the end.

51
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,600
I look forward to the year ahead.

52
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,941
JUST TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON

53
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,486
ANSWER THE PHONE, JAE-I
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

54
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,241
With that, our ceremony comes to a close.

55
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,870
Students, please make your way
to your individual classes.

56
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,499
-What are you doing? Sit.
-Why?

57
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,416
Just sit down.

58
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,126
What is it?

59
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,545
That jerk. Fuck.

60
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,767
What were you doing?
I was messaging Ye-ji.

61
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:37,939
Excuse me.

62
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,484
Hi. You saw earlier, right?
I'm the new scholarship student.

63
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,610
I have English first,

64
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,446
but I don't know where to go.
Do you have English now?

65
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,907
You're too chipper.

66
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,535
It'll take you a while to know your place.

67
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,452
What?

68
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,455
Getting to know what?
Buddy? You're just leaving?

69
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,631
These girls will show you
where your classroom is.

70
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,134
Can I have your number?

71
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,927
What? My number?

72
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,804
What was that face?

73
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,640
I'm sure there's a lot
you're curious about.

74
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,183
Ask if you have any questions.

75
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,268
Oh, really?

76
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,437
Thanks.

77
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,605
-What's your username?
-We'll follow back.

78
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,107
I don't have an account.

79
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,233
You don't?

80
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,151
No.

81
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,404
Here's my number.

82
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,905
Thanks. See you around.

83
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,075
-Wow.
-Wow.

84
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,453
He is really odd.

85
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,546
What is this?

86
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,053
Never mind.

87
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,267
Good morning.

88
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,604
Scholarship student?
You're not allowed in here.

89
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,355
But I have English now.

90
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,399
Standard A is at the end of the hall.

91
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,484
This is Special A.

92
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,360
So it's not here.

93
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,240
-Hi.
-The scholarship kid.

94
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,241
Why is he here?

95
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,174
That's my seat.

96
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,468
Is it?

97
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,761
Oh, sorry.

98
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:33,888
That's my friend's.

99
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,308
Oh, is it?

100
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,476
What a mess.

101
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,311
Look at his tie.

102
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,815
He's really flaunting his peasant status.

103
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,319
I think he smells funny too.

104
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,029
He smells homeless, right?

105
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,913
Not even a bag hook.

106
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,742
You shaved off 1.25 seconds.

107
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,329
Ri-an, let's have lunch.

108
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,042
Done for the day?

109
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,714
I am.
Ri-an, you have one more class, right?

110
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,259
At 4:00 p.m. International politics.

111
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,854
Woo-jin's acting suspiciously these days.
Is he seeing someone?

112
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,941
How's Jae-i? Still not heard from her yet?

113
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,211
If you're giving each other
the cold shoulder,

114
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,339
then maybe

115
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,636
I should be eyeing the throne
while the queen is absent.

116
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,056
What would work best to win you over?

117
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,184
I spent all break working out.

118
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,396
Why don't you take a look
and see if it was worth the effort?

119
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,651
I don't need to look.

120
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,364
I already know you have
a better body than most models.

121
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,240
So

122
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,660
stop messing around.

123
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,082
I wasn't messing around.
But it looks like I should say I was.

124
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,585
Where are you going?

125
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,753
I have plans.

126
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,631
I'm not leaving out of embarrassment.

127
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,574
Jae-i!

128
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,220
What were you doing alone
in the US for three months?

129
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,431
I have younger cousins in Irvine.

130
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,890
I was busy.

131
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,270
I'm disappointed.
You ignored all my calls and messages.

132
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,647
I guess Woo-jin
and I don't matter as much.

133
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,316
Did you ignore Ri-an the whole time too?

134
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,406
Figures. His negative energy
could've burned a hole through the earth.

135
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,324
What's going on? Did you two fight?

136
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,663
Even so, you two are a package deal.
How can you not talk for three months?

137
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,832
I have something to say
to the whole group.

138
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,750
You do?

139
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,253
I have morning plans. Let's meet
on Sunday afternoon at the track.

140
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,130
The track?

141
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,929
Why at the track?
And why do I have to gather everyone?

142
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,524
Assemblyman Lee, let's take a group photo.

143
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,692
Say "cheese."

144
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,444
-One, two, three.
-Cheese!

145
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,779
Cheese!

146
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,781
All done. Applause all around.

147
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,032
You're such a good girl.

148
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,284
-Bye.
-Thank you very much.

149
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,244
-He's my eldest.
-My goodness.

150
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,830
Attention. Is everyone free
on Sunday afternoon?

151
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,290
We should all get together.

152
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,797
Jooshin Electronics' cellphone sales
have been on the rise recently.

153
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,465
Especially in Barcelona.

154
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,050
I read that this morning.

155
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,761
What about France?

156
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,222
The Jooshin bakery brand
will be launched in Paris--

157
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,139
Just a moment.

158
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,768
Our Jung Jae-i is finally back.

159
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,563
Let's meet at the track on Sunday.
Don't be late.

160
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,576
How about this one, Miss Jae-i?

161
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,495
I think it will suit your skin tone.

162
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,210
I will go with this one.

163
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,434
I do hope the food is to your liking.

164
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,562
I don't often indulge in such luxuries.

165
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,565
A delicious meal in a beautiful garden,

166
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,651
and above all else,
it's a feast with you, Chairman Jung.

167
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,777
Thank you.

168
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,197
Assemblyman Lee mentioned
organizing a lunch several times,

169
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,783
but work has been busy,
so this is very overdue.

170
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,911
Your daughter is incredibly beautiful.

171
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,372
She takes after her mother.

172
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,667
You think she takes after me?

173
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,420
I think Jae-i is far…

174
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,132
prettier than I am.

175
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,221
She's beautiful and does well in school.
You must be so proud.

176
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,684
Woo-jin told me that Jae-i is
at the top of her class in Jooshin.

177
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,023
Thankfully, the kids fulfill their duties
without much input from us.

178
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,400
We're very proud of Jae-hyeok too.

179
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,653
He graduated from Hanguk Middle
at the top of his grade last year.

180
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,864
I graduated from Hanguk Middle last year.

181
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,366
You graduated from Hanguk Middle School?

182
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,784
That's my alma mater.

183
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,162
I didn't expect to meet
a fellow alumnus here.

184
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:22,838
Jae-i?

185
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,927
Are you uncomfortable?

186
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,347
You didn't seem to eat much earlier.

187
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,514
I'm fine.

188
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,435
We're going to have tea upstairs.
Get ready and come up.

189
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,312
All right. I will.

190
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,190
Your outfit…

191
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,278
Did you pick it out yourself?

192
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,533
You should change first.

193
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,287
I don't think it suits
an occasion like today's.

194
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,831
Many scrutinize the smallest details.

195
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,584
The clothes you choose,
your sense of style.

196
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:05,881
I think it would be best if you dressed
in a classier style, like your mother.

197
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,342
Which mother do you mean?

198
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,845
My stepmother?

199
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,846
Not that again!

200
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:20,729
Of course I'm talking about my wife,
your mother who raised you.

201
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,023
Not the woman who gave birth to you.

202
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,324
I think you should get changed. Right now.

203
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,368
I'll go do that.

204
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,287
While you're there…

205
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,422
you should put on a different lipstick.

206
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,257
Look at this color.

207
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,384
It's trashy.

208
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,929
Just like your mother.

209
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,852
I'd love for my daughter

210
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,104
to seem more like a daughter of mine.

211
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,608
More suited to the label
of the eldest daughter of Jaeyul Group.

212
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,659
Get ready and come upstairs.

213
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,177
JOOSHIN HIGH RECEIVES
MORE APPLICANTS IN 2024

214
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,838
I am

215
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,048
here for a gig.

216
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,217
To play the piano.

217
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,683
I was taking a short break here.
I'm leaving now.

218
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,185
I'm going to head out.

219
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,441
You can use this if you like.

220
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,695
Never mind that.

221
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,531
Can you take that off?

222
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,534
-Pardon?
-Your shirt.

223
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,369
Lend it to me.

224
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,121
Oh, this?

225
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,749
I'm in a hurry to get somewhere,
and this attire is inappropriate.

226
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,170
Oh, right. I guess so.

227
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:36,133
It's just that I wouldn't be able
to go anywhere if I took this off, so…

228
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,261
Wait, hold on.

229
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,278
You might be

230
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,823
in more of a predicament than I am.

231
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,708
It's so cold.

232
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,105
Don't they get scared?
Why would anyone do this stuff?

233
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,150
I don't get it either.

234
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,154
It's exhilarating.
And it makes you feel alive.

235
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,949
Jung Jae-i!

236
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,619
Been a while.

237
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,373
-Missed you to death.
-How have you been?

238
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,126
Your outfit today is pretty unique.

239
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,752
It's been ages since we were all together.
Want to go somewhere after?

240
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,130
We should have a good time today.

241
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,047
Jung Jae-i.

242
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,467
Anything to say to me?

243
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,556
-He-ra.
-Yes?

244
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,308
I'm challenging Ri-an to a bet.

245
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,978
A bet? What kind of bet?

246
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,604
The winner gets a wish granted.

247
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,606
What kind of wish?

248
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,234
I'll tell you if I win.

249
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,030
Three laps.
I'll take the inside line. That's all.

250
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,781
No objections regardless of outcome.

251
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,033
Save it for if you win.

252
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,659
If I win,

253
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,746
you'll have to start by explaining

254
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,457
what on earth you're doing.

255
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,497
What's gotten into them today?

256
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,293
-Do they have to take it this far?
-Who knows.

257
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:19,202
Hey, why were you driving so dangerously?
You could've gotten hurt.

258
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,537
I won.

259
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:22,956
I said I won.

260
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,667
Can I…

261
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,712
tell you my wish now?

262
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,217
Let's break up, Ri-an.

263
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,611
He-ra.

264
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,820
-Yeah?
-Let's go.

265
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,244
What happened to her
before she went off to America?

266
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,998
I don't know. I have no idea.

267
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,585
But I've never seen them like that before.

268
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:13,882
Say that again.

269
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,844
Let's break up. Let's end things.

270
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,888
For what reason?

271
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,475
Tell me why you're being like this!

272
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,063
You acted like a stranger
when we were together,

273
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,316
then disappeared without a word
for three months,

274
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,234
and this is the first thing you say?

275
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,945
We first met when we were six.

276
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,074
And the summer we turned 15,

277
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,993
you said you liked me at first sight.

278
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,163
Why?

279
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,124
Why did you like me?

280
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,793
There's no reason. I just--

281
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,710
Exactly.

282
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,795
There isn't one.

283
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:57,175
There's never really a reason
for starting to like or dislike someone.

284
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,635
Hey!

285
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,554
Let's be friends.

286
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,057
We're just friends from now on.

287
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,435
I won the bet.

288
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,187
Keep your promise.

289
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,106
Jae-i.

290
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,191
Jung Jae-i!

291
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,485
Damn it!

292
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,480
He's killing it.

293
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,525
The Jooshin tyrant's bad boy image
is especially sexy today.

294
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,194
Did you see the bandage on his hand?
Is he hurt?

295
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,199
Jae-i. Rooibos.

296
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,662
-Thanks.
-Did you get home okay yesterday?

297
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,291
I saw that Ri-an was hurt.

298
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,209
-Did something happen between--
-He-ra.

299
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,545
Let's not go there.

300
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,550
All right. Let's talk later.

301
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,451
No special announcements for today.

302
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,622
If anyone needs to change classes,
the deadline is this week.

303
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,209
Let's all work toward
another successful semester.

304
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,961
Study hard in your classes today.

305
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,258
Can I have a word
with our class president?

306
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,723
Are you playing cello? I'm playing flute.

307
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,226
Probably. I don't have time
to play the flute too.

308
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,730
Excuse me. I have a question.
How do you apply for class changes?

309
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,190
What?

310
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,360
I saw classes like rowing and fencing,
but none were on my schedule.

311
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,070
Why are you asking me that?

312
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,864
Just ask your friends.

313
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,741
"Friends"?

314
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,123
-Hey.
-What now?

315
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,084
Where do I go to change classes?

316
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,587
It's the key events calendar.

317
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,675
Ju-won.

318
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,052
Can you keep an eye on the new student?

319
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,931
I'd like you to help him have
a smooth transition.

320
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,267
So what happened last time

321
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,103
doesn't happen again.

322
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,023
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,574
-Is this too much makeup?
-Looks fine to me.

324
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,868
Did you ask Jae-i what the problem is?

325
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,704
There isn't one.

326
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,372
There's never really a reason

327
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,876
for starting to like or dislike someone.

328
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,217
She started avoiding you
and left for the US.

329
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,928
You fell out
around the time of my birthday party.

330
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,388
Nothing comes to mind?

331
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,808
Did you do anything to upset Jae-i?

332
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,729
I'm not sure.

333
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,607
Damn, man. We can rack our brains,
but we'll never know.

334
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,985
We can think it over ad nauseam
and still not know why girls get pissed.

335
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,069
Hey!

336
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,907
Just say, "I don't know what I did,
but I'm sorry."

337
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,575
That's when they talk.

338
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,161
"This is why I'm upset.
This is why I'm disappointed."

339
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,330
I don't get it even when they tell me.

340
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,919
I agree with Yun-seok.

341
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,338
Don't think. Just apologize.

342
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,340
Girls sometimes just want confirmation.

343
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,216
"Confirmation"?

344
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,760
Even if they push you away,

345
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:12,221
just say, "I'm sorry.
I'd die without you."

346
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,223
Girls fantasize about men doing that.

347
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,059
Even Jae-i?

348
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,393
She's a girl, isn't she?

349
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,188
Do it tomorrow.
Let's meet at the vacation home.

350
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,690
Let's have a proper party for once.

351
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,108
That sounds like fun.

352
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,234
-Right?
-Yeah.

353
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,611
You should bring something.

354
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,739
He's not thinking of sitting there, is he?

355
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,326
You crazy dumbass!

356
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:37,872
Move.

357
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,007
Having trouble understanding
the ways of the world, Mr. Kang Ha?

358
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:49,968
I am?

359
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,887
Ri-an hadn't even left yet
when you stood up in the auditorium.

360
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,517
You barged into the special classrooms
and tried to sit wherever you wanted.

361
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,603
And what was that today?
You wanted to sit on the bleachers?

362
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,648
Yes. What's wrong with that?

363
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,900
He's like a newborn baby.

364
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,112
Fresh-faced and empty-headed.
He's oblivious.

365
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,365
He even asked Gil Ye-ji
about changing classes.

366
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,367
The daughter of Jooshin Mart's owner?

367
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,040
What kinds of changes
do you want to make to your classes?

368
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,252
Oh, I just noticed
there were fencing and rowing classes.

369
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,671
Those classes?

370
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,923
My old school didn't have
classes like that.

371
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,800
This really must be a good school--

372
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,968
Go to the faculty room.

373
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,889
But do you even have the money
to pay for the special class fees?

374
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,559
Rowing is around 40 million won
per semester.

375
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,352
I think fencing is a little cheaper.

376
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,854
Forty million won?

377
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,897
Oh, that's expensive.

378
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,321
Listen carefully, little Kang Ha.

379
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,492
This school is different
from your previous schools.

380
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,161
Jooshin has its own rules.

381
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,204
What are they?

382
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,707
Never get on anyone's nerves.

383
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,584
Whose nerves?

384
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:09,172
The upper-class kids like Jae-i,
He-ra, Woo-jin, and especially Ri-an.

385
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,715
And why is that?

386
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,092
What do you mean why? It's obvious.

387
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,385
They're different from us.

388
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,429
We're scholarship kids.

389
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:20,099
They give us different ties based on
our status, because we're different.

390
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,601
Scholarship kids get navy.

391
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,352
They get maroon.

392
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,440
Ri-an's maternal great-grandfather
founded the school, so he's a given,

393
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,567
and the others are legacy students.

394
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,362
They're from families
who've contributed to Jooshin.

395
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,324
Which is why
we're able to attend this school.

396
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,119
Shouldn't they be respected accordingly?

397
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:43,915
"Respect…"

398
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,416
Don't think about it!

399
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,919
Don't even ask questions.
Just commit it to memory.

400
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,670
"I won't just go poking around."

401
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,173
"I'll do my best not to bother them."

402
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,467
-Is that so hard to understand?
-No.

403
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,554
Well, respect or whatever. I get it.

404
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,807
But to say
we shouldn't get on their nerves…

405
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,309
Don't you think that's extreme?

406
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,479
Fuck, go ahead
and consider it extreme, then.

407
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,483
Those extremes you just mentioned.
You better go to those extremes.

408
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,199
Do you know why you're here?

409
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,831
Because a scholarship spot opened up.

410
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,126
Why did a spot open up?

411
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,003
The kid

412
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,133
who ignored what I said and acted out…

413
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,181
was killed by Ri-an.

414
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,829
I see.

415
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,667
I get it, Chan-min. So you're saying

416
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:15,298
I should try to get along with them
to make my school life easier.

417
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,510
Thank you for the advice.

418
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,226
Think he got the message?

419
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,312
Why is that asshole so confident?

420
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,946
I've been here for a while
but never got to say hi.

421
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,660
You remember my name, right? Kang Ha.

422
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,663
Nice to meet you, Kim Ri-an.

423
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,134
What's with this guy?

424
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,261
What are you fools doing?

425
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,889
-Get rid of him.
-Sorry, Yun-seok.

426
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,141
You son of a bitch.

427
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,643
What's going on?

428
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,853
-You pranked him, didn't you?
-Of course not.

429
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,022
What did they say? That we're monsters?

430
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,775
That we'd eat you alive
if you didn't suck up?

431
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,818
What?

432
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,280
They were teasing you.
They played a prank on you.

433
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,035
We should've had the party sooner
so you wouldn't get teased.

434
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,370
You free tomorrow?

435
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,373
We're throwing you a welcome party.

436
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,832
Welcome party?

437
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,669
See you tomorrow. I'll send a car.

438
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,213
See you.

439
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,924
Be there. We'll be waiting.

440
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,952
I think this will do.

441
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,453
You sure she'll like this?

442
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,414
Jae-i?

443
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,082
Probably?

444
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,459
I'll see where she is.

445
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,464
Of course it isn't Jae-i's style.

446
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:49,744
Jung Jae-i. I'm serious.
I won't start the party until you come.

447
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,997
Hurry up and get here.

448
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,614
Electronic devices are not permitted.

449
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,618
Your cell phone and other devices
will be returned to you when you leave.

450
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,703
Oh. Okay.

451
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,844
What?

452
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,223
This asshole came!
Just 'cause you were invited? Dude!

453
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,642
Move aside.

454
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,894
-Chan-min, hurry up.
-Rin-a, wait for me.

455
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,319
What the hell? This kid actually came.

456
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,987
You lunatic. How did you get here?

457
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,781
You're unbelie-bubble, asshole.

458
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,104
Oh my God. He-ra.

459
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,522
She's so pretty.

460
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,367
You're finally here. Our guest of honor.

461
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,371
Isn't that the puppy?

462
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,875
-He's got some nerve coming here.
-He actually came.

463
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,044
Today is going to be so much fun.

464
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:13,429
All right. Should we officially get
the welcome party underway?

465
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,809
-Starting with a welcome drink.
-Shots!

466
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,436
Welcome drinks.

467
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,231
It's like a lucky draw.

468
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,067
It's a tradition
at scholarship student welcome parties.

469
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,154
-A lucky draw?
-Five of these shots are regular alcohol.

470
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,491
But one is something seriously incredible.

471
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,037
-Incredible?
-You'll know if you drink it.

472
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,164
I'll choose first.

473
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,248
Okay!

474
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,503
Go, He-ra!

475
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,881
-Drink!
-Drink!

476
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,221
Well done!

477
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,182
It was regular booze.

478
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,106
I don't drink.

479
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,863
Drink!

480
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,823
-Drink!
-Drink!

481
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:21,330
-Drink!
-Drink!

482
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,292
Think of everyone who helped
with this party, scholarship kid.

483
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,592
What's taking you so damn long?

484
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,386
Just take that one!

485
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,889
-Have two shots!
-Drink it already! Down it!

486
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,057
Okay!

487
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,227
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

488
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,144
Bottoms up!

489
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,446
-Down it already.
-Hey, scholarship kid!

490
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,242
-There he goes!
-There you go!

491
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,037
Okay!

492
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,875
Wow, he really drank it.

493
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,836
The newbie's not bad.

494
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,421
He's hot, and he's got game.

495
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,548
He can hold his liquor!

496
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,550
-What a man.
-Now take another shot.

497
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:18,512
I can't believe he actually drank that.
He should have another.

498
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,014
He's so cute.

499
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,608
The next magic trick will be tissue magic!

500
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,110
-Tissue magic?
-He's so weird! What the hell?

501
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,987
-What happened?
-Eat the tissue.

502
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,864
-What the hell?
-Eat it!

503
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,953
It keeps coming out!

504
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,087
What in the world?

505
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,759
Now go!

506
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,761
No more magic!

507
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,388
-It's all over.
-It's time for a bet.

508
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,931
You and Chan-min…

509
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,227
The loser pays 500,000 won.

510
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,646
All right!

511
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,647
Start!

512
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,819
This jerk's insane.
Do you know how much all this costs?

513
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,113
-You can't go around breaking stuff.
-Oh no.

514
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,199
Jesus. He's screwed.

515
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,992
-Those glasses are…
-Call your mom.

516
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,702
This is fucking serious.

517
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,955
-Get your parents here now.
-What are you going to do?

518
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,667
You fucking idiot.

519
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,378
If he vomits here,
the embarrassment would last forever.

520
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,840
Hey, he's fun.

521
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,404
Spin the wheel!

522
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,488
Spin it!

523
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,073
Hey!

524
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,032
Spin it!

525
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,662
-It's Ba-da!
-Ba-da.

526
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,707
Okay, it landed on Ryu Ba-da.

527
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,458
What's the question?

528
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,462
When was the last time you had sex?
Truth or dare?

529
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,756
Truth.

530
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,427
-Or just dare?
-Oh, come on.

531
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,429
Just tell us already.

532
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,806
Don't tell me.
Is the answer, "This morning"?

533
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,808
-That must be it.
-I don't know.

534
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,769
-I'll just take the damn shot.
-What the hell?

535
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,604
I'll take it.

536
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,319
That was so cool! What the hell!

537
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,029
Oh, seriously.

538
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:41,947
That was cool.

539
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,951
You're finally back, Jung Jae-i.

540
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,786
Here I go.

541
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,538
Spin it!

542
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,591
Do you remember?
October 27th of last year.

543
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,134
I was quite surprised.

544
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:05,345
Think your dad would like this video too?

545
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,642
Let's talk.

546
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,317
One more time. This is the last time.

547
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:19,985
Spin it!

548
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:07,908
Right.

549
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,994
I know this isn't your style.

550
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,329
But

551
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,833
I felt like I had to do something.

552
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,088
I'm sorry.

553
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,424
For what?

554
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,509
Whatever it is.

555
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,011
I'm just sorry for it all.

556
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,721
You have nothing to be sorry for.

557
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,224
But

558
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,476
just accept it, Ri-an.

559
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,563
I won't tell you why I'm doing this.

560
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,107
Not before I'm dead.

561
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,568
Do you even hear what you're saying?

562
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,320
Just tell me what is going on.

563
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,782
You have to give me a reason
for me to decide if I can accept it.

564
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,132
It's Kang Ha!

565
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,759
-Scholarship kid!
-Finally, the newbie's turn.

566
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:12,431
Are there any girls here
you'd want to sleep with?

567
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,727
Hey, choose wisely.

568
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,521
If you single someone out,
it might happen.

569
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,192
-Truth.
-Truth…

570
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,414
No. Dare.

571
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,499
Dare. All right.

572
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:44,546
French kiss one of the girls here
for three minutes.

573
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,089
Oh, French kiss?

574
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,257
French kiss!

575
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,343
-French kiss!
-French kiss!

576
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,511
-French kiss!
-Hey.

577
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,683
-I thought he was pissed.
-Oh my God.

578
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,794
-What the heck?
-Where are you going?

579
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,046
That fucker already had a girl in mind.

580
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,381
-Let's go.
-Wait for us.

581
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,465
Let's go with him!

582
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,101
You haven't forgotten my promise,

583
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:40,811
have you, brother?

584
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,359
In-han.

585
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,492
I promised to find

586
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,037
the person who did that to you.

587
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,251
Kang… Kang Ha…

588
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,462
Kang…

589
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,722
The bastard who killed you.

590
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,767
Why did a spot open up?

591
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,313
The kid who ignored
what I said and acted out

592
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,691
was killed by Ri-an.

593
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,490
What are you doing?

594
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,492
I'll expose everything.

595
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,164
-Everything that asshole did to you.
-What the hell are you doing here?

596
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,641
I'm going to expose it, no matter what.
