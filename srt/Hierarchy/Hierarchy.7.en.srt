00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,114
Woo-jin.

3
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,409
Why did you come?

4
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,537
It's your first birthday with me.

5
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,706
I want to say happy birthday properly.

6
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,916
Properly?

7
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,546
Your present.

8
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,674
That's not much.

9
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,056
Your second present.

10
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,602
Don't be late.

11
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,503
Ms. Han?

12
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,381
In-han?

13
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,467
-This is insane.
-In-han.

14
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,386
It's not like that.

15
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,888
Let him go. I'll take care of it.

16
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,723
No, Woo-jin. No one can know.

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,434
In-han!

18
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,314
No…

19
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,657
Hey, Woo-jin.

20
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,784
Seen that scholarship jerk?

21
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,162
He split just when it was getting fun.

22
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,580
-Where did he go?
-Hey.

23
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,125
Rein it in.
That's how jokes turn into accidents.

24
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,878
Go back inside.

25
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,298
-Let's go.
-Why are you getting angry?

26
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,508
-Let's go out back.
-Or downstairs.

27
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,095
Let him be.

28
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,683
Why are you chasing after a kid like him?

29
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,935
He's my friend.

30
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,980
Were you crying? Why do you look so upset?

31
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,774
It's nothing.

32
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,401
It's obviously something.

33
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,485
What's wrong?

34
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,281
-You don't know my dad.
-Let's find a way.

35
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,699
What is that?

36
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,288
I'll tell the guys to stop bullying him.

37
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,874
Let's go back.

38
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,507
In-han!

39
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,094
In-han!

40
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,394
Kang Ha.

41
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,023
LITTLE BROTHER

42
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,458
In-han, let's talk.

43
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,542
Okay? In-han!

44
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,588
In-han!

45
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,608
MS. HAN JI-SU

46
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,902
In-han, let me explain.

47
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,862
-Everyone is crazy!
-Where are you?

48
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,573
-Let's talk in person.
-Everyone in this school is insane.

49
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,242
Teachers and students alike!

50
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,994
In-han, listen to me. We need to talk!

51
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,078
KANG IN-HAN - WJ

52
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,037
I'll come to you.

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,333
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Let's talk face-to-face. In-han, listen!

54
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,251
LITTLE BROTHER

55
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,836
Forget it!

56
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,587
In-han. Kang In-han!

57
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,340
I'll expose everything
that happened at this crazy school!

58
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,508
I'll expose it all.

59
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,511
Kang Ha.

60
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:14,897
In-han.

61
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,733
What was that?

62
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,360
-What was that sound?
-Kang…

63
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,903
-Say something!
-Kang Ha…

64
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,238
-In-han!
-Kang Ha.

65
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,282
In-han, where are you?

66
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,618
Hold on, I'll call you right back.

67
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,120
I'll call you back!

68
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,564
In-han…

69
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,159
In-han?

70
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,371
In-han?

71
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:34,036
EPISODE 7.
OUR SHORT, VULNERABLE YET PRECIOUS CHAPTER

72
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,625
SEOUL YONGHO POLICE STATION

73
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,638
School violence?

74
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,141
Given our social standing,

75
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,519
my friends and I will never have to engage

76
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,355
in physical altercations.

77
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,316
I'm incredibly offended.

78
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,110
What basis do you have for accusing me?

79
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,449
Mr. Attorney, don't we have
the right to remain silent?

80
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,784
Those were legally prescribed drugs.

81
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,955
-For anxiety disorder.
-Take a strand of my hair if you want.

82
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,166
It's not true. Why don't you believe me?

83
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,250
"School violence"?

84
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,920
I never hit anyone.

85
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,297
I was showing them some magic tricks.

86
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,715
I was just…

87
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:32,470
As someone older,
I was just trying to help younger students

88
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,721
thrive in school.

89
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,932
I wasn't acting on behalf of anyone.

90
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,059
I don't know.

91
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,437
We just went to the parties.
We've never been involved

92
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,856
in anything like violence or drugs.

93
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,942
We're total nerds.

94
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,986
We had no part in that.

95
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,321
We did play a part.

96
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,992
I'm sure I'm responsible
for certain things too.

97
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,127
You have some nerve.

98
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,174
I've never seen
a scholarship student like you.

99
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:16,597
I had no idea
you would wreak such havoc on the school.

100
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,059
That's what I came to do.

101
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,899
To set things right
even if it wreaked havoc.

102
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,235
My brother's killer…

103
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,246
I may not be able to find them myself,
but that day… No.

104
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,250
I'll bring to justice those who stood by

105
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,877
while he was bullied long before that.

106
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,136
You wouldn't

107
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,638
happen to be one of those people,

108
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,557
would you?

109
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,366
Hey!

110
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,329
You called the police? On me?

111
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,498
Drugs? Violence?
Did you fucking see me do that?

112
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,417
I know, right?

113
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,586
What do you even know about me?

114
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,004
What did I ever do?

115
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,923
I wonder what he gave the police. Videos?

116
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,426
Why don't you show them to me too?

117
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,469
Show me.

118
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,637
Never mind.

119
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,848
You should just stop coming to school.

120
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,516
I've told you before.

121
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,313
I decide if I'll stay in school.

122
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,775
You have no right to demand that.

123
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,360
Of course he does.

124
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,612
You guys don't pay any tuition.

125
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,323
We even pay
into a school development fund.

126
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,868
Ever thought about
where those benefits you reap come from?

127
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,620
You have no conscience.

128
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,914
Right, He-ra?

129
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,463
She's right.

130
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,510
Awarding scholarships
out of noblesse oblige

131
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,889
is essentially an act
of charitable goodwill.

132
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,141
This isn't how you repay goodwill.

133
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,561
So that makes it okay?

134
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,024
Does not paying tuition
warrant mistreatment?

135
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,567
The hell are you saying?

136
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,819
He's not wrong.

137
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,072
We shouldn't be persecuted
for being scholarship students.

138
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,951
Have you all lost it?

139
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,329
You should've behaved
if you didn't want to be reported.

140
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,416
You just never quit.

141
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,000
Let go of him, Yun-seok.

142
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,798
Jae-i.

143
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,009
You're not about to take his side,
are you?

144
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,054
Kang Ha is right. We were in the wrong.

145
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,185
Don't be afraid to take part
in the investigation.

146
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,646
The injustice you faced at school

147
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,939
and the bullying.

148
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,899
Be honest about it.

149
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,487
So we'll realize what we did wrong.

150
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,864
Only then

151
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,409
will it never happen again.

152
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,837
Fuck.

153
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,615
Don't you get it?

154
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,867
The police came to our school.

155
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,536
Mom, I didn't hit anyone.

156
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,207
Well, I did hit some people,
but I didn't hit them.

157
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,626
And I didn't do it because I wanted to.

158
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,877
Anyway, gotta go.

159
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,637
Fuck.

160
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,560
What's with the disgusted look?

161
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,816
None of what he said was a lie.

162
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,819
He didn't want to hit anyone.

163
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,782
He did it to get on your good side…
and because you wanted him to.

164
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,747
So what?

165
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,624
Is there more to do?

166
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,336
You've been telling everyone
you'll set things right.

167
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,632
Are you done yet?

168
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,384
You were having a birthday party.

169
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,220
That day.

170
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,682
You covered your tracks well.

171
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,643
You're not in any of the videos I have.

172
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,521
Am I done yet?

173
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,524
I'm just getting started.

174
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,861
Those at fault
should be punished accordingly,

175
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,990
and I intend to witness it first-hand.

176
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,097
Do you have to go to New York?

177
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,017
It's already been decided.

178
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,938
I don't want to leave you alone again.

179
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,191
When I think about
what you went through alone…

180
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,655
-I haven't even apologized properly.
-You don't need to keep apologizing.

181
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,200
I know how you feel.

182
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,636
Ri-an, I'll be right back.

183
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,553
Okay.

184
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,647
WE FOUND OUT WHO SENT THE VIDEO
IT WAS PRINCIPAL PARK HUI-SEON

185
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,319
Ju-won.

186
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,697
-We should talk.
-Let go.

187
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,824
That video you sent me,

188
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,827
I could get the police involved.

189
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,709
Ju-won.

190
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,503
I knew nothing about you

191
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,797
before discovering
you were the blackmailer.

192
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,715
Now that I know, I'm more confused.

193
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,135
Why would you do that?

194
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,889
Consider what you guys have done.

195
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,144
The scholarship students
and teachers grovel at your feet.

196
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,980
You're the authority at Jooshin.

197
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,108
I despised that.

198
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,198
The videos you threatened me with

199
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,493
weren't among the ones
Kang Ha gave to the police.

200
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,912
That fool didn't take
the most important ones.

201
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,082
And I didn't give them to him.

202
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,254
Are your threats still ongoing?

203
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,466
I'm thinking about it.

204
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,513
"I'm thinking about it." "I'm leaking it."
You're all talk and no action.

205
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,851
You must have something to protect,
just like I do.

206
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,313
You know leaking it
would directly affect your mom.

207
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,357
Or rather, the principal.

208
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,738
And you must be targeting me
instead of Ri-an

209
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,866
because you're afraid of retaliation.

210
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,459
Something's off with Jae-i.

211
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,086
"Off"? How so?

212
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,173
Since when has Jae-i spoken up
for other people?

213
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,883
She's different somehow.

214
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,635
When will the old Jae-i be back?

215
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:38,432
I just like the indifferent and cold Jae-i
that I've always known.

216
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,226
I'm not sure.

217
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,978
Who cares if she's never back?

218
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,438
She's leaving anyway.

219
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,065
So I shouldn't care?

220
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,777
You hated Jae-i. You wanted her
to leave Jooshin more than anyone.

221
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,195
That…

222
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,406
that was when I was livid with Jae-i.

223
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,659
All friends go through ups and downs.

224
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:02,081
Didn't you renounce your friendship
and say you'd get back at her?

225
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,085
She's the one who saved me from hell.

226
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,046
She's always been like that though.

227
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,882
And she's always put up
with my nasty attitude.

228
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,135
I wanted to start acting
like a real friend.

229
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,430
But she'll be in New York soon.

230
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:28,982
That video,

231
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,568
did you send it?

232
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,488
Video? What do you mean?

233
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,365
Where and how did you get hold of it?

234
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,202
What on earth do you think you're doing?

235
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,537
Ri-an.

236
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,288
Don't dodge the question.

237
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,998
Give me a straight answer.

238
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:54,466
This is a private educational foundation
affiliated with the Jooshin Group,

239
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,426
and you are Jooshin's heir.

240
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,344
And?

241
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,179
I'm telling you that,

242
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:03,809
when it comes to you,
there is nothing I can do independently.

243
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,230
Was it my mom?

244
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,822
You were spying on me?

245
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,949
Why the hell would you do that?

246
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:25,080
Hiring people to spy on me is one thing,
but that video…

247
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,999
Why did you send it to me?

248
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,044
Out of concern.

249
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,383
If you were to get her pregnant,
it would be a nightmare for us.

250
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,969
You need to stay alert.

251
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,264
-Mom!
-How dare you raise your voice at me!

252
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,976
You are my son and Jooshin's heir.

253
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,688
Before being a son and an heir,
I'm a person too.

254
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,315
I am not your pet dog!

255
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,735
I'm tired of being under your thumb.

256
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,820
It's suffocating.

257
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,199
You may as well
just throw me out like Dad!

258
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,586
I'll give it up.

259
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,591
I can't choose to not be your son,
but I can choose not to be the heir.

260
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,010
Ri-an!

261
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,142
How could you say that to me?

262
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,729
You're my everything.

263
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,484
You're my only son, the owner of Jooshin,
and the center of the universe.

264
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,613
I will make sure you become all that.

265
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,991
You are my one and only hope.

266
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,765
-Good afternoon, ma'am.
-Oh, hello.

267
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,169
I didn't know
you'd actually go to the police.

268
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,922
Our school wasn't doing its duty

269
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,842
of protecting its students.

270
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,345
Anyhow, you've set things in motion.

271
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,392
The things you said
you wanted to make right,

272
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,519
revenge for In-han.

273
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,146
He would've done the same.

274
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,900
He wouldn't have tolerated
all the injustices.

275
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,865
I know that's the kind of person
In-han was.

276
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,369
I don't think of it
as you getting revenge.

277
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,413
I think we're just…

278
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,043
being held accountable for our actions.

279
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,546
I'm willing to submit to my fate.

280
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,467
The things I didn't know
because no one told me,

281
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,179
like what I was doing wrong

282
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,224
and what I was overlooking and condoning…

283
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,066
I wish I would've known sooner.

284
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,029
Before we lost In-han.

285
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,376
I'm sorry…

286
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,046
for realizing too late.

287
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,259
And

288
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,138
for acting selfishly
to try to protect Ri-an.

289
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,100
I'm sorry, too…

290
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,938
for burdening you.

291
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,534
I'm leaving for New York soon.

292
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,455
You're leaving?

293
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,542
-What will happen to you, then?
-Nothing.

294
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,380
I'll just continue living
as Jung Jae-i of the Jaeyul Group.

295
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,757
So, Kang Ha,

296
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,427
take care.

297
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,222
And graduate with top honors.

298
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,480
Jae-i.

299
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,485
Was there ever

300
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,239
a moment when you had feelings for me?

301
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,208
No. Not even for a single moment.

302
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,175
You liar.

303
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:39,949
I'm sorry.

304
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,080
It's all my fault.

305
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:25,995
Kang In-han.

306
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:27,997
How have you been?

307
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,379
Say hi.

308
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,678
I invited Ri-an here because I thought
he might have something to say to you.

309
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:45,348
KANG IN-HAN
APR. 13 .2007 - OCT. 27. 2023

310
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,611
Let's just take it slow

311
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,655
and try to right one wrong at a time.

312
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,908
Until I leave,

313
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,370
I'm going to do everything I can.

314
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,665
Is this…

315
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,047
really the end for us?

316
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,678
Of course not.

317
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,724
We're only 18, Ri-an.

318
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,938
Just think of it as

319
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,400
spending time apart for a while.

320
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,576
I can't go on without you.

321
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,579
What about you? Can you go on?

322
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,832
Even without me?

323
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,550
You'll apologize to Kang Ha too?

324
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,468
I will.

325
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,762
So please don't go, Jae-i.

326
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,184
Ri-an,

327
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,689
I feel like we're getting punished.

328
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:23,321
I keep thinking these are the consequences
of all our past wrongdoings.

329
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,867
We left a lasting scar on someone.

330
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:29,953
Both of us did.

331
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,919
So we should also

332
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,839
accept the consequences…

333
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,217
of our actions.

334
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,777
Wait.

335
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,591
How did you…

336
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,510
This is Jooshin, Ms. Han Ji-su.

337
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,513
An improper relationship with a student…

338
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,392
How is such a thing possible as a teacher?

339
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,396
I'm sure you're aware
of the countless issues this would cause.

340
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,858
If this were to get out now
when the school is already in disarray…

341
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,278
can you guess what would happen?

342
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,658
Woo-jin's parents
would like to keep this quiet,

343
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,201
so I'll keep this short.

344
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,498
As soon as you leave this office,
submit your resignation

345
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,833
and leave the school.

346
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,045
E-TICKET CONFIRMATION

347
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:03,796
Principal Park--

348
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,466
Just be grateful
their generosity and consideration

349
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,718
are commensurate with their social status.

350
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,598
And do not forget
what that generosity implies.

351
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,770
Was it Woo-jin…

352
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:21,981
who revealed it?

353
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,984
If Woo-jin hadn't been involved
in the matter,

354
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,153
you would likely be in prison now

355
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,782
for committing a hit-and-run.

356
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,910
In return, we expect you to keep silent

357
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,497
about the events related to Woo-jin
and everything else.

358
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,971
Should we go on a trip together
before Jae-i leaves?

359
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,182
Want to go somewhere nearby?

360
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,100
No.

361
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,103
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

362
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,023
I'm not going somewhere
where you can never see me again.

363
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,652
-Woo-jin?
-Yeah?

364
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,903
Are you okay?

365
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,279
Yeah.

366
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,617
Can you fly home during breaks?

367
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,577
Not likely.

368
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,079
I was told not to come back.

369
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,789
This is serious revenge.

370
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,084
What do you mean?

371
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,212
You're leaving because that puppy
turned the school upside down.

372
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,673
And you're being separated
from the three of us.

373
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,008
It's proper revenge.

374
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,720
Considering what Kang Ha's been through,
would this suffice as revenge?

375
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,444
Get revenge.

376
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,994
What did you do?

377
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,497
What the hell did you do to Jae-i?!

378
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,292
I met with her father.

379
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,130
I thought you honestly wanted
Jae-i to disappear.

380
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,382
So I asked him to send her to New York.

381
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:15,720
I said if he didn't,
I'd expose why Jae-i went to the States.

382
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,181
Why she went to the States?

383
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,391
She was pregnant.

384
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,351
What?

385
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,103
With Ri-an's baby.

386
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,275
You're insane, Lee Woo-jin!

387
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,860
You told her father that?

388
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,820
How could you do that?

389
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,614
How could you do such a thing?

390
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,823
You told me

391
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,201
to decide if it was Yoon He-ra or not!

392
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,328
I chose you. I chose Yoon He-ra!

393
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:49,045
Still, how could you do that, you moron?

394
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:53,216
How will you ever face
Ri-an and Jae-i now?

395
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,469
You know how important you are to them.

396
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,222
I should come clean.

397
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,725
I should say this is all my doing.

398
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,228
Don't say a word. Do that, and it's over.

399
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,230
Keep it quiet so we can stay friends.

400
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,005
Figured I should say goodbye.

401
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,843
I just handed in my resignation.

402
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,685
Nothing bad will happen.

403
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,104
And no one will know.

404
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,939
How can you say that?

405
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,024
You and I,

406
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,318
we both know.

407
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,572
Don't think that this is over.

408
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,794
Wait.

409
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,880
What did she just say?

410
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,340
You think that was intentional?

411
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,585
Remember how you asked me
which one truly had my heart?

412
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,046
What?

413
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,672
Hermès or He-ra?

414
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:00,801
It's He-ra.

415
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,012
She's the one I really like.

416
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,141
I know.

417
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,103
You came here to tell me that?

418
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,528
I did something bad.

419
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,531
And it seems like
everything that's happened

420
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,076
started that night

421
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,787
due to my mistakes.

422
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:33,960
I'm afraid to take responsibility,
but I want to unload one thing.

423
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,170
Woo-jin.

424
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,173
What are you talking about?

425
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,219
I didn't know what kind of accident it was
on the day it happened.

426
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,430
I just had to make sure…

427
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,102
that car wasn't traced back to her.

428
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,438
I didn't want to cause issues
for my dad's political career.

429
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,066
So I had it covered up.

430
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,611
Then I happened to

431
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,863
find a pen in the car.

432
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,034
Recently, I realized

433
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,745
it was a camera.

434
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,556
I'm sorry, Jae-i.

435
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,112
This belonged

436
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:45,948
to Kang In-han.

437
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,556
The woman in the video
is a teacher at your school?

438
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,270
Detective Kim,
find out the suspect's address.

439
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,856
Which assemblyman
does the car belong to again?

440
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,859
Lee Han-jong, the presidential candidate.

441
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,866
Why is such a prominent man's name
popping up here?

442
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,952
I think we should notify the chief first.

443
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,162
I think so too.

444
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,460
I am Assistant Inspector Jung Ju-han.

445
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,421
-You need to come with us.
-Wait. Why?

446
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,007
We have a search and seizure warrant.

447
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:46,675
Please cooperate.

448
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,971
Who authorized this? This is Jooshin High!

449
00:39:59,105 --> 00:39:59,939
Damn it.

450
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,233
Ms. Han Ji-su?

451
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,819
Inspector Jang In-ho,
Seoul Yongho Police Station.

452
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,322
Under the Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Crimes Act,

453
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,200
you are under arrest
for fleeing the scene of an accident.

454
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,996
You have the right to remain silent
and avoid self-incrimination.

455
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:27,967
Ms. Han.

456
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,385
Thank you for last time.

457
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,845
Thank you.

458
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,681
Are things better?

459
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,474
Yes.

460
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,811
In-han, you're a talented artist too.
You're doing well.

461
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,729
You've got this!

462
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,648
Thank you.

463
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:08,215
The former chairman established
a private educational foundation

464
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,260
to nurture students
to become assets to their country.

465
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,930
Never mind nurturing students,
violence and drug use have come to light.

466
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,058
And the culprit behind a hit-and-run
that killed a student

467
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,185
was a teacher?

468
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,312
I take full responsibility.

469
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:25,065
The damages suffered are
beyond the scope of your responsibility.

470
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,526
The future handling of the issue
will be discussed

471
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,821
with the board and the new principal.

472
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,494
Ms. An!

473
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:46,295
You know how hard I have worked
to defend the school over the years.

474
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,297
How could you

475
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,300
just throw me out
like a crumpled piece of paper?

476
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:55,679
I think the price we've paid so far
is worth more than a piece of paper.

477
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:01,644
Do you think I engage with the school
for the sake of this foundation?

478
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,479
No.

479
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,899
I do it all for my son, Ri-an.

480
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:12,071
It was your job to ensure
that my son always remained unscathed.

481
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,115
Your job was to protect Jooshin's owner.

482
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,557
I'm happy you're leaving the school, Mom.

483
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,603
I don't need to be ashamed of you anymore.

484
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:53,404
I gave Kang Ha all the videos
he turned over to the police.

485
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,490
I've known for a while

486
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,868
that Jooshin ordered you
to spy on the kids' cloud storage.

487
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,663
I wanted to use that
to destroy the school.

488
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,544
But I couldn't
because I was worried you'd get hurt.

489
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,761
-Ju-won.
-But it's all over now.

490
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,223
You don't need to do any of that now.

491
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,980
That's all I ever wanted.

492
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,487
-Were drugs sold at Jooshin?
-Is Jaeyul Group's eldest pregnant?

493
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,573
It's shocking
that the "A" group's eldest was pregnant

494
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,408
and has since miscarried.

495
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:25,412
What's even more shocking is
that the father is the "B" group heir.

496
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,082
Do you know the relationship
between the two groups?

497
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,460
Take care of it.

498
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:36,965
You need to ensure that minimal damage
is done to the group's image.

499
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,636
So how does it feel?

500
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,391
I'm asking how it feels
to live a life like your mother's.

501
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,937
I've come to terms with it.

502
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,148
You take after your mother.

503
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,983
And your behavior

504
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:59,738
has destroyed all of my plans for you.

505
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,909
You've become utterly useless.

506
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:14,461
I guess this was inevitable.
You and I just wasted our precious time.

507
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,258
I was afraid…

508
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,512
that you'd throw me out like Mom.

509
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,725
I was only three or four
when you said those things.

510
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,519
"If you act inappropriately,

511
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,522
you'll vanish like your mom."

512
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,442
I was always so scared of that.

513
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,451
But I'm fine now.

514
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,620
I'm not scared at all.

515
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,707
You should know…

516
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,840
I never recover the things I've abandoned,
especially if that happens to be

517
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,634
a person.

518
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,279
I want to apologize.

519
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,667
I went to his cinerarium.

520
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,002
To see my brother?

521
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,505
That accident that day…

522
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,883
I wasn't directly responsible,

523
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,427
but the guys
were bullying In-han that day.

524
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,806
It's all my fault.

525
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,435
I should've stopped them.

526
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,484
At the time, I couldn't stand
seeing In-han with Jae-i.

527
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:46,905
So I just stood by and watched
as the guys bullied him.

528
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,414
I know very well
that you could never forgive me.

529
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,000
But still…

530
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,713
I'm truly sorry.

531
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,550
To both you

532
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,094
and In-han.

533
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,097
I lost my brother.

534
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,436
You could apologize hundreds of times,
but it wouldn't bring him back.

535
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,398
But you're sorry?

536
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,822
It's so easy for you.

537
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,454
If not for that accident…

538
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:40,250
he would still be here,
laughing and cracking jokes.

539
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,253
If you hadn't bullied him

540
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,423
and driven him out
onto the street that night…

541
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,468
he would still

542
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,763
be alive and well.

543
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,021
You're sorry? Fine.

544
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,817
Just live with that guilt, Ri-an.

545
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,780
Because I will never

546
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,407
accept your apology.

547
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,424
Everything is a result of my negligence.

548
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,804
Before being the leader of a company,
I am a mother,

549
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:37,265
and my child has caused
social controversy.

550
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,602
For that, I bow my head in apology.

551
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:45,107
However, the illegally filmed video
is a clear violation of the law.

552
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,026
As such, we will be taking
serious legal action.

553
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,153
Mr. Choi Yun-seok,

554
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,949
do you admit to inflicting violence
on the scholarship students?

555
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,284
And lastly,

556
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,036
I feel deeply responsible

557
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,664
for the violence
and inappropriate behavior

558
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,333
on the part of Jooshin's students

559
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,044
and vow that all wrongs will be righted.

560
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:11,633
Choi Yun-seok, Baek Chan-min,
Kwon Jae-jun, Cha Ji-seok, Lee Yu-jin,

561
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,677
do you admit to inflicting harm?

562
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,524
I am also

563
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,735
an offender.

564
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,916
Maybe I should've come clean about it all,

565
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,960
including visiting Jae-i's dad.

566
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:51,048
Giving her that pen camera destroyed
your dad's presidential campaign.

567
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:57,429
And some things are better left unsaid,
for everyone's sake.

568
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,600
Your betrayal of Jae-i is something
we'll take to the grave.

569
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,062
Be good to Jae-i and Ri-an until you die.

570
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,354
Repay them that way.

571
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,106
Think it'll change?

572
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,566
What?

573
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,484
Jooshin.

574
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,069
And us.

575
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,739
I'm not sure.

576
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:19,618
I don't think
anything changes all at once.

577
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,746
Whether that's Jooshin or us.

578
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:26,750
I'm off.

579
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,382
Make sure you head straight home.

580
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,979
This is our first bus ride together

581
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,024
since starting high school.

582
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,447
We used to always
take the bus together in middle school.

583
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,493
Sorry…

584
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,872
for avoiding you because I was scared.

585
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,333
And for saying I couldn't help.

586
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,001
What?

587
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,921
You've changed since getting rich.

588
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,465
When have we ever apologized
for things like that?

589
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,218
We'd just beat each other up
and let it slide.

590
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:23,390
Don't you remember In-han always saying
it's okay for friends to do that?

591
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,488
See? I told you it would look nice.

592
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,284
You're just stating the obvious.
I'm Yoon He-ra, after all.

593
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,078
He-ra.

594
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:46,788
Yeah?

595
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,667
I didn't know you thought of me that way.

596
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,212
My cold and blunt speech.

597
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:59,217
I just always thought
you were understanding of that.

598
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,597
It wasn't because
I didn't consider you a friend.

599
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:08,518
I know that.

600
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,772
And I was a little unaware too.

601
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,525
I'm embarrassed to admit it.

602
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:22,157
We've been friends forever,
but I've only just figured it out.

603
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:23,825
What?

604
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,204
You're not cold.
You just pretend like you are.

605
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,500
And that's how you protected yourself.

606
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,136
I'll be waiting for you.

607
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,020
Have a safe trip.

608
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,277
My friend Jung Jae-i .

609
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,199
Take care of yourself.

610
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,368
My mean

611
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,746
and beautiful friend He-ra.

612
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,378
Let's go.

613
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,444
Just a moment.

614
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,166
Skip school. Spend the day with me.

615
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,343
-Let's go.
-Don't let go.

616
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,886
-All right?
-I'll hold it.

617
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,846
-Give it a go.
-Okay.

618
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,516
I was so close.

619
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,475
-You okay?
-Again.

620
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,561
-Here goes.
-Let's go.

621
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,858
-See? How am I doing?
-There you go.

622
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:20,942
Try coming this way.

623
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,494
It's easier than I thought.

624
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,832
-You're good.
-Right?

625
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:36,916
Yes.

626
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,212
What do you think? I'm good, aren't I?

627
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,592
Here. Try it.

628
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:49,763
What is this?

629
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,057
A toasted sandwich.

630
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,810
It's fine.

631
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,272
Wait, when did you try this?

632
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,275
I haven't tried it yet.

633
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,569
I wanted to try it with you.

634
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,537
It's really good.

635
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,914
-Quick. Try it.
-Okay.

636
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,545
How is it?

637
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,048
-It's good, isn't it?
-It is.

638
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,385
Was this made by a chef? Are they famous?

639
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,346
-Don't want yours? I'll eat it.
-No.

640
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,181
-I'm eating it.
-Let's get another.

641
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,486
The weather's nice.

642
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,238
And so is the breeze.

643
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,198
You're right.

644
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:52,283
Ri-an.

645
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,036
Kang Ha once said to me

646
00:56:56,871 --> 00:57:01,543
that I should find what I like
and what makes me happy, and protect it.

647
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,295
So I thought about it.

648
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,216
And to me, that's you.

649
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,512
From the moment I first saw you until now,

650
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,723
you've always been part of my world.

651
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,102
That's how I survived.
It's how I'm still surviving.

652
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,855
To the 18-year-old Jung Jae-i,

653
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,400
Kim Ri-an is her sole and absolute warmth.

654
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:32,991
I feel the same way.

655
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:37,162
I wouldn't have survived
without you either.

656
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,337
But, Ri-an,

657
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,048
we should stop just surviving…

658
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,594
and relying on each other.

659
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,307
When we're truly happy on our own,

660
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,226
when we can share that happiness

661
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,813
instead of relying on each other for it,

662
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,191
that's when we should meet again.

663
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,612
Let's say bye with a smile.

664
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,406
So one day we can both smile again

665
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,451
and return to each other.

666
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,675
I just want you…

667
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,180
to not have a hard time.

668
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:42,185
I want you to be happy, Jae-i.

669
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:57,992
Me too.

670
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,121
I also want you…

671
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,462
to be happy and smiling.

672
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,465
When you substitute five,
it becomes minus two.

673
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,133
-That's what you're doing.
-Right.

674
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,344
Hey, this looks nice.

675
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,678
Did your mom buy this?

676
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,430
-Two, three.
-Say cheese.

677
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:47,310
I'm graduating soon,
so I won't be able to look after you guys.

678
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,145
You'll have to take care of everyone.

679
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,773
Just make sure my graduation present is…

680
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,858
Get off your phone
when your senior is talking!

681
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,276
God.

682
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,028
Say what?

683
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,729
Jae-i told me to apologize.

684
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,065
Is that for me?

685
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,441
Well, I can't eat both.

686
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,780
This isn't like you, He-ra.

687
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:47,620
I always wondered who ate this crap.
I heard you introduced Jae-i to it.

688
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,540
But

689
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,210
she didn't eat it,
so she wouldn't know how it tastes.

690
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:58,923
Too sweet.

691
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,509
Hey, how do you eat this thing?

692
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,569
I didn't know this would happen.

693
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,864
I tried so many times to stop
and forget everything.

694
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:07,909
I just…

695
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:10,578
I just wanted

696
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,080
to stay focused on you and move on.

697
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,875
But I couldn't.

698
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,960
I couldn't do that.

699
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,256
I couldn't let someone else
suffer the same fate as In-han.

700
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,091
It's what I needed to do.

701
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,345
Kang Ha.

702
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,930
That's why I had no choice.

703
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,309
I didn't know
it would lead to you leaving.

704
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,521
I'm sorry.

705
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,858
I'm sorry for making you leave.

706
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:46,531
I'm sorry for having a crush on you.
I'm just sorry for everything.

707
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,708
You wanted to see me smile.

708
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,128
How can you see me through those tears?

709
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,387
Don't worry too much.

710
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,640
I'm not going to New York.

711
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:14,809
What?

712
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:19,605
I'm standing on my own two feet
and following my heart.

713
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:26,112
I'm going to start over in the place
that will make me the happiest.

714
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,868
So, Kang Ha…

715
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,205
don't worry too much about me.

716
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:38,958
And take care.

717
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,721
Oh.

718
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,851
Do you remember the last question
you asked me that day?

719
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,198
You were right. I lied.

720
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,264
Mom.

721
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,658
YOU LOOK SHAKEN UP, KIM RI-AN
