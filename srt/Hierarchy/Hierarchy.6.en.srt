1
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,896
Don't you think
you're being incredibly rude?

3
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,773
No matter how little
my confession meant to you,

4
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,525
you shouldn't reject me like this.

5
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,533
Didn't I tell you not to get in the way?
That I won't just stand by if you do?

6
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,161
What will you do?

7
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,205
You'll just have to wait and see.

8
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,873
You guys abandoned all respect.

9
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,001
Now watch me throw it out the window.

10
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,464
Woo-jin.

11
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,966
Make sure He-ra gets home safe.

12
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,219
You bitch.

13
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,845
He-ra.

14
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,013
I'll get out of here.

15
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,851
That should be the first thing.

16
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,407
I've had enough!

17
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,577
Let go! Ri-an's lack of respect,
Jae-i's arrogance!

18
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,622
I won't take it anymore!

19
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,804
Let go!

20
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,055
Let go of me!

21
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,432
Why are you getting in my way?

22
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,767
Make your choice.

23
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,269
Is it Jae-i, Ri-an, or me?

24
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,186
Who is it?

25
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,105
I said choose!

26
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,313
EPISODE 6
AN ARROW: TO THE HEART

27
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,870
Why are you so late, sweetie?
I was worried you couldn't find the place.

28
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,084
It may be a bit uncomfortable,

29
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,754
but we need to stay here
for the time being.

30
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,716
But I did book a suite for us,
especially for you.

31
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,178
I'll go out and buy us some sushi.

32
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,305
You head upstairs.

33
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,182
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

34
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,767
-Escort her to the room.
-Sure.

35
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,645
Oh, and, He-ra?

36
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,940
I also bought a dress for you

37
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,776
to wear out this weekend.

38
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,278
Try it on upstairs.

39
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,956
Enjoy your stay.

40
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,654
I'll buy you a nicer dress next time.

41
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,131
The chef here nearly moved hotels,
but I managed to convince him to stay.

42
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,467
I know you love the food here.

43
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,931
Apologize to Kang Ha.

44
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,279
Have I done something
that calls for an apology?

45
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,281
Intentional or not,

46
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,577
you're the cause
of the hierarchy and violence

47
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,370
that naturally occurred at school.

48
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,205
You know that.

49
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,332
Is that all my fault?

50
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,295
Think about what Kang Ha's been through
and why he's acting that way.

51
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,298
I understand him completely.

52
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,342
We both had a hand
in what happened to In-han.

53
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,933
I would like to see you
sincerely apologize to him.

54
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,059
Let's not ruin this.

55
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,104
I'm sitting here with you,
talking over a meal.

56
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:05,318
It feels like things are back to normal,
and I'm actually feeling all right.

57
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,862
Apologizing is not difficult.

58
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,238
I don't know how to.

59
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,365
I've never done it before.

60
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:20,917
So…

61
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,836
let's drop it.

62
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,507
It's been ages
since we had dinner together.

63
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,427
Let's just enjoy our meal, Jae-i.

64
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,040
Your expression tells me
you weren't studying just now.

65
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,169
Oh, I was sketching.

66
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,965
Your father has finally made a decision.

67
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,716
On running for president?

68
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,303
I think he'll be able to get
the full support of the Jaeyul Group.

69
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,348
The Jaeyul Group? Not Jooshin?

70
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,235
No one knows about this yet.

71
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,778
What is that?

72
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,197
Evidence that
the Jaeyul Group family's eldest

73
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,658
paid several visits
to an ob-gyn in the States.

74
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,597
Kang Ha.

75
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,481
Let's go. They're waiting for you.

76
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,072
Your taste is risky.

77
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,954
Your interest in scholarship students,
I mean.

78
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,542
I'm sure you had good intentions,
but it's always ended badly.

79
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,296
I heard you won't be going to the States.

80
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,507
That just makes me more concerned
as your homeroom teacher.

81
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,469
I'd hate to see another uproar at school.

82
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,845
Whatever my tastes are,

83
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,724
yours aren't refined enough
for you to be concerned about mine.

84
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,492
"Stand up to them"?

85
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,453
We can't stay here
under these unfair circumstances.

86
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,664
Isn't it unfair to think of it that way?

87
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,000
We're attending a school
with the country's richest kids for free.

88
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,460
What could possibly be unfair?

89
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,378
So?

90
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,131
Will you let them walk all over you,
thinking that's what you deserve?

91
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,466
And if we don't want to?

92
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,801
What can we do?

93
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,386
We need to gather evidence.

94
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,223
They need to learn what they take
for granted is not guaranteed.

95
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,392
The school and the teachers won't do it.

96
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,018
You can't count on the school.

97
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,938
Think about the influence
their parents have on Jooshin.

98
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,232
You think the school would defend us?

99
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,316
He's right.

100
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,651
And you, Kang Ha,

101
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,403
what are your true intentions?

102
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,238
To use us to avenge your brother?

103
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,032
You're right.

104
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,493
That's how it started.

105
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,453
But that's not the only reason anymore.

106
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,373
If we hold back now,
we'll just continue throughout college

107
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,792
and into adulthood.
We'll have to hold back forever.

108
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,293
Does that not matter to you?

109
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,340
You've never even tried
to change anything.

110
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,802
Let's give it a shot.

111
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,101
You and I have
the same intentions and goals, right?

112
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,687
It won't be easy.

113
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,440
It goes without saying with them,
but it's the school too.

114
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,653
We can't be rash.
Unless we face off with them directly.

115
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,364
Directly?

116
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,032
The school knows everything.

117
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,034
They keep tabs on everything we do.

118
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,453
So we need to be cautious.

119
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,706
They know everything?

120
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,585
Where did you get all the info
and videos you have?

121
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,673
JUNG JAE-I

122
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,258
COPYING 2 ITEMS TO USB

123
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,429
I can't tell you that yet.

124
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,724
What's more important is
that we share the same goals.

125
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,934
Let's start at the top.

126
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,853
We'll leak Jae-i and Ri-an's video.

127
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,023
Via the press or social media.
It will destroy them immediately.

128
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,317
We can't do that.

129
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,402
Why not?

130
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,404
Don't tell me you actually like Jae-i.

131
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,075
I need to know for sure

132
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,494
if we're in this together…

133
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,538
or not.

134
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,394
She's not answering?

135
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,022
Who do you think I called?

136
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,816
He-ra.

137
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,735
She hasn't been coming to school
or answering my calls.

138
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,072
Seems like she's pretty hurt.

139
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,200
Ri-an's relieved
that everything's back to normal.

140
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,701
But how do you feel deep down?

141
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,371
Is that

142
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,332
a question I need to answer?

143
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,084
Just make your intentions clear.

144
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,462
We're all having a hard time
because of your decisions.

145
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,464
"All"?

146
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,135
Ri-an, He-ra,

147
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,555
and me too.

148
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,104
If you hadn't pushed Ri-an away

149
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,356
and gone after Kang Ha,
He-ra would've kept

150
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,817
her feelings secret.

151
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,778
You two wouldn't have had any issues, and…

152
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,450
I wouldn't be so heartbroken right now.

153
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,008
-Well done.
-That was good, right?

154
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,092
Quick!

155
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,468
Woo-jin.

156
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,099
Get over here.
I won't go easy on you this time.

157
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,851
For real this time.

158
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,769
Wait! Hold on a second.

159
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,273
Come here.

160
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,190
What? Why?

161
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,318
-From each of us.
-We all get a shot.

162
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,277
-Why?
-One each.

163
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,154
Hurry, flick him.

164
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,080
You're blaming me for everything.

165
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,462
I'm not blaming you.

166
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,464
I'm worried.

167
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,220
I'm worried that all the time
we spent together will mean nothing.

168
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,140
I'm scared

169
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,351
it'll all crumble.

170
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,190
Let's try to make sure
that doesn't happen.

171
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:42,900
Okay?

172
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,948
My heart has never once
strayed away from Ri-an.

173
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,745
I left my heart next to him
and walked away for his sake.

174
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,666
I thought it was the best I could do,

175
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,542
and even now…

176
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,254
it's my only option.

177
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,008
I don't deserve him.

178
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,144
I'll make an effort though.

179
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,564
I want to protect us as much as you do.

180
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,900
Whatever it is,

181
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,695
I'll do whatever I can.

182
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,199
So you should also

183
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,327
make it clear which side you're on.

184
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,247
Is it He-ra? Or

185
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,749
the woman with the Hermès bag?

186
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,922
Which one truly has your heart?

187
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,111
LEE WOO-JIN

188
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,751
Wow, it must be my birthday today.

189
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,295
I read the DM ten times
and thought, "Is this real?"

190
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,963
"An actual date with He-ra?"

191
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,840
Thanks for keeping your promise.

192
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,677
I'm keeping my eyes on you all night.
Who knows when I'll see you again?

193
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,637
I'm taking advantage of this opportunity.

194
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,849
You like me that much?

195
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,145
Everyone else calls me mean and rude
and talks behind my back.

196
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,480
But that's your charm.

197
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,440
Don't develop a taste for bad girls.

198
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,816
You'll just be miserable.

199
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,694
What? He-ra?

200
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,071
What brings you here?

201
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,199
I've actually been meaning to contact you.

202
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,325
Me?

203
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,412
My sister's move to New York fell through.

204
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,039
So I thought

205
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,917
this would be the ideal moment

206
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,752
to pass this on to you.

207
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,170
"Ideal moment"?

208
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,254
You remember, right?

209
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,009
That decisive and lethal hand
I said I had.

210
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,931
Take a look

211
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,893
at my decisive and lethal hand.

212
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,188
It's yours now.

213
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:41,870
Jae-hyeok.

214
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,788
Oh, hey.

215
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,043
Did you watch it?

216
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,003
Did you?

217
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,880
It's great, isn't it?

218
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,348
You asshole.

219
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,353
I had a suspicion,
but you really are a son of a bitch.

220
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,063
One without boundaries, at that.

221
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,024
He-ra!

222
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,195
I recognized a kindred spirit
and did you a favor.

223
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,447
You can't respond with a slap in the face!

224
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,287
I am definitely a bitch,

225
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,330
but I'm a bitch with morals.

226
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,500
Being called a kindred spirit
by someone devoid of humanity

227
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,459
is a little unfair.

228
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:30,961
Don't you think?

229
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,762
That crazy bitch! Seriously?

230
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,182
Wow, this is fucking ridiculous!

231
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,560
Jung Jae-i, you idiot.

232
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,271
Is this how you were being treated?

233
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,648
By that lowlife?

234
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,004
I'll leave these here, ma'am.

235
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,716
I'm so thankful each time you come.

236
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,051
Just a moment.

237
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,472
-Ta-da!
-Oh my.

238
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,807
And don't be thankful.
I get paid to do this.

239
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,142
Thank you. Have a nice day.

240
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,938
My goodness.
Even the way he talks is sweet.

241
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,278
Take that!

242
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,281
Kang Ha!

243
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:43,951
-Hey.
-Get him!

244
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,744
Hey, give me that.

245
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,829
-I told you guys to be careful.
-Kang Ha!

246
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,957
You're lucky I didn't drop my ice cream.

247
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,583
-Seriously?
-You're all wet!

248
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,335
Laughing instead of apologizing?

249
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,336
Is that a challenge?

250
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,921
-Hey!
-Kang Ha!

251
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,965
You're dead.

252
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,925
-Hey!
-We'll all die at this rate!

253
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,803
-I surrender.
-Don't give in!

254
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,429
I'm not dead yet!

255
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,764
Hey, stop!

256
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,599
Where are you going?

257
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,437
Hi, Kang Ha.

258
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,034
Try it. It's really good.

259
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,295
The weather is so nice.

260
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,172
There's a nice breeze,
and the clouds are pretty.

261
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,925
It's fascinating.

262
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,510
What is?

263
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,220
How are you always so happy?

264
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,267
The weather looks the same to me,
but you say it's pretty.

265
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,353
You get into immature water gun fights

266
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,731
and have fun like a little kid.

267
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,738
I've never felt those emotions before.

268
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,575
I always felt anxious,
like I wasn't good enough.

269
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,872
You don't have nearly as much as I do.

270
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,709
How do you find joy in such simple things?

271
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,049
When our after-school classes finished,

272
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,468
In-han and I always stopped
for tteokbokki.

273
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,972
We'd buy tteokbokki and help
the elderly shop owner move things.

274
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,226
And then she'd always buy us ice cream.

275
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,855
I loved things like that.

276
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,691
Playing arcade games on the way home,

277
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,028
eating ice cream outside on a nice day,

278
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,656
running to catch the bus
and seeing an empty seat.

279
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,867
I just love things like that.

280
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,204
I'm jealous.

281
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,123
You have things like that too.

282
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,002
It might not be the breeze or clouds,

283
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,631
but there are things you like,
things that make you happy.

284
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,594
Find those things,

285
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,347
and protect them.

286
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,269
In my experience,
the odds are slightly better

287
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,356
when you face your fears head-on
than when you hide from them.

288
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,027
So even if you could get hurt,
face up to it and fight.

289
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,654
Don't you think it's worth it?

290
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,156
It's about finding what you like.

291
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,705
I want you to have fun, Jae-i.

292
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,212
Even I can see
that you're not happy at all.

293
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,442
You can tell me now.

294
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,197
That's why you came, isn't it?

295
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,744
I want to know what your plan is.

296
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,957
You said you would expose
everything that happened to In-han.

297
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:25,130
I found out who is threatening you.

298
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,050
What's their end goal?

299
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,427
It's the same as mine.

300
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:36,892
We want the people who encourage, enable,
and cause the things happening at Jooshin

301
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,102
to be held accountable for their actions.

302
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,605
I'm thinking of teaming up with them.

303
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,443
I got my hands on a bow.

304
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,822
I'm going to start
drawing back the bowstring.

305
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,617
But I don't want

306
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,827
the arrow to hurt you.

307
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,748
I'll make sure the threats stop.

308
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:04,169
I want to protect you and bring the people
who drove In-han to his death to justice.

309
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,469
Didn't I tell you?

310
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,640
If there's one thing in my life
I want to protect,

311
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,600
it's Ri-an, and Ri-an alone.

312
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:23,855
If you aim that arrow at Ri-an,
I can promise you one thing.

313
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,941
I'll be right there…

314
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,402
in front of Ri-an.

315
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,370
That means we'll end up…

316
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,207
facing each other.

317
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,278
I'm dating Jae-i.

318
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,574
It's been a while,
and I thought you should know.

319
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,287
All the rights and privileges
in the world come with responsibilities.

320
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,790
The path you'll take as the heir,
the burdens you must shoulder…

321
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,083
When you think about that,

322
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,918
such trivial matters are--

323
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,920
I have no intention
of living like you and Dad.

324
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:34,718
Being in a loveless marriage, exchanging
pleasantries a couple of times a year.

325
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,136
I'm not interested in that.

326
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,805
I'm going to date someone I really like

327
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,223
and be happy.

328
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,433
"Someone you like"?

329
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,023
I guess that does seem
quite important at your age.

330
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,359
But, Ri-an, you will soon realize
that's just childish youthfulness

331
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,946
and emotional trickery,
which are incredibly trivial.

332
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,282
I don't care what you think.

333
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,575
I need Jae-i.

334
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,662
I've made myself clear.

335
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,832
I couldn't get hold of you.

336
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,334
I was so frustrated.

337
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,921
I got sick of waiting and just came.

338
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,096
I fixed the car. What do you think?

339
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,515
Good as new, right?

340
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,492
The car is flawless.

341
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,578
I didn't see that thing.

342
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,080
I got rid of it already.

343
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,253
It could put us in danger.

344
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,842
-That car--
-I don't know what's gotten into me.

345
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,554
I thought you might be avoiding me.

346
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,932
My emotions were all over the place.

347
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,643
I didn't know what to do.

348
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,020
I didn't think we shared
the kind of feelings…

349
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,860
that would make your emotions
be all over the place.

350
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,046
I know this isn't love.

351
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,175
And I know you could never be mine.

352
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,553
But I'm still human, so it hurts.

353
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,346
No matter how hurt you are…

354
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,059
that's not something
you can just take out.

355
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,896
-Have you forgotten?
-No.

356
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,105
How could I forget?

357
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,777
That car is a remnant of our time together
and a secret that must stay hidden.

358
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,328
It's He-ra, isn't it?

359
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,248
The person in your heart.

360
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,502
Let's not indulge
in unnecessary fantasies.

361
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,261
Leave that here.

362
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,474
Why?

363
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,601
In case I become a threat?

364
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,061
It's not about that.

365
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,731
It might be dangerous.

366
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,609
Maybe so, but this is
the only thing that can protect me.

367
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,197
You know very well

368
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,785
that the power to protect you
lies with me, not that.

369
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,045
I can't say it was all serious.

370
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,341
But at the very least, it wasn't a lie.

371
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,220
I was comforted, and I felt supported.

372
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,600
But that's enough now.

373
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,440
Let's end things here.

374
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,369
I'll see you at school,

375
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,580
student Lee Woo-jin.

376
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,318
Eyes, heart, head, or neck.

377
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,821
Aim for a spot
that will end its life with one shot.

378
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,699
Hit it properly

379
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,576
and blood will spurt everywhere.

380
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,286
That brown rabbit

381
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,790
will turn red in an instant
with one movement of your hand.

382
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,128
That kind of thrill of the hunt…

383
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,798
will make you stronger.

384
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,764
Go on, pull the trigger.

385
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,727
Jae-i.

386
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,270
Open your eyes.

387
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,857
Why aren't you shooting?

388
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,400
End its life this instant.

389
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,278
Shoot. Right now.

390
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,622
Jung Jae-i.

391
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,915
I don't want to shoot.

392
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,459
I don't want to kill anything.

393
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,420
I won't be coming anymore.

394
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:49,425
Hunting and the pressure you put on me,
I hate it all.

395
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,642
What you just said makes it sound
like you'll disobey my orders

396
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,811
and not listen to me. Is that right?

397
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,981
Before being your daughter
or the eldest of the Jaeyul Group family,

398
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,024
I'm just me.

399
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,401
I think I have the right

400
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,321
to live as Jung Jae-i
and protect the things I want to.

401
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,531
No.

402
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,992
That's not up to you to decide.

403
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,704
I named you myself,

404
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,998
and my blood runs through your veins.

405
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,252
Do you really think
you have the means or right

406
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,587
to give that up?

407
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,094
As long as you have that,

408
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,640
you won't be able to make
any decisions for yourself.

409
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,103
It's the price and duty

410
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,773
of the days you've lived.

411
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:47,984
It is everything.

412
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:54,407
From the beginning,
you were just a part of me that I made.

413
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,131
Find out who filmed it
and would dare send that to me.

414
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,841
Start by finding the source.

415
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,301
We'll take care of it ASAP.

416
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,012
This can't be leaked anywhere.

417
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,015
Use whatever means necessary to block it.

418
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,560
Nobody can find out about this,
not the school, not my mother.

419
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,523
Everyone here must
put their jobs on the line to block it.

420
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,440
No matter what.

421
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,495
TRADING FIRM INTERNATIONAL YOON
FACING BANKRUPTCY

422
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,626
Is this for real? Are they really broke?

423
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,754
It says He-ra's family
is in the final stages of bankruptcy.

424
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,132
What'll happen to He-ra now?

425
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,342
Ri-an rejected her,
and Jae-i cut ties with her.

426
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,011
If her family is broke,
our Queen He-ra is done for.

427
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,013
Hey, she's no Queen He-ra now.

428
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,141
You know how she acted at school.

429
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,143
She's completely ruined!

430
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,404
Time for the morning announcement.
Take your seats.

431
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:03,995
I need a moment.

432
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,337
There's something we need to discuss.

433
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,672
What is it?

434
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,008
Last year at the vacation home,

435
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,886
someone filmed us.

436
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,348
But don't worry about it.

437
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,517
I'll deal with it
so that there are no issues.

438
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,394
Who sent that to you?

439
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,604
I'm looking for them.

440
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,772
You just stay by my side.

441
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,065
I'll handle it.

442
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,442
Just don't run away.

443
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,985
Let me protect you.

444
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,371
I said I would give you an opportunity.

445
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:51,042
You know what has been happening
at Jooshin High.

446
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:55,254
Stop condoning their actions,
and punish them according to regulations.

447
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,715
I am giving you

448
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,927
one last chance
for the school to fulfill its role.

449
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,555
I wonder where you get
all your confidence.

450
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,266
I have

451
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,562
a massive bomb
that would blow Jooshin away.

452
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,441
A bomb?

453
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,485
If you let this slide like before,

454
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,904
my friends and I

455
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,615
will set off that bomb.

456
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,751
What are you doing?

457
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,712
Why would you meet with the principal
without consulting me?

458
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,089
I'm setting things right.

459
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,801
If that's the case,
we should take down Ri-an first.

460
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,552
You wanted to start at the top.

461
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,721
The adults who let Jooshin get this way

462
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,765
are the top.

463
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:52,019
Is this why you said you'd join me?
Why did you really approach me?

464
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,440
Don't tell me.

465
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,610
So you could protect Jae-i?

466
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,280
Hey, Ju-won, where is this coming from?

467
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,990
I'm right. It's because of Jae-i.

468
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,701
Do you know what kind of secret she has?

469
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,869
You haven't seen everything. If you knew--

470
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,787
So it's you.

471
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,213
The blackmailer.

472
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,688
So you've drawn your bow.

473
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,525
I told you that I'd make them pay.

474
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,737
I'm going to tell my family
and notify the school.

475
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,531
I'll say there's a video

476
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,075
and that it might be leaked
for the world to see.

477
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,745
I will tell them everything myself.

478
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,664
Why would you? If you do that, you'll--

479
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:58,044
Probably get beaten half to death
by my dad, then hidden away in New York.

480
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,171
Even so,

481
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,173
at least they'll stop it.

482
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,258
My dad and the school.

483
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,012
They'll do whatever it takes
to make sure it doesn't get out.

484
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,222
It's what Jooshin does.

485
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,809
So you're going to take matters
into your own hands?

486
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,561
I don't care what happens to me.

487
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,855
I'll protect Ri-an.

488
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,736
Why?

489
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,239
He's my everything.

490
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,532
Exactly! Why?

491
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,368
Why does your everything…

492
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,705
have to be Kim Ri-an?

493
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,419
Because to Ri-an,

494
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,422
I'm everything too.

495
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,966
That's how we grew up.

496
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,511
We leaned on each other.

497
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,140
If Ri-an falls apart, I will too.

498
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,350
Do as you wish, then.

499
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,728
I won't give up.

500
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,441
I don't care if you stand in front of him
or if we all die…

501
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,195
I'm seeing this through.

502
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,162
I was pregnant.

503
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,420
Don't turn around.

504
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,713
Just stand there and listen.

505
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,510
I was scared.

506
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,807
Scared I'd be cast aside by my dad,
like my mom was.

507
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:40,438
Scared I'd lose everything I had
and be thrown out overnight.

508
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,108
So I ran off to the States by myself.

509
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,823
But I couldn't do it.

510
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,494
I tried going to the hospital twice.

511
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,080
I couldn't figure out what to do.

512
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,416
But then…

513
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,336
one day, I was in so much pain.

514
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,467
It must've known
about my negative thoughts.

515
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,554
And just as it first came to me,

516
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,515
all of a sudden, it was gone.

517
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,652
What about Ri-an?

518
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,323
Does he know?

519
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,038
He doesn't know.

520
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,208
I just…

521
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,920
did my best to avoid him.

522
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,966
I couldn't bear to look at Ri-an
as though nothing had happened.

523
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,427
"It's better this way."

524
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,473
"Things are back to normal now.
That's why I went to the States."

525
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,559
"Just like that,

526
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,103
it will all be forgotten."

527
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,606
"It will all be over if we break up."

528
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,860
That was how I was holding on.

529
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,660
But you turned up and ruined everything.

530
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,496
You keep making me

531
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,332
face the feelings
I've been running away from.

532
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,876
You dig up memories that I've buried.

533
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,340
You make me aware of thoughts
I didn't know I had.

534
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:33,968
You do that.

535
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,446
So from now on…

536
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,826
I'm going to do what you taught me.

537
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,289
You're going to fight?

538
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,040
I'm going to protect what I like.

539
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,128
So if you must draw your bow, go for it.

540
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,841
I will gladly stand in your way.

541
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,565
I've finally found you.

542
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,029
How long have you been here?

543
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,073
You should've told us things were bad.

544
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,617
"Us"? Who do you mean by "us"?

545
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,868
Ri-an and Jae-i?

546
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,079
Or the self-conscious Lee Woo-jin?

547
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,122
Who can I be a part of an "us" with?

548
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,919
Let's find a way out first.
I'll just find it myself.

549
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,588
Let's start by going to my studio.

550
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,840
Stop acting like
a knight in shining armor.

551
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,385
Don't add fuel to my fire.
I already feel like shit.

552
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,427
He-ra.

553
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,595
I'm going to drop out.

554
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:46,058
Ri-an, Jae-i, and Woo-jin, let's just
say our goodbyes, for good.

555
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,644
We have no reason to hang out anymore.

556
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,229
How could you say that?

557
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,730
I'm so sick of all of you.

558
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,149
Especially Jae-i, that idiot…

559
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,863
Why do I even bother?

560
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,159
You're going to drop out because of us?
Because of Jae-i?

561
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,578
I'd rather leave. I can't stand you all.

562
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,163
So you're still angry.

563
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,207
Isn't it too soon for me to be over it?

564
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,876
Considering all that Jae-i's done to me.

565
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:16,922
That bitch.

566
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,676
How could she not say a single word to me?

567
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,893
You said to choose, right?

568
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,773
It's you, He-ra. I choose you.

569
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:38,861
So?

570
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,447
What can your choice do for me?

571
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,115
Get revenge.

572
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,828
Don't drop out. Stay at Jooshin.

573
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,169
APPLICATION TO WITHDRAW ENROLLMENT

574
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,546
NAME: YOON HE-RA

575
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,507
REASON FOR WITHDRAWAL

576
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,347
Is running away the best you can do?

577
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,350
You always go to extremes.

578
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,061
What do you expect to happen
after you suddenly drop out?

579
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,021
You're so damn annoying.

580
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,983
Why are you taking turns
to come and bother me?

581
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,527
Worry about yourself.

582
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:06,073
Jae-i, what kind of place
do you think Jooshin is?

583
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,200
"What kind of place"?

584
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,035
It's a jungle.

585
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,413
If you get distracted here,
anyone can attack you.

586
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,668
But it also has one very solid philosophy.

587
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,129
That an education here will be
unattainable to those with no money.

588
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,051
That's why we looked down on those kids
and treated them like they were invisible.

589
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,344
And you expect me

590
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,889
to endure that torture here?

591
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,058
That's not what I'm saying.

592
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,894
If you have time to worry,
worry about yourself first.

593
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,479
You have bigger fish to fry.

594
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,815
What do you mean?

595
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:47,197
What gives you the right to boss me around
when you tell me nothing about your life?

596
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:53,537
Jae-i, did you ever
even consider me your friend?

597
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,807
Hey, it's He-ra.

598
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,566
You idiot.

599
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,193
"Idiot"?

600
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,696
Your greetings have become
overly aggressive.

601
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,281
It's an insult, not a greeting.

602
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:32,367
What kind of idiot can't even protect
his own girlfriend?

603
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,202
What do you mean?

604
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,207
The vacation home.
Your memories there together.

605
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,253
Someone filmed it.
I wonder who that could be.

606
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,841
How do you know about that?

607
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,468
Jae-i's family own that place.

608
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,846
Only one person would go there
besides you two.

609
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,308
Move, damn it.

610
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,851
Just get out of here already.

611
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,114
YEAR 1 LOCKER ROOM

612
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,618
Hey! Everyone out, except for Jae-hyeok.

613
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,577
-Get lost!
-Go!

614
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,871
Run!

615
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,623
Get out. Aren't you leaving?

616
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,347
-Hey.
-You piece of trash.

617
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,516
What were you thinking?

618
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,768
What were you planning to do with it?

619
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,604
Yoon He-ra, you fucking bitch.

620
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,066
Ri-an, it's not what you think…

621
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,823
Get lost. They're just talking.

622
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,074
Just leave, you punks.

623
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,784
-Is he dying?
-What's going on?

624
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,703
Seems a little extreme.

625
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,396
You piece of trash.

626
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,691
Do you know what the hell you did?

627
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,027
Get lost.

628
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,161
Ri-an!

629
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,079
Are you insane?

630
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,206
Get over here. Cut it out.

631
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,292
How dare you touch me?

632
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,502
You fucking scholarship student.

633
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,757
-Move.
-Stop.

634
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,926
-Move.
-I said stop.

635
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,933
Let go of me before I kill you first.

636
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,269
-Just stop already.
-You fucker.

637
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,896
Just think before you act!

638
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,149
How do you think Jae-i would feel
if she knew you were beating people up?

639
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,613
How dare you

640
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,241
speak about Jae-i.

641
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,202
You're so pathetic.

642
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,370
What?

643
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,956
You have no idea
what she's enduring to survive.

644
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,833
All because of you!

645
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:32,047
What she's been through
and what she's prepared to go through.

646
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,342
What are you talking about?

647
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,676
And you know what?

648
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,638
She wants to take it on herself.

649
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,139
Like I said!

650
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,934
Like I said,

651
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,937
I'm asking you what you're talking about.

652
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:48,730
Hey.

653
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:50,732
Answer me.

654
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,026
What do you mean by that?

655
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,487
You protect her from now on,

656
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,282
so she doesn't have to endure it alone.

657
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,127
-Pass it.
-Pass the ball.

658
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,969
There he goes again.

659
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,224
-Bus is here.
-Let's get on.

660
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,256
This is a nice dress.

661
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,136
What? Are you here to gawk?

662
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:04,014
Are you here to congratulate me
on the squalor I live in?

663
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,809
I don't care about anything else.

664
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,938
I just want you to know one thing.

665
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,987
I have never thought of you
as anything but a friend.

666
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:25,410
You were always my friend,
and that's why I spent time with you.

667
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,246
The same goes for now.

668
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,842
What's with the sudden friend talk?

669
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,807
Yes, Dad?

670
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,601
He-ra! It's done.

671
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,228
We're going to be fine.

672
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,063
We can keep the company afloat.

673
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,690
-Is that true?
-Yes.

674
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,067
Of course it's true.

675
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,486
The Jaeyul Group said they would help us.

676
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,321
Now there's nothing to worry about.

677
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,907
See you soon, sweetie. I love you.

678
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:10,997
Did you do this?

679
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:13,833
I told you.

680
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,671
I've never thought of you
as anything but a friend.

681
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,260
Jae-i.

682
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,806
Pregnant?

683
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,395
You…

684
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,482
you are so determined to drive me insane!

685
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,944
How is it possible that you have

686
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,321
such a chilling resemblance
to your mother?

687
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:47,701
Leave for New York immediately,
before any rumors start.

688
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,417
Answer me.

689
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,294
I'll go.

690
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,254
On one condition.

691
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,007
Help He-ra's father's company,

692
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,300
International Yoon.

693
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,428
He-ra is my closest friend.

694
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,014
I don't think
you're in a position to ask for favors.

695
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:13,435
Furthermore, why should I even entertain
any requests from you?

696
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:17,230
That way, I will go to New York
and do what you want me to.

697
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,192
I know I'm the link between
the Gongseong Group and the Jaeyul Group.

698
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,069
I'm well aware.

699
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,327
I'm going to New York.

700
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,663
You should visit.
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

701
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,285
Pull over, please.

702
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,227
How could you keep that from me?

703
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,354
How?

704
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,651
How could you bear it all alone?

705
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:48,655
So…

706
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,617
you found out.

707
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,829
How am I supposed to live
with the guilt of leaving you alone?

708
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,997
I let you go through that by yourself.

709
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,210
How…

710
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:08,091
how am I supposed to forgive myself?

711
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,225
No matter how hard I try to run away,

712
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,395
I'm still in the same place.

713
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,148
Why would you run away in the first place?

714
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,195
I'm here next to you.

715
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,913
I didn't want you to get hurt too.

716
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,002
So I tried my hardest to run away.

717
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,299
I get sad when I look at you…

718
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,720
and I was worried you would be too.

719
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,099
So I ran away like a crazy person.

720
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:03,480
But in the end…

721
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,858
here we are.

722
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,203
You must have been so scared.

723
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,455
How did you get through that alone?

724
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,584
I'm sorry.

725
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,879
I'm so sorry, Jae-i.

726
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,930
I'm sorry about everything.

727
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:41,392
I won't let you go through
anything like that alone ever again.

728
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,228
From now on,

729
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,564
I'm never letting go of your hand.

734
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,497
I never would've worked with you
if I knew you'd use this

735
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:46,666
to attack people.

736
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,626
Kim Ri-an, Choi Yun-seok,

737
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,671
the violence their gang committed,
the videos I watched…

738
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,009
that's already more than enough evidence.

739
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:58,928
That petty violence?

740
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,139
It's not scandalous.

741
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,475
Unless it's scandalous,
it has no impact or meaning.

742
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,935
Give me my phone right now.

743
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,062
I can't.

744
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,317
Jae-i already knows it was me.

745
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,443
"Legitimate means"?

746
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,778
We can't win against them that way.

747
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,114
We have to strike first.

748
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,490
Kim Ri-an and Jung Jae-i,

749
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,160
I will destroy them first.

750
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,706
Give it back!

751
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,833
This isn't right, Ju-won!

752
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:33,004
We're trying to right wrongs,
not destroy someone's life!

753
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:34,631
You bastard!

754
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,966
You're doing this because of Jae-i.

755
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,719
Hey, snap out of it.

756
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,805
Have you forgotten why you're at Jooshin?
Your brother, Kang In-han!

757
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,062
Have you forgotten how they treated him?

758
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,257
Ri-an?

759
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:22,845
My tears…

760
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,599
won't stop, Woo-jin.

761
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,229
I really want to stop crying.

762
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:37,860
But I can't.

763
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,494
So, Mr. Woo-jin…

764
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,669
what do you want from me
in exchange for this?

765
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,051
Jae-i.

766
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,887
Please send her to New York.

767
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,477
Just make Jae-i leave.

768
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,104
Make sure…

769
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,858
make sure she can't come back.

770
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:23,865
Please accommodate my request,

771
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,701
or you will see a story
about Jaeyul Group's eldest

772
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,579
having been pregnant
as a high school student

773
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,874
on the news.
