HIERARCHY

2
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,247
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

3
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,343
It's time to get up.

4
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,311
Did you sleep well?

5
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,146
Yeah.

6
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,245
Don't be late.

7
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,043
-See you later at school.
-Okay.

8
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,568
EPISODE 2
SECRET: WITHIN A SECRET

9
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,080
Let's break up, Ri-an.

10
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,429
I trust you've been well.

11
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,681
Hand them out, please.

12
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,730
Thank you, Chairwoman An.

13
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,984
I thought you were coming next month.

14
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,196
Ri-an, my son.

15
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,322
Have you been well?

16
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,617
My Singapore trip ended early,
so I'm here for a few days.

17
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,995
How is school?

18
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,746
You're a senior now.

19
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,957
You'll be in college in no time.

20
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,086
You've grown up so fast.
It's making me nostalgic.

21
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,797
I'm a junior.

22
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,465
What?

23
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,592
I have a year left before graduation.

24
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,470
That's great.

25
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,806
Any college preferences?

26
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,684
I think the UK would be best.

27
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,601
Oh.

28
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,105
-Let's go through my schedule.
-Yes, ma'am.

29
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,324
Luncheon with the board at noon.
Jooshin Gallery at two o'clock.

30
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,658
Jooshin Hotel at four.

31
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,119
And what else was there?

32
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,746
The meeting with Director An.

33
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,874
-I'll see him briefly after the luncheon.
-Noted.

34
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,251
Besides the weather, London is perfect.

35
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,253
Choose a school in the UK.

36
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,629
You won't regret it.

37
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,173
I last saw you three months ago

38
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,216
and shared a meal with you
over a year ago.

39
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,178
Don't you care whether I've been well,

40
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,097
if I'm eating properly,
or if I'm in good health?

41
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,643
I'm still at an age
where I need the attention of my parents.

42
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,897
Who do we have on staff
in charge of Ri-an's care?

43
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,859
Six tutors, two personal assistants,
three health specialists, four dieticians.

44
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,321
What attention are you lacking?

45
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,666
Let's set up a meeting with President Ryu
before the board meeting.

46
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,751
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,156
Tae-ho!

48
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,409
Hey!

49
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,160
Oh, hey, it's Tae-ho!

50
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,079
What's going on here?

51
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:53,996
What…

52
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,874
You pauper. How dare you touch me?

53
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,546
Hey, Tae-ho.

54
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,719
You're completely clueless, aren't you?

55
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,596
-Do you know him?
-No way.

56
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,474
How would he know
the only son of Jaeyul Hotel's owner?

57
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,809
Hey, scholarship kid.

58
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,978
Being schoolmates doesn't make us friends.

59
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,440
-You're laughing? Wow.
-He laughed.

60
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,359
A peasant daring to touch
a nobleman's shoulder

61
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,444
and laughing about it?

62
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,863
Poor Tae-ho. What if his shoulder rots?

63
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,366
Ta-da!

64
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,993
No way! He actually came?

65
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,829
If Ri-an sees him,
he'll want to gut him at the very least.

66
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,706
He's seriously something else.

67
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,291
What happened that night?

68
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,210
Didn't Jae-i just stand there
when he kissed her?

69
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,420
Maybe they're an item.

70
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,089
No way. A lowly scholarship kid and Jae-i?

71
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,048
It's not possible.

72
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,341
Right, He-ra?

73
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,220
It's not totally impossible.

74
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,765
Scholarship or not,
all that matters is that Jae-i likes him.

75
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,933
I think it's admirable.

76
00:07:56,017 --> 00:08:00,021
The courage to like someone
regardless of status or background.

77
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:00,980
Really?

78
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,858
What about you, He-ra?
Any guy's okay as long as you like him?

79
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,984
I'm different.

80
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,070
I'm not attracted to men
who are weaker and less affluent.

81
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,031
It's just in my DNA.

82
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,200
Hey. He's coming.

83
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,230
You're done if you get on their bad side.

84
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,857
What Chan-min said the other day is true.

85
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,942
The kid who died.

86
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,443
He got on Ri-an's bad side.

87
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,238
They said it was a hit-and-run.

88
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,282
But he ran into traffic
out of fear of being bullied.

89
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,202
Or someone hit him on purpose.

90
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,872
What did that kid do
to get on Ri-an's bad side?

91
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,124
It was because of Jae-i.

92
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,502
He dared to become friends with her.

93
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,254
-That's all?
-"That's all"?

94
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,630
Jae-i is Ri-an's girlfriend.

95
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,091
She's Kim Ri-an's only hot button
and Achilles heel.

96
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,175
That's what she is.

97
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,043
I have one question.

98
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,296
Why go to such extremes around me?

99
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,589
What kinds of extremes?

100
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,966
That kiss?

101
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,304
"Let's break up. Let's just be friends."

102
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,973
I've been perfectly clear
about my feelings.

103
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,392
Who I like and what I do with them

104
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,644
is none of your concern.

105
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,562
You like him?

106
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,772
That scholarship kid?

107
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,775
What could possibly be

108
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,820
the real reason
you're using a clueless kid

109
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,990
to break up with me?

110
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,452
The reason you're determined to hide.

111
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,454
I need to know, Jung Jae-i.

112
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,956
And on that note,

113
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,667
I wonder what I'll end up doing.

114
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,464
I'm willing to do whatever it takes,
regardless of means or method,

115
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,094
until I find out
what you're keeping from me

116
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,263
and you return to your rightful place.

117
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,076
I'll take care of him quietly.

118
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,496
Not quietly. Crush him thoroughly.

119
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:09,335
He needs to learn the consequences
of laying his hands on what's mine.

120
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,629
Don't you think we should be lying low?

121
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,631
It hasn't been long since that guy died.

122
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,470
I'll handle it and make sure he suffers.

123
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,767
From this point forward,

124
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,020
any asshole that acknowledges
the new scholarship student

125
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,355
or even speaks to him

126
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,524
will be considered his equal.

127
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,943
Chan-min.

128
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,114
I shouldn't have to tell you
to take care of these things.

129
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,658
How much longer
do I need to explain every damn thing?

130
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,702
I'm ashamed to call myself a senior.

131
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,579
I was actually coming up with a plan
to take care of him.

132
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,756
Seriously.

133
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,009
Who makes those kinds of plans
in front of someone?

134
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,762
-Right?
-You motherfucker.

135
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,222
Do you have a death wish?

136
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,018
Yun-seok just told you not to speak to me.

137
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,353
Didn't you hear him?

138
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,147
This crazy fucker…

139
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,404
Chan-min, I'm not the one
you should be hitting.

140
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,114
-It should be Yun-seok.
-Hey!

141
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,743
-Right?
-My fucking bones!

142
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,328
You son of a bitch!
The hell are you guys doing?

143
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,875
This is fucking bullshit…

144
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,962
Fuck!

145
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,548
What is going on?

146
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,510
A senior?

147
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,804
What are you doing here?

148
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,600
Damn it. How fucking embarrassing.

149
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,609
I have a brief announcement to make.

150
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,612
This year's Healing Forest
will go ahead as planned.

151
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,156
Make sure to check the notice
in the group chat.

152
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,201
And notify me in advance
if you can't attend.

153
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,703
That's all.

154
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,462
Jae-i.

155
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,300
Can we talk for a moment?

156
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,679
Talk.

157
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:28,933
Just say it.

158
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,309
It doesn't matter.

159
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,356
You heard her.

160
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,237
I'm sorry about the other day.

161
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,533
If I startled or offended--

162
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,492
Scholarship kid.

163
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,785
Kang Ha is my name.

164
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,121
Not "scholarship kid." Kang Ha.

165
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,331
Whatever your name is.

166
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,792
We just had fun at a party.
Don't overreact.

167
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,418
I hate people who are clingy.

168
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,588
Oh, can I give you some advice?

169
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,800
This is to repay you for the shirt,
so listen up.

170
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,932
Drop out of school.

171
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:10,850
"Drop out"?

172
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,477
Why should I drop out?

173
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,189
You provoked Ri-an, and it's the only way
you can stand up to him.

174
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,529
If that's what you mean,
I'll take care of it myself.

175
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,446
And…

176
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,491
I liked it.

177
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,870
That it was you that day

178
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,706
and that you didn't push me away.

179
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,457
I liked it.

180
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,760
I'm all for it,

181
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,013
this passionate romance
that transcends status.

182
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,018
But why did you choose Jae-i that day?
There were so many other girls.

183
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,269
Because she's pretty.

184
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,353
What?

185
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,273
She was the prettiest.

186
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,025
That day.

187
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,819
Out of the countless girls.

188
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,575
That's it?

189
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,080
You put your life on the line
simply because she was pretty?

190
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,513
I felt I had to do something.

191
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,015
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,975
Whatever it is.

193
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,561
I'm just sorry for it all.

194
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,577
How do I look? Cool, right?

195
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,330
It suits you very well.

196
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,332
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

197
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,209
Shall we?

198
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,135
I got it all on camera.

199
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,821
What are you eating?

200
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,156
-Ice cream.
-Alone?

201
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,033
-There's only one spoon.
-Here.

202
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,953
Open up.

203
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,497
Come closer so I can give it to you.

204
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,791
Give it to me. Seriously!

205
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,459
Hey!

206
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,502
Hey, you!

207
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,422
Hey!

208
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,090
Hey.

209
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,053
Admit defeat?
You don't mess with people's food.

210
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,597
Pick one. Ice cream or me.

211
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,598
Ice cream.

212
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,392
Get over here.

213
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,728
I'll give it to you.

214
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,942
Open up. Wider.
Hey, come closer to take it.

215
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,986
Seriously? Hey!

216
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,279
Is it your fault or not?

217
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,156
-It's my fault.
-You admit it?

218
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,365
It's really my fault.

219
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,826
-Hold on.
-What for?

220
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,203
Are you seriously beating me up over food?

221
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,706
-Because you messed up.
-Is it ice cream or me?

222
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,791
-Of course it's--
-Of course?

223
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,376
-Of course--
-Of course?

224
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,170
-Ice cream.
-Are you about to cry?

225
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,797
Come over here. Hey!

226
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,507
You're a pure and loyal romantic.

227
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,676
That gets unattractive though.

228
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,975
I saw Jae-i outside the hotel.

229
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,778
Did you even hear what I said?
That's unattractive.

230
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,907
What's more, Jae-i's the type
to hate people who are clingy.

231
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,916
I suggest using a different method.

232
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,293
A different method?

233
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,796
Date someone else, Ri-an.

234
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,550
Since the age of 15… No.

235
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,513
After only having eyes for Jae-i since
the age of six, Ri-an's with someone else?

236
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,890
I wouldn't be able to stand it.

237
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,226
I'd go back to you or steal you back.

238
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,270
-So I should date someone else?
-Yeah.

239
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,022
Or at least pretend to.

240
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,945
Jae-i still has feelings for you.
That's why she came here.

241
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,907
I'm saying you should stop chasing
and start strategizing.

242
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,575
It's your best chance.

243
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,537
In that case…

244
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,251
you should

245
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,711
look into that.

246
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,550
Look into what, exactly?

247
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,929
The real reason Jae-i broke up with me.

248
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,228
That would be tricky.

249
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,732
I want you two to get back together,
but I'm Jae-i's best friend.

250
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,192
I can't be a spy, can I?

251
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,063
-Hey.
-It's been a while.

252
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,358
Just tell me already.

253
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,445
Tell you what?

254
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,614
I sense you have secrets you can't share.

255
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,991
That's a heavy burden to bear.

256
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,743
I'll share the load.

257
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,167
Just a second.

258
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,338
Guess I'm not the only one
with a secret I can't share.

259
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,259
Be right back.

260
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,484
If you keep ignoring me,

261
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,654
I'll consider sending this
to your father too.

262
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,830
Is this the email address
for Jaeyul Group's secretary's office?

263
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,686
I thought it was over.

264
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,522
You said you deleted it all.
Isn't that enough?

265
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,825
Are you

266
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,868
sure about this?

267
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,953
I'm sure.

268
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,622
I checked twice…
no, three times, over and over.

269
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,167
Now what? What should I do now?

270
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,127
What do I do?

271
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,255
Let's look for a way.

272
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,842
A way to what?
It took so much to keep it under wraps.

273
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,806
-Jae-i.
-You have no idea what my dad is like.

274
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,933
If he finds out,

275
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,643
he'll hide me away like my mom

276
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:52,978
or just kill me.

277
00:21:55,772 --> 00:22:00,027
Then I'd be better off dying
before it gets out.

278
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,154
Let's find a way.

279
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,822
I'll help you.

280
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,118
I'm so scared I'll end up like my mom.

281
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,870
I'm scared my dad might kill me.

282
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,342
What is that?

283
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:28,889
-You didn't…
-Jae-i?

284
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,600
What? Hey!

285
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,602
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Jae-i.

286
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,063
-What are you doing here? Get out.
-Jae-i!

287
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,272
Come out for a second.

288
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,160
How about it, Jung Jae-i?
Are you interested in speaking to me now?

289
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,846
-Leaving already?
-Yes.

290
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,681
I'm tired. You should go too.

291
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,362
You almost had it.

292
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,030
So close, Dad.

293
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,338
Chairman Jung.

294
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,760
What is it?

295
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,390
What?

296
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,605
What has surfaced?

297
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,236
Double-check the details and stand by.

298
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,706
What is the meaning of this, Jae-i?

299
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,171
No way would my daughter do that.

300
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,088
It can't be right.

301
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,842
You acted like your mother, knowing about
my disdain for her vulgarity?

302
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,010
There's no way.

303
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,805
I trust that my daughter would never do
anything of the sort.

304
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,517
Answer me.

305
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,103
Don't stand there like a speechless fool!

306
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,028
I said answer me!

307
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,033
I need to get going.

308
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,706
Something came up at work.

309
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,752
It must be bad news.

310
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,463
Something odd was posted
on the board members' forum.

311
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,215
I'll need to assess it.

312
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,553
We haven't gone hunting together
as a family in so long,

313
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,096
and I've ruined it.

314
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,975
Take your time coming down.

315
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,995
That's done. Now lemon zest…

316
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:43,124
Director Jang was calling
at an early hour.

317
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,585
You sure the company is okay?

318
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,754
Of course, we're fine.

319
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,215
Have you heard from Jooshin?

320
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,386
We'll be working together soon.

321
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,681
Is it already that time again?

322
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,642
Yes, it certainly is!

323
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,563
The day that I get to make
my daughter's breakfast myself!

324
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,861
Come see me at the house later.

325
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,907
Why is she bossing me around again?

326
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,412
That's so damn funny.

327
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,582
Hey.

328
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,324
They spiked my drink.

329
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,993
It had to have been drugs.

330
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,415
I almost died.

331
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,334
I'm serious.

332
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:13,048
Wait. In-han. Just calm down.
How would high schoolers have drugs?

333
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,215
You have no idea…

334
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,136
what kind of place Jooshin is…

335
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,349
what kind of people they are.

336
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,827
Did one of your parents
get wrongfully terminated from Jooshin?

337
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,913
Or a supplier that stopped getting work?

338
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,583
What the hell are you
for me to be so bothered by you?

339
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,503
They say that Kim Ri-an is the law
and at the heart of Jooshin.

340
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,547
Whether I reach that heart or destroy it,

341
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,676
I'm just trying my best to survive here.

342
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,718
"Reach"

343
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:00,887
or "destroy"?

344
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,480
I don't know what your true motive
is here, scholarship kid,

345
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:12,857
but go for it.

346
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,569
Whatever it is, if you can.

347
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,201
Violence. Bullying.

348
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,912
Kim Ri-an was behind it all.

349
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,207
Were the drugs his doing too?

350
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,103
It needs to happen at the Healing Forest
or we're dead.

351
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,274
But he didn't even flinch
when you punched him.

352
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,900
How will we drive him away?

353
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,236
We just have to break his will.

354
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,863
We'll either beat him to a pulp

355
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,992
or make him disappear
like that jerk Kang In-han.

356
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,787
No one would bat an eye
if another outcast died anyway.

357
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,206
Get off your phone
when your senior is talking.

358
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,792
I should just pummel these idiots.

359
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:19,215
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

360
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,899
My teacher asked me to give you this.

361
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,233
Thanks.

362
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,446
How is everything?
Are you getting along with everyone?

363
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,907
Who do you mean by that?

364
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,203
Ri-an, Jae-i, Woo-jin, He-ra.
I mean your friends, of course.

365
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,704
Friends?

366
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,624
They're all fine.

367
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,834
Don't hang around with useless kids.

368
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,545
The friendships you make here
will last a lifetime.

369
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,465
They'll be helpful when you start working.

370
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,926
You know what I mean, don't you?

371
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,804
Yes.

372
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,184
But, Mom…

373
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,813
how did you cover it up?

374
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,650
In-han's death.

375
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,778
Not a single article was published.

376
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,072
I'm just curious.

377
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,785
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

378
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,912
You'll be late to class.

379
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,682
Please open it.

380
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,059
I saw Ri-an put drugs
into Yun-seok's locker.

381
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,983
It's against policy
to open student lockers.

382
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,359
It violates privacy.

383
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,778
If you don't open it for me,
I'll file a formal complaint.

384
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,488
File a complaint?

385
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,491
-About what?
-You saw me being attacked.

386
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,159
But you ignored it.

387
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,330
Kang Ha.

388
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,416
A school is a mini society.

389
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,500
At Jooshin,

390
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,880
we aid students by giving them
the freedom to resolve minor issues.

391
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,841
Aid us? With what?

392
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,803
"They're the sons of the companies
you'll end up working for anyway."

393
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,640
"You're a poor nobody who should know
his place and crawl before them."

394
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,352
Don't tell me that's the kind of aid
you're referring to.

395
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,396
-Kang Ha!
-I'll go to the press.

396
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,316
I'll tell them about being assaulted
and Jooshin's rules.

397
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,650
Everything.

398
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:31,991
Boo!

399
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,117
You scared me.

400
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,370
I'm hungry. Buy me some yogurt.

401
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,454
-Yogurt?
-Yeah.

402
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,957
-Let's go. Sure.
-Strawberry?

403
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,221
Is this what you were talking about?

404
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,598
Please deal with this
in an official manner.

405
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,977
Find out what kinds of drugs they are,
who is dealing them to whom,

406
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,521
and who they were given to.

407
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,689
This is Xanax.

408
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,733
It's an antidepressant.

409
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,861
You may not know
since you went to a normal school,

410
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,990
but the kids here need it
because they're under so much pressure.

411
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,953
If you don't believe me,
take it to a hospital or police station.

412
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,001
But put it back before anyone finds out.

413
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,672
So you don't cause problems.

414
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,771
You know how to find out who's sending
anonymous DMs on Insta, don't you?

415
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,440
I'm not sure.

416
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,108
Why do you ask?

417
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,361
You said you know a good law firm, right?

418
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,697
Well, that I do know.

419
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,742
Eun-gyeong prosecuted
internet trolls through that firm.

420
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,620
I heard the head office
dislikes disclosing account details.

421
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,289
So anons are harder to trace.

422
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,958
I don't mind
if it's not a legitimate route.

423
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,669
Find someone
who can trace anonymous accounts.

424
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,757
How would I do that?

425
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,844
You have a wider social circle
than I do and--

426
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,888
On the day of Woo-jin's birthday party,

427
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,432
a video was recorded.

428
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,559
A video?

429
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,478
Someone has it in their possession.

430
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,146
Wait.

431
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,065
Who has it?

432
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,067
And how? What was recorded?

433
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,486
Was it anything bad?

434
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,364
Was there anything at that party
that was okay to be recorded and shared?

435
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,284
Was there a single thing?

436
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,458
Do whatever you need to do
to find someone.

437
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,050
Hey, what do you think of this?

438
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,303
It's nice.

439
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,888
Should I pick one more?

440
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,140
How long is this year's Healing Forest?

441
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,350
Isn't it one day?

442
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,185
Who was that guy?

443
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,270
Kang…

444
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,398
The dead scholarship student.

445
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,608
Kang In-han?

446
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,777
Didn't he die
on the day of Woo-jin's party?

447
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,278
Yeah, it was that day.

448
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,858
This is Yoon He-ra. How have you been?

449
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,193
I need to look into something.

450
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:32,648
Now, students,
we will begin today's floating session.

451
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,525
Relax your body and lie back…

452
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,659
Take a deep breath in.

453
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,286
Inhale.

454
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,174
Nice shot!

455
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,809
By the way, did he come?

456
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,727
The puppy.

457
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,645
I did see him.

458
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,274
I think
Kang Ha's in for a world of hurt tonight.

459
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,400
Oh, tonight?

460
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,196
I bet Chan-min and the others are
brewing something up to save themselves.

461
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,739
Think it'll be a spectacle?

462
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,823
Sounds like fun.

463
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,325
Want to bet on it?

464
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,035
Bet?

465
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,995
My money's on his tenacity.

466
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,956
A million won on him lasting the night.

467
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,166
Me too. A million on him
making it to tomorrow.

468
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,710
Deal. One million on him
not making it through.

469
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,170
No backing out later, okay?

470
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,547
What about you, Tae-ho?

471
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,302
A million on him not lasting.

472
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,846
Okay! It's two million won if you lose.

473
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,723
-Hey, make it five.
-Five million won?

474
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,558
I'll raise you five to make it ten.

475
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,603
Think of it as a regular school retreat.

476
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,522
Use that room.

477
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,275
It'll be better
since it's separate from the main area.

478
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,192
Okay.

479
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,444
You can choose your sessions
from the info desk.

480
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,031
If you can help it,

481
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,784
try to find the least popular ones.

482
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,661
Thanks, Class President.

483
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,371
I'm just doing my job.

484
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,291
Don't talk to me in public.

485
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,210
They call me Moss.

486
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,963
Because I'm barely noticed.

487
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,632
-That's so offensive--
-I'm not offended.

488
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,929
I earned that nickname
by staying under the radar.

489
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,764
I don't want anyone…

490
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,018
to ruin that for me.

491
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,565
I get it.

492
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,166
I put in the request for you.

493
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,460
About that anon account,

494
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,880
if it was someone at Woo-jin's party,
doesn't it mean it's someone we know?

495
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,092
They would know better
than to try that with us.

496
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,052
What do they want?

497
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,764
I don't actually know
exactly what they want.

498
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,641
Are they looking to make a buck
by threatening to go public?

499
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:16,520
But no one that stupid or desperate
for cash would've been there that night.

500
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,814
Forward me those DMs.

501
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,025
I'll get him on it.

502
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,239
I'll give them the account details myself.

503
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,371
So there is something.

504
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,833
You were also filmed
doing something you shouldn't have.

505
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,464
Want to go for brunch?

506
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,937
I haven't even eaten a thing,
but I think I'm getting indigestion.

507
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,065
-Is it just me?
-Maybe it's something contagious.

508
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,942
Because me too.

509
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,778
We haven't been together
like this in ages.

510
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,279
Are you going to be like this?

511
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,200
I'm leaving.

512
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,954
Sit.

513
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,580
You want to be friends.

514
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,334
You have no reason
to be uncomfortable or avoid me.

515
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,128
You said you didn't know what you'd do.

516
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,047
That you'd do whatever it took,
regardless of the method.

517
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,347
Isn't that reason enough
for me to be uncomfortable?

518
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,185
Hey, Jae-i!

519
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,771
I'll walk you back.

520
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,826
Have you thought about what I said?

521
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,165
You mean me dating someone else?
Forget it. It won't work.

522
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,959
She won't fall for me
pretending to date someone else.

523
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,044
-Not Jae-i.
-She will.

524
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,880
If it's me.

525
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,590
I'll do it for you.

526
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,760
Why would you
put yourself out there like that?

527
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,763
You need someone
believable enough for Jae-i,

528
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,642
someone who will do just enough
to make her jealous, then back off.

529
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,060
I'm all you've got.

530
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,439
I wasn't going to tell you,

531
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,026
but despite her feelings for you,

532
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,986
Jae-i's falling for the scholarship kid.

533
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,241
I could tell by the look in her eyes.

534
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,245
If you let this go on,
you'll never win Jae-i back.

535
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,146
I thought I packed all the meds,
but I forgot the antacids.

536
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,232
I think three packs should do.

537
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,737
Kang Ha.

538
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,449
I'm asking you to go
so you don't have a run-in with anyone.

539
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,660
Thanks for your concern.

540
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,412
You may think I'm a coward,
but that's how it is here.

541
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,749
I'm just trying my best
to make something of it.

542
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,459
There's no need to explain.

543
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,128
All you find here are
cowardly adults and insane kids.

544
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,006
I don't even want to know why anymore.

545
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,524
Hey.

546
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,109
Jesus, you scared me.

547
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,235
Are you okay?

548
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,779
Are you heading out?

549
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,824
Yeah. On an errand to the drugstore.

550
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,246
Let's go. I need to buy cigarettes.

551
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,081
What?

552
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,083
What? Do you want to ride on the back?

553
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,422
Isn't that Jae-i?

554
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,260
It is her.

555
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,553
And the scholarship kid.

556
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,555
You holding on?

557
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,929
How refreshing.

558
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,515
Huh? What?

559
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,433
What was that?

560
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,062
Want to see the ocean? Should I stop?

561
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,773
No. It's okay. Keep going.

562
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,067
Okay.

563
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,913
Want to put this on?

564
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,666
No. I'm fine.

565
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,925
I don't think it'll let up anytime soon.

566
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,771
How cute!

567
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,536
You're pretty.

568
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,164
What?

569
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,083
You're pretty when you laugh.

570
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,754
I've never seen you laugh before.

571
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,095
I'm suddenly curious.

572
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:10,476
You're pretty, smart,
and rich enough to have whatever you want.

573
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,227
You have it all.

574
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,396
Why don't you smile?

575
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,275
That's how I was raised.

576
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,071
"Don't laugh or cry irresponsibly."

577
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,908
"Careless laughter becomes gossip."

578
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:31,246
"If you're seen crying just anywhere,
it'll later lead to your undoing."

579
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,166
Wait. You actually learn those things?

580
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,919
Yes, from the age of three.

581
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,008
The rich really learn all kinds of things.

582
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,179
What about you?

583
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:51,225
Why are you always smiling
when you get bullied for being poor?

584
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,018
Me?

585
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,728
I'm not poor.

586
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,067
I've never thought of myself
as being poor or miserable.

587
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:00,984
That is…

588
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,909
until I came here.

589
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,509
The rain isn't stopping. Let's go.

590
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,220
Hey, Jae-i. Wait for me.

591
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,388
Oh, right. The bike.

592
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,724
Jae-i.

593
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,309
Hey, Jae-i!

594
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,019
One second.

595
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,857
Put this on. You'll catch a cold.

596
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:43,861
There.

597
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,574
Jae-i.

598
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,785
Damn it.

599
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,798
When he comes, grab him by the arms first.

600
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:08,468
We'll either beat him up
or light a fire in here and lock him up.

601
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,179
We need to sort him out, no matter what.

602
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,515
Got it?

603
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,059
Answer…

604
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,691
Head inside.

605
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,359
This…

606
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,823
Come inside and dry it.
I have a steam closet.

607
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,581
It really is very nice here.

608
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,626
The suites are millions of won a night.

609
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,711
When will I ever get to stay
in one of those?

610
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,421
A few million is nothing.

611
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,299
Ri-an's and Jae-i's villas
are close to ten million won.

612
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,801
Wow. Must be nice
to be born with a silver spoon.

613
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,680
Too bad they weren't born
with manners too.

614
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,224
They all order their teachers around
like housekeepers.

615
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,562
-I'm not sure I'll last much longer.
-Isn't it worse for you, Ms. Han?

616
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,191
Your class has Ri-an,
He-ra, Jae-i, and even Woo-jin…

617
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,735
I'd be too uncomfortable to work.

618
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,780
Those kids are actually fine.

619
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,950
It's the others that cause trouble.

620
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:14,409
Hey.

621
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,128
Ms. Han? The principal is looking for you.

622
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,756
Thank you.

623
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,300
Excuse me, I--

624
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,760
-Go on.
-Sure.

625
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:38,725
Why would Principal Park
be asking to see Ms. Han at this hour?

626
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,062
-Who knows. Just drink up.
-Okay.

627
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,192
Is something wrong?

628
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,779
My girlfriend isn't answering the phone.

629
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,950
I left my cell phone in my room to charge.

630
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,497
But did Principal Park
really ask to see me?

631
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,502
I opened a bottle of wine.
Let's go to my room.

632
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,954
Where the hell is he?

633
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,998
What's with this asshole?

634
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,834
Did he catch on and bolt?

635
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,920
Message the guys
and get them to find out where he is.

636
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,339
Where the hell are those two idiots?

637
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,176
How many fucking hours
have we been waiting here?

638
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,683
Take it off and change into this.

639
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:05,979
It's fine. It's not that wet.
I'll leave as soon as my shirt's dry.

640
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,107
Suit yourself.

641
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:17,282
Are Jae-i and Kang Ha close?

642
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,201
Who?

643
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,036
The new scholarship student.

644
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,080
Oh, the problematic scholarship kid?

645
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,373
Why do you ask?

646
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,503
DRYING

647
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,274
If you're sleepy, go to bed.

648
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,444
No. I'm not sleepy.

649
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,267
I didn't hate it either.

650
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:27,602
What?

651
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,607
That day, when you kissed me…

652
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,446
I didn't hate it either.

653
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,875
Go together? Where?

654
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,465
Jae-i's villa.
I saw them walking in together.

655
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,507
Together?

656
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,553
Are you sure?

657
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,182
Yes. I saw them on the way in.

658
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,103
I think--

659
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,237
I'll be right back.

660
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,197
Okay.

661
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,825
Where are you, Principal Park?

662
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,579
You need to come over now
with the master key.

663
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:50,412
I'll help you.

664
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,692
What is going on?

665
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,404
What the hell are you doing?

666
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:06,696
PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM
KANG HA

667
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,070
These guys

668
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,322
are the worst.

669
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,325
Huh? I didn't know ghosts could talk.

670
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,119
Why did you bother coming to school?

671
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,537
You'll be expelled anyway.

672
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,038
Seriously.

673
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,417
A scholarship student with the audacity
to break into Jae-i's room?

674
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,628
Wow, I thought you were just a puppy,
but you're a total stalker.

675
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:04,921
How terrifying.

676
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,464
How much did we bet again?

677
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,425
-No idea.
-Five million? No, ten.

678
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,428
Ri-an.

679
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,388
Where are you going?

680
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,849
To the disciplinary hearing?
I'll come with you.

681
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,183
Let's do it.

682
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,269
The thing.

683
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,645
What thing?

684
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,564
The relationship Yoon He-ra offered.

685
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:24,941
Let's do it.

686
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,246
During this year's
Healing Forest field trip,

687
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:41,583
you were accused of
breaking into Miss Jung Jae-i's room.

688
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,876
Do you acknowledge this?

689
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,879
Answer the question.

690
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,547
Further questioning is unnecessary.

691
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,340
I witnessed it myself.

692
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:53,136
At least try to explain
how it happened, Kang Ha.

693
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,053
If I tried to…

694
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,599
would you believe me?

695
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,684
At Jooshin,

696
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:03,855
we adhere to school rules more strictly
than any other school in Korea.

697
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,983
We have no intention of granting leniency

698
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,027
to a student who shows no remorse.

699
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,489
In accordance with Article 12,

700
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,158
for dishonoring the school
and committing indecency,

701
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,661
we intend to enforce
the expulsion of Kang Ha.

702
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,291
He didn't break in.

703
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,542
I invited him over.

704
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,711
Miss Jae-i.

705
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:30,590
I asked him to bring something I needed,
and he just stopped by.

706
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,926
So if you have to punish someone,

707
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,845
punish me.

708
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:37,722
Get up.

709
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,016
Wait, you…

710
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,312
He broke school rules.

711
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,650
I'm going to request strict punishment
to restore school order.

712
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,945
What are you doing, Jae-i?

713
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,073
I asked you what you are doing.

714
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,162
Leave Kang Ha alone.

715
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:03,998
What?

716
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,834
I'm not exaggerating.
And I wasn't using him either.

717
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,384
I like him.

718
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,473
So don't lay a hand on him.

719
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:22,892
Stop right there.

720
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,815
This is Jooshin, Jung Jae-i.

721
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,735
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

722
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,238
Jooshin or not…

723
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,867
I'm Jung Jae-i, Kim Ri-an.

724
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,018
Why did you do that?

725
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,445
I could've dealt with it.

726
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:18,656
Now people will talk about you
because of me.

727
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,033
Kang Ha.

728
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,996
Why'd you really come here?

729
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:39,844
So you've figured out

730
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:41,804
who I am.
