00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,668
Crazy.

3
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,253
Everyone is crazy!

4
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,464
I will expose it all.

5
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,675
I'll expose everything
that happened at this crazy school.

6
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,337
EPISODE 4

7
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,715
REVENGE, DESIRE, ROMANCE:
THE HEART OF THE MATTER

8
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,135
Where's the security guard?

9
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,346
I told him I left something.
Should buy us ten minutes or so.

10
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,482
-So what exactly are you looking for?
-Drugs.

11
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,901
Yun-seok gave Ri-an drugs.

12
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,361
He put them in his locker.

13
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,905
Ms. Han said it was an antidepressant.

14
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,949
But there was more.

15
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,994
I've heard about them
dealing things like that.

16
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,079
Things like edibles and GHB.

17
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,126
Take a look.

18
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,143
Find anything?

19
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,022
What is it?
Is there something in the pictures?

20
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,734
I'm just in awe.

21
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,487
I've never seen her smile like that.

22
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,963
That's cold!

23
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,803
Okay, let's go. All right?

24
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,765
No!

25
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,182
It's pretty.

26
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:27,892
So are you.

27
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,104
Ri-an.

28
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,524
I'm so happy right now.

29
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,735
Being Jung Jae-i of the Jaeyul Group means

30
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,365
I'm always thinking about how I should act
and what I should be doing.

31
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,118
It's ingrained in my mind.

32
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,914
When I'm with you,
I don't think about that.

33
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,626
I know the feeling.

34
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,713
That feeling of forgetting

35
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,049
that I'm the heir to Jooshin
and even my identity as Kim Ri-an.

36
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,682
I get that feeling when I'm with you.

37
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,937
I like you.

38
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,984
So much so that I wonder
if it's possible to like anyone this much.

39
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,270
On your way home, I see.

40
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,440
I just arrived, so I'm still on the plane.

41
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,028
My son, I'm curious
how you felt about yesterday.

42
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,863
How I felt about what?

43
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,116
The things that will be yours,
the people who will answer to you.

44
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,911
After seeing them all on display,
has it sunk in?

45
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,706
Do you see how much love
I've prepared for you to inherit?

46
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,625
"Love"?

47
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,420
Of course, it's not
the easiest kind of love to handle.

48
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,964
The reputation Jooshin has maintained,

49
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,384
the futures of those under you
and their families.

50
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,803
All of that will be your responsibility.

51
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,972
I guess you could call it
an elaborate and heavy crown.

52
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,018
So, Ri-an, protect your right
to that position.

53
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,104
Uphold your social and moral standing.

54
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,439
Don't get caught up in vulgar scandals.

55
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,649
I want you to always

56
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,652
be cognizant of how important you are.

57
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,655
See you later, my heir.

58
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,521
Your classes are ready.
Please get changed and come back down.

59
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,565
Let's take a break first.

60
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,067
Prof. Cho is here
to teach strategic management

61
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,070
and Prof. Son
for international business theory.

62
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,615
Both are essential for successors
of the top ten companies in the industry,

63
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,701
and the professors were carefully chosen.

64
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,247
Your day starts at 5 a.m. tomorrow,
so rescheduling is not an option.

65
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,582
I'm only 18.

66
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,042
I'm still in high school.

67
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,837
From dawn until dawn the next day, I…

68
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,592
Don't you think I deserve
some breathing room after school?

69
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,635
I understand that you're tired.

70
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:50,970
However…

71
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,273
Hey, Woo-jin.

72
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,066
Your mom is so clueless.

73
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,196
If I'm going to run for president,
I need to impress Jooshin's heir.

74
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,948
This seaweed soup isn't going to cut it.

75
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,992
I made it because Ri-an asked for it.

76
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,662
Ri-an likes seaweed soup.
I'm sure we'll enjoy it.

77
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,790
And that's our cue to leave.

78
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,543
Your mom isn't that clueless.

79
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,921
-Enjoy your meal, Ri-an.
-Thank you. I will.

80
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,772
It's just seaweed soup,
so why doesn't it taste like this at home?

81
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,024
You have all the best chefs on staff.

82
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,567
They can reproduce any taste.

83
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,652
Not every taste.

84
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,029
Like the taste of warmth.

85
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,407
The taste that's in the food
normal families eat.

86
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,661
Our food doesn't have that.

87
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,206
Come by often, then.

88
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,166
For my parents.

89
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,709
They would love that.

90
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,170
Nothing beats friendship.

91
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,465
I should come here from now on.

92
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,055
I had a random thought.

93
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,560
Being together was so natural
for Jae-i and me.

94
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,604
The times and spaces we shared

95
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,109
are where we felt warmth,
comfort, and security.

96
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,778
So lately,

97
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:34,073
I've been feeling anxious and empty,
like I've lost something.

98
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,370
But, seriously, is Jae-i okay?

99
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,080
That timid bundle of nerves?

100
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,208
No.

101
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,252
There's no way.

102
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,963
Are you okay?

103
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,008
Let's eat.

104
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,514
Here.

105
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,445
Right before you pull the trigger,
the target is also aware

106
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,157
that a bullet will soon
pass through their body.

107
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,784
It's a matter of what comes first.

108
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,661
Either they're slow to react and die,

109
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,122
or they're swift enough to escape death.

110
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,334
That look in that very moment,

111
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,337
the look they have
right before their death or escape,

112
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,756
I find it so exhilarating and profound.

113
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,591
Me too, Dad.

114
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,509
When I hit a running target,

115
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,470
I get this rush of adrenaline.

116
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,889
That's why I enjoy hunting.

117
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,515
You, Jae-i?

118
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,605
I just think--

119
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,898
"Poor thing."

120
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,358
"How heartbreaking."

121
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,193
Something along those lines?

122
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,529
About that scholarship student…

123
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,996
is what you feel for him
like the pity and compassion you feel

124
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,333
for the animals being chased
around the hunting grounds?

125
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,796
If not, I can't comprehend it.

126
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,548
A scholarship student.

127
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,259
I guess

128
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,595
it's like mother, like daughter.

129
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,349
Is it something
trashy bitches have in common?

130
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,559
Unbelievable.

131
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,065
Jae-hyeok?

132
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,775
Yes, Dad?

133
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,072
How dare you run
that mouth of yours, you brat.

134
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,991
That isn't something
for you to babble about.

135
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:41,909
Is it now?

136
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,289
Get out.

137
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,207
Yes, sir.

138
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,841
I felt sorry for him.

139
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,759
Like you said,

140
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,554
it was just compassion
for a poor scholarship student.

141
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,765
I guess the truth got distorted.

142
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,308
Didn't you learn your lesson

143
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,188
about the consequences
of that trivial sympathy you show?

144
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,106
Why?

145
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,778
Wasn't the incident
with the other kid enough?

146
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,831
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,130
You've been there long enough.

148
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,886
The rumors about Jooshin and Jaeyul
being enemies have sufficiently died down.

149
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,555
Start making preparations

150
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,308
to move to New York.

151
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,827
Jae-i.

152
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,042
How annoying.

153
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,503
Because of my dear sister,

154
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,088
I got slapped again.

155
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,800
Perhaps it's because
you run your mouth without thinking.

156
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,345
And don't call me your "dear" sister.

157
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,389
It gives me the creeps.

158
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,183
What?

159
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:30,851
The creeps?

160
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,438
Seriously? God.

161
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,691
You're pretty confident, aren't you?

162
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,444
Don't forget,

163
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,031
dear sister…

164
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,371
the cards I have in my hand.

165
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,208
And what you agreed to.

166
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,111
Ri-an!

167
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,488
Let's go together.

168
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,699
What should we eat?

169
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,535
Trust Yoon He-ra
to have solid survival tactics.

170
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,786
"Survival tactics"?

171
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,080
If she had to go up against Jae-i alone,

172
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,457
we'd be saying goodbye to her
at her funeral.

173
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,878
She's sticking to Ri-an
and using him as a shield.

174
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,421
I see.

175
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,491
I asked to see you to apologize.

176
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,868
That night,

177
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,413
I thought my dad might have flustered you.

178
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,999
This is Jae-i's boyfriend.

179
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,294
Hello. My name is Kang Ha.

180
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,467
What makes you think
you can open your mouth here?

181
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,221
If that's what you mean,
it had zero effect on me.

182
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,475
I've built up an immunity
from all the crap I've gotten here.

183
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,061
Anyway, thanks.

184
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,687
"Thanks"?

185
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,106
I've been wronged by a lot of people,

186
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,192
but the number of people
who have apologized…

187
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,153
You're the first at Jooshin.

188
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,201
Avoid them.

189
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,829
If anyone at school wrongs you

190
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,456
or bullies you,

191
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,833
just avoid them.

192
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,379
Jae-i.

193
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,589
Do you still like Ri-an?

194
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,259
What?

195
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,638
If you do,
why are you running away from him?

196
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,057
Is there some reason you have to?

197
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,101
Like a specific reason

198
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,937
you can't be with him.

199
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,024
I thought I already told you

200
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,276
to not

201
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,320
cross the line.

202
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,873
I want to see you smiling too.

203
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,711
So how about we start going out for real?

204
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,630
Instead of Ri-an,

205
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,757
I'll be by your side.

206
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,221
So you're not anxious or lonely.

207
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,600
I'll make you smile, Jae-i.

208
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,107
Stop being so anxious.

209
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,445
I'll help you.

210
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,280
I'll be by your side, Jae-i.

211
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,285
They're oddly

212
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,328
similar.

213
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,884
Real or fake, it means nothing to me.

214
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,302
What do you mean?

215
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,887
You wouldn't understand.

216
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,347
-Because I'm a scholarship student?
-No.

217
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,183
I don't think we're different.

218
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:40,851
But

219
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,896
what I think or how I feel doesn't matter

220
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,815
in the world I live in.

221
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,192
Or rather,

222
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,070
in the world I have to survive in.

223
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,281
Until I can stand on my own two feet.

224
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,159
"Survive"?

225
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,161
Like I said, you wouldn't understand.

226
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,082
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear you earlier.

227
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,688
How do we look?

228
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,233
Do we look good together?

229
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,694
I'll pretend I never saw you two.

230
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,784
Oh, Mr. Ri-an?

231
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,456
Your mother honored
our school event with her presence,

232
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,999
but I didn't properly thank her.

233
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,753
Would you tell her
how truly thankful I am that she came?

234
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,046
Tell her yourself.

235
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,339
You usually do.

236
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,300
Of course.

237
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,307
Who's the one in charge here?

238
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,184
The one with power.

239
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,979
What?

240
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,611
Age,

241
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,737
gender,

242
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,990
and job title mean nothing.

243
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,701
Power has equaled superiority
for a long time now.

244
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,452
Don't tell me you didn't know.

245
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,413
Ms. Han Ji-su.

246
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,879
Okay. Come to the lounge.

247
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,005
Don't skip lunch.

248
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,132
I'm eating with my friends.

249
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,093
You don't love me.

250
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,306
Do you?

251
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,562
Jealousy?

252
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,398
But jealous of whom?

253
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,735
Or love?

254
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,488
Which is it, Teach?

255
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,660
Who is it?

256
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,038
Who's the woman in Lee Woo-jin's heart?

257
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,726
See you at the studio.

258
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,192
-Hi, Ms. Han.
-Hello.

259
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,235
Hi.

260
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,319
Did you see her bag?

261
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,489
-Hello.
-Hello.

262
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,951
Did you see it?

263
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,500
Jae-i?

264
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,673
Shouldn't we apologize
when we bump into each other?

265
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,260
"Teachers and students are expected
to show mutual respect."

266
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,220
It's in the school regulations.

267
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,346
Is respect

268
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,640
really necessary?

269
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,434
Are you perhaps in need
of counseling or help?

270
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,061
"Counseling"?

271
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,314
I don't remember you
being this touchy in the past.

272
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,693
And you've been hanging out
with that scholarship student, Kang Ha.

273
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,571
Jae-i, you seem incredibly anxious
and reckless these days.

274
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,577
If you ever need my help,
seek me out anytime.

275
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,747
We've all overcome a major ordeal.

276
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,543
And we can't let
a tragedy like that ever happen again.

277
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,339
An Hermès Birkin bag.

278
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,385
You seem more anxious
and reckless than I am, Ms. Han.

279
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,113
Ju-won, what are you doing here
at this time of day?

280
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,199
I left my home key card at…

281
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,952
You don't need that.
The passcode will unlock the door too.

282
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,829
Oh, right.

283
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,374
I'm late for study hall. I'll get going.

284
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,302
To express the average rate of change
as a numerical value,

285
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,930
the increase in X
can be expressed as B minus A,

286
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,557
and you get the value of delta X.

287
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,475
Thanks.

288
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,727
I'll take it from here.

289
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,774
Tae-ho, you said you lived in the States
before you came to Jooshin, right?

290
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,859
Yeah.

291
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,736
So you had no friends in Korea.

292
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,738
Pretty much.

293
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,075
MAIL
UNIVERSITY OF MANNHEIM

294
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,327
"Mannheim"?

295
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,621
Not the US or the UK?

296
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,539
Everyone is going to the US or the UK.

297
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,458
I want to go somewhere quiet.

298
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,419
Somewhere without any Jooshin kids, then.

299
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,505
Not necessarily.

300
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,673
You're different from the others.

301
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,592
I am?

302
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,720
Your family owns the Jaeyul Hotel,
yet you interact with me.

303
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,223
And you're friends…

304
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,186
with Kang Ha too.

305
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,104
Says who?

306
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,942
Who says I'm friends with that lowly shit?

307
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,861
I saw you and Kang Ha at the burger joint.

308
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,572
What are you saying…

309
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,032
Don't worry.

310
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,283
You know I'm discreet.

311
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,494
I won't spread rumors.

312
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,998
Speaking of Kang Ha…

313
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,503
don't you think
he looks like that dead kid, In-han?

314
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:14,161
Hey, are you insane? You fucking idiot.

315
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,955
Who do you think you are,
hanging with Jae-i?

316
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:17,873
Huh?

317
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,959
Answer me.
What's this asshole's name again?

318
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,712
-Kang In-han?
-"Kang In-han"? Are you a tough guy?

319
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,838
You son of a bitch.

320
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,548
You crazy asshole.

321
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:27,966
You bastard!

322
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,135
Hey.

323
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,429
Hey.

324
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,961
You scholarship students always seem
to like these unsightly places.

325
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,176
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

326
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,469
Thanking you?

327
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,722
Only the most accomplished elites
get to meet Jae-i's dad.

328
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,474
And thanks to me,

329
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,894
you introduced yourself
to someone of that caliber.

330
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,897
You only did that
to put Jae-i on the spot.

331
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,317
Not only are you unapologetic,
you want me to thank you?

332
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,944
You should be apologizing.

333
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,030
You're the one who put Jae-i on the spot.

334
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,074
By hanging around her.

335
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,789
Want to hear an interesting story?

336
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,210
There was a kid here before
who was just like you.

337
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,754
He was close with Jae-i too.

338
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,550
Do you know what happened to him?

339
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,511
You've heard, right?

340
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,849
That kid who died because of Ri-an?

341
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:00,809
Ri-an?

342
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:05,272
Ri-an is the heir to the Jooshin Group.
Why would he bother with a kid like that?

343
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,155
If you really want to blame someone,
I'd actually say

344
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,534
you should be blaming Jae-i.

345
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,914
Blaming Jae-i?

346
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,127
Whether Jae-i showed him sympathy or pity,
he shouldn't have accepted it.

347
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,881
If he hadn't, that tragic accident
may never have happened.

348
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,640
Jae-i killed that scholarship student.

349
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,689
This isn't someone else's story, puppy.

350
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,733
You think you're any different?

351
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,403
Every time a scholarship student has come,
it's always caused issues.

352
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,031
But whether it ends in ruin or misfortune,

353
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,366
it never reaches us.

354
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,869
It only affects the likes of you.

355
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,837
Why are you telling me this?

356
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,631
Out of concern?

357
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,090
Let's call it concern.

358
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,968
We don't want a repeat of that tragedy.

359
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,005
Let's get a rebound.

360
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,548
You've got this, Woo-jin!

361
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,769
I seriously need to go shopping today.

362
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,687
Why?

363
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,022
-I got my personal color analysis.
-What is it?

364
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,357
Guess.

365
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,067
-Summer?
-Cool winter?

366
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,152
-I need to get all new makeup.
-Smell this.

367
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,070
Nice, right?

368
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,162
We have a time limit now?

369
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,877
You're being exiled to New York?
I wanted to have some more fun.

370
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,087
Guess we won't have time for that anymore.

371
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:59,506
HAHA

372
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,595
HAHA

373
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,615
Jae-i.

374
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,826
What's wrong? What's going on?

375
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,161
Jung Jae-i!

376
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,122
Leave her alone.

377
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,042
I think this is all because of you.

378
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,460
Because of me?

379
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,505
She's always had a lot of anxiety.

380
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,633
But now he knows
there's a scholarship student

381
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,926
in Jae-i's vicinity.

382
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,511
Her father knows.

383
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:51,182
Think about the pressure she's under
and the kind of anxiety that would cause.

384
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,435
You have no clue about what we endure.

385
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,980
Of course.

386
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,565
There's no way you would.

387
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,027
I'm so sick of you scholarship bastards.

388
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,576
I guess this would be the gaze

389
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,287
that met my brother too.

390
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,168
You know what?

391
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,504
It always goes beyond harm
and becomes a threat.

392
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,089
It's always your kind…

393
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,217
that ruins Jae-i.

394
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,430
Hey!

395
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,723
Ri-an.

396
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,266
Don't touch things like this.

397
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,851
-We'll deal with it.
-He's right.

398
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,768
Leave it.

399
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,895
Let go.

400
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,190
Where the hell are you going?
Get over here.

401
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,653
You guys are terrifying.

402
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,614
Will I find myself in hot water too?

403
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,782
You know,

404
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,993
like that scholarship student you killed.

405
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,006
What's wrong?

406
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,637
Is it taboo to talk about it here,
especially in front of Ri-an?

407
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,188
Kang Ha.

408
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,734
Who are you?

409
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,209
Parade, riposte. Touche.

410
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,128
Prêts.

411
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,588
Allez.

412
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,305
Prêts.

413
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:55,890
Allez.

414
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,687
Attaque, touche, point.

415
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,230
Prêts. Allez.

416
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,114
Attaque, touche, point.

417
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:20,999
Thanks.

418
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,924
Can you check
the scholarship kid's background?

419
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,217
Why, all of a sudden?

420
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,511
From the moment he got to Jooshin,

421
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,556
he talked about being scared of me
and getting on my good side.

422
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,891
But every chance he got, he attacked me.

423
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,602
Like he had nothing to fear.

424
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,022
That sounds about right.

425
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,567
When a person stops being afraid,
there's always a valid explanation.

426
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,487
I'm suddenly curious why that is.

427
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,998
I know you want an apology.

428
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,542
But I won't do that.

429
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,545
I have no interest
in a meaningless apology anyway.

430
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,675
Any updates to report?

431
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,555
You called me to check
on the errand you assigned me?

432
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,141
They're inside the school.

433
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,769
The person who sent the anonymous DMs.

434
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,145
They were sent from Jooshin.

435
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,898
Are we done now?

436
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,400
This is the last favor
I'm doing as your friend.

437
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,735
From now on,

438
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,488
I'm not your friend.

439
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,033
You never thought of me as one anyway.

440
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,745
We're past the point of no return.

441
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:44,040
We can't keep hanging out
and pretending everything is fine.

442
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:46,959
So what?

443
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,881
Since we're not friends,
I'll come out and say it.

444
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,424
I like Ri-an.

445
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,512
I really didn't want to say this
because it's cliché and juvenile,

446
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,055
but I was first.

447
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,308
I liked Ri-an first.
It started in kindergarten.

448
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:06,395
I let you have him since we were besties,
and that brought us this far.

449
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,150
I'm going to…

450
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,278
make him mine.

451
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,161
Okay, then.

452
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,706
I guess it's better…

453
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,835
than me having him.

454
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,797
What's wrong?

455
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,342
Did you think I'd get mad
and slap you or something?

456
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,433
I'm so angry
I could think of far worse things to do.

457
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,646
But you just said we're not even friends.

458
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,694
We have no reason to be angry

459
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,446
or the right to fight.

460
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,301
Jae-i, let's count to three
and jump in together.

461
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,427
Okay, He-ra.

462
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,471
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

463
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,483
-He-ra.
-Jae-i.

464
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,578
I'm going to take a video of you doing it.
It's rolling.

465
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,917
-We didn't take a picture of this.
-Look here.

466
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,573
What's wrong with me?

467
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,575
Why am I crying?

468
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,913
He-ra is graduating next year.

469
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,915
Is there nothing we can do?

470
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,710
I can send her abroad to study
with your younger son.

471
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,880
You know he was interested
in He-ra, right?

472
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,925
My company is about to go under.

473
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,928
I know you can get us connected
with Jooshin!

474
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,350
It's about survival now, He-ra.

475
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,477
Get your head on straight.

476
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,369
You'll be with him
all the time in New York.

477
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,329
Have you met Chairman Park's son yet?

478
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:14,041
No. I've only heard about him.
I've never met him before.

479
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,336
On the surface,
this dinner is about you two meeting.

480
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,299
But Chairman Park and I need to discuss
Jaeyul Group's electric car issues.

481
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,801
Think of it as your own work.

482
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,220
Read the room and act appropriately.

483
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:27,972
Okay.

484
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,651
I want to confirm something.

485
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,904
Can you get
the scholarship kid's student records?

486
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:57,835
All right.

487
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:58,919
I'll get them.

488
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,845
Nothing noteworthy.

489
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,097
PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM
KANG HA

490
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,057
Right. I can see that.

491
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,810
Why can't I shake
this sinking feeling, then?

492
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,229
He's just a scholarship student.

493
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,231
Why do you care so much?

494
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,444
My thoughts exactly.

495
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,614
Why do I care so much?

496
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,708
So an anonymous account
sent you this video and nothing else?

497
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,711
Yeah. Who could it be?

498
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,672
It's definitely someone
who knows who my brother is.

499
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,678
He-ra said she thinks
In-han's accident was Jae-i's fault.

500
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,556
He-ra said that?
Why would she suddenly say that?

501
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,894
Well, she's not wrong.
They're basically all accomplices.

502
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:00,022
They're not.
The Jae-i I know is different.

503
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,524
Different?

504
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,151
She isn't selfish and mean
like Ri-an and He-ra.

505
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,208
These two look great together.

506
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,629
They are indeed
a good-looking man and woman.

507
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,759
By the way, I'm sorry about that night.
I was mistaken about you and Ri-an.

508
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,844
I'm sorry, Jae-i.

509
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,513
Don't mention it.

510
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,516
People around here like to talk.
It wasn't worth your concern.

511
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,102
I hope you'll understand, Seon-jun.

512
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,937
It's not even a matter of discussion.

513
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:44,358
There's bound to be talk like that
in circles of similar people.

514
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,776
I don't mind such things.

515
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,320
You're destined for greatness.

516
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,659
Once Jae-i is ready and comes to New York,
I'll take good care of her.

517
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,287
We should get engaged
right after you graduate.

518
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,247
We can just attend college together.

519
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,836
I've never seen this laid-back fellow
rush into anything before.

520
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,631
We're going to do it anyway,
so there's no sense in delaying it.

521
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,719
What's more, people like us
all get together with similar families,

522
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,181
so nothing could be more perfect
than a beautiful bride.

523
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,266
That perfection is sitting opposite me.

524
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,768
I want to tie her down.

525
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,981
I was worried they might not get along.

526
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,066
It seems my concerns were unnecessary.

527
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,486
Hope you enjoy. Eat up, Miss Jae-i.

528
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,614
Thank you.

529
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,465
Jae-i?

530
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,635
I meant it when I said
I didn't mind earlier.

531
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,472
Marriage for people like us
is like a strategy…

532
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,473
Remember this?

533
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,727
If we get married and live together,
you'll start to feel stifled…

534
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,770
JJJ_J_00
HAS SENT A PHOTO

535
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,188
Does Kim Ri-an know?

536
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,564
I would understand.

537
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,400
Do you like dogs?

538
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,402
I have a lot of dogs back in New York.

539
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:25,501
Wait, is it even Ri-an
who should know about this?

540
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,727
Jae-i?

541
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,567
So much so that I wonder
if it's possible to like anyone this much.

542
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,402
Instead of Kim Ri-an, I'll…

543
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,112
-Stop being so anxious.
-I'll make you smile.

544
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,029
I'll help you.

545
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,450
Fuck! Seriously?

546
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,535
You crazy bitch!

547
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,870
Goddamn it.

548
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,164
Fuck.

549
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:22,308
Out of all of Shakespeare's sonnets,
this is the most famous. "Sonnet 18."

550
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,146
"May I compare you to a summer's day?"

551
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,899
As you all know,
Shakespeare lived 400 years ago.

552
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:35,613
As such, there are many outdated phrases
from that time seen in this poem too.

553
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,783
Also, this poem was written
in iambic pentameter…

554
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,756
Hi.

555
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,675
Keep your promise about that date.

556
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,426
Of course. You know me.

557
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,220
You can go now.

558
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,147
I came because Seon-u asked me to.

559
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,526
But I'm not sure why you wanted to see me.

560
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,321
I'm thinking of becoming friends with you.

561
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,325
You don't know me very well.

562
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,327
Of course I do.

563
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,079
At the very least,

564
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,124
I know how much you hate
your older sister.

565
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,724
-Want to come to my party?
-No.

566
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,683
Bring Si-u.

567
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,852
-Ask him yourself.
-No, you ask him. Quick!

568
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:41,405
Why hasn't she been answering her messages
or coming to school?

569
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,950
Did you forget how to talk?

570
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,535
I'm asking you what's going on.

571
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,078
That's Jae-i's business.

572
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,832
Why do I have to answer to you?

573
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,254
You don't know either, do you?

574
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,313
-She's in exile.
-"Exile"?

575
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,191
She had dinner with Seon-jun's family
of the Gongseong Group.

576
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,109
I forget what happened,

577
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,736
but apparently, she ruined it.

578
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,863
So Jae-i's enraged father said,

579
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,657
"Forget about school.
Just get out of my sight."

580
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,451
She was sent to the vacation home.

581
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,162
When her exile is over,
she'll be dragged to New York.

582
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,371
New York?

583
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,831
So suddenly?

584
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,667
Don't you dare tell Ri-an
Jae-i's at her vacation home.

585
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,795
I'm on fire right now.

586
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,464
-I won't let anyone get in my way.
-Get in your way?

587
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,840
What are you scheming now?

588
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,098
How do I look?

589
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,141
Pretty?

590
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,643
Out of the blue?

591
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,937
Why are you asking?

592
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,001
So I do look pretty today.

593
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,503
Your reaction is satisfactory.

594
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,047
Thanks for the confirmation.

595
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:48,490
KIM RI-AN

596
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,680
RECENT CALLS

597
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,223
JAE-I

598
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,102
186 Biseong-ro.
It's Jae-i's vacation home address.

599
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,354
She's been exiled.

600
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,065
Her boyfriend should go and console her.

601
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,434
SLIDE TO ANSWER

602
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,138
Jae-i.

603
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,225
How dare you come here.

604
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,450
I was worried. No one can reach you,
and you don't come to school.

605
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,869
Why are you here?

606
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:03,500
Tell me what's going on
and how I can help you.

607
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,548
Go.

608
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,051
-You can't help with anything.
-You're wrong.

609
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,052
I can help.

610
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,889
Whatever it is, me being here is
better than you being alone.

611
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,228
Why do you always push me away?

612
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,480
You look like you could faint
at any moment.

613
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,899
You look so miserable you could die.

614
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,111
What's the point of stubbornly
pushing me away like this?

615
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,157
Let go.

616
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,575
No.

617
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,660
Whatever happens,

618
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,911
I'll stay by your side.

619
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,084
Please, just let go of me!

620
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,087
What can you do for me?

621
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:53,467
I'm being threatened,
and I don't even know who's behind it.

622
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,555
Tell me.

623
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,808
What can you do to help?

624
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,064
"Threatened"?

625
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,109
By who?

626
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,071
Why you?

627
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,989
What did you do to be threatened?

628
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,660
I killed someone.

629
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,211
What?

630
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,343
I said I killed someone.

631
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:46,895
Kim Ri-an.

632
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,733
What brings you here?

633
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,735
I have something to say.

634
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:00,450
I've thought about it,
and there's only one card I can play.

635
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,577
Though it doesn't suit me at all.

636
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,495
A card?

637
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,416
Jae-i's off to New York
with Chairman Park's son.

638
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,963
It means that ship has sailed.

639
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,299
She's at her vacation home.
She'll be leaving directly from there.

640
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,180
So listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

641
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,976
It's all in the past.
You can't stop her from leaving.

642
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,856
Start over with me.

643
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:36,862
I like you.

644
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,239
No, I love you,
and I have for a long time.

645
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,533
Let's make it official.

646
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,005
You're sure Jae-i's

647
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,382
at her vacation home?

648
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,641
KANG IN-HAN, KANG HA
FRATERNAL TWINS

649
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,272
"Killed"?

650
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,649
Who?

651
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,570
A scholarship student.

652
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,073
Kang In-han.

653
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,215
I'm…

654
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:44,971
his brother.

655
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,317
The Kang In-han you say you killed…

656
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,655
was my brother.
