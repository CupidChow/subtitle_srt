1
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,089
I'm…

3
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:54,929
his brother.

4
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,145
The Kang In-han you say you killed…

5
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,483
was my brother.

6
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,417
Damn scholarship student.

7
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,088
Why did it have to hit Ri-an?

8
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,172
He hit Ri-an?

9
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,381
He's dead meat now.

10
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,591
Are you insane?

11
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,760
Are you okay? Damn, man.

12
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,928
He's lost his mind.

13
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,556
-He looks pissed.
-I feel bad for the other guy.

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,600
He's a dead man now.

15
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,687
Are you crazy?

16
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,272
How dare you throw that at Ri-an?

17
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,442
The ball rolled toward me,
so I just threw it to return it.

18
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,445
I had no idea it would hit Ri-an.

19
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,822
He really has lost it.

20
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,824
Open your eyes, dumbass.

21
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,909
If the ball rolled your way,

22
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,661
you should've run back over with it.

23
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,497
But you actually dared
to throw it at Ri-an?

24
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,963
Are you glaring at me?

25
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,590
When even begging for forgiveness
wouldn't be enough?

26
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,846
Why the hell would you step out of line?

27
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,222
You piece of shit.

28
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,807
I hate everything about you.

29
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,518
If you're a scholarship student,
act like one.

30
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,727
Stop it!

31
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,479
You shithead.

32
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,273
Son of a…

33
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,233
Crazy jackass!

34
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,443
-Get him.
-Let's fucking get him.

35
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,695
Get off me!

36
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,619
Get that asshole!

37
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,413
Hey! Run faster.

38
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,998
Hey, that way.

39
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,182
You know everything
you're entitled to, sis?

40
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,058
You're gonna give it all to me.

41
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,604
It's long overdue.

42
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,024
You should've been kicked out
when your mom was.

43
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,568
Anyway,

44
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:18,114
I intend to get back
what's rightfully mine.

45
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,532
Why?

46
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,827
Because you have neither the pedigree
nor the integrity to deserve it.

47
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,210
Get a transfer agreement drawn up
and notarized by an attorney.

48
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,629
That's all I want.

49
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,714
How could you do such a thing?

50
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,342
Don't like it? That's fine.

51
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,470
I'll just take that directly to Dad, then.

52
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,474
Jung Jae-hyeok!

53
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,267
I bet he'd love it. Right?

54
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,403
Think it over carefully.

55
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,615
Call me when you've decided.

56
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,492
Keep the phone.

57
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,744
I have more.

58
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,159
Do you want this?

59
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,871
Sweets help when you're upset.

60
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,912
Eat this while you watch.

61
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,004
He looks like you.

62
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,553
What?

63
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,526
The Kang In-han you say you killed

64
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,904
was my brother.

65
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,786
You…

66
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,373
you tricked me.

67
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,542
I wanted to know exactly what happened.

68
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,503
What In-han had to endure at Jooshin,

69
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,254
why everyone kept it quiet,

70
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,964
and why the school was so quick

71
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,009
to cover it up before anyone found out.

72
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,516
Jae-i, I don't believe In-han was killed
in a hit-and-run.

73
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,142
There had to be another reason.

74
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,311
A reason he ended up

75
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,687
on the street that night.

76
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,607
Is that why you approached me?

77
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,901
To get information?

78
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,860
That's right.

79
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,615
That was the case at first
but not anymore.

80
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,618
I saw everyone as a suspect
the moment I set foot in Jooshin.

81
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,454
"Who bullied In-han?
Could he have been murdered?"

82
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,999
As I was searching for answers, I realized

83
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,836
what kind of person you are.

84
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,548
I meant it when I said

85
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,050
I wanted to make you smile
and be by your side.

86
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,303
But, Jae-i…

87
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,599
I'm still his brother.

88
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,104
I need to find out
how my only brother died.

89
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,275
So, Jae-i…

90
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,739
please help me.

91
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,830
Jae-i.

92
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,208
Jae-i!

93
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,892
You fucking bastard!
How dare you touch her?!

94
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,811
So you're Kang In-han's brother?

95
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,564
Now the pieces are falling into place.

96
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,443
I see why you kept messing with me
and why you approached Jae-i.

97
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,863
What? Did you want to
get revenge or something?

98
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,657
So you did do something…

99
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,119
worthy of revenge,

100
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,537
Kim Ri-an.

101
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,631
Something funny?

102
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,175
Do you want to…

103
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,803
end up like your brother?

104
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,514
What?

105
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,212
He deserves a bigger beating.

106
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,721
Did that hurt? Hey.

107
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,390
Hey, come on.

108
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,103
-Go get him.
-You're going to break the glasses.

109
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,896
-Oh, come on.
-In-han!

110
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,837
Stop it.

111
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,763
THE LATE KANG IN-HAN

112
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,271
Stop.

113
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,523
Stop.

114
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,526
I said stop!

115
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,740
Please…

116
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,119
I just want you to stop.

117
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,833
Did I surprise you? I'm sorry.

118
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,918
I never should've left you alone.

119
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,087
No matter what you said,

120
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,049
I should've stayed by your side.
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,942
EPISODE 5
OUTSTANDING OUTSIDERS: THE KANGS

122
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,250
FROM KANG HA

123
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,169
KANG IN-HAN

124
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,090
I don't even know…

125
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,843
what anything means anymore…

126
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:20,721
In-han.

127
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,029
That puppy is Kang In-han's brother?

128
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,782
They're twins. Fraternal twins.

129
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,200
-No way! Twins?
-Yes.

130
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,451
Because they're twins,

131
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,496
Kang Ha was adopted and raised
by their childless uncle.

132
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,915
Their addresses
and family registry are different,

133
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,750
so the school had no idea.

134
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,293
Adopted by his uncle?

135
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,255
I thought that only happened
in old stories.

136
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,506
Anyway,

137
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,843
isn't it strange
that In-han's brother came to Jooshin?

138
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,971
He kept acting clueless
and standing up to Ri-an.

139
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,181
He also got closer to Jae-i on the sly.

140
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,851
There was an explanation for all of it.

141
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,935
"An explanation"?

142
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,105
Maybe he sensed something was off.

143
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:16,152
There was something strange
about the accident that killed In-han.

144
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,666
Ms. Han Ji-su?

145
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,380
Hanguk High has agreed to give you
a full scholarship

146
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,216
and additional financial aid
until you graduate.

147
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:44,764
Daehan High awards top graduates
four years of free college tuition.

148
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,522
I already have a scholarship
and financial aid.

149
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,984
And Jooshin offers better benefits
for top grads.

150
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,903
I worked hard to come here, Ms. Han.

151
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,864
The school cannot allow one student

152
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,326
to disrupt the environment
of the entire school.

153
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,411
Our students' mental health

154
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,623
is one of the top priorities
for Jooshin's teaching staff.

155
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:14,251
I don't understand
how I'm disrupting the school environment.

156
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:24,178
Every time the students look at you,
they will be reminded of Kang In-han.

157
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,973
You would be
repeatedly triggering their trauma.

158
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,769
In-han is a taboo topic here at Jooshin.

159
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,898
"Trauma"?

160
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:39,860
"Taboo"?

161
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,322
Expulsion is your other option.
It would be easy to justify.

162
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,492
Scholarship students are outsiders here.

163
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,327
Getting rid of one outsider

164
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,704
wouldn't even be an issue.

165
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,918
The choice is yours.

166
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,628
Transfer or be expelled.

167
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,186
I choose neither.

168
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,607
A scholarship student has never graduated

169
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,942
at the top from Jooshin.

170
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,528
I will be the first.

171
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,155
I'll prove they're not special.

172
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,783
I'll show them myself what fairness is…

173
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,996
and teach them right from wrong.

174
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,210
Someone has to.

175
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,463
Such common sense isn't being taught

176
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,425
by a single adult here.

177
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,010
Kang Ha.

178
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,847
Scholarship student Kang Ha
of Year Two, Class Two…

179
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,558
Please process his expulsion, Ms. Han.

180
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,686
On the grounds of

181
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,814
being a threatening student
who harms the school atmosphere.

182
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,483
Do as you wish.

183
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,710
It would be easy to justify.

184
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,254
Scholarship students are outsiders here.

185
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,214
Getting rid of one outsider

186
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,175
wouldn't even be an issue.

187
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,885
If you can, that is.

188
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,519
I can't believe this is even real.

189
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,105
The more I think about that asshole,
the angrier I get.

190
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,566
You should've gotten rid of him
when I told you to.

191
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,318
I wanted to.

192
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,905
But Jae-i was acting weird at the time.

193
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,577
Jae-i won't be getting involved anymore.

194
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,247
-So get rid of him properly this time.
-Really?

195
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,709
That makes it so much easier for me.

196
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,296
And it seems to me that Kang Ha
has the other kids acting out.

197
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,424
I'll take this chance
to get them back in line.

198
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,512
-She couldn't even stand?
-No.

199
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,056
I've never seen Jae-i

200
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,767
look so shocked and terrified.

201
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,062
Isn't there a reason for that?

202
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,106
A reason?

203
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,358
For Jae-i to suddenly go to the States.

204
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,321
For her to break up with you
and push you away.

205
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,033
There has to be a reason.

206
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,619
It's not important.

207
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,455
I'm only focusing on one thing
from now on.

208
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,373
Jae-i.

209
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,001
I won't let her leave my side.

210
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,460
I'm going to protect her.

211
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,545
What about He-ra?

212
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,217
She confessed her feelings for you.

213
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,723
She has Lee Woo-jin.

214
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,268
A friend like me
and a man like Lee Woo-jin.

215
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,603
All in all,

216
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,814
that's more than enough for He-ra.

217
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:28,005
The two of us dating is
a win-win situation that's necessary

218
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,548
for Jaeyul and Gongseong.

219
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,510
I don't hate the idea of it.

220
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,894
We'll be leaving soon.
Have you been having fun?

221
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,065
Yes, sort of.

222
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,527
Still don't like talking to me?

223
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,780
Get used to it already.

224
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,741
I mean, you know,

225
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,701
once we're in New York,

226
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,703
we'll be together all the time.

227
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,417
I'm getting out.

228
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,591
See you when we fly out.

229
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,569
Why did you come all this way?

230
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,655
Let's take a walk.

231
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,661
Has the shock died down somewhat?

232
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:42,871
I'm fine.

233
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,125
From now on,
don't go anywhere without security.

234
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,628
Especially at school,
make sure you're beside me at all times.

235
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,672
Are you worried Kang Ha might kill me?

236
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,300
We have no idea
what kids like that are capable of.

237
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,385
"Kids like that"?

238
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,138
He's not some monster.

239
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,683
You know that scholarship students
are just normal kids.

240
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,352
You should know that by now.

241
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,569
You saw Park Seon-jun earlier.

242
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,362
We're leaving for New York together.

243
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,365
I barely got permission
to come back to school.

244
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,702
So don't come over
or ask to see me out of the blue.

245
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,163
I want to stay low-key.

246
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,498
I won't let you go, Jae-i.

247
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,457
Have you forgotten?

248
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,503
I'm the one who said we should break up,
and I walked away from you.

249
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,882
New York or not, I have no desire

250
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,176
to be by your side.

251
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,011
Why the hell not?

252
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,598
So I don't ruin anything else.

253
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,851
When I'm with you,
everything around us gets ruined.

254
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,188
I don't know
if that's your fault or mine anymore.

255
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,315
I'm afraid we'll see each other
at our worst

256
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,691
and take things too far.

257
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,069
I'm scared we'll end up
destroying everyone else too.

258
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,239
So just stop it.

259
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,199
No.

260
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,241
I can't stop.

261
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,743
"Everyone else"?

262
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,746
I don't care if I destroy them all.

263
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,916
I just need to keep you safe.

264
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,543
Ri-an.

265
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,880
I've thought about it countless times
since we've been apart.

266
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,175
"Would I be able to break up with Jae-i?"

267
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,137
"No, we can't break up."

268
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,848
That's my conclusion.

269
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,602
I'll do whatever it takes
to keep you by my side.

270
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,897
I don't care if that takes me
to my rock bottom, hell,

271
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,899
or to the ultimate end.

272
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,944
I will be by your side.

273
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,490
I've moved past just liking you.

274
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,494
This is love.

275
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,956
Jung Jae-i.

276
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,583
I love you.

277
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,296
I don't have
those kinds of feelings for you.

278
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,190
Why are you telling me that now?

279
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,068
That's when I was young.

280
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,569
Wow, you're ridiculous.

281
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,863
Looks like you can't resist.

282
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,240
Neither can I, but…

283
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,786
Seriously, come on.

284
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,169
Man, that's hilarious.

285
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,592
Hey, Jae-i!

286
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,681
Oh my God.

287
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,434
I was worried when I heard you fainted.

288
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,602
Are you feeling better now?

289
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,813
I was shocked by the sudden news.

290
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,231
You're flying out so soon.

291
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,819
What a beautiful friendship.

292
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,740
You besties have a good time.

293
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,825
See you later, He-ra.

294
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,709
What are you doing?

295
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,337
I came to give you an invitation.

296
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,591
We're still best friends officially,

297
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,885
so I should host your farewell party.

298
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:27,763
"Farewell"?

299
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:29,973
And not a celebration?

300
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,017
I guess it could become a celebration.

301
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,940
I told Ri-an how I felt about him.
I'm waiting for his response.

302
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,193
Congratulations. Hope you get good news.

303
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,486
Are we done here?

304
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,946
Just stay out of my way.

305
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:47,908
What?

306
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,827
Don't do anything to sway Ri-an.

307
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,996
I'm not even asking for help.

308
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,748
Just stay out of my way.

309
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,794
You can do that until you leave, right?

310
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,631
No. Even if you can't, please do.

311
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,842
If you don't, I won't stay quiet.

312
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,177
What are you going to do?

313
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,641
There is something I can give you.

314
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,142
How should I put this?

315
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,228
It's a very decisive

316
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,646
and lethal hand.

317
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,232
A decisive and lethal hand?

318
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,483
What could that be?

319
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,944
You'd be shocked if you knew.

320
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,282
But, He-ra,

321
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,868
if I give it to you…

322
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,456
what will you give me in return?

323
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,127
I'm not sure.

324
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,504
I don't know what would be suitable,

325
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,757
but it'll have to be something
that's also decisive and lethal.

326
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,094
Whenever you want,

327
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,304
however you want it.

328
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,436
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

329
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,814
That isn't an empty threat.
I will literally do anything.

330
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,234
I don't care if you, Ri-an,
or all of us get hurt.

331
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,162
I forgot to tell you something funny.

332
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,084
The day we stopped being friends,
I started crying on the way home.

333
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,339
I guess we really were friends,
as ridiculous as that sounds.

334
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,512
So, even though our friendship is over,
I want us to have a beautiful ending.

335
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,891
Leave quietly and gracefully, Jae-i.

336
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,351
So neither of us gets hurt.

337
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,312
Catch my drift?

338
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,774
See you at the party.

339
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,152
He-ra.

340
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,919
Take care.

341
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,513
I guess this in itself

342
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,057
is a beautiful ending.

343
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,144
I fly out the day of the party.

344
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,730
Enjoy your celebration.

345
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,857
I'll disappear for your sake.

346
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,284
"Enjoy your celebration"?

347
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,621
She always has to have the last word.

348
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,249
Maybe it was a sincere goodbye.

349
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,960
That was her being sarcastic, not sincere.

350
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,338
It was like she was saying,
"See how much fun you have without me."

351
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,508
I'll need to give her a talking-to, then.

352
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,552
How dare she annoy my He-ra?

353
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,469
Right?

354
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,681
Dad.

355
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,645
I want to make this party
out of this world.

356
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,191
The venue, DJ, my dress,
and my jewelry all need to be perfect.

357
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,904
All right.

358
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,240
I'll let Mr. Park know.

359
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,616
You're serious, right?

360
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,412
I have the best dad!
What would I do without you?

361
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,261
Tae-ho.

362
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,434
This is so fucking ridiculous.
I'm speechless.

363
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,732
This is Park Tae-ho,
the oldest son of Jaeyul Hotel's owners?

364
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,359
Is your mother really a hostess?

365
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,862
You're a love child?

366
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,449
Him living in the States was bullshit too.
He was the mistress's son.

367
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,410
He went to the same middle school
as Kang In-han and Kang Ha.

368
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,287
He moved here and started a new life.

369
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,705
You should take this off.

370
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,123
Why are you wearing it?

371
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,458
What does that make him?

372
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,959
What do we call kids like this?

373
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,879
A hostess mother
and a father from a business dynasty?

374
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,756
We need to come up with a new name.

375
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,676
Something like half-man, half beast.
Half-rich, half-slut?

376
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,886
"Half-rich."

377
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,012
Wait.

378
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,098
If he went to middle school
with the puppy,

379
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,602
that means he knew all along.

380
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,103
This asshole knew everything.

381
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,105
Were you pulling a fast one on us?

382
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,816
Well…

383
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,153
-The thing is…
-Spit it out already.

384
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,447
Speak properly. You're getting annoying.

385
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,492
Did you have fun fooling us all this time?

386
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,576
Hey.

387
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,577
Was it fun?

388
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,162
Did you have fun, you jerk?

389
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,455
-Did you?
-I'm sorry.

390
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,582
-Tell me. Was it fun?
-I'm sorry.

391
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,586
So? Put that down.

392
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,796
Tell me. Was it fun?

393
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,422
I asked if it was fun.

394
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,465
Leave him alone!

395
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,134
Kang Ha.

396
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,595
Tae-ho, it's your friend.

397
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,932
-Friends since middle school?
-Kang Ha.

398
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,400
What an interesting turn of events.

399
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,444
We stumbled on something
while digging into your background.

400
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,574
If you stay here, he's done for.
What do you want to do?

401
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,493
Since he's your friend,

402
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,286
you should just leave Jooshin.

403
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,622
If you do, we'll let him stay.

404
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,337
Who are you to decide that?

405
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,672
What?

406
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,049
Who are you to say who can stay?

407
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,509
There he goes again.

408
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,184
You're just Ri-an's errand boy
who goes around bullying kids.

409
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,035
Ta-da. Hand these out to everyone.

410
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,912
What is this? It's so pretty!

411
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,748
Invitations to Jae-i's farewell party.

412
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,915
You're planning it?

413
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,584
Of course. I'm her best friend.

414
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,545
Do your best to make sure everyone comes.

415
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,267
What are you going to wear?

416
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,227
-That dress from before?
-The pink one?

417
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,062
No, let's just go shopping later.

418
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,601
You okay?

419
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,705
I'm sorry, Tae-ho.

420
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,210
I'll do whatever I can

421
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,337
to stop Yun-seok harassing you.

422
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,965
How? By killing him or something?

423
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,884
If you kill Yun-seok, who's next?

424
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,136
Woo-jin, Ri-an, He-ra.

425
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,265
Jae-i, Chan-min, Ba-da.
Will you kill them all?

426
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,268
-Tae-ho.
-One person disappearing isn't enough.

427
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,771
They'll just carry on being themselves.

428
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,026
Stop.

429
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,862
We should stop.

430
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,949
I need to stay at Jooshin.
It's what my father wants.

431
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,493
I know how you feel…

432
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,748
I know what you're going through.

433
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,504
But I'm just so scared, Kang Ha.

434
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,345
I can't help you anymore.

435
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,170
YEAR 2, CLASS 2

436
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,067
YOON HE-RA

437
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,779
Seriously?

438
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,540
LEE WOO-JIN

439
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,253
You haven't been answering my calls
or reading my messages.

440
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,964
Are you avoiding me?

441
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,292
Jae-i, make sure you keep up
with the news here

442
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,129
to see what bombs get dropped
because of you.

443
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,257
People like you and Kim Ri-an
take a real hit

444
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,175
when your social image gets damaged.

445
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,052
Look forward to it.

446
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,989
They're inside the school.
The person who sent the anonymous DMs.

447
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,201
They were sent from Jooshin.

448
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,721
Oh.

449
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:18,806
I'm sorry.

450
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,433
Truly.

451
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,934
I thought you weren't coming
to school anymore.

452
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,270
I'll tell you…

453
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,233
what you want to know.

454
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,694
About In-han's accident.

455
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,037
Woo-jin had a birthday party.

456
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,625
That night,
In-han couldn't endure the bullying,

457
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,003
and he ran out of the party.

458
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,341
Then the accident happened.

459
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,594
So he was tortured.

460
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,180
So much so that

461
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,975
he ran into the road that late.

462
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:46,811
Was it them?

463
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,771
Yun-seok and Ri-an.

464
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,689
No.

465
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,567
I know you're suspicious of Ri-an, but…

466
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,320
it wasn't his fault.

467
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,034
It was my fault.

468
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,537
If we hadn't been friends,

469
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:09,333
In-han wouldn't have been bullied
by so many people.

470
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,009
So blame me.

471
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,555
Blame only me.

472
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:34,942
Help me.

473
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,112
Someone at school is threatening me.

474
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,240
I need to find them before I leave.

475
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,410
It's fine if they're just threatening me.

476
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,204
But Ri-an…

477
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,750
They intend to take him down too.

478
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,126
If it has to do with him,

479
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,795
I don't think I can help.

480
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:59,634
I have the same goal…
as the person threatening you.

481
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,185
You said you would help me survive.

482
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,358
If Ri-an falls apart, I will too.

483
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,196
I want to protect him.

484
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,828
What about me?

485
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,083
I know it's selfish.

486
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,378
But I can't trust anyone in this school…

487
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,131
except you, Kang Ha.

488
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,014
You're so…

489
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,019
you're so cruel, Jae-i.

490
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,855
How could you ask me to do that?

491
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,525
How could you ask me…

492
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,987
to help Ri-an?

493
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,678
What are you doing here?

494
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,765
Waiting for me?

495
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,933
Just open the door.

496
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:42,838
Who is it?

497
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,132
-I don't need to take it.
-Are you really seeing someone?

498
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,009
Don't be ridiculous.

499
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,222
Don't keep secrets from me.
I'm on edge these days.

500
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,141
Why is that?

501
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,226
Because of Ri-an.

502
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:57,937
Or maybe Jae-i.

503
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,313
Or because of He-ra.

504
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,066
What does that mean?

505
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,986
Your desire for what you can't have
is putting you on edge.

506
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,280
Because of the greedy He-ra.

507
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,741
I don't like how you put that.

508
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,786
What's wrong with being greedy
or having desire?

509
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:20,751
You just quietly observe your desires,
without being able to hold or have them.

510
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,463
At least I'm honest. Aren't I better off?

511
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,508
Honesty is great.

512
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,884
You're amazing, He-ra.

513
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,636
But it's too much of a good thing.

514
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,640
I'm worried about you.

515
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,061
I'm worried you might get too greedy
and lose it all.

516
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,479
I appreciate your concern,

517
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,898
but I don't like
"too much of a good thing" either.

518
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,443
Phrases like "the more the merrier"
are much better.

519
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,708
Thanks for the ride.

520
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,090
ON OFFICIAL DUTY

521
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,522
What's going on?

522
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,850
For my darling daughter, for the moment
you want to look the most beautiful.

523
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,208
Mom.

524
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,296
What is all this?

525
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,634
I'm sorry.

526
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,514
What…

527
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,099
what now, He-ra?

528
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,977
What do we do?

529
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:31,859
My baby.

530
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,280
What now?

531
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,617
Oh, He-ra.

532
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,972
Help me.
Someone at school is threatening me.

533
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,772
Why do you think they want us
to go to Jae-i's farewell party?

534
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,689
Right?

535
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,733
They never invite us to their parties.

536
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,985
-So why now?
-Maybe they're plotting something.

537
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,029
Like some sort of plan to bully us all.

538
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,822
I'm too scared to go.

539
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,074
Let's just

540
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:21,992
face it head-on.

541
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,912
Are you going to avoid them
and hide forever?

542
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,372
We should stand up to them.

543
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,539
Why are you all here?

544
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:35,005
I'm sure scholarship students
don't have classes in Special A.

545
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,007
We're just waiting for our next class.

546
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,051
This room is empty all day today.

547
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,887
Even so, entry is only permitted
to those in special classes,

548
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,557
the real students of Jooshin High.

549
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:50,771
You're only here thanks to
the societal consideration of others.

550
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,400
How dare you set foot in a space
for special students?

551
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,948
Clean everything up

552
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,574
and leave, all of you.

553
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,327
At once!

554
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,805
The preparations are complete.
But are you sure about this?

555
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,934
If anything goes wrong,
it could cause a myriad of issues.

556
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,686
If the chairwoman finds out--

557
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,854
Make sure she doesn't.

558
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,023
And make sure nothing goes wrong.

559
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,320
And if something does happen,
despite your efforts,

560
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:41,864
I will

561
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,033
take responsibility for it.

562
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,624
Be sure to call as soon as you arrive.

563
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,709
I will.

564
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,377
Don't worry too much, Father.

565
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,046
I'll stick by Jae-i's side
and take good care of her.

566
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:58,964
All right.

567
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,675
I'm counting on you, Seon-jun.

568
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,469
-Oh.
-Yes?

569
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,768
I guess this is goodbye.

570
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,728
Have a safe flight.

571
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,314
Yes, sir.

572
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,651
And don't ever come back.

573
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,363
Now… nothing here belongs to you.

574
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,916
Darling, they'll be late.
Why don't we let them go now?

575
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,251
All right. Safe travels.

576
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,296
We'll contact you as soon as we arrive.

577
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,965
We'll be on our way now.

578
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:09,827
Bye!

579
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,672
This is awesome.

580
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,755
-I'm here.
-Hey, let's get a drink.

581
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,673
Okay.

582
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,435
-Wow.
-Wow.

583
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,228
So bright and shiny.

584
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,606
-Want to take a picture with it?
-Okay!

585
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:36,705
-What's the class pres doing here?
-She invited the scholarship kids too.

586
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,333
That's why the party is here
and not at He-ra's villa.

587
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,171
What's taking He-ra so long?

588
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,714
The host of the party is late.

589
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:49,301
The guest of honor
is supposed to arrive last.

590
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,554
Why would He-ra be the guest of honor?
This party is for Jae-i.

591
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,847
Jesus, Ba-da.

592
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,474
Are you totally clueless?

593
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,976
-What do you mean?
-That's just an excuse.

594
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,103
Today's party is basically a coronation.

595
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,064
"Farewell, Jae-i."

596
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:05,567
"The crown belongs to Queen He-ra now."
Something along those lines.

597
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,444
That's why the party is today.

598
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,156
That's right. Jae-i flies out today.

599
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,784
Think she left?

600
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,190
What about Ri-an?

601
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,316
He's running late.

602
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,654
-You seem different today.
-How so?

603
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,283
Unlike your usual self,
you seem just normal.

604
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,953
That's what I'm going for.
Extravagance gets old.

605
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,372
And I still look pretty anyway.

606
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,959
You're right. You are pretty.

607
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,088
I've been thinking about
the advice you gave me.

608
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,006
"Advice"?

609
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,384
About holding back
on what I want to have and hold.

610
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,469
You said that was dumb.

611
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,347
So, to be like you,

612
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,100
I'll be more honest about my desires.

613
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,771
Do whatever you want.

614
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,275
I'm settling things with Ri-an today.

615
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,944
If I make him mine,
there will be no issues.

616
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,155
"Issues"?

617
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,173
Hello, He-ra.

618
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,802
Thanks for inviting me and all the others.

619
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,512
Maybe it's the suit?

620
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,682
You seem different today too, puppy.

621
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,354
Keep to yourselves.

622
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,815
We should have fun and enjoy ourselves.

623
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,400
Since we're here.

624
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,372
I wonder what it is.

625
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,541
What could have changed?

626
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,306
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE VIDEOS?

627
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,482
DON'T GET FLUSTERED
AND MAKE IT SO OBVIOUS

628
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,669
I told you it'd be obvious
if you got flustered,

629
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,130
Class Pres.

630
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,682
I visited In-han and found this.

631
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,183
It's yours, isn't it?

632
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,687
I'm sure I saw it attached to your bag.

633
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,484
But I wonder why
this was at In-han's cinerarium?

634
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,113
Why would you visit my brother?

635
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,158
Were you and him close?

636
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,203
I was curious about that,
so I asked Tae-ho,

637
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,122
and he said something strange.

638
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,916
You're different from the others.
And you're friends with Kang Ha.

639
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,961
Speaking of Kang Ha, don't you think
he looks like that dead kid, In-han?

640
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,799
So I thought I'd send a message
to see what happened.

641
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,427
Seeing you startled confirmed it for me.

642
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,016
Jae-i said she was getting
anonymous threats.

643
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,019
Is that your doing?

644
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,064
What do you want to know?

645
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,775
Why I sent that to you?

646
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,820
Or perhaps, why I threatened Jae-i?

647
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:21,740
No.

648
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,451
What else you have in your possession.

649
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:28,955
That's all I want.

650
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,469
We're all out.

651
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,060
-No way.
-No way.

652
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,147
Why isn't he here yet?

653
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,525
No way. Check this out.

654
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,870
GONGSEONG CHAIRMAN'S SON
ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGES

655
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,630
What the hell?

656
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,006
Let's go!

657
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,967
Why is a car coming in here?

658
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,794
Mr. Park Seon-jun?

659
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:01,923
You are under arrest
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

660
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,804
Let's go.

661
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,557
The guest of honor shouldn't be too late.

662
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,476
What is he doing?

663
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,062
Isn't that Jae-i?

664
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:25,822
Ri-an.

665
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,408
So you did this.

666
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,204
You stopped Jae-i from leaving.

667
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,707
He-ra, I hope this answers your question.

668
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,753
This is official.

669
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:41,963
Jae-i and I are…

670
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:44,799
starting over.

671
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,302
We're going to tell our families too.

672
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:55,060
So from now on, nobody better go
anywhere near her in my presence.

673
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,355
Especially you over there,

674
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,483
scholarship student.

675
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,573
He's screwed.

676
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:09,908
Poor He-ra.

677
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,208
You said I could have them all, right?

678
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,544
All the videos you have.

679
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,423
Give them all to me.

680
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,043
Which one suits me?

681
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,047
-They're both nice.
-Which is nicer?

682
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,590
Aren't you buying both anyway?

683
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,301
I'm buying them all. Move.

684
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,307
If you're going to buy them all anyway,
why bother asking me?
