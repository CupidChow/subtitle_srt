00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,427
Why did you do that?

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,221
I could've dealt with it.

4
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,516
Now people will talk about you
because of me.

5
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,019
Kang Ha.

6
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,068
Why'd you really come here?

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,162
So you've figured out who I am.

8
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,305
I came to Jooshin with a goal.

9
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,395
That's right. I'm here to take your place.

10
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,400
Top of the grade until graduation.

11
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:53,071
If I keep that up,
Jooshin will pay for me to study abroad,

12
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,241
and I'll be given priority
when applying to their overseas branches.

13
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,327
You were always at the top of the grade.

14
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,831
No scholarship student
has ever reaped those benefits.

15
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,708
I want to be the first.

16
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,419
Just you wait.
I won't make it easy for you.

17
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,213
They might just be grades to you,

18
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,800
but this is the opportunity of a lifetime…

19
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,845
for me.

20
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,784
Why go to such extremes around me?

21
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,702
That kiss?

22
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,370
"Let's break up. Let's be friends."

23
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,414
I've been perfectly clear
about my feelings.

24
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,542
Who I like and what I do with them
is none of your concern.

25
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,784
NO SIBLINGS

26
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,419
Why'd you really come here?

27
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,672
So you've figured out who I am.

28
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,301
Kang In-han.

29
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,638
Kang Ha.

30
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,420
Wanna go together?

31
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,132
If we're going to do this, I thought
we may as well put on a proper show.

32
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,260
We could go to school together

33
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,220
and make it look like we're official.

34
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,267
You don't agree?

35
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,353
-If you don't--
-Come down when I call.

36
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,321
I'll be back.

37
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,474
EPISODE 3
HIERARCHY: A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN

38
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,234
Oh? Jae-i?

39
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,324
What are you doing?
Don't just stand there. Get in already.

40
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,584
Stop staring at it. It won't fall off.

41
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,837
I'm not worried about that.

42
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,630
What is it, then?

43
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,549
It's cute.

44
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,719
This car with my bike on the back.

45
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,145
How tacky. Why do you wear that bracelet?

46
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,024
This? It's a friendship bracelet
with the Seonyul members.

47
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,777
-"Seonyul"?
-The music group.

48
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,529
That day we first met,
I was playing piano at your house.

49
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,823
I'm in a group
with the musicians who were there.

50
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,077
So everyone in that group
has the same bracelet?

51
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,994
Yes.

52
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,121
But is it tacky?

53
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,791
I think it looks nice.

54
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,351
-It's Jae-i.
-What the…

55
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,106
Who does he think he is?

56
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,107
Look at his bag.

57
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,360
Let's hurry. You'll be late for class.

58
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,195
-What the…
-Stop.

59
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,489
Stop taking photos. If Ri-an finds out…

60
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,199
-Look at their hands!
-That's real?

61
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,076
-That's crazy!
-Seriously?

62
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,662
Big news.
Jae-i and Kang Ha are holding hands.

63
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,497
-Are they dating?
-No way.

64
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,456
What's going on?

65
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,457
What's with them?

66
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,376
-They came to school like that?
-Hold up.

67
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,461
-Get a picture.
-Are they actually dating?

68
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,139
What is it?

69
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,015
Is there a problem?

70
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,475
No.

71
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,352
Why would there be?

72
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,368
I've never seen Jae-i holding hands
with a boy other than Ri-an.

73
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,206
What do you think
the deal is with that kid, Kang Ha?

74
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,293
Don't you have class, Ms. Han?

75
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,503
Oh.

76
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,088
Right.

77
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,925
No holds barred now, is it?

78
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,095
Did you see the photos?

79
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,347
Are those two serious?

80
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,600
Hey, don't make such a big deal out of it.

81
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,102
Everyone's talking about it.

82
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,813
The least we can do
is quietly congratulate Jae-i.

83
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,523
-And support her.
-Damn.

84
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,066
So it's true? It must be.

85
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,693
What about the Jooshin tyrant?

86
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,029
What about Ri-an? Are they really done?

87
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,363
We have to assume so.

88
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,741
Otherwise, she wouldn't be seeing
someone else.

89
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,659
And, you never know,

90
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,496
Ri-an might also have someone new.

91
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,623
Hey.

92
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,930
What is this?

93
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,139
Chocolates.

94
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,475
They're for you.

95
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,280
Help yourselves.

96
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,616
I'm off.
I have a special class this morning.

97
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,621
I feel sorry for Kim Seon-u.

98
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,208
He-ra pays him no attention,
yet he comes by every chance he gets.

99
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,125
I know, right?

100
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,588
Isn't that when it started?

101
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,216
-After they had sex at Woo-jin's party.
-Hey!

102
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,760
Quiet. Someone might hear you.

103
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,845
Who cares? Everyone knows already.

104
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,139
Still, don't go around gossiping about it.

105
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,724
Don't want He-ra catching you.

106
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,560
You'd be dead meat.

107
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,769
JOOSHIN HIGH SCHOOL

108
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,770
Why would I?

109
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,655
Good morning, friends.

110
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,911
Why are you in Jae-i's seat?

111
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,830
I'm being considerate.

112
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,166
Would you be able to focus
sitting next to Jae-i on a day like today?

113
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:52,925
What is that?

114
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:53,968
Oh, well…

115
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,136
Our seat.

116
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,020
I'll be in this class with Jae-i
from now on.

117
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,771
I hope we get along.

118
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,524
What? Do you even know what this class is?

119
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,693
This is a special class
for the four of us.

120
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,403
It's not a class for just anyone.

121
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,571
"Just anyone"?

122
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,282
He-ra.

123
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,417
His class fees and schedule are settled.

124
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,546
But if you're against it,
I'll make a class for me and Kang Ha.

125
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,312
Aren't you going to start class?

126
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,509
Are you just going to ignore them?

127
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,469
She's even bringing him into our classes.

128
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,389
We should do something.

129
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,601
You should fight back
and tell Jae-i we're dating too.

130
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,520
You have to provoke her if you…

131
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,065
Hey, Kim Ri-an!

132
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,738
Don't overdo it, Yoon He-ra.

133
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,879
Why is he taking out his annoyance on me?

134
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,800
Oh my God. It's Kang Ha!

135
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,593
-Hi.
-Hi, Kang Ha.

136
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,511
Is that him?

137
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,431
That's him.

138
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,473
It's Kang Ha.

139
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,891
-That's Kang Ha?
-Yeah.

140
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,894
Kang Ha.

141
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,441
Can I have a word?

142
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,154
Spit it out. What do you want?

143
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,449
It's…

144
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,410
Hey, I'm sorry.

145
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,330
I didn't do it on purpose.

146
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,249
What are you doing?

147
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,543
You already have an idea
of my position here.

148
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,045
All the things
I had no choice but to do to you,

149
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,548
I want to apologize for them. I'm sorry.

150
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,926
Why?

151
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,053
Because of Jae-i?

152
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,978
I'm still a scholarship student,
just like I was back then.

153
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,981
This is just ridiculous, Chan-min.

154
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,775
My dad works for the Jaeyul Group.

155
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,945
Just hit me.

156
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,032
Just beat me to a pulp.

157
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,867
I'll lie here like…

158
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,788
Just like this.
Stamp on me to your heart's content.

159
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,039
Here, hit me.

160
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,582
What's wrong?

161
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,459
A club? Do you need a club?

162
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,502
I'll find one.

163
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:17,922
Here, take this.

164
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,093
Take it and beat me until it breaks.

165
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,096
But please don't say
anything bad about me to Jae-i.

166
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,683
I guess no one around here has a spine.

167
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,230
If you did, you wouldn't have taken
the lead on bullying someone

168
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,690
just because Kim Ri-an's posse
said a few words.

169
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,691
Don't you think?

170
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,751
Fuck. This is turning into a headache.

171
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,929
Does that mean Jae-i
and Ri-an have totally called it quits?

172
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,597
It seems Jae-i has decided to.

173
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,517
But Ri-an hasn't.

174
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,769
Who would've thought?

175
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,273
Why's that scholarship kid
getting involved with Jae-i?

176
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,066
My guess is that Jae-i is doing it

177
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,235
on purpose.

178
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,195
I doubt it'll last long.

179
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,697
I'm worried.

180
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,116
The students seem unsettled.

181
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,453
We don't want
another tragedy on our hands.

182
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,258
What are you doing? What if someone sees?

183
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,551
If they see, they see.

184
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,469
It'll be fine.

185
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,180
Don't worry so much, Ms. Han Ji-su.

186
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,437
I'm off.

187
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,330
DON'T PROVOKE RI-AN, HE'S DANGEROUS

188
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,457
THAT'S HOW IT STARTED FOR IN-HAN TOO

189
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,457
That's mine.

190
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,314
We killed it.

191
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,246
Pass the ball.

192
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,564
It's getting on my nerves.

193
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,235
She looks at me like nothing happened.

194
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,618
It had to have been you.

195
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,164
You left that note
in my locker, didn't you?

196
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,004
LET'S MEET AND TALK

197
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,596
Hi.

198
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,847
What's your secret?

199
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,391
-What?
-How did you befriend Jae-i?

200
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,728
You're a ray of hope
for us scholarship students.

201
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,355
I'm floored you're dating Queen Jae-i.
What's your secret?

202
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,150
Can I have your number?

203
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,496
Okay, focus!

204
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,997
Let's go, Jooshin!

205
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,834
Let's go!

206
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,544
Let's go, Choi Yun-seok!

207
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,425
Blue 15!

208
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,688
Touchdown!

209
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,607
I blocked them. It was me!

210
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,151
You were awesome.

211
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,071
-Kim Ri-an!
-You're the best, Ri-an!

212
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,739
Kim Ri-an!

213
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,242
-Kim Ri-an!
-Nice.

214
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,370
You're amazing, Kim Ri-an!

215
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,831
What's going on?

216
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,748
What the hell?

217
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,964
Where's Jae-i?

218
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,994
Wow, you really killed it.

219
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,039
That was the most incredible
touchdown celebration ever.

220
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,957
I know, right? What a man.

221
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,793
The Jooshin tyrant is so romantic.

222
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,588
My heart couldn't take it.

223
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:16,840
Wait!

224
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,093
He-ra, you said
Ri-an might be seeing someone new.

225
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,803
So that means

226
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,222
it's you.

227
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,309
Well, I'd be lying if I said
there was no indication whatsoever.

228
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,061
I had an inkling.

229
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,564
And you didn't say a word to us.
I'm disappointed, Queen He-ra.

230
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,734
"Queen He-ra"?

231
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,277
You've ascended to queen status.

232
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,072
You're Ri-an's new girlfriend.
He kissed you in public.

233
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,282
Oh, stop.

234
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,498
No way. It's Kim Seon-u again.

235
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:50,832
Impressive.

236
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,002
Get on. We need to talk.

237
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,004
You two, go on ahead.

238
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,142
Do you think Seon-u rushed over in shock?

239
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,104
-Because Ri-an kissed He-ra?
-Yeah.

240
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,149
Where are they going anyway?
She'll be okay, right?

241
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,444
Have you ever been on a motorcycle?

242
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,456
He-ra.

243
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,667
"Get on"? "We need to talk"?

244
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,295
How dare you be so rude?

245
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,505
He-ra, do you like Ri-an? What about me?

246
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,424
Why are you curious about that?

247
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,134
I'm warning you, Seon-u.

248
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,053
Don't cross the line.

249
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,851
Why did you sleep with me
if you don't even like me?

250
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,482
The girls were curious.

251
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,278
The cute incoming freshman.
Fit and fresh meat.

252
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,407
They were wondering how you'd be in bed,
so I took one for the team.

253
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,742
Satisfied now?

254
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,118
How could you say that?

255
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,537
I really like you.

256
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,206
Why do you like me?
Because you slept with me?

257
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,752
If that's why,
you're being way too selfish.

258
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,129
I didn't exactly have
a good time that night.

259
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,758
You're such a bitch!

260
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,136
You're a good judge of character.
Now stop bothering me.

261
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,930
I'm gonna tell Ri-an we slept together!

262
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,182
Be my guest.

263
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,933
Just stay out of my way.

264
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,397
Are you all right?

265
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,399
Having issues with your GPS signal?

266
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,151
You're late. I left school ages ago.

267
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,279
Just leave him.

268
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,923
KIM RI-AN, YOON HE-RA, LEE WOO-JIN,
JUNG JAE-I, CHOI YUN-SEOK

269
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,926
DOWNLOADING FIVE FOLDERS
TO YEAR 2, CLASS 2

270
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,971
JOOSHIN HIGH SCHOOL

271
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,663
She is waiting for you.

272
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,588
There isn't anything
particularly concerning.

273
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,631
With regard to Ri-an,

274
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,467
each dedicated staff member

275
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,137
is carefully overseeing
even the smallest details.

276
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,431
I think it's time
we have a parents' night.

277
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,766
Will you be in attendance?

278
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,019
Maybe it's a delayed phase of adolescence.

279
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,730
Recently, Ri-an said that he's still

280
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,025
at an age where he needs parental care.

281
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,196
He has so many staff,
I'm not sure what he's complaining about.

282
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,323
But if he wants attention, he'll get it.

283
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:55,494
It is, after all, a parent's duty
to provide everything their child wants.

284
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,786
You are incredible.

285
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,957
Despite your busy schedule, you care
for your child's emotional well-being.

286
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,543
I truly admire you.

287
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,213
Ensure the staff
of affiliated companies are present.

288
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,547
While I'm there,

289
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,758
we can handle any minor business matters.

290
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,635
I'll arrange everything as instructed.

291
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,849
I'm here.

292
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,231
Hey, Tae-ho.

293
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,982
How have you been?

294
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,778
Haven't seen you like this

295
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:31,780
in a while.

296
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,408
Let's get going. Okay?

297
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,452
We can talk while we eat.

298
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,874
You pauper. How dare you touch me?

299
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,085
Hey, Tae-ho.

300
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,258
Jaeyul Hotel's owner's only son.

301
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,134
That's what I'm known as.

302
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,513
No one there knows my real background.

303
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,098
That's why I avoided

304
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,308
both In-han…

305
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,144
and you.

306
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,896
I get your position.

307
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,816
At least you still tried to help.

308
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,364
I know you gave my brother the same note.

309
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,449
Why Jooshin?

310
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,327
And what's up with you and Jae-i?

311
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,997
Don't do anything dangerous.

312
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,376
I don't know what Jae-i is trying to pull,
but she and Ri-an go way back.

313
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,294
I know.

314
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,589
That's why I want to be by Jae-i's side.

315
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,383
So you're provoking him on purpose.

316
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,343
Kim Ri-an, I mean.

317
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,389
In-han called me.

318
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,810
Something definitely happened to him.

319
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,773
But not even the police could figure out
what it was or who did it.

320
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,110
Filed as a hit-and-run.

321
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,322
What do you intend to do
when even the police can't figure it out?

322
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,573
I'll collect evidence.

323
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,200
Alcohol, drugs, bullying…

324
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,286
The kids who hurt In-han,

325
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,329
Kim Ri-an included,

326
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,415
I'll expose everything
they've been doing at Jooshin.

327
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,001
So, Tae-ho,

328
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,252
I need your help.

329
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,339
What can I do to help?

330
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,091
I need Ri-an's locker combination.

331
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,302
The combination?

332
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,763
Yun-seok is Ri-an's drug supplier.

333
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,765
There has to be proof in his locker.

334
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,602
I can't exactly get close to them,
but you can.

335
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,605
That's true.

336
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,232
You're right. But I'm

337
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,109
a little scared.

338
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,487
Please help me with this,

339
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,530
Tae-ho.

340
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,180
Out with it.

341
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,433
Aren't you here to talk?

342
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,979
What are you playing at
by bringing He-ra into this too?

343
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,987
I thought… we were at a place
where I didn't need to explain

344
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,490
what I was planning and with whom anymore.

345
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,701
Kim Ri-an.

346
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,910
YOON HE-RA

347
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,669
Did you get home okay?

348
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,421
I just wanted to chat.

349
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,506
Are you free right now?

350
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,591
Come over.

351
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,801
We can talk here.

352
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,444
Ri-an's house? At this time?

353
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,322
Well, I just called for a little chat,

354
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,074
and he asked me to come over.

355
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,659
That's crazy.

356
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,912
Hey, don't you think
you're moving too fast?

357
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,914
Do I look okay?

358
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,833
I think I'm bloated because it's late.

359
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,878
You're gorgeous. A total goddess.

360
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,879
So pretty.

361
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,880
-You think so?
-Yes!

362
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,965
Meongnyang, isn't He-ra gorgeous?

363
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,842
He-ra is gorgeous.

364
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,803
Good boy.

365
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,180
-You're so smart.
-I'll call you later.

366
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,575
You got here fast.

367
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:30,995
Hi, Jae-i.

368
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:39,087
Ri-an invited me over out of the blue,
and I needed to talk to him anyway.

369
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:44,175
I plan to give him an earful about today.
I know your relationship is on the rocks,

370
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,593
but that was out of line.

371
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,721
And you and I are best friends.

372
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,308
Don't worry.
I'll give him a good talking-to.

373
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,313
Don't play along
with Ri-an's little games.

374
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,576
"Little games"?

375
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,648
It's been a while.

376
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:42,775
Indeed.

377
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,528
The lobby is nicer than I remember.

378
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,280
I'll show you inside.

379
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,535
Are you going to kill him too?

380
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,881
Are you sure about this?

381
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,299
I'm sure.

382
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,637
I checked twice…
No, three times, over and over.

383
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,183
If he finds out,
he'll hide me away like my mom.

384
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,689
These aren't just empty threats.
I have everything.

385
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,273
This

386
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,316
and also that.

387
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,776
What do you want from me?

388
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,042
What?

389
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,296
Dad's looking for you.

390
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,013
Have you decided on a dress?

391
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,681
To wear to parents' night?

392
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,392
Chairman Park of the Gongseong Group
will be there.

393
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,021
Their second child attends Jooshin.

394
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,398
I heard they're in their first year.

395
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,900
Chairman Park's oldest son
lives in New York.

396
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,611
We've been discussing it for ages.

397
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,197
It's time our households
got to know each other.

398
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,490
We'll say hi that night

399
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,285
and arrange a formal gathering
in the near future.

400
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,244
Dad.

401
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,121
I'm not ready…

402
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,249
Jae-i.

403
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,169
This has been in the works

404
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,546
since the moment
we found out you were a girl.

405
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,424
This isn't just about you.

406
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:16,471
It will affect the overall direction
of the Jaeyul Group's business dealings.

407
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,723
I understand what you're saying.

408
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,224
I do, but--

409
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,186
Their scale and business potential
align well with ours.

410
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,939
They're flawless as partners.
Make adequate preparations,

411
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,192
so nothing gets in the way
of what you must do

412
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,401
and where you must go.

413
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,197
Be especially careful
of gossip surrounding your personal life.

414
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,242
Don't do anything
worth being talked about.

415
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,369
No.

416
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,415
We can't have that.

417
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,570
Why are you here?

418
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,863
I was waiting for you.

419
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,824
Let's take my ride today.

420
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,590
The breeze is so nice. Don't you think?

421
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,717
This is like the Healing Forest.

422
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,719
When we rode that bike.

423
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,382
Let's stop and eat.

424
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,472
-Thank you.
-Hope you enjoy.

425
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,227
Here.

426
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,440
You'll be shocked if you've never had it.
It's so good.

427
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,156
Don't like me.

428
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,073
What?

429
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,744
I don't like you,
so you shouldn't like me either.

430
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,999
The time I spend with you
is only out of goodwill.

431
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:56,047
An act of goodwill to prevent anyone else
from getting hurt because of me.

432
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,887
Everyone who got on Ri-an's bad side
eventually left.

433
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,431
If I leave you alone, you'll end up

434
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,059
just like them.

435
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,521
That's the only reason I'm helping you.

436
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,858
So just stay committed
to the role you're playing.

437
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,488
Don't distort or misinterpret
my act of goodwill.

438
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,369
I won't misinterpret or distort anything.

439
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,330
But

440
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,123
am I allowed to worry about you?

441
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,627
You? Worry about me?

442
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,795
Yes, you worry me.

443
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,713
You seem on edge.

444
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,299
You seem that way even now.

445
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,052
Your expression is cold and indifferent.

446
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,555
But your eyes tell me

447
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,475
you're lonely and afraid.

448
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,447
How's that for role commitment?

449
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,867
Right now, I'm playing the role
of Jung Jae-i's boyfriend.

450
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:11,539
Caring about my girlfriend's mood
is all part of being a good boyfriend.

451
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,251
Right? Don't you think?

452
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,109
-Good morning, He-ra.
-Morning.

453
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,569
-Hi, He-ra.
-Hi.

454
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,862
Hi, He-ra.

455
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,160
JAE-I

456
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,588
Hi, Jae-i.

457
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,303
I actually meant to call you.

458
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,598
That thing I asked about. How'd it go?

459
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,726
What? What thing?

460
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,811
The anonymous account.

461
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,688
Right.

462
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,900
Oh, I've found someone to trace it.

463
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,611
They said it's difficult
to identify the user,

464
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,739
so I told them to track
where the messages are being sent from.

465
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,534
Tell me.

466
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,079
-Huh?
-I get it.

467
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,124
Now, tell me why
you've been meaning to call.

468
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,257
I'm so sorry, Jae-i.

469
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,344
Sorry? For what?

470
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,762
I'm your best friend.

471
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,640
I can't be doing this.

472
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,351
I tried convincing him and getting angry.

473
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,269
I tried everything I could.

474
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,898
But Ri-an is so stubborn.

475
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,734
He's taking the breakup really hard.

476
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,112
I just can't bear to reject him.

477
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,907
I'm worried what he'll do if I reject him.

478
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,495
I know it will hurt you--

479
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,038
It won't hurt me, He-ra.

480
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,374
But…

481
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,378
you can't.

482
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,048
What do you mean?

483
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,218
We may be broken up, but you and my ex?

484
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,554
That just won't do.

485
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,978
You're not a suitable match
for my ex-boyfriend anyway.

486
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,939
Don't you remember what I said?

487
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,400
About not playing along
with Ri-an's little games.

488
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,071
I hope you've gotten
the message this time.

489
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,703
Get the account issue resolved
as soon as possible and let me know.

490
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,421
I'm "not a suitable match"?

491
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,149
Shouldn't you be attending
your school event,

492
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,942
not playing music at it?

493
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,403
It doesn't apply to scholarship students.

494
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,571
It doesn't apply?

495
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,116
Well, they told us not to come.

496
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,993
We get special treatment.

497
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,330
All those rich kids are coming,
but they told you not to come?

498
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,623
What school does that?

499
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,500
I think it's good.

500
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,252
I won't feel out of place,
and I can make money.

501
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,379
Good.

502
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,215
Your tie's crooked.

503
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,510
In-han was always
so meticulous and well-groomed.

504
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,179
Come on, man.

505
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,640
This is all In-han's doing anyway.

506
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,974
He always did it for me.

507
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,476
Does it look okay?

508
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,270
There we go. Good!

509
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,692
This is a Valentino dress.

510
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,695
It's a minimalist red dress
with a standout zipper.

511
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,241
This one's
from the latest Prada collection.

512
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:19,703
Its simple and classic design
would flatter Miss Jae-i's figure--

513
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,664
This one, Jae-i.

514
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,968
I think these would suit you well.

515
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,401
There.

516
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,903
I approve.

517
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,199
Your expression is cold and indifferent.

518
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,867
But your eyes tell me

519
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,328
you're lonely and afraid.

520
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,422
I trust that
all preparations are in order?

521
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,856
Is my daughter seeing someone new?

522
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,691
Who did you get so dressed up for?

523
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,276
Have a look around.

524
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,362
And guess who my secret boyfriend is.

525
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,115
I'll have to keep my eyes peeled
to find out who he is.

526
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,082
Is Jae-i's father coming tonight?

527
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,501
I assume so. Ri-an's mother is coming too.

528
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,921
And you're Jae-i's closest friend
at Jooshin, aren't you?

529
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,675
Well, you could say that.

530
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,553
Do you think your dad

531
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,931
could take advantage
of that connection tonight?

532
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,853
What do you mean by that?

533
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:14,109
The deal my company
was working on with Jooshin

534
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,737
didn't work out.

535
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,280
You said that was important.

536
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,825
Which is why I'm considering
sounding out Jaeyul Group.

537
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,578
Chairman Jung rarely interacts with people

538
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,497
who aren't on his level.

539
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,582
But since he'll be there tonight,

540
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,627
don't you think you and Jae-i

541
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,172
could casually arrange an introduction?

542
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,469
I'll talk to Jae-i about it.

543
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:56,902
Jae-i.

544
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,534
Oh, I'm here for a gig.

545
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,660
With my music group.

546
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,330
Jae-i, you look so beautiful tonight.

547
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,917
Wait, there's…

548
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,962
You have a stray hair.

549
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,301
What's your reason?

550
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,555
I have my reason for keeping you around.

551
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,391
What's yours?

552
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,311
"You're pretty. You worry me.
You seem on edge."

553
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,190
Why say those things
when no one is around?

554
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,238
There isn't one. There's no reason.

555
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:45,868
Just because.

556
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,288
I say those things
because you are pretty, and I do worry.

557
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,373
Whenever I see you smile, I think,

558
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,626
"What's behind that smile?"

559
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,462
"What is he hiding?"

560
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,174
Why do I always think that?

561
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,896
Welcome, Ms. An.

562
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,981
-Welcome.
-Hello, Ms. An.

563
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,025
Guess you're not busy.

564
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,902
You never attend events.

565
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,153
I'm here to show my son

566
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:25,115
the parental love and attention
he said he needed.

567
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,246
Hello, Ms. An.

568
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,123
-Welcome, Ms. An.
-Good evening.

569
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:35,793
Do you see it?

570
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,296
The immense care and love
I'm showering you with.

571
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,467
Those people standing before you,
those countless affiliates.

572
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,845
No other parent in the world
can hand down this social status,

573
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,140
but I will give it all to you, Ri-an.

574
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,609
In the future,

575
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,904
Jooshin will not only lead the way
in practicing noblesse oblige.

576
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,574
I have no doubt we will produce
the best talents equipped with

577
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,451
both character and intellect.

578
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,912
Good evening.

579
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,252
Hello, Mr. Jung.

580
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,046
Good evening, Mr. Jung.

581
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,633
Hello.

582
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,262
Now, then.

583
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,931
Let's raise our glasses.

584
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,351
To Jooshin and our children.

585
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,978
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

586
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,818
Ri-an's mom's Bulgari necklace
is probably worth over 100 million won.

587
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,486
Wow, 100 million?

588
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,155
How much are her earrings
and necklace worth altogether?

589
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,157
They're on another level.

590
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,494
See Yun-seok's mom's Van Cleef?
You can't even buy that anymore.

591
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,416
Are you two going to
just stand here eating and chatting?

592
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,877
Don't you have anyone to greet?

593
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,628
They all look busy.

594
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,717
Haven't I always said you need to make
the right connections from a young age?

595
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,176
Who are you talking about?

596
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,637
-Why are you so clueless?
-No, it's embarrassing.

597
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,579
He-ra?

598
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,166
Can I have a word?

599
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,295
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

600
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,053
Have you spoken to Jae-i?

601
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,388
Not yet.

602
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,265
I'll ask her.

603
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,687
Jae-i.

604
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,986
My dad wants to introduce himself
to your father.

605
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,155
He has something to discuss too.

606
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,240
It's been a while, Jae-i.

607
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,496
I heard Chairman Jung was here,
so I was hoping to meet him.

608
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,874
You and my He-ra are such close friends,

609
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,043
but we've never properly met.

610
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,086
He's busy.

611
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,297
I'll tell him you said hello.

612
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,563
It's not a difficult favor.

613
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,940
No, it's not.

614
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,068
I just don't feel like it.

615
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:50,570
What?

616
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,991
I have no interest
in doing you any favors.

617
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,269
Your dress.

618
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,605
It's pretty.

619
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,735
So pretty that I want to stop fighting

620
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,445
with the Jae-i of today.

621
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,196
We're not fighting, Ri-an.

622
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,407
We broke up.

623
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,337
I have nothing but admiration

624
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,673
for Jooshin's passion
for the education business.

625
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,926
Our children's future
is the country's future.

626
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,429
We can't just chase after growth.

627
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:01,725
I believe corporations have a duty
to help build a harmonious society.

628
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,269
I admire you too.

629
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:08,690
There are so many far-fetched rumors
surrounding Jooshin and Jaeyul Group.

630
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:12,110
But you happily sent Miss Jae-i our way,
for which I'm grateful.

631
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,198
And thank you
for accepting her with open arms.

632
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,910
Apologies for my tardiness.

633
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,871
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has, Chairman Park.

634
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,749
-Welcome.
-You're as beautiful as ever.

635
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,459
Thank you.

636
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,544
-I trust you're well.
-Yes. And you?

637
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,630
I haven't seen you all in ages.

638
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:56,738
Over here, Jae-i.

639
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,240
Introduce yourself.

640
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,285
Nice to meet you.

641
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,204
-I'm Jung Jae-i.
-Nice to meet you.

642
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,331
I've heard a lot about you.

643
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,460
Seeing such a good-looking
young man and woman together

644
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,254
has me thinking.

645
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,131
If the two families became one,

646
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,466
it would be the union
of Jooshin and Jaeyul.

647
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,719
Could you imagine a bigger powerhouse?

648
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,013
Is that so?

649
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,266
It would affect our kids' futures.

650
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,811
We couldn't only consider
the effect of the union.

651
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,521
But wouldn't it make a great story?

652
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:33,567
"Two competing corporations become one
through their children."

653
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,651
A great story, indeed.

654
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:39,114
But great stories
are not usually created so easily.

655
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,658
That's why they're a rarity.

656
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,995
I've heard a few things
about that rarity of a story.

657
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,249
I heard Mr. Ri-an and Miss Jae-i
are in a relationship.

658
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,300
That can't be true.

659
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,721
It's likely just gossip
due to two high-profile kids

660
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,806
attending the same school.

661
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,974
Right, Mr. Ri-an?

662
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,480
It's preposterous gossip.

663
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,150
Above all else, we intend to match our son

664
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,361
with a family who share
similar values to Jooshin.

665
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:22,407
Jooshin contributes to society
and upholds its traditions.

666
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,160
The Jaeyul Group prioritizes
commercial viability.

667
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,121
So in that respect, we are very different.

668
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,209
Our long-term goals are quite different.

669
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,378
If you consider growth potential,
there would be no reason

670
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:39,674
for the Jaeyul Group to enter
into a union with a stagnating Jooshin.

671
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,804
I've brought up an unnecessary topic
and seem to have made a faux pas.

672
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:45,972
Please, excuse me.

673
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,265
Of course. See you soon.

674
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,674
Ri-an will never let go of Jae-i.

675
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,717
He doesn't get bored of girls like I do.

676
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,512
And unlike you,
he can differentiate between feelings

677
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,972
of love and greed.

678
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,600
You're playing with fire.
I worry because I know you so well.

679
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:31,726
Do you still like me?

680
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,645
Hey, what are you--

681
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,772
If not, just stay out of my business.

682
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,952
It's been a long time.

683
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,246
Remember me?

684
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,747
Of course. How have you been?

685
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,626
He's been wanting
to introduce himself to you,

686
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,545
but he's being very shy.

687
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,130
Introduce himself?

688
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,923
I am Jae-i's friend, after all,

689
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,217
so it's only right I help out.

690
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:05,677
Right, Jae-i?

691
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:07,887
Yoon He-ra.

692
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,979
This is Jae-i's boyfriend.

693
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,278
This guy is living proof

694
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,531
of the noblesse oblige
Jooshin is always emphasizing.

695
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,244
Jooshin's pride, a scholarship student.

696
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,596
Go on.

697
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,389
Say hello, Kang Ha.
