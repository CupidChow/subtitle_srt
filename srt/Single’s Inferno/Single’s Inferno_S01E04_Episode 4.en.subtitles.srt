OH JIN-TAEK

10
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,707
INFERNO

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,959
Hyeon-joong, are you going to work out?

12
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,503
-Let's go.
-We're going to play catch.

13
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,509
-Awesome. Nice.
-Well done.

14
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,679
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my.

15
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,181
-Bye.
-You're strong.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,057
Stop!

17
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,689
Hey!

18
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,614
You're a fast runner.

19
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,908
Only fast runners are left on this island.

20
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,833
I wonder how the two men must be feeling.

21
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,002
Kyuhyun, how would you feel
if you were him?

22
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,588
-Who?
-Se-hoon.

23
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,258
I would've been crushed inside

24
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,302
-Right.
-if I were Se-hoon.

25
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,638
Of course.
His feelings were not reciprocated.

26
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,599
-He kept expressing his feelings for her,
-Right.

27
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,976
but he didn't get any answer.
It discourages him.

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,021
No matter how confident you are,
after being rejected repeatedly,

29
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,023
-you'll feel small.
-Right.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,443
What's Ji-yeon's ideal type?

31
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,903
-Who?
-Ji-yeon.

32
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,241
She likes quiet and manly men.

33
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,993
-Someone trustworthy?
-Yes, someone trustworthy.

34
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,079
I think she said something like that.

35
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,833
If that's true,
she might have found Jin-taek attractive.

36
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,251
Right.

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,629
-He does have a lot of charm.
-He does.

38
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,926
I don't know Ji-a very well,

39
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,344
but we made some eye contact

40
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,596
and got to talk a bit
when we had brunch together.

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,350
Ji-a's personality is
actually my ideal type.

42
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,019
I like charismatic women

43
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,272
who have their own opinions.

44
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,860
And this is why I'm curious about Ji-yeon.

45
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,279
-Why?
-Because she's the opposite.

46
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,738
I have never…

47
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,157
Experienced someone like her?

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,034
Right. I've never dated someone like that.

49
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,495
I know

50
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,000
that she's not the type of woman I like
and doesn't have the personality I like.

51
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,628
I mean, she's pretty.
She has bright skin and a beautiful smile.

52
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,506
But when I think about her,

53
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,550
I know that's not the type I usually like.

54
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,843
I felt the opposite.

55
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,554
When I talked to her, I felt like…

56
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,847
She's not a shy person?

57
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,765
She's rather strong.

58
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,892
Rather?

59
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,562
I mean, she looks
so weak and soft on the outside,

60
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:11,399
so we assumed her personality
would be like that too,

61
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,359
but I don't think that's true.

62
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,069
-She's a very strong person.
-Right.

63
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,697
She's not easily influenced by others.

64
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,241
-You think she's not easily swayed?
-She isn't.

65
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,619
I think she's
a lot stronger than you think.

66
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,828
-I think.
-I see.

67
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,876
I want to know

68
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,712
-what you think.
-Yes?

69
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,759
You know, I called her

70
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,969
-and we went for a walk.
-Right.

71
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,138
While we walked and talked,

72
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,140
I made it clear

73
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,394
that I'd like to talk to her more
and get to know her better.

74
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:53,942
But I felt like
she wasn't excited to hear that.

75
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:58,696
She was like, "But I'm not
that interested in you."

76
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,449
Well, in the worst case,
it's because she doesn't like you.

77
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,660
-Okay.
-But if that's not the case,

78
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,872
she probably thought
she had talked with you enough

79
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:12,001
so she wanted to talk to Jin-taek,
who she didn't get to talk to yet.

80
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,086
That's what I think.

81
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,588
-You can look at it this way.
-That might be the case?

82
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,589
Yes.

83
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,258
That's what I think.

84
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,885
Right. I know that's what you think.

85
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,097
I mean, this is

86
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:29,477
something I have never felt before.
It feels bitter.

87
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,520
Right.

88
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,397
I'll be honest with you.

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,233
I went to Paradise with Ji-a yesterday

90
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,193
and I liked it.

91
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,154
But I said this to Ji-a.

92
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,200
We still have a lot of time,
so why don't we try

93
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,745
-talking to other people too?
-Right.

94
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,791
So she talked to other people,
and she left with Si-hun.

95
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,169
And it made me a bit sad.

96
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,171
-It bothers you, right?
-It does bother me.

97
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,925
I'm really nervous now. I don't know why.

98
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,011
Is your hand okay?

99
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,554
My hand? It's okay. Really.

100
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,598
You look very happy now.

101
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,975
Well, now…

102
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,686
I feel great.

103
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,398
I feel a bit drunk. You know what I mean?

104
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,816
You feel drunk?

105
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,776
Yes. It feels good to be drunk, you know.

106
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,154
-That's how I feel right now.
-Are you drunk on me?

107
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,740
I am.

108
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,868
You know what I mean.
You make me feel drunk.

109
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,246
I didn't feel this way
from the start though.

110
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,790
I think it's because we cooked together.

111
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,209
-You keep…
-Why?

112
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,421
I couldn't even look at you,
but you'd keep talking to me.

113
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,173
Let me try.

114
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,676
-Do you know how to do it?
-I haven't done it before, but…

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,471
-I can do it.
-You can do it.

116
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,223
-Gosh, it's hot!
-Oh, no.

117
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,141
Be careful.

118
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,268
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

119
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,772
-Did you burn your hand?
-I got burned.

120
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,650
I was touched by that.

121
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,777
I see.

122
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,236
-When we were cooking rice.
-Rice?

123
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,905
I got distracted then.

124
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,282
-That's why you burned your hand.
-That's why.

125
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,202
-I was…
-I'll go with you for the laser treatment.

126
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,411
To treat this scar?

127
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,704
Would you come with me?

128
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,082
Will you wait for me?

129
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,669
There's something I wanted to ask you.
When I first saw you,

130
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,047
I felt like I almost got a heart attack.

131
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,591
I couldn't really look at you.

132
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,261
But as far as I remember,
we made eye contact once,

133
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,638
I think.

134
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,308
You might not remember it,
but I think we did once.

135
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,020
-It's not too hot, is it?
-It's so hot.

136
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,856
-It's going to get hotter.
-It's crazy.

137
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,528
What was your first impression of me?

138
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,571
I thought you weren't looking at me.

139
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,075
I was. I looked at you
many times, secretly.

140
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,620
I guess you're one
of those who likes to peek.

141
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,330
I really enjoyed that feeling.

142
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,458
It felt like I had a secret crush.

143
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,086
-You know that?
-Really? Do you want me to leave then?

144
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,838
No, I'm just so happy now.

145
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,717
My gosh. Si-hun wasn't like that earlier.

146
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,262
He's definitely talking
more about his feelings

147
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,222
compared to when he was with Ji-yeon.

148
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,599
-He seems really excited now.
-He does.

149
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,768
-He was calm when he was with Ji-yeon.
-Right.

150
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,063
But now, I can even hear
his heart pounding.

151
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,441
-He's definitely acting differently.
-Right.

152
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,403
Until now, I wasn't sure.

153
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:30,032
I wasn't sure if I couldn't look at you
just because you're so pretty.

154
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:34,245
I had no idea what made my heart flutter

155
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,165
whenever we made eye contact.

156
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,500
My heart skipped a beat.

157
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,793
Did your heart flutter?

158
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,258
Yes.

159
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,759
You're talking a lot when we're alone.

160
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,011
-Right?
-Yes.

161
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,388
I act differently

162
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,765
around the people I'm close with.

163
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,769
When I'm with a woman I like, I get cuter.

164
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,313
I can be really cute too.

165
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,856
Only when I'm with my boyfriend.

166
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,609
-Really?
-Yes. Nobody knows that.

167
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,527
That's cute.

168
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,450
You think that's cute?

169
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,160
You'll be really shocked later.

170
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,829
Okay.

171
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,541
Ji-a is amazing.

172
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,628
She's so enchanting.

173
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,754
Right.

174
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,384
I sent you some signs with my eyes.

175
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,802
-With your eyes?
-Yes.

176
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,930
You need to look into my eyes.

177
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,933
-Is that so?
-I use my eyes to communicate.

178
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,314
Well, I'm starting
to realize where my heart is going.

179
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,484
What I know for sure is that today

180
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:50,029
I'm different from
the person that I was yesterday.

181
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,198
-I see.
-That's how I feel.

182
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,408
What about you?

183
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,369
If I'm different?

184
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,204
-Yes.
-I'm also different today.

185
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,247
-Really?
-Yes.

186
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,957
I'll think of it as a good thing.

187
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,627
You're cute.

188
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,548
-Shall we make a toast?
-Shall we?

189
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,091
PARADISE
AN YEA-WON & KIM JUN-SIK

190
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:14,595
To our escape from Inferno
and our arrival to Paradise.

191
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,763
You deserve this.

192
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,806
You deserve it too.

193
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,522
It tastes so good.

194
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,606
It tastes like heaven.

195
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,442
Seriously, it tastes so good.

196
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,034
I can't help but laugh.

197
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,706
Now that we're having food,
I'm reminded of something.

198
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,333
-You're a cook in the army, aren't you?
-A cook?

199
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,543
No?

200
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:49,463
You have the decisiveness
and the skin of a soldier.

201
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,133
You're considerate of others and…

202
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,385
-I see.
-And you're such a good cook.

203
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,804
Are you a cook in the army?

204
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,349
I'm running a business.

205
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,228
I'm running a health product brand.

206
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,191
I founded the company
during my junior year of college.

207
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,152
And I turned 28 this year.

208
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,323
I'm now running a health product brand.

209
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,366
Our main product is

210
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,952
wild-simulated ginseng from Pyeongchang.

211
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,205
We process it
and sell wild-simulated ginseng honey.

212
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,000
KIM JUN-SIK, 28,
CEO OF A HEALTH PRODUCT BRAND

213
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,168
That's really cool.

214
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,130
-I had no idea.
-We do research

215
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,423
on food and flavors

216
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,884
-because we make beverages.
-I see.

217
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,053
I do a lot of things.

218
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,095
Okay.

219
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,184
I'm a personal trainer
and a pilates instructor.

220
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,311
I also model on the side.

221
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,107
I was born in Busan,
and I've been living there since.

222
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,360
I'm 27.

223
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,824
I've been swimming since I was little.

224
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:03,746
I've been a personal trainer
for about six years

225
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,874
and a pilates instructor
for two years now.

226
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,251
AN YEA-WON, 27,
PILATES INSTRUCTOR, MODEL

227
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,961
-It suits her.
-It suits her.

228
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,757
You chose me today.

229
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,218
-Don't say that.
-Is there a specific reason?

230
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,639
Because you work out.

231
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:26,268
You're the only one
that I have something in common with.

232
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,645
I see.

233
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,146
You were like

234
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,232
a silver lining.

235
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,151
Seriously. A silver lining
on the deserted island.

236
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,903
-Really?
-Yes, really.

237
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,406
Cheers.

238
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,327
Yea-won kept choosing one person,

239
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,745
-and it worked.
-You're right.

240
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,080
I hope it works out.

241
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,039
I really do.

242
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,292
Time went by so slowly in Inferno.

243
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,294
But here, time flies.

244
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,882
In a nice place, with the person you like…

245
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,842
Time really flies.

246
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,635
…time flies because you're happy.

247
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,553
That's true.

248
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,846
PARADISE
SHIN JI-YEON AND OH JIN-TAEK

249
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,305
I haven't done this in a long time.

250
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:04,849
Really?

251
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,892
-Let me put it on you.
-Okay.

252
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,187
It's cold.

253
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,939
Hold on.

254
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,274
Your face is so small.

255
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,782
You look great in pink.

256
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,700
I do?

257
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,829
I guess I look good in pink.

258
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,124
I'm glad I brought the facial masks.

259
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,501
Thank you.

260
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,092
This is the second time we came here
and we came together.

261
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,804
Right. I had no idea I'd come here again.

262
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,347
Me neither.

263
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,016
-Seriously.
-I know, right?

264
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,686
And we were total strangers yesterday,

265
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,229
exchanging awkward hellos.

266
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,147
Right.

267
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,150
I had no idea we'd come here together.

268
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,111
This will be a good memory.

269
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,070
Right.

270
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,741
-Can I take this off now?
-I should take it off too.

271
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,784
I got distracted by our conversation.

272
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,870
I know. I'll take it off
and stay like this.

273
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,664
-Should I pat my face?
-Yes.

274
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,000
Your face is so glossy now.

275
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,921
-So how was it today?
-Today?

276
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,797
-It was fun.
-We spent time together.

277
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,633
It was fun.

278
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,634
Is that so?

279
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,261
-How about you?
-What?

280
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,514
-How about you?
-I had fun too.

281
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,849
-Come on. You're just saying what I said.
-What?

282
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,309
I really had fun.

283
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,521
When I first saw you,
I thought you may be a sweet person

284
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,440
unlike your manly appearance.

285
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,441
Really?

286
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,569
I just remembered what I wanted to say.

287
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,196
Was it yesterday?

288
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,199
We talked alone for a short while.

289
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,784
Did we talk yesterday?

290
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,826
Yes.

291
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,912
I guess you like wearing dresses.

292
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,331
This place makes me dress like this.

293
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,375
-I see.
-I don't usually dress like this.

294
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,961
-I see. You look great in the dress.
-Really? Thank you.

295
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,879
That kind of color and pattern

296
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,422
-doesn't suit anyone.
-You think?

297
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,051
-But you look very sophisticated in it.
-I see.

298
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,804
You're flattering me.

299
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,763
I mean it.

300
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,847
Really?

301
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,186
Right, I really enjoyed that conversation.

302
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,145
Oh, really?

303
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,605
-Though it was short.
-I see.

304
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,234
That's when I became more curious.

305
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,485
I see.

306
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,740
-That's what I wanted to say.
-I see.

307
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,994
-You should be more interested.
-Interested in you?

308
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,707
He seems very different
from when he's with So-yeon.

309
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,917
I think Jin-taek

310
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,919
-is naturally flirtatious.
-Right.

311
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,881
Some men can be awkward when they're faced

312
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,382
with something unexpected,

313
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,511
but he seems so comfortable
when he talks or makes jokes.

314
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,263
He doesn't seem awkward at all.

315
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,514
-It's just how he is.
-He seemed relaxed.

316
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,017
Exactly. And that's something
you're born with.

317
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,227
PARADISE
SONG JI-A AND CHOI SI-HUN

318
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,438
-Can you swim?
-Actually, I can't swim.

319
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,397
Me neither.

320
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,941
-Let's just walk around.
-Let's enjoy the night view.

321
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:01,942
Okay.

322
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,576
Nothing.

323
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,702
-What is it?
-What?

324
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,537
-What is it?
-You're so pretty.

325
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,043
Ji-a never avoids eye contact.

326
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,170
They look so cute together.

327
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,214
I mean, I can see he's really into her.

328
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:29,345
I've only imagined what it would be like.

329
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,013
-What? Coming here?
-Yes.

330
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,433
I thought it would be really interesting

331
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,060
if something like this happened,

332
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,980
and it happened so naturally.

333
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,148
Right.

334
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,903
I'm now wondering how I would feel

335
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,989
when I see Hyeon-joong tomorrow.

336
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,575
-I'm thinking about it.
-How was it today?

337
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,286
Today? Well, I only heard
about you from him, so…

338
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,579
-What did he say?
-What?

339
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,497
What did he say?

340
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,502
He said he felt like
you guys became really close.

341
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,712
-After we went together?
-Yes.

342
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,589
-I see.
-So I thought

343
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,343
I wouldn't have a chance.

344
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,930
I'm actually glad
that they changed the rule.

345
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,765
-If they hadn't…
-I was very surprised.

346
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,726
If they hadn't changed it,
you might have gone with him again.

347
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,064
I was so happy to hear
about the new rule today.

348
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,692
I thought something fun might happen.

349
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,653
I was really surprised
to hear the rule change too.

350
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,612
Yes.

351
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,742
What do you think you'll do
if a new guy shows up?

352
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,661
A really charming one.

353
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,037
-So charming.
-How charming?

354
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,249
-He's close to your ideal type.
-My ideal type?

355
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,251
Yes. Let's say he's nearly perfect to you.

356
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,877
Would that even be possible?

357
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,838
We never know.

358
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,964
Okay.

359
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,091
What if the same happens to you?

360
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,676
What?

361
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,847
I have never felt this way
about a woman in my life.

362
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,349
I wonder if there could be
anything better than this.

363
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,851
I see.

364
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,894
-Really? You like me that much?
-Yes.

365
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,689
-You probably don't want to go home then.
-No.

366
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,238
-He's so into her.
-This is just crazy, isn't it?

367
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,407
Gosh. Give him a break.

368
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,451
I can see Si-hun drooling already.

369
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,618
Tell me about it.

370
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,620
He's in trouble.

371
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,831
-She won't let him get it together.
-My.

372
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,000
I can't get it together either.

373
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:29,381
There's something about
the way she talks that fascinates us.

374
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,300
-She's so charming.
-She has the gaze.

375
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,093
-I can't even copy it.
-It's her gaze.

376
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,722
I think we can even make
a book out of everything she said.

377
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,766
-Seriously.
-Is she really that good?

378
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,396
We have the same menu today.

379
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,484
We have the same menu.

380
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,445
I guess this hotel's breakfast
never changes.

381
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,614
-I know this hotel very well.
-Right.

382
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,157
It's always the same.

383
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,785
Enjoy.

384
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,411
Thanks. Enjoy.

385
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,707
So-yeon, what's your plan today?

386
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,837
I decided to follow my heart.

387
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,004
I see.

388
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,048
-You'll go with your gut.
-Well…

389
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,217
Jin-taek said he really liked me.

390
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,301
-Right.
-Right.

391
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:01,723
-But I'm not that attracted to him.
-I see.

392
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,936
Still, I gave him a chance
because he likes me.

393
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:06,937
-I see.
-I see.

394
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,523
This doesn't mean I don't like Jin-taek.

395
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,567
Maybe I should talk to him when he's back.

396
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,278
-I'm not saying, "He's got no chance."
-Right.

397
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,863
-I totally get you.
-Okay.

398
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,407
Hyeon-joong and I talked a lot yesterday,

399
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,662
and I realized I might be
too obsessed with one person.

400
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,833
Then Hyeon-joong told me
that I was being short-sighted

401
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,919
and that I should try
to look at the bigger picture.

402
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,672
And I really appreciated his advice.

403
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,382
-Right!
-It was like a wake-up call.

404
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:39,720
Yesterday, I thought,
"This is such a cruel show."

405
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:44,141
But we have a lot of time,
so I think we should get to know everyone.

406
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,184
Right.

407
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,939
I think you're paying attention
only to one person too.

408
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,649
I'm just following my heart.

409
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,151
-Is that so?
-Yes.

410
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,153
But there are some people here

411
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,238
you haven't talked to yet.

412
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,074
-I think I'm trying.
-Really?

413
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,368
I'm doing my best. That's just how I am.

414
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,539
Can't you see that I'm trying?

415
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,208
-I can.
-Don't you think?

416
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,003
Well, you're putting most of
the effort into one person though.

417
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,259
-That was a great meal.
-It was a great meal.

418
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,427
How's this?

419
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,929
-I'll do this today.
-This?

420
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,263
-What's this?
-Hey.

421
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,681
GOD OF DECISION-MAKING

422
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,643
Today, I'll do
whatever this book tells me to.

423
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,602
Try it.

424
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,020
I'm serious.

425
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,360
-Read it out loud.
-Let me read it for you.

426
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,612
-Left.
-Left or right?

427
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,821
Left.

428
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,451
"Keep trying."

429
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,417
But you are to decide what to keep trying.

430
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,502
Right.

431
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,629
Just think about
our conversation last night.

432
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,881
Hey, this is kind of creepy.

433
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,050
"Keep trying"?

434
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,218
No!

435
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,512
No. Stop trying.

436
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,430
-This is unfair.
-Right. This is unfair.

437
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,431
No.

438
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,976
KEEP TRYING

439
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,020
Think about what you should keep trying.

440
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,816
You made a decision today,
so keep going in that direction.

441
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,775
Okay.

442
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,652
You changed your mind today.

443
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,493
-They're coming back.
-They're coming.

444
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,494
They're back.

445
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,495
All right.

446
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,789
I can't believe I'm back here.

447
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,748
Are you excited?

448
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,874
Hi!

449
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,668
Did you have fun?

450
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,087
-I really wanted to go with you.
-Me too.

451
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,631
-Did you have a good time?
-Yes. I missed you.

452
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,924
-Did you have fun?
-Yes. Thanks.

453
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,009
-Did you have fun?
-I did.

454
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,885
-Young blood.
-Give them a hug.

455
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,012
You're wearing pink.

456
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,847
-You look great in pink.
-It suits you.

457
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,808
I missed you.

458
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,020
-How was it? Did you swim?
-I missed you.

459
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,565
When we met the people
who came back from Paradise,

460
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,942
I couldn't look at Jin-taek in the eyes.

461
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,527
I didn't want us to feel awkward.

462
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:05,449
So I welcomed Yea-won
and tried not to look at him.

463
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,617
Yes, we swam.

464
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,078
-Did you guys have a good time?
-It was amazing.

465
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,621
You're going every day. I envy you.

466
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,248
Every day?

467
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,835
I can already see what he'll keep doing.

468
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,589
I wonder what you guys did.

469
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,091
-Me too. What did you do?
-Tell us what you did.

470
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,761
I was surprised to hear
about who matched with each other.

471
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,845
Me too!

472
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,180
I also didn't expect this.

473
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,724
We actually talked about it
on our way there.

474
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,518
Before Ji-yeon left,

475
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,729
I said I felt like Jin-taek and Ji-a

476
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,147
-would be a couple.
-Right.

477
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,356
Really?

478
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,610
-I'm really bad at picking up hints.
-I had no idea either.

479
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,112
Jin-taek is such a smooth talker.

480
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,781
-Really?
-A lot of memorable lines.

481
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,824
-Memorable lines?
-A lot of them?

482
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,286
We used facial masks together.

483
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,163
Really? Together? Alone?

484
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,623
-We sat on the sofa
-Together.

485
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,167
-and talked with the facial masks on.
-That's cute.

486
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,251
Looking at each other?

487
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,669
We looked like ghosts.

488
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,338
-That sounds nice.
-That's lovely.

489
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,381
-Skincare is important.
-Right.

490
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,305
I really don't know.

491
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,476
I thought you'd be matched with Ji-a.

492
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,770
Because you guys seemed to hit it off.

493
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,064
So I thought he would go with Ji-a,

494
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,733
and Ji-yeon would obviously go with him.

495
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,362
So I was thinking about what
I should make for dinner with the rest.

496
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,447
He really surprised us.

497
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,824
I was really surprised too.

498
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,534
-It was a big surprise.
-It was.

499
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,703
-I would've been shocked too.
-Did you have a change of heart?

500
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,541
I wouldn't say no.

501
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,794
So you're torn.

502
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,005
Well…

503
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,883
She was actually
more talkative than I thought.

504
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,051
Oh, really?

505
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,595
And her profession was also…

506
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,180
-Surprising?
-Surprising?

507
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,181
-It was.
-I knew it.

508
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,600
I wonder what you guys did.

509
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,018
I was thinking of what to do,

510
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,980
and I suggested
something good for body care.

511
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,982
-Body care?
-Did you get a massage?

512
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,403
It's a kind of massage.
We used facial masks.

513
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,445
I see.

514
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,534
-What did you do yesterday?
-Yesterday?

515
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,578
-We got to listen to how So-yeon felt.
-Yes.

516
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,955
We didn't get to have
a long conversation though.

517
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,082
-Because she wasn't feeling well.
-Oh, really?

518
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,000
Yes.

519
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,627
Ji-a, when did you
exchange signals with Si-hun?

520
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,545
-I know.
-I know.

521
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,423
Well, I didn't even
get to talk to him properly.

522
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,633
-It was just a hunch.
-I see.

523
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,260
-Was it your gaze again?
-So I didn't think I'd go.

524
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,430
-Was it your gaze again?
-But really, I had no idea.

525
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,141
-He said he was surprised too.
-Really?

526
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,851
Yes. He seemed really surprised.

527
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,395
-We were all surprised yesterday.
-Seriously.

528
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,064
-So interesting.
-We talked only on the first day.

529
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,733
We talked a bit while cooking.

530
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,236
-I never really talked to Jin-taek either.
-Exactly.

531
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,988
-How interesting.
-It really is.

532
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:50,947
Interesting, right?

533
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,950
What do you think?
Do you like him more now?

534
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,996
He was very different from what I thought.

535
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,165
He was different
from when he was with people.

536
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,335
-He had charisma, and he talked a lot.
-Oh, really?

537
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,628
-Like an older man?
-Right.

538
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,088
-He was a better leader than I thought.
-I see.

539
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,381
He was very proactive.

540
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,299
I see.

541
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:15,180
My mind has changed completely.

542
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,224
It has reset. Everything has changed.

543
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,726
Yesterday changed everything.
It changed everything.

544
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,354
-See? This happens.
-Does that mean you like her a lot?

545
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,480
Yesterday was amazing.

546
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,107
It changed everything.
It almost felt weird.

547
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,109
You two went with the same person,

548
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,738
but you seem to have
experienced different things.

549
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:35,659
-Even though the person is the same.
-I had this idea based on what I heard,

550
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,703
but what I saw was different
from what I heard.

551
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,665
That surprised me.

552
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,292
To me, she felt totally different
from what I heard.

553
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,671
-We all feel differently.
-Right.

554
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,464
We can get different impressions.

555
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,554
Looks like I'm the only one

556
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,348
-who didn't go to Paradise.
-I know.

557
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,683
This must be tough

558
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,102
for Se-hoon.

559
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,729
-Right. I was thinking the same.
-Right.

560
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,482
He asked me out for a walk yesterday,

561
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,733
so I knew he'd choose me.

562
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,068
I see. But you…

563
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,945
-Right.
-I see.

564
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,198
It seemed like Se-hoon gave it
a lot of thought

565
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,868
before he asked you out for a walk.

566
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,164
He might have gotten the impression
that you were interested in him too.

567
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,750
-While taking a walk.
-He may have felt that way.

568
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,793
Really?

569
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,547
But it would've been weird if she said no.

570
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,424
-I couldn't say no.
-Of course not.

571
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,384
If he wants to talk to me, he can talk.

572
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,720
But whether I choose him or not
is up to me.

573
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,054
It's up to you.

574
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,639
I understand.

575
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,474
This is why I was torn.

576
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,184
I felt bad for him.

577
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,481
So you're 100 percent sure
that you're not interested in him.

578
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,859
I wouldn't say that,

579
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,361
but when we're together…

580
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,865
-You don't feel any chemistry.
-Right. There's no chemistry.

581
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,326
There's no spark.

582
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,953
-When we talked at the brunch…
-You feel that right away.

583
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,497
If I felt some attraction at the brunch,

584
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,082
I would've been more interested.

585
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,377
-But we both didn't feel that way.
-You didn't feel anything.

586
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,255
So I thought, if I chose him

587
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,591
knowing that I'm not attracted to him yet,

588
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:19,262
-it wouldn't be nice to him.
-You have to at least feel something.

589
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,388
It can hurt him.

590
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,890
-That would be worse.
-Right.

591
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,145
She clearly knows
what she likes and what she doesn't.

592
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,023
She just said
she's not attracted to Se-hoon.

593
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:30,940
Right.

594
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,027
But the fortune-telling book said…

595
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,987
-It said…
-Oh, no.

596
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,364
-Keep trying.
-Keep trying.

597
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,573
Oh, no.

598
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,699
What a sad coincidence.

599
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,244
You see, the participants are sharing
the lodging with the same gender group.

600
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,581
I think it'll become chaotic soon.

601
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:51,544
There will be subtle mind games
within the same gender group

602
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,006
and power games from now on.
They'll start to splinter.

603
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,968
When Ji-yeon was just talking,
So-yeon seemed

604
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,220
-pretty upset.
-Right.

605
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:04,057
Wherever So-yeon goes,
Ji-yeon is in the way.

606
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,185
At first, Jin-taek said he liked So-yeon.

607
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,313
But then he went to Paradise
with Ji-yeon and had a great time.

608
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,817
-She's a bit interested in Se-hoon too,
-Right.

609
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,945
-but Se-hoon likes Ji-yeon so much.
-Exactly.

610
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,489
-Wherever So-yeon goes,
-Right.

611
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,615
Ji-yeon is in the way.

612
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,616
Which is sad.

613
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,535
She may be smiling now,

614
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,954
but they probably feel
somewhat uncomfortable.

615
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,622
It's the same with Si-hun.

616
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:31,084
He knows how Hyeon-joong feels about Ji-a,
but he said everything's changed

617
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,128
after spending time with her in Paradise.

618
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,212
He must've felt bad.

619
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,340
But I think it was a declaration of war.

620
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,135
-I thought the same.
-He said, "I'm falling for her."

621
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,344
"I like this woman."

622
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,763
He said that in front of everyone.

623
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,267
-And I think Hyeon-joong got the message.
-Right.

624
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,442
-Finally.
-I've been waiting for this moment.

625
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,862
Today in Inferno,
all participants will be given free time.

626
00:28:58,945 --> 00:28:59,821
Free time?

627
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,700
I hope you can all have nice dates

628
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,911
with the participants you like.

629
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:08,955
That's it?

630
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,417
I'm leaving.

631
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,002
I'm leaving first!

632
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,130
-What's happening?
-Where are you going?

633
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,965
Where are you all going? Wait up.

634
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,759
Oh, my.

635
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,344
Gosh, Se-hoon stood up
with so much confidence.

636
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,139
-Where are they going?
-This is war.

637
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,223
Let's go.

638
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,600
I'll be the first to go out.

639
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,851
Everyone, come out.

640
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,853
Call them one by one.

641
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,854
Free time?

642
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,694
Can I come in?

643
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,363
-Can I come in?
-Sure.

644
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,702
-Can we come in?
-Sure.

645
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,914
HYEON-JOONG GESTURES

646
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,669
-See you later.
-Where are you going?

647
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,340
That was fast.

648
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,223
Hello.

649
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,265
Hi.

650
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,230
Gosh, that place is wild.

651
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,732
I wonder what will happen.

652
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,860
-Did you have fun?
-How are you?

653
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,028
-Me?
-Did you have a good time?

654
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,988
-No.
-How was it?

655
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,281
-I…
-I was really curious.

656
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,699
-I shouted on the beach.
-Why?

657
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,159
-Because I left?
-Ji-a!

658
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,955
Did you have fun?

659
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,250
-There's so much I want to say.
-Really? To me?

660
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,376
Yes.

661
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,710
-Did you see Si-hun
-Si-hun…

662
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,087
leaving the lodging alone?

663
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,965
He went to Ji-a,
but she was taken by someone else.

664
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,717
-There's so much I want to say.
-Really? To me?

665
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,677
Yes.

666
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,159
-What is it you wanted to say?
-What?

667
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,203
-You said you had a lot to say.
-Right.

668
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,000
Looking at your eyes,
I forgot what it was.

669
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,626
What did you do yesterday?

670
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,211
We had dinner and…

671
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,131
-I heard you had Dom Pérignon.
-So you heard about it.

672
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,341
-I heard you didn't drink much.
-No, I didn't.

673
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,844
-So I said you usually don't eat much.
-I see.

674
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,348
I thought, if you stayed here with me,

675
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,893
-we would be able to talk a lot.
-Right.

676
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,478
-Here, you can have deeper conversations.
-I see.

677
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,147
-No one is watching.
-Is that so?

678
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,985
So I was left here, but there was no one
I wanted to have a deep conversation with.

679
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,904
-I had to think…
-I'm the only one, right?

680
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,864
Yes.

681
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,909
I wanted to take some time
to organize my thoughts,

682
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,160
so that was great.

683
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,373
To be honest,
I felt more comfortable yesterday.

684
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,627
When I was with you,
I felt a bit uncomfortable.

685
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:10,178
But hanging out with you was more fun.

686
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,767
Because you felt uncomfortable?

687
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,685
No, not because I felt uncomfortable.

688
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,979
It's just how I felt.

689
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,400
To be honest,

690
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,987
-I don't feel that comfortable around you.
-Right?

691
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,281
It means we're not that close yet.

692
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,240
Right.

693
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,243
But here's what I thought yesterday.

694
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,704
I'm not sure if this is because
I feel uncomfortable around you,

695
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,583
but I want to be with someone

696
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,419
-who is considerate of me.
-I see.

697
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,380
-But you weren't like that.
-Okay.

698
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,714
So I said to other guys

699
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,469
that I like you and that
you're close to my ideal type and all,

700
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:57,308
but I want to be with someone
who loves and cares about me.

701
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:01,604
So I decided to have
one more deep conversation with you

702
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,231
before I decide what to do.

703
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,650
-That's why I came to you right away.
-I see.

704
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,612
That's what you thought.

705
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,744
Okay. I'll be considerate.

706
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,044
Other girls seemed
to think the same about me.

707
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,921
-Think what?
-That I'm a one-woman man.

708
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,090
-So-yeon said that yesterday.
-Really?

709
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,174
Yes.

710
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:34,929
I think I'll only talk
and hang out with the person I like.

711
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,055
I'd rather…

712
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,890
Don't you want to try other options?

713
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,642
-I could, but…
-You never know.

714
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,437
I don't know.
I wouldn't make the first move.

715
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,862
-Come to me.
-What?

716
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,405
-I want you to come to me.
-Okay.

717
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,537
He must be so happy to hear that.

718
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,873
-Come to me.
-What?

719
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,124
I want you to come to me.

720
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,752
Okay. I did come to you.

721
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,878
I was waiting for you.

722
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,087
-It took me a lot of courage.
-If…

723
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,339
If you hadn't come,
I would've come to you.

724
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,972
I told you.

725
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,974
-Si-hun is coming.
-What?

726
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:20,933
Si-hun is coming.

727
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,904
I should get
some water ready for our guest.

728
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,620
I've been waiting
to give you some time to talk.

729
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,455
-Really?
-Yes.

730
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,667
I'll see you when you're done.

731
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,712
I'll be up there.

732
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,888
-Let me just drink some water.
-I can wait.

733
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,724
I'm good at waiting.

734
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,819
Is it hot now?

735
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:13,903
What?

736
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,738
-It's hot outside.
-Is it?

737
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,832
This is like a drama.

738
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,543
-Such a cliffhanger, right?
-Right.

739
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,253
This is amazing.

740
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,592
Why the sudden free time?

741
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,677
-I know.
-I know.

742
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,928
So you guys…

743
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,221
I even brought my shoes.

744
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,848
So-yeon, can we talk for a bit?

745
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,266
-Now?
-Yes.

746
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:44,934
I woke up.

747
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,978
I didn't want to wake you up.

748
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,488
Did you enjoy the date yesterday?

749
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,409
Yes, I had a good time.

750
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,827
I see.

751
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,831
How was your day yesterday?

752
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,667
I think I've been really tired.

753
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,626
Of course.

754
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,544
I got a good rest.

755
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,837
-Good.
-I slept a lot too.

756
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,838
Well done.

757
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,175
But it felt strange yesterday.

758
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,176
How did it feel?

759
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,469
Well…

760
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,514
I mean, you chose someone else
because that was the rule.

761
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,391
-Right.
-I knew that.

762
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,686
-But I know we aren't a couple either.
-Right.

763
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,690
And you said I was the only one
you'd like to go to the hotel with.

764
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,817
You said that to me.

765
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,986
Cheers.

766
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,113
Are you going to come here
with another girl?

767
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,283
I said I'm coming here only with you.

768
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,118
-Right.
-Exactly.

769
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,704
Right. It was definitely
a memorable comment.

770
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,748
So-yeon is very forthright.

771
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:52,126
We had no choice because of the rule.

772
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,003
That's just what happened.

773
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:54,921
Right.

774
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,088
It couldn't be helped.

775
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,050
I thought you'd feel
even more uncomfortable than I did.

776
00:36:59,133 --> 00:36:59,967
I see.

777
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,762
Because you were the one who said it

778
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,014
-so confidently.
-It almost looked like I lied.

779
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,892
Exactly. That's what I worried about.

780
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,061
I was worried

781
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,565
-you might feel bad about it.
-I see. Thanks for worrying about me.

782
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,524
Well.

783
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,653
-It must've been nice.
-Pardon?

784
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,737
You went to the hotel.

785
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,991
Well, that's not important.

786
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,204
-What did you like the most in the hotel?
-What?

787
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,206
-What did you like the most?
-In the hotel…

788
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,084
I ordered other dishes too.

789
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,088
But what we had was better.

790
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,260
-Do you feel guilty?
-What?

791
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,469
Do you feel guilty?

792
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,137
Well…

793
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,722
I don't think I feel guilty.

794
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,640
Okay.

795
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,685
I'm just getting to know others too.

796
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,814
I think what's important is
that I know what I want.

797
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,107
I see.

798
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,150
That's what I think.

799
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,610
-I see.
-Yes.

800
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,321
You said earlier
that you liked tall women.

801
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,491
So I said, "Ji-yeon is tall too."

802
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,243
Then you said, "Is Ji-yeon tall?"

803
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,787
-"I didn't know."
-I didn't know until you told me.

804
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,082
Was that the reason
you chose her after me?

805
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,418
Did you want to get to know her?

806
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,379
Well, her height is one thing.

807
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,049
But she was the one
I was interested in most, out of the rest.

808
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,342
Okay.

809
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,219
I see.

810
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,391
-I see.
-Yes.

811
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,730
-He's become somewhat colder.
-Something has changed.

812
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,275
-Right.
-Jin-taek used to care about So-yeon only.

813
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,693
The Jin-taek we used to know…

814
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,321
The Jin-taek that we used to love
is gone now.

815
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,282
And most importantly,
he's avoiding eye contact.

816
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,284
He avoids eye contact
while talking to her.

817
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,370
He's not the old Jin-taek anymore.
He doesn't look so hungry.

818
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:56,459
Now, So-yeon seems more upset,
talking about her disappointments.

819
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,544
On the other hand,
Jin-taek is being vague.

820
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,547
And he's leaning too far back right now.

821
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,093
This is a cruel place.

822
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,520
Although it's a cruel place,
there's some warmth too.

823
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,730
What warmth?

824
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,899
We're warm right now.

825
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,532
-I'm sleepy.
-Are you sleepy?

826
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,826
Yes, I'm sleepy and tired.

827
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,954
Did you have fun yesterday too?

828
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,249
-I had fun.
-Did you enjoy makgeolli?

829
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,251
I got drunk after one glass of makgeolli.

830
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,504
-Really?
-I almost passed out.

831
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,755
Can I sit here?

832
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:43,839
Sure. Sit.

833
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,142
I'm sleepy.

834
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,484
I'll help you with the tanning oil.

835
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,820
-You should get some rest.
-Wait…

836
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,025
What happened to me yesterday was unreal…

837
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,486
to me.

838
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,365
Anyway, to me, everything is over

839
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,701
since yesterday.

840
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,202
I'm done organizing.

841
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,329
-Organizing your thoughts and feelings?
-Yes.

842
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:01,167
So I didn't really feel
like talking to others.

843
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,169
-I see.
-So I was just waiting.

844
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,170
Where were you?

845
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,171
Out there.

846
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,881
Out there? It's so hot outside.

847
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,300
You've been waiting?

848
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,385
I'm good at waiting.

849
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,554
-I'm good at waiting.
-What?

850
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,805
I'm good at waiting.

851
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,435
-Do you want to go see the ocean?
-Yes, I'd love to.

852
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,689
-Do you want to sit?
-Okay.

853
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,733
-Isn't this place just perfect?
-It is.

854
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,942
Then I'll sit here.

855
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,069
I'm curious now.

856
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,529
-About what?
-Well…

857
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:35,910
This is our fourth day here,

858
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,913
and I'd like to know what's going on.

859
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,166
-You mean, you want to know what I think?
-Yes.

860
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,461
I mean, you went on a date
with both Hyeon-joong and me.

861
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:50,174
But didn't we talk quite a lot yesterday?

862
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,717
-We did.
-Yes, we did.

863
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,137
But I didn't get to talk much
with Hyeon-joong that day.

864
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,141
I got a bit drunk,
and we didn't have much time.

865
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,309
I see.

866
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,103
So I think I should talk
with him some more first.

867
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,609
Okay.

868
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,736
I'm okay with that.

869
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,074
You're a man.

870
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,158
I don't care.

871
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,120
I'll give you guys some time.

872
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,331
Go and talk to him.

873
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,959
He's waiting because we're talking here.

874
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,336
Have a nice talk.
Wait here. I'll go and call him.

875
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,504
Okay.

876
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,421
All right.

877
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,173
-Rest here.
-Okay.

878
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,850
How did it go?

879
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,936
It went well.

880
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:48,816
Hyeon-joong gave me
some time to talk to her,

881
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,610
so I got to talk to her for a short while.

882
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,737
We need to play fair.

883
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,449
At least you can play the game.

884
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:00,953
What do you mean?

885
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,083
-I feel like there's a ball,
-Yes.

886
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,669
but there's no opponent.

887
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,382
-There's no goal post either.
-Really?

888
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,300
Yes.

889
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,603
I can't watch this.

890
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,480
He feels like he's playing soccer alone.

891
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,024
He's got nothing but a ball.

892
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,694
I remember Se-hoon was
such a cheerful man on the first day.

893
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,821
Well, she even said she was sleepy.

894
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,198
I think he decided to stop trying.

895
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,577
They're now isolated from the outer world

896
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,579
and asked to date only.

897
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,914
And I think that's rushing people.

898
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,960
The circumstances make it easier
for them to develop feelings.

899
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,672
-Right.
-I think Si-hun is really brave.

900
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,425
It's not about who chose Ji-a first.

901
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,886
Right now, Ji-a seems
more interested in Hyeon-joong.

902
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:03,098
But he wouldn't give up
and he said, "I'm good at waiting."

903
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,267
-Right. I found it charming.
-It's so cool.

904
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,311
-I almost felt like crying
-Right.

905
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,771
when he said he could wait.

906
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:13,317
Personally, because of this,
I find Si-hun much more charming now.

907
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,110
That was charming indeed.

908
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,112
And I find Jin-taek much less charming.

909
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,657
-Don't even get me started.
-You were his number one fan.

910
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,743
I had no idea he'd be so fickle.

911
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,999
Are you going for a swim, Ji-a?

912
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,752
-No, I'm not swimming.
-No?

913
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,253
I'm just going to watch him.

914
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,184
-Is he following them?
-Seriously?

915
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,019
He'll probably watch from a distance.

916
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,948
-Looks like Si-hun really likes you.
-Why?

917
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,074
He keeps waiting.

918
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,867
But I've been waiting too.

919
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,042
I'm confused now.

920
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,001
Even more?

921
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,213
If Jin-taek was

922
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,049
really interested in me,

923
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:24,096
he would've chosen someone
who would definitely not choose him back.

924
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,889
Isn't that why he chose Ji-yeon?

925
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:26,807
No.

926
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,560
He said he likes tall women.

927
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,812
I see.

928
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:37,568
-Because she's the second tallest.
-Ji-yeon is the second tallest.

929
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,237
I chose Se-hoon because I knew
he wouldn't choose me back.

930
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,991
I knew I wouldn't go
to Paradise with Se-hoon.

931
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,993
-That's why I was left here.
-I see.

932
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,453
-But he chose someone
-He chose

933
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,706
-who might choose him back.
-someone who might choose him back.

934
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:54,334
So I feel like he may not be
compatible with me.

935
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,586
Right.

936
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,796
What would you do if you were me?

937
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,551
Who do you think is a better match for me?

938
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,262
-You mean, in general?
-Between Jin-taek and Se-hoon.

939
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:09,016
Jin-taek looks like a better match
for you, appearance-wise.

940
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,018
Do we look good together? I'm not sure.

941
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,853
Well…

942
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:17,191
Se-hoon said he likes the
type of woman who takes the initiative.

943
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,402
And in a way, he was refused twice.

944
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:25,115
I think this is
the moment he can be swayed.

945
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,410
I think if you use this opportunity well,

946
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,287
you'll have a chance.

947
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,082
She's grasping the whole picture.

948
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,375
-She's a strategist.
-Gosh.

949
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,836
-And she's been acting so innocent.
-Gosh.

950
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,757
The ocean.

951
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,967
-Finally.
-We can finally play in the water.

952
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:44,927
I know.

953
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,721
Push me.

954
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,063
Look at him having fun,
without knowing how So-yeon feels.

955
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,651
So-yeon and Yea-won are coming.

956
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,239
Come on and try. I'll hold you. Get on.

957
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,158
-Move to the back.
-There you go.

958
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,576
-So it will float.
-It works!

959
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,994
Good. Let's go.

960
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,079
Let's go.

961
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,622
Let's go to Paradise!

962
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,623
Bye.

963
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,250
Don't even hint at Paradise.

964
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,970
Se-hoon, can we talk?

965
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:28,887
Sure.

966
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,228
-Shall we go to the cafeteria?
-Let's go there.

967
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,271
Okay.

968
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,652
Did you get to talk to many people today?

969
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,238
-Well, I talked to everyone.
-Everyone?

970
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:49,825
Not today alone though.
Today, I talked with Ji-yeon and…

971
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:57,708
You see, I think
the game will be changing soon.

972
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,084
I bet new people will come.

973
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,211
Possibly.

974
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,214
So take it slow
and look at the big picture.

975
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,843
I'm trying. I really am.

976
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:12,014
I'm trying to do that,

977
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,515
but the thing is…

978
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,852
-I know you still have feelings for her.
-I just have never

979
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:23,525
been rejected by someone like this before.

980
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,363
I mean, if you're like,

981
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:32,784
"It's Ji-yeon or no one. Whatever happens,
I won't regret my choice,"

982
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,953
that's really cool.

983
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,371
No, I'm not like that.

984
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,541
But Ji-yeon keeps rejecting you.

985
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,793
But you keep trying.

986
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,797
-But I'm not like that.
-And I think you might be

987
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,674
making her feel uncomfortable.

988
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,387
Actually…

989
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,851
I actually hate doing this to others.

990
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,019
Okay.

991
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,776
Well, I just don't want you to be hurt.

992
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:11,615
You seemed to have recovered yesterday,
but until we made fried rice for dinner,

993
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:15,077
you seemed so crushed.

994
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,662
Did it look that bad?

995
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,788
Yes.

996
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:18,997
Really?

997
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,792
And that's why I wanted to talk to you.

998
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,671
I thought, at this rate,
the same thing will happen again.

999
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:29,383
So you're kind of giving me advice.

1000
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,425
I'm just worried.

1001
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,343
Right.

1002
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,557
Is there anything you want
to know about me?

1003
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,854
-About you?
-Yes.

1004
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,654
Well, at first, I didn't know
what kind of person you were.

1005
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,282
And to be honest, at first,

1006
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,619
I thought you were interested in me.

1007
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,330
-Interested in you?
-On the first day.

1008
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,874
-On the first day?
-Yes. And here are the reasons.

1009
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,711
You put the apron on me.

1010
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,337
EVENING OF DAY 1

1011
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,296
Nice.

1012
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,006
Let me see.

1013
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,966
Much better.

1014
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,300
-You think?
-A lot better.

1015
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,468
Thank you.

1016
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,472
And we made fried rice together.

1017
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,640
Right.

1018
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,475
-He's good.
-Nice.

1019
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:26,857
-That's why I feel bad for you.
-I'll be honest with you.

1020
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,610
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say this,
but I chose you on the first day.

1021
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,571
"The best fried rice ever." That was me.

1022
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,825
Maybe I'm not allowed to say this but

1023
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,077
it was me who wrote that.

1024
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,251
Seriously, I wrote that.

1025
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:49,921
It was our first day,
so I thought I should write

1026
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:53,550
to the person that seemed
the most interesting.

1027
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,219
"I saw you enjoy the food today."

1028
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,808
-"I find that side of you charming."
-Yes.

1029
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,477
I SAW YOU WORK HARD
AND ENJOY THE FOOD TODAY

1030
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,562
I FIND THAT HUMAN SIDE OF YOU CHARMING
LET'S MAKE GOOD MEMORIES

1031
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,818
-"Let's make good memories together."
-Yes.

1032
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,403
Okay.

1033
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,156
Okay.

1034
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,499
But you haven't made any move since.
At least that's how I felt.

1035
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:29,294
Right. We haven't really hung out
since that night.

1036
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:32,881
On the other hand, you and Jin-taek
spent time together until lunchtime.

1037
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,925
-Jin-taek came to me in the lodging.
-Right.

1038
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,094
And I thought,
"Wait. I'm not that into her yet."

1039
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,681
-I see.
-I thought I wasn't that into you yet.

1040
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,684
Well, here's my point.

1041
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,938
So Jin-taek was flirting with me,

1042
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,983
but you've been obsessed
with Ji-yeon since that day.

1043
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:56,446
And you started
to pay full attention to her.

1044
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,989
-Right.
-So I thought,

1045
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,325
"I hope it goes well."

1046
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,537
I wished things would work out
between you and Ji-yeon.

1047
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,538
So…

1048
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,666
to tell you the truth,

1049
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,460
I feel like I'm looking at you

1050
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,255
the way you're looking at Ji-yeon.

1051
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,133
-Really?
-Really?

1052
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,261
So that's how she's been feeling.

1053
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,179
She's being really honest.

1054
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,307
I feel like I'm looking at you

1055
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,018
the way you're looking at Ji-yeon.

1056
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,483
I had no idea.

1057
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,194
Seriously. I…

1058
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:40,365
I didn't catch the hint at all.

1059
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:45,453
I see. Anyway, that's why
I got confused last night.

1060
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,371
I see.

1061
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:50,375
Jin-taek went to Paradise with another
girl because the situation had changed,

1062
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,627
not because he didn't like me.

1063
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,714
But it made me think a lot.

1064
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:59,259
I want to be happy,
and I want to spend time

1065
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,344
with someone I truly want to be with.

1066
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,429
Of course.

1067
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,347
-Even for a short while.
-Right.

1068
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:08,476
And you're the first person
I wanted to make an effort to talk with.

1069
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,645
So, yes.

1070
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,732
That's what happened.

1071
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,573
Funny, isn't it?

1072
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,699
It is.

1073
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,160
This is so interesting.

1074
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,497
-Shall we go now?
-Shall we?

1075
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,255
Anyway, I appreciate your courage.

1076
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,267
Until now, Ji-yeon was
the only person in Se-hoon's head.

1077
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,268
-Right.
-Right.

1078
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,355
Then suddenly So-yeon showed up.

1079
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,482
When they were together
in Inferno yesterday,

1080
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,150
-nothing happened.
-Right.

1081
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,653
And now, something new has begun.

1082
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:03,198
-There's something that bothers me though.
-Yes.

1083
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:07,160
Before she saw Jin-taek had changed…

1084
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:08,370
You mean she should have

1085
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,789
-said this yesterday.
-If she had said it yesterday,

1086
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,249
it would've sounded more truthful.

1087
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,501
You mean, last night.

1088
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:18,129
Right. I mean, she's doing that

1089
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,674
after seeing Jin-taek's change.

1090
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:26,513
I'm not sure what she's thinking yet.
That's what I think.

1091
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:31,893
But it's true that So-yeon was
not interested in Jin-taek at first.

1092
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,937
-Right.
-She was just a little swayed

1093
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,648
because Jin-taek was
hitting on her so aggressively.

1094
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,109
-At first, she was interested in Se-hoon.
-Right.

1095
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,111
-That's true.
-And that probably means

1096
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,238
this was how she was feeling
from the start.

1097
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,948
I know this is how she truly feels.

1098
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,449
But she could've said this

1099
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,785
-a little earlier.
-She could've timed it better.

1100
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,620
This is hard.

1101
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,301
I see someone.

1102
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:06,761
What?

1103
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,388
-A woman is coming?
-It's a woman.

1104
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,723
My gosh.

1105
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,224
Do we have a newcomer?

1106
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,854
-Is someone there?
-Someone is there.

1107
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,605
-A new female participant?
-Really?

1108
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,274
There were more men than women.

1109
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,402
-I saw someone in white.
-Me too.

1110
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:26,072
-What?
-Someone is there.

1111
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,199
-What?
-What's happening?

1112
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,325
-There's more?
-What's going on?

1113
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,785
It's a man.

1114
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,164
-My gosh.
-Oh, my.

1115
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,916
-What's happening?
-Gosh. We have new faces.

1116
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,962
-She looks pretty.
-She's really pretty.

1117
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,380
This is amazing.

1118
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,007
-I didn't see this coming.
-What's going on?

1119
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,551
-What's going on?
-This isn't fair.

1120
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,803
I've completely changed.

1121
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,265
He was really sexy.

1122
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:55,393
Looks like there will be new couples.

1123
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,562
I don't know how I feel yet.

1124
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:58,855
Well, I can't stop you.

1125
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,690
Now, I'm starting to get annoyed.

1126
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,109
She's so cute. I didn't expect this.

1127
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,487
-I feel like she'll choose Se-hoon.
-I bet he will get two votes.

1128
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,448
This might be my first
and only chance to go to Paradise.

1129
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,700
Did you give it some thought?
Do you need more time?

1130
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,745
Well, let me tell you what I think.

1131
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:14,788
Okay.

1132
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:48,822
