1
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,103
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,106
INFERNO

3
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,029
Have you decided
between Min-woo and Min-kyu?

4
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,531
No, not yet.

5
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:34,200
I see.
They're really different, aren't they?

6
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,454
I don't think
I'll be able to decide until the end.

7
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,124
I think Min-woo is cute.

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,043
-He is.
-Right?

9
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,545
-He really is.
-Yes, he's like a puppy.

10
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,629
-Right.
-Totally.

11
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,631
Have you talked to Min-woo?

12
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,300
No, I haven't.

13
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,217
I see.

14
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,011
You should talk to him.

15
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,264
I think you should before it's too late.

16
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,434
What did he do yesterday?

17
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,602
-Min-woo?
-What did he do?

18
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,561
We all hung out.

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,813
And we confided in each other.

20
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:09,444
Remember how Min-woo
was originally interested in Si-eun?

21
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,113
But when he went to Paradise with you,

22
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,909
he said he felt nervous
but good at the same time.

23
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:20,080
But with Si-eun,
I think he just feels comfortable.

24
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,878
This must be hard for Si-eun too.

25
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,338
-Si-eun?
-Yes.

26
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,965
It's obvious who she'll pick.

27
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,509
Min-woo?

28
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,262
What? No, Won-ik.

29
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,099
HANHAE, KIM JIN-YOUNG, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

30
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,352
-She's got it totally wrong.
-She's completely clueless.

31
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,313
-I guess it's not that obvious for her.
-I know, right?

32
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,608
Gyu-ri needs to venture out
and be more aware of what's happening.

33
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,485
Maybe she's trying to avoid the sun.

34
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,988
What? No, Won-ik.

35
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,449
-Really?
-There's nothing with Min-woo.

36
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,035
I think Si-eun will choose Min-woo.

37
00:01:59,119 --> 00:01:59,994
What?

38
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,706
But they haven't been to Paradise,
nor can they go anymore.

39
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,501
You need to have gone
to Paradise with someone

40
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,586
to be sure enough to choose them.

41
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,921
-Right.
-Don't you think?

42
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:15,135
I think they're yearning
to get to know each other a bit better.

43
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:19,722
And the fact that she's still not sure
after having talked to Won-ik so much…

44
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,393
Right, but I'm not certain
about Min-kyu either.

45
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,937
I'm not even sure of Min-woo.

46
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,814
Maybe you're right.

47
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,483
I bet it's hard for everyone.

48
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,819
I wonder what'll happen.

49
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,532
-She has it entirely wrong.
-They're practically in Paradise.

50
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,493
I didn't know what to think
when she said Won-ik's name.

51
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,163
-Won-ik's name keeps popping up.
-Right?

52
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,373
-But he's only mentioned in passing.
-I know.

53
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,457
I feel bad.

54
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,502
It seems that Gyu-ri is clueless
about what's going on.

55
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,256
But it'll become obvious to her
now that they're in Inferno.

56
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,465
I'm curious to see

57
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,509
-how her expression will change.
-Right.

58
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:01,890
All of a sudden, she might find Min-woo
looking all happy with Si-eun.

59
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,266
She'll be shocked.

60
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,310
-Right.
-She might start noticing things.

61
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,477
I think she will.

62
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,980
Let's take a picture here.

63
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,023
That sounds great.

64
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,483
The tide is quite high right now.

65
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,610
It's beautiful.

66
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,071
-We're finally taking pictures.
-Yes.

67
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,865
-You're still here.
-What?

68
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,327
-You didn't go to Paradise.
-I told you that I wouldn't go.

69
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,122
He's acting like it was his choice.

70
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,124
Someone has to pick you.

71
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,420
I think he's trying to tell her
that he couldn't go.

72
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,424
-It was pretentious but cute.
-Yes.

73
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,886
I told you that I wouldn't go.

74
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,389
-You could've gone.
-What?

75
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,183
-You could've gone.
-Grab onto me.

76
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,314
-This is amazing. It's pretty.
-How about a group photo?

77
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,817
Would you like to take a picture
with Min-young?

78
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,653
Come on, ex-wife.

79
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,695
"Ex-wife"?

80
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,572
-Gosh, ex-wife…
-My bad.

81
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,824
Put on a good face, you two.

82
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,326
-A good face?
-Look at me.

83
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,703
One, two, three.

84
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,584
Can we take a selfie with this?

85
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,586
-Gosh, that's…
-What's that?

86
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,921
I accidentally took this.

87
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,548
Really? But it came out well.

88
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,050
-I guess it did.
-Yes.

89
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,636
-She's listening!
-She's listening in.

90
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,637
She totally is.

91
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,763
Now she knows.

92
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,182
-She wasn't even looking at the picture.
-Right.

93
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,603
Who's up next?
How about Min-woo and Si-eun?

94
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,063
We can all take turns.

95
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,607
-Yes, let's take turns taking photos.
-Okay.

96
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,447
Is anyone good at taking pictures?

97
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,615
I'm not very good.

98
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,496
-I'll stand in front.
-Okay.

99
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,124
It could come out well.

100
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,917
One, two, three.

101
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,841
Gyu-ri is taking a picture for them?

102
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,136
-Inferno is so much fun.
-This is just…

103
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,389
I hope it came out well.
We even held our breath.

104
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,391
What's wrong with this picture?

105
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,184
-We clenched our jaws.
-Right?

106
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,314
I'm really happy today.

107
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,359
I don't want this time in Inferno to end.

108
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,572
How about some fireworks?

109
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,614
-Sure.
-Sounds great.

110
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,491
We're doing lots of new things here.

111
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,702
-Isn't this better than Paradise?
-What?

112
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,871
-Isn't this better than Paradise?
-Of course.

113
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,374
-Want my hand?
-Yes.

114
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,298
You're supposed to stick this
in the ground and light it, right?

115
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,509
-Hey, I got it in.
-How did you do it?

116
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,261
Shall I stick a few in here?

117
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,387
-Yes.
-Go ahead.

118
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,724
Hey, get out of the way.

119
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,851
There. Wait a second.

120
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,102
-Gosh!
-That scared me!

121
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,854
It's so pretty!

122
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,650
-They're always together.
-Yes.

123
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,611
-Si-eun won't leave his side.
-Right.

124
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,446
It's so pretty!

125
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,867
It's really pretty.

126
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,161
Quick! Get out of the way!

127
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,162
I'm scared.

128
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,045
Gyu-ri's keeping her distance.

129
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:19,962
-Yes.
-Right.

130
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,507
-I'm sure she feels it now.
-Exactly.

131
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,258
She's thinking, "I got it wrong."

132
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,219
-Gosh.
-It's beautiful.

133
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,847
Wow, it's so pretty.

134
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,185
It's so beautiful.

135
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,648
It's really pretty.

136
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,150
-Si-eun is checking on them.
-She glanced at them.

137
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,153
Si-eun isn't paying attention
to the fireworks.

138
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,279
-No, she isn't.
-Right.

139
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,198
Her eyes are glowering, though.

140
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,993
It's really pretty.

141
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,955
-We need a picture of this.
-I know, right?

142
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,336
-Here.
-Thanks.

143
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,892
This is just too pretty!

144
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,148
Why are you so quiet?

145
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm not feeling that well.

146
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:28,322
I also think I need some time
to think things over.

147
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,323
I see.

148
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,367
-Starting today…
-Yes?

149
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,538
I think I need to talk to Min-woo today.

150
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,956
Then how about right now?

151
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,333
But I'm not sure what to do first.

152
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,919
-I don't know if I should talk to him
-Okay.

153
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,839
or take some time
to figure out what I want.

154
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,090
I see.

155
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,676
-I'm not feeling well.
-Okay.

156
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,179
-And you have a lot on your mind.
-Yes, I do.

157
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,096
Right.

158
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,226
-Min-woo, are you going to shower now?
-No.

159
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,605
-Do you want to talk to her first?
-Do you want to?

160
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,356
-Well…
-I don't mind if you do.

161
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,649
It doesn't matter to me.

162
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,026
You can go first.

163
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,153
-Okay, I'll go first, then.
-All right.

164
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,367
Yes?

165
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,665
What are you up to? Do you want to talk?

166
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,626
Sure.

167
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,842
These two aren't meant to be.

168
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,387
Did you have fun watching the fireworks?

169
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,597
I did.

170
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,768
It's been a really long time
since I've set off fireworks like that.

171
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,394
It was fun.

172
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,774
-Oh, no.
-Goodness.

173
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,651
-Her expression…
-Look at her face.

174
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,153
Si-eun is making herself very clear.

175
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,404
-She really is.
-Right.

176
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,074
-She isn't giving him a chance.
-That's pretty cool.

177
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,078
Are you cold?

178
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,872
-I'm covered up, so I'm fine.
-Okay.

179
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,715
To be honest, when I opened the door,

180
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,969
I thought it'd be Min-woo, not Won-ik.

181
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,596
I really wanted to talk to Min-woo,

182
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,642
but when I found out it wasn't him,
I couldn't focus on our conversation.

183
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,437
I think I just wanted to leave
as quickly as possible.

184
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,566
What are you up to?

185
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,401
What?

186
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,987
-Me?
-Yes.

187
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
I'm on my way back to my room.

188
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,741
-Let's talk inside.
-Okay.

189
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,371
Can I use your blanket?

190
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,330
Yes.

191
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,458
What's going on? What's wrong?

192
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,296
I thought I was okay, but…

193
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,674
You know how it is.

194
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,054
When all of your stress piles up

195
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,558
until it affects you physically…

196
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,977
You're not feeling well, are you?

197
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,855
No. I'm okay now.

198
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,065
No, you're not your usual self.

199
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,901
I'm a little startled.

200
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,781
I'm hoping things will be better tomorrow.

201
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,871
Say something.

202
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,788
What?

203
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,208
What do you want to hear?

204
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,337
Tell me what you've been up to in Inferno.

205
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,048
Did you behave yourself?

206
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,799
YESTERDAY

207
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,845
I really had a great time
chatting with you in Paradise.

208
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,849
You've been on my mind ever since,
so I wanted to talk to you.

209
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,603
The Paradise I went to with you
was the most fun.

210
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,565
So I'm going to be more honest
about my feelings now.

211
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,945
If I end up going, stay put and lie low.

212
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,408
Of course I will. We're all stuck here.
We'll probably just eat.

213
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,869
Don't do anything funny.

214
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,871
If you end up going?

215
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,667
That was yesterday.

216
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,046
-She told him to stay put.
-Yes.

217
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,715
But things didn't go her way.

218
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,550
He didn't listen to her.

219
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,428
Did you behave yourself?

220
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,138
What?

221
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,142
Did you stay put and lie low as I said?

222
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,691
A lot went through my mind yesterday.

223
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,820
To be honest, I didn't know how you felt.

224
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:42,243
It was hard to know
what you were thinking about me.

225
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,036
I mean, Paradise was fun.

226
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,999
But I really couldn't figure out
how you felt about me.

227
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,295
-So?
-So then…

228
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,340
As I told you before,

229
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,342
I wanted to get to know Si-eun better.

230
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,055
Have you talked to her, then?

231
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,849
I did today.

232
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,439
We talked.

233
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,322
You're just staring at me.
Why won't you say anything?

234
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,117
Then what?

235
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,163
What was it like talking to Si-eun?

236
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,375
Si-eun was pretty open and engaging,

237
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:37,256
and I saw a different side to her
while talking with her.

238
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:39,925
Today?

239
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,678
She's surprised.

240
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,805
Today?

241
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,557
We talked before,

242
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,978
but I was able to make my decision today.

243
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,650
I told you to stay put,
but it looks like you didn't.

244
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,615
I don't like guys

245
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,118
who don't listen to me,

246
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,121
-Min-woo.
-What?

247
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,624
What do you mean?

248
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,959
I told you not to do anything funny.

249
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,880
Why do you think I said that?

250
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,469
I know. I remember you telling me that.

251
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,097
So why didn't you listen?

252
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,186
I think our timing has been off a lot.

253
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,771
What are you talking about?

254
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,649
I said that so our timing wouldn't be off.

255
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,528
It's why I told you to stay put
for one day.

256
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,366
Is she scolding him?

257
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,034
Maybe it's because she's older.

258
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,954
-She's interrogating him.
-It's as if she's his teacher.

259
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,581
-"I don't like guys who don't listen."
-"Min-woo."

260
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,291
It's as if he's getting scolded.

261
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,586
-She sounds like a teacher.
-"Min-woo, I told you to behave."

262
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,004
It's a little scary.

263
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,466
It's why I told you to stay put
for one day.

264
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,637
This is your fault.

265
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,477
Right?

266
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,025
My fault?

267
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,365
You should've been more straightforward.

268
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,959
-Are you getting annoyed with me?
-No.

269
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,043
Seriously?

270
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:39,879
Hey.

271
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,756
You're unbelievable.

272
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,928
Anyways…

273
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,181
Anyways what?

274
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,601
-I just…
-You just what?

275
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,811
-What is it?
-Don't laugh.

276
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,979
Oh, okay.

277
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,940
I'm leaning more towards Si-eun.

278
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,525
-What?
-I'm leaning towards her.

279
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,654
Why do you keep laughing?

280
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,619
-She's flabbergasted.
-She is.

281
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,870
"You're unbelievable."

282
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,413
He sounded surprisingly firm.

283
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,497
-Right.
-Yes.

284
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,044
When I realized you were

285
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,256
weighing your options between me and her,

286
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,468
it was a turnoff.

287
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,137
A turnoff?

288
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,057
You think I was weighing my options?

289
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,808
Yes. Well, I mean…

290
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,895
When you said
you were leaning towards her…

291
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,356
If that's how you feel…

292
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,776
If you're leaning towards Si-eun,

293
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,527
then just go.

294
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,868
I wasn't weighing my options.

295
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,536
Really? Then what was it?

296
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,622
It's just a turnoff for me.

297
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,585
But wasn't Gyu-ri doing the same thing?

298
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,254
-I mean, with Min-kyu and Min-woo.
-Right.

299
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,883
-Yes, technically speaking.
-She said she was torn between them.

300
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,636
I mean, why are you…

301
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,429
I don't know anymore.

302
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,641
It's my fault for not being clear.

303
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,936
But I wasn't weighing my options.

304
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,521
Well, I mean…

305
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,690
How should I put this?

306
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,819
Just take me out of the equation.

307
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,991
Count me out.

308
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,243
When I'm the only one

309
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,997
you're interested in,
then you can say you like me.

310
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,126
But if you're torn between two people,
it means you don't like me.

311
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,669
So…

312
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,048
I don't want to be with someone like that.

313
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,551
Take care, then.

314
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,014
-I'm kind of scared.
-Me too.

315
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,181
"Take care, then."

316
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,852
What…

317
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:06,483
If you had just told me about how…

318
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,028
About how you felt about me…

319
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,696
Hold on.

320
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,698
Are you kidding me?

321
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,659
Did you expect me
to lay everything out for you?

322
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,495
You could've said something.

323
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,833
Did you expect me
to tell you that I like you?

324
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,210
That I have feelings for you?

325
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,547
That I keep thinking about you?

326
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,469
When I talked to you,

327
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:39,266
I didn't really get the feeling
that you liked me. That's why.

328
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,185
So while you were gone,

329
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:45,147
I talked to Si-eun
because I was curious about her.

330
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,817
-She was really straightforward,
-Okay.

331
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,403
and I felt that we meshed well.

332
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,239
The more we talked,
I felt differently about her.

333
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,160
-And then with you--
-You're a bit like Gwan-hee, aren't you?

334
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,745
What?

335
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,581
Oh, my.

336
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,876
You're a bit like Gwan-hee, aren't you?

337
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,504
How so?

338
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,757
Based on what you just said,

339
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,219
it seems like
you became interested in Si-eun

340
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,929
because she approached you first.

341
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,223
But that sounds like…

342
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,474
That's not it.

343
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,603
-That's not the only reason why.
-Okay.

344
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,564
When I first talked to Si-eun,

345
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,360
I thought I felt comfortable with her
because I thought of her as a friend.

346
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,072
But after talking to her,
I started to feel differently.

347
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,242
You weren't there,
so I don't expect you to understand me.

348
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,789
But I liked how clear she was
about her feelings for me.

349
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,458
-I see.
-And we meshed pretty well.

350
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,711
He expressed his interest in me,

351
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,506
but during the short time I was away,

352
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,927
he had a change of heart.

353
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,973
I found it ridiculous
that he couldn't even wait one day.

354
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,477
He said if I had expressed
my feelings clearly,

355
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,855
then he wouldn't have done what he did.

356
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,567
But I personally think

357
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,945
that he should've known
how I felt about him.

358
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,990
The fact that he began
to lean toward Si-eun

359
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,035
because she expressed
her feelings more than I did

360
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,581
just proves how shallow
his feelings for me were.

361
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,626
That's why I wouldn't be caught dead
with a guy like that.

362
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,381
I feel bad for Si-eun,
but I hope the two end up together.

363
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,718
I see. It turned out well, then.

364
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,012
Straight to the point.

365
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,930
-That sums it up.
-It all worked out.

366
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,894
Well, I tried thinking about it
in Gyu-ri's shoes.

367
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,729
As we've mentioned before,

368
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,648
people like her
don't usually get turned down

369
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,358
-or rejected.
-Right.

370
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:57,654
But she's in a situation where she feels
she's being weighed against someone.

371
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,700
I think that hurt her pride.

372
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,077
When you think about it,

373
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,623
the person Min-woo was
interested in the most was Si-eun.

374
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:12,252
But then Gyu-ri suddenly chose Min-woo,
which made him feel confused.

375
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,962
That was the order of things.

376
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,964
-But Gyu-ri doesn't know.
-But she thinks

377
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,093
that he changed his mind overnight.

378
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,471
I think at this point,

379
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,975
Min-woo felt that he had to give Gyu-ri
some sort of reason

380
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,394
-because she kept asking him questions.
-Right.

381
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,649
That's why he kept mentioning
how Si-eun approached him first.

382
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,109
But that probably made Gyu-ri think,

383
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,612
"Did I not express my feelings?"

384
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:42,532
"I may not have told you that I liked you,
but I made it clear enough."

385
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,493
"You're no different than Gwan-hee."

386
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,246
-I think that's how she took it.
-Yes.

387
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,415
But I also get why Min-woo
would be frustrated by that.

388
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,918
-It was definitely unfair.
-Totally.

389
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,588
And let's be honest. Gyu-ri was also torn

390
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,508
-between Min-woo and Min-kyu.
-That's right.

391
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,760
I'm pretty disappointed
in Gyu-ri right now.

392
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,303
-She…
-You're disappointed?

393
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:08,308
-He doesn't like that kind of attitude.
-She shouldn't have been so condescending.

394
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,811
She should've been a bit more respectful.

395
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,355
Just because she's older than him

396
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,566
doesn't mean she can talk to him
with a condescending tone.

397
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,318
And during her interview,

398
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,154
I found her words to be
disrespectful to him.

399
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,365
I think she ended up
showing her true self.

400
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,284
-"Her true self."
-My gosh.

401
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,036
She said, "I wouldn't be
caught dead with him."

402
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,289
We shouldn't say such things lightly.

403
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,498
He's so mad.

404
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:35,002
In any case, I'm pretty sure
that Min-woo's feelings for Gyu-ri

405
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,004
-are gone now.
-Totally.

406
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,880
-I bet he made up his mind.
-Right.

407
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,091
Like you said, it turned out well.

408
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,759
-Right. Good for them.
-Exactly.

409
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,428
-He can choose Si-eun now.
-Right.

410
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,265
-See you later.
-Okay.

411
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,986
No one's here.

412
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,423
After I came back
from my quick chat with Won-ik,

413
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:25,344
I found out that Min-woo and Gyu-ri
were having a talk.

414
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:29,264
But I didn't feel anxious at all

415
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,809
because I was very sure about him
and trusted him a great deal.

416
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,853
In that sense, I didn't feel nervous.

417
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:39,066
But in terms of time,
the day was almost over.

418
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,692
We only had one day left,

419
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,903
so I felt like
we were running out of time.

420
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,701
This is it. It's almost over.

421
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,078
Yes, it feels weird.

422
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,208
I've only spoken to you and Min-ji.

423
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,835
Are you disappointed because of that?

424
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,961
Yes, quite a bit.

425
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,384
Now that I think about it,
Jin-seok tends to hold grudges.

426
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,969
-Right?
-You can't blame him, though.

427
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,680
Min-young became as meek as a lamb.

428
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,516
-The tables have turned.
-Right.

429
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,851
She even looks like a lamb
in her white dress.

430
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,937
-She looks gentle.
-The tables have turned.

431
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,979
-Definitely.
-Yes.

432
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,566
-I'm disappointed too.
-Why are you disappointed?

433
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,112
I spent all of my time with you,
but you're acting this way.

434
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,823
I thought you liked being with me.

435
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,409
Of course I did.

436
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,785
Then what is it?

437
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,455
-Are you being grumpy?
-Someone was mean to me.

438
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,541
I was mean to you one time.

439
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,751
Let go of it already.

440
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,839
I guess you were mean only once.

441
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,800
-Then why--
-It was your only chance, though.

442
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,718
What?

443
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,303
Don't act all cute.

444
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,722
Cut it out. Stop acting cute.

445
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,607
-What's going on?
-I'm nervous.

446
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,734
-What is she up to?
-She's leaving.

447
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,251
-Is she looking for him?
-She couldn't wait any longer.

448
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,757
Hey. Come on in.

449
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,301
I just…

450
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,261
-She didn't go there.
-What a relief.

451
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,264
-That scared me.
-I thought she had gone to the other room.

452
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,223
My gosh.

453
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,101
I need some advice.

454
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,352
Sure. Come on in.

455
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,979
-Can I stay?
-Yes.

456
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,857
-I came to talk to you both.
-Go ahead.

457
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,984
I'm kind of at a loss right now.

458
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,569
-Tell us.
-Why? What happened?

459
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,531
Won-ik wanted to talk to me,
but while I was with him,

460
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,868
-Gyu-ri went straight to Min-woo.
-Right.

461
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,330
-And I think they're still talking.
-Okay.

462
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,416
So I'm kind of upset right now.

463
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,044
I was happy we both stayed in Inferno…

464
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,420
-Right.
-Yes.

465
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,675
It's driving me crazy.

466
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,055
I think it's okay for you to step up now.

467
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,265
-Do whatever you want to do.
-Totally.

468
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,226
-I agree.
-It's okay to be selfish now

469
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,144
because there isn't much time left.

470
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,104
Just do what you want.

471
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,773
Okay.

472
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,566
Should I go now?

473
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,901
Don't play it too safe.

474
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,571
You know you're going
to regret it if you do.

475
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,324
No regrets. Just go for it.

476
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,162
Come on. I'll go with you.

477
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,375
Just a second.

478
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,880
I'll give them five more minutes
and then go in after that.

479
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,058
Take this off for me.

480
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,893
What? Take what off?

481
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,855
-What?
-I've wanted this off for a while.

482
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,651
Is that allowed?

483
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,154
-I got it.
-Can we do that?

484
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,156
It's fine.

485
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,784
She took her mic off.

486
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,621
What is it?

487
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,582
-I just…
-Aren't we done talking?

488
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,838
What is it?
Do you have anything more to say?

489
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,755
No.

490
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,186
How much longer do you guys need?

491
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,314
Who is that?

492
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,691
How much longer do you guys need?

493
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,568
-We're almost--
-Can I talk to Min-woo for a bit?

494
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,778
No, you can't.

495
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,238
-What?
-You can't.

496
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,116
-Oh, my.
-What?

497
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,576
My gosh.

498
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,954
-Gyu-ri has lost it.
-I'm scared!

499
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,457
-That was so scary.
-She's lost it.

500
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,791
Goodness.

501
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,628
-She is…
-She's gone over to the dark side.

502
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,714
I'm sure she's kidding,
but it doesn't feel like it.

503
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,716
Come on, Gyu-ri. Don't be like that.

504
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,639
-Come see me when you're done.
-Okay. We'll be done soon.

505
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,685
Okay. I'll be waiting for you.

506
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,525
-She said I can't talk to him.
-Not right now?

507
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,693
-It's not that.
-Then?

508
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,529
He'll be out in a second.
But when I asked, Gyu-ri said,

509
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,989
"No, you can't."

510
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,115
-Seriously?
-Yes.

511
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,789
-He'll be here soon.
-Okay.

512
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,960
But I think that answer
was the craziest thing I've ever heard.

513
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,046
-What Gyu-ri said?
-Her expression…

514
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:53,963
Yes.

515
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,762
But I trust Min-woo.

516
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,889
I trust what he told me before.

517
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,058
Still, you never know.

518
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,976
It's up to you to make it happen.

519
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,443
Let's wrap it up.

520
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,865
"Wrap it up"?
I can't believe you said that.

521
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,296
Let's leave it at that for today.

522
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,677
I was quite flustered and upset.

523
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,930
But we kept going in circles,
and we weren't getting anywhere,

524
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,267
so I just wanted
to end our conversation quickly.

525
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,400
-I'm so sorry.
-It's all right.

526
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,193
I thought you were sleeping
in the other room.

527
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,070
No, I'm going to sleep here.

528
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,075
Shall we go?

529
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,793
-Were you waiting long?
-What?

530
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,587
-Were you waiting long?
-Yes.

531
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,718
-Did you have a good talk?
-What?

532
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,052
Did you have a good talk?

533
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,263
-Well, we talked.
-I see.

534
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,099
Did it go well?

535
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,518
-Yes. It was really good.
-I see.

536
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,145
Do you feel better now?

537
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:36,649
I wouldn't say I feel better,
but we talked.

538
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,234
-I see.
-Yes.

539
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,155
Are you leaning toward Min-woo?

540
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,907
-Min-woo?
-I'm talking about you.

541
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,908
-Me?
-Yes.

542
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:45,909
No.

543
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,703
When I talked to him,
I realized he wasn't the one.

544
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,163
I see.

545
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,289
I mean,

546
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,334
it wasn't really up to me.

547
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:58,463
Do you think Min-kyu is
a better fit for you, then?

548
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,547
Right.

549
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,009
I'll have to think about that
some more because…

550
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,469
Well…

551
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:09,349
Just because someone is available
doesn't mean I should settle for him.

552
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,142
-Right.
-Don't you agree?

553
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,439
-We talked here before.
-Right.

554
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,191
So I wanted to come back.

555
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,860
Did the talk go well?

556
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,320
-The talk?
-Yes.

557
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,738
Yes, it was fine.

558
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,281
It seemed a little scary.

559
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,826
Well, to be honest…

560
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,160
Have I already told you?

561
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,286
About what?

562
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,500
One of the people
I was interested in was Gyu-ri.

563
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,085
Right.

564
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,463
I already knew it was Gyu-ri.

565
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,008
I told her that I was leaning towards you.

566
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,093
I see.

567
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,470
-I mean, I had to.
-Right.

568
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,806
-It wouldn't have been right.
-I know.

569
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,225
So did everything go okay?

570
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,646
Well, I told her exactly how I felt.

571
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,732
So I…

572
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,817
I'm just not…

573
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,779
I'm not good at saying things like that,
so I'm not sure how it went.

574
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,239
-I don't know.
-Okay.

575
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,242
But what I do know
is that you have nothing to worry about.

576
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,578
I really wanted to tell you that.

577
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,330
And I'm sorry for worrying you.

578
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,460
I feel exactly the same
as I did when we talked before,

579
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,380
so don't worry about anything, okay?

580
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,757
-I wasn't--
-Right now…

581
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,303
I wasn't worried because I trusted you.

582
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,221
It's working out.

583
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,140
They just needed to talk about it.

584
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,352
I had no idea
the conversation would last so long.

585
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,354
Right. I had no idea either.

586
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,608
-It takes time to talk about these things.
-I should've…

587
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,193
I should've left sooner.

588
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,778
It's fine.

589
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,906
You handled it.

590
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,201
I'm sorry for making you wait so long.

591
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,787
-It's okay.
-I'm so sorry.

592
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,998
You know what, though?

593
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,961
If you don't talk things out in Inferno,
it'll never work out.

594
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:02,879
You're right.

595
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,425
-We took the long road to get here.
-Right.

596
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,803
This is the last stretch of our journey,
but it's still not easy.

597
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,765
Why is this so hard?

598
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,559
That thought keeps
running through my head.

599
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:17,936
Same here.

600
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,980
It's such a long and messy road,

601
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,732
but I really love it.

602
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,238
I choose you.

603
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,824
I choose you too.

604
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,121
"I choose you."

605
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,958
I should make a song out of that.

606
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,042
I know, right?

607
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,879
Tomorrow is our last day here.

608
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,006
You're right.

609
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:52,971
I want to have the best day tomorrow,
and I want to spend it with you.

610
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,139
Me too.

611
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,018
-Let's enjoy ourselves.
-We should get a good night's sleep.

612
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,103
We should.

613
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,605
-Let's go to bed.
-Okay.

614
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,691
-Let's talk more tomorrow.
-Let's have fun.

615
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:05,692
Okay.

616
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,735
-Shall we go, then?
-Yes.

617
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,945
It's pretty late now.

618
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,700
-Those two wrapped things up well.
-They did.

619
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,411
-Min-woo and Si-eun
-I bet they slept well.

620
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,329
took a long and messy road.

621
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,082
But things only keep
getting better for those two.

622
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,583
They formed a strong bond.

623
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,918
-Exactly.
-Right.

624
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,546
And I think Min-woo had a difficult time

625
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,674
when he was talking to Gyu-ri earlier.

626
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:33,344
So I bet he enjoyed his time
with Si-eun even more

627
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,055
-after that talk.
-I agree. He probably felt relieved.

628
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:36,973
"I choose you."

629
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,975
-"I choose you too."
-"I choose you too."

630
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,643
I didn't expect her to say that.

631
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,188
PARADISE
YUN HA-JEONG & YUN HA-BIN

632
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,151
Look at the sunset. It's so beautiful.

633
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,571
-Can you see it from there?
-Yes, I can.

634
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,574
Can you see it?

635
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,284
-I can't see it.
-Come here, then.

636
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,912
Here. Lean back.

637
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,458
-Can you see it?
-Yes.

638
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,252
I thought Inferno was okay,
but this place--

639
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,837
It's pretty nice, right?

640
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,673
It's very different,
but it's nice here too.

641
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,719
I wanted to win the race
and bring you here.

642
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,679
-Right.
-I'm sorry that I couldn't.

643
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,264
It's okay. Don't say that.

644
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,018
I feel awkward
because I'm not good at this.

645
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:26,314
Anyways, thanks for bringing me here.

646
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,282
-Gosh, this looks so good.
-My gosh.

647
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,285
Enjoy your meal.

648
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:40,912
Eat up.

649
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,214
-Isn't it delicious?
-It is.

650
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,133
I was really hesitant to order the pizza.

651
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,264
We don't know each other's age.

652
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,849
It's about time I asked.

653
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,227
I think I'll be the only one
to know your age.

654
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,021
So how old are you?

655
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,106
Me?

656
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,857
-I'm 31.
-What?

657
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,400
What?

658
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,611
-Really?
-Yes.

659
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,488
You're a lot younger than I thought.

660
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,076
I'm the only one
who knows how old you are.

661
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,037
-You're the only one who knows for sure.
-Right?

662
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,374
We all thought you were
either the oldest or second to oldest.

663
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,959
I think Gwan-hee's the oldest.

664
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,585
-He's the oldest.
-He seems old.

665
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,588
He tries to act young,
but I can feel that he's old.

666
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,967
I don't think he knows that, though.

667
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,556
-I love Gwan-hee and Ha-jeong.
-Seriously.

668
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,309
-Me?
-I want to know what you do.

669
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,146
I act.

670
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,939
-You're an actor?
-Yes.

671
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,319
I'm an actor.

672
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,491
Currently, I mostly act
in independent films.

673
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,328
Once I get cast after auditioning,

674
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,166
I study the script and learn my lines
in preparation for filming.

675
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:12,753
YUN HA-BIN, AGE 31, ACTOR

676
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,422
What do you think about my job?

677
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,924
-I expected as much.
-Really?

678
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,467
But not your age.

679
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,468
I see.

680
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,056
You know what?
It feels different here this time around.

681
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,974
How so?

682
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,227
I'm enjoying the food more
because I feel comfortable.

683
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,897
When I was here before,

684
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,192
I felt like I had to keep
the conversation going during meals.

685
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,819
But now, I can focus on eating.

686
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:40,615
I personally don't like
to talk when I eat.

687
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,532
I see.

688
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,242
I don't even look at my phone.

689
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,535
Really?

690
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,372
-I don't even watch TV. I just eat.
-I see.

691
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,959
Is she telling him not to talk to her?

692
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,544
I know, right?

693
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,173
I can see him taking it that way.

694
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,008
Now that you mention it, so can I.

695
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,572
I think there's alcohol in this.

696
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,698
Do you feel tipsy?

697
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,741
I feel a buzz.

698
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:24,659
Really?

699
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,495
Is that why you got quiet just now?

700
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,455
-I think so.
-Are you tired?

701
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,002
You were so cheerful and energetic,
but now you're quiet.

702
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,421
This is how I am
when I'm alone with someone.

703
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,468
Gwan-hee thought
I was quiet when we first met.

704
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,386
Really?

705
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,179
When we first met, it was just us.

706
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,098
-And then we went to Inferno.
-Right.

707
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,600
When we talked,
I was pretty calm like this.

708
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,352
That's mostly how I communicated.

709
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,396
So he thought I was quiet,

710
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,731
but he said I was too cheerful
when we came back.

711
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,317
He said he just couldn't figure me out.

712
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,443
I see.

713
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,700
In the end, it's all about Gwan-hee.

714
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,410
-She keeps bringing him up.
-Yes.

715
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,578
I want to go back to Inferno.

716
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,830
-You do?
-Do you want to go?

717
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,206
Go by yourself.

718
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,374
Fine. Just stay here.

719
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,458
Sounds good to me.

720
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,876
I like this place.

721
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,923
I have another question.

722
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,008
Go ahead and ask.

723
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,968
Why did you

724
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,887
want to come to Paradise with me?

725
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,097
-Why?
-Yes.

726
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,517
Well, I…

727
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:37,356
I kept wondering why I chose you.

728
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,274
Okay.

729
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,275
And so…

730
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,821
I felt that I needed an answer to that.

731
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,492
In the process of finding that answer…

732
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,955
And maybe it was because I kept thinking…

733
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,415
You just kept…

734
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,168
Or maybe it was
because of all my thoughts…

735
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,464
I think I felt the need
to talk to you here.

736
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,841
-So why were you curious about me?
-I just…

737
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,010
-What I'm trying to say
-Okay.

738
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,803
is that I felt something.

739
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,930
I think we click on some level.

740
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,393
I was drawn to you for some reason.

741
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,603
-Really?
-Yes.

742
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,230
I felt a sense of peace and comfort,

743
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,441
but I kept that to myself.

744
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,359
Really?

745
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,487
I see.

746
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,871
Cheers!

747
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,334
I have a question for you too.

748
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,960
I mean, it's just that…

749
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,630
-You only gave out one candy.
-Yes.

750
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:46,384
Was there anyone else
you wanted to give it to?

751
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,635
-Me?
-Yes.

752
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,013
Was there anyone else
you wanted to give it to?

753
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,181
-Me?
-Yes.

754
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,725
Wait. I thought you knew.

755
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,270
Know what? That you gave it to me?

756
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,188
No.

757
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,481
Then what?

758
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,488
I was interested in Gwan-hee.

759
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,490
-I didn't know.
-Really?

760
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,075
-Yes.
-Well, I was.

761
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,368
-In the beginning?
-Yes.

762
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,452
I see.

763
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,331
Then, why did you give it to me
instead of Gwan-hee?

764
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,627
Gwan-hee?

765
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,504
I fought with him a lot.

766
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,422
Okay.

767
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,092
So I got upset with him once.

768
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,009
Right.

769
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:33,848
The thing is, he was so busy
getting to know people

770
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:38,602
that he never really checked in on me

771
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,937
or anything like that.

772
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,481
He just wanted me to approach him first.

773
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,150
-That's what it was like.
-Right.

774
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,653
But then, you came to me first, and--

775
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,072
-When you weren't feeling well?
-Yes.

776
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,658
That's why I gave it to you.

777
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,909
I see.

778
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,746
So the candy was originally
meant for Gwan-hee,

779
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,415
but you gave it to me, right?

780
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,084
Yes.

781
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,215
-Ha-bin probably feels a bit offended.
-Right.

782
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,801
-She's being too obvious.
-Right.

783
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:15,097
It's been a while
since I've felt this full.

784
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,309
…since I've felt this full.

785
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,938
-Excuse me. Are you sleepy?
-I am.

786
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,356
Just go to bed, then.

787
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,321
I get sleepy when I drink alcohol.

788
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,866
I think you've had enough to eat.

789
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,534
No, I haven't.

790
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,328
I'm going to try some tteokbokki

791
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,164
since you told me to.

792
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,208
Forget it. Don't eat it.

793
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,804
I thought you had
a lot to talk about with me.

794
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,181
Yes.

795
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,098
TWO DAYS AGO

796
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,266
I don't think…

797
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,020
I want to talk to you here.

798
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,606
I want to go to Paradise with you.

799
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,193
-So we can talk?
-I want to talk openly and candidly.

800
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,155
I wanted to talk to you a lot at first.

801
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,573
But now you don't want to?

802
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,367
-No, it's not that.
-Okay.

803
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,577
I just don't feel the need for it anymore.

804
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,329
-I see.
-Yes.

805
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,123
I feel that I can put

806
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,168
all of that aside because I feel…

807
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,420
-Comfortable?
-I feel really comfortable.

808
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,506
-What?
-What?

809
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,757
What in the world…

810
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,259
-What's he saying?
-What?

811
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,635
-Hold on a second.
-What?

812
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,763
-Comfortable?
-I feel really comfortable.

813
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:42,101
I love this sense of comfort
and stability right now.

814
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,937
I don't know.
Now that I feel this way with you,

815
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,731
I don't really know what to ask anymore.

816
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:54,697
And after organizing all of my thoughts,
I just let go of the questions I had.

817
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,240
What?

818
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,703
Oh, dear.

819
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:06,208
And after organizing all of my thoughts,
I just let go of the questions I had.

820
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,628
-I just forgot.
-You should've made a list.

821
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,881
"What should I ask Ha-jeong
if we go to Paradise?"

822
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,592
-"I'll ask her…"
-Why would I?

823
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,969
I'm the type to follow my instincts.

824
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,763
Is that so?

825
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,362
When we were in Inferno,

826
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,907
it seemed like he was ready
to share a lot about himself.

827
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,076
But he wasn't really willing to,

828
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,704
so I think that's why I was disappointed.

829
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:49,501
I actually had a lot of questions
that I wanted to ask her.

830
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,963
But because I had spent
a lot of time in Inferno,

831
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,217
the tension I felt while I was there

832
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:01,180
kind of just evaporated
once we got to Paradise.

833
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,307
It left me feeling drained.

834
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,476
I feel really bad for Ha-jeong

835
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,562
because I didn't try to engage
in a conversation with her.

836
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,067
Is he just clueless? What's going on?

837
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,111
I'm not sure
if I'm understanding this correctly.

838
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,739
So he's not asking her any questions

839
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:22,534
not because he knows
that she likes Gwan-hee,

840
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:26,288
-but because he feels at ease with her?
-Yes, because he feels comfortable.

841
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:30,000
"I'm just loving this moment.
I don't need to ask questions."

842
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,711
-"What more is there to say?"
-He's not thinking straight.

843
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:36,256
But he's the total opposite
of most people.

844
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,219
Normally, when you go to Paradise,
the tension explodes twofold.

845
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,304
But his tension just went away.

846
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,349
I think that's why he didn't want to talk.

847
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,851
He doesn't mesh well
with Ha-jeong in that sense.

848
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,731
-Like this?
-Yes.

849
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,608
I'll leave this light on.

850
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:02,991
It's not…

851
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,453
It's not that I don't want to talk to you.

852
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,874
It's just that I find it hard.

853
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,584
Why is that?

854
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,295
-There must be a reason why.
-Yes.

855
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,132
From my perspective…

856
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,803
I mean, you might not think
it's a big deal,

857
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,555
but for me, it's really…

858
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:30,352
It's really difficult for me
to open up to people.

859
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,270
Okay.

860
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,440
I've been like this since I was a kid.

861
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:38,902
So it's gotten more and more difficult
for me to express myself.

862
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,862
I see.

863
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:40,821
But you know what?

864
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,699
If you don't say anything,
no one will know how you feel.

865
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,284
Just express yourself.

866
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,786
How? What do you want me to do?

867
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,706
I mean, if you don't know
when you started liking me,

868
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,835
then just say,
"I'm not sure when I started liking you,

869
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,254
but I found myself attracted to you."

870
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,047
Just be honest about how you feel.

871
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,801
But you keep mumbling about this and that.

872
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,845
Oh, my goodness!

873
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,139
Oh, dear.

874
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,223
I love this.

875
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,977
Right. So I'm attracted to someone.

876
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,730
And I tell that person.

877
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,899
-Okay.
-But she doesn't feel the same way.

878
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,108
Then, that's it.

879
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,861
What are you talking about?

880
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,281
Let's say I'm attracted to someone,
and she feels the same way.

881
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,574
Then, the two of us…

882
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,332
I'm absolutely lost right now.

883
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,294
I have no idea what you're trying to say.

884
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,464
So I'm just going to sleep.

885
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,847
"So I'm just going to sleep."

886
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,767
A lot of people sing while they talk.

887
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,227
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

888
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,646
"Gosh, what are you talking about?"

889
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,524
"I'm just going to sleep."

890
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,067
People really talk like that.

891
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,276
I see.

892
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,946
PARADISE
CHOI HYE-SEON & LEE GWAN-HEE

893
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,823
Are you really sleeping out there?

894
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,826
Want to sleep in the same bed?

895
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,668
It's fine. I'll sleep out there.

896
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,921
Why don't you put this next to the sofa?

897
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,674
It'll be much better.
The sofa is too short.

898
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,552
I've always slept on the sofa.

899
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,595
-With your feet dangling off the end?
-Yes.

900
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,888
You can sleep like that?

901
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,266
It's still better than Inferno.

902
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,059
That's why you're always tired.

903
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,581
-I have a question.
-Yes?

904
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,292
Why are the options
sleeping on the sofa or sleeping together?

905
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,168
He can sleep in the other bed.

906
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,838
-Yes, that's what Hye-seon meant.
-He meant that too.

907
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,550
Maybe it's because
Gwan-hee knows himself too well.

908
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,467
I see.

909
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,137
-Because he might roll right into her bed?
-Exactly.

910
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,346
-You never know.
-Right.

911
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,848
I guess he really meant it.

912
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,725
That was perceptive.

913
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,227
Gwan-hee is a man of self-control.

914
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,520
No, he's acting this way

915
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,939
-because he knows he has none.
-Right.

916
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,983
That shows that he has self-control.

917
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,068
-He won't take any chances.
-Right.

918
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,862
-Better safe than sorry.
-He's great.

919
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,906
You're very sharp.

920
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:39,041
FINAL DECISION
D-1

921
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,335
You scared me.

922
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,378
-Jeez.
-Which is better?

923
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,213
-What?
-Should I put my hair down or…

924
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,131
Okay.

925
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,884
-Put it down.
-Okay.

926
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,778
-When I came with Min-ji yesterday…
-Yes?

927
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:13,200
It felt a bit strange coming with someone
I didn't know very well.

928
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,870
But being here with you makes it feel

929
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,456
like we've been dating for two years.

930
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,668
Two years already?

931
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,795
It feels different the second time around.

932
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,588
Yes, I agree. It's different.

933
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:30,008
Maybe it's because we had
a deep conversation yesterday.

934
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,220
You know what I mean.

935
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,472
-The mood?
-Just being together like this.

936
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:37,975
That's how I feel.

937
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,937
-If we end up leaving together,
-Yes?

938
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,149
do you actually think
we'd be able to see each other?

939
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,026
Like, as a real couple.

940
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,571
He always asks
instead of saying how he feels.

941
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,990
-He's the If Boy.
-Yes.

942
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,200
She should ask him the same question.

943
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,618
Because he's If Boy.

944
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,577
-The If Boy.
-If Boy.

945
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,913
-If we end up leaving together,
-Yes?

946
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,916
do you actually think
we'd be able to see each other?

947
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,751
Like, as a real couple.

948
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,462
Gosh, let me think.

949
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,633
I think I'd like to give it a try.

950
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,638
So if you're attracted to me,
what would be the reason?

951
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,018
See? That's just what he does.

952
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,686
-If Boy.
-"If Boy"?

953
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,814
I didn't notice this before,

954
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:29,609
but I keep seeing more and more things
about you that I like.

955
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,487
I find that really amusing.

956
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,033
There are things about you
that I find attractive.

957
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,036
-What do you mean?
-I'm not telling you.

958
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,372
I have no idea what you're talking about.

959
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,126
There's something

960
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,754
a bit pathetic about him…

961
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,505
Wait, I shouldn't say that.

962
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,050
He's not around, is he?

963
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,805
-It's okay.
-Just say it.

964
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,265
-We know what she means.
-Yes.

965
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,391
-We know.
-We all do.

966
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,148
Gwan-hee is a lot older than I am,

967
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,651
but he seems younger than me at times.

968
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,654
It seems like he wants
the woman to take the lead.

969
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,574
But I think that's kind of cute.

970
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,705
It's our last blueberry pastry.

971
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,460
I haven't had French toast in forever.

972
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,338
I don't think I need to come
to Paradise anymore.

973
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,256
I've thoroughly enjoyed myself.

974
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,842
A whole lot more than I expected to.

975
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,011
-The bingsu itself was a reward.
-Yes.

976
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,846
You don't eat like this every day.

977
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,682
That sound will play,

978
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,476
-and you'll have to leave.
-Gosh!

979
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,686
"A new male participant
is waiting for you."

980
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,522
How about a new female participant?

981
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,774
Will you go again?

982
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:51,691
Of course.

983
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,321
-You can have all the mango.
-No, have some.

984
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:59,032
-You can eat all of it.
-Did you have enough yesterday?

985
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,075
It's not that.

986
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,035
Mangoes remind me of you.

987
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,332
Gosh, this is delicious.
We won't get to have this again.

988
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,461
If I had my phone on me
and could take a picture with you,

989
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:15,298
I think this image of us right here

990
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,426
eating together for the last time

991
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:22,180
would probably hold
the most meaning for me.

992
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,057
I was thinking about this earlier.

993
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,726
Having breakfast with you like this

994
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,771
would be the most memorable moment for me.

995
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,444
To be honest, I felt…

996
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,863
When we first met,

997
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,782
I didn't think
I'd change my mind about you.

998
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,035
But then a lot happened
over the course of time.

999
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,746
And now that we've come full circle,

1000
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,541
I don't have the words
to express how I feel.

1001
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,255
I bet you'll say
the same thing to Min-ji later.

1002
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,257
"It was like seeing an ex-girlfriend."

1003
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,053
-She nailed it.
-She knows him inside and out.

1004
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,181
-We're all thinking the same thing.
-I know.

1005
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,059
I bet you'll say
the same thing to Min-ji later.

1006
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,187
"It was like seeing an ex-girlfriend."

1007
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,189
If I see Min-ji…

1008
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,317
If she talks to me first,
I'll listen to what she has to say.

1009
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,276
Out of curiosity.

1010
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,652
-You'll listen first?
-Yes.

1011
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,449
PARADISE
CHO MIN-JI & PARK MIN-KYU

1012
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,701
Are you sure
you're not going to cry today?

1013
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,827
I'm not going to cry.

1014
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,871
I'm totally going to laugh.

1015
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:32,000
Then, I'll just be honest
and lay it out for Gwan-hee.

1016
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,793
I'll say you care about him a lot

1017
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,171
and that you kept worrying about him

1018
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:40,300
even when we were eating room service.

1019
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,802
I'll also tell him
that all we talked about

1020
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,804
was the time you spent with him.

1021
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,431
Okay. Sounds good.

1022
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,642
-Min-kyu is so nice.
-Totally.

1023
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,602
-He is.
-I feel that Min-kyu

1024
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,480
gives off very mature vibes here.

1025
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,357
Don't be too anxious, okay?

1026
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,234
-And stop worrying.
-I'm not anxious.

1027
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,735
Why? Do you think I am?

1028
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,195
You were anxious all night.

1029
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,655
-Ever since last night…
-No.

1030
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,073
-I was just upset.
-Right.

1031
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,449
I know you were upset.

1032
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,638
Oh, no.

1033
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:27,847
He's looking away.

1034
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,647
Don't talk to me.

1035
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,359
Just don't.

1036
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,405
He told her not to talk to him.

1037
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,323
Gwan-hee's just joking around.

1038
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,952
Lean on his shoulder and get some sleep.

1039
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,540
Just lean on him already.

1040
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:57,877
Get some sleep.

1041
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,928
Hold on. Look at that formation.

1042
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,972
Gwan-hee's surrounded by the trio.

1043
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,140
-Yes.
-You're right.

1044
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,100
-My gosh.
-So what's going to happen

1045
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,685
to Gwan-hee now?

1046
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,562
-I think Gwan-hee…
-Did he decide?

1047
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,480
Someone will ask to talk to him

1048
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,233
ten minutes before the final decision.

1049
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,484
And whoever that is…

1050
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,613
I don't think anything is certain
until Gwan-hee makes the final decision.

1051
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,782
-You're right.
-It'll be important to see

1052
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:31,578
how he interacts
with Min-ji back in Inferno.

1053
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,997
-And then there's Ha-jeong.
-What?

1054
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,042
-What?
-Even I have no hope for those two.

1055
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,752
But remember what Ha-jeong said?

1056
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,712
-"Circle back"?
-He'll circle back.

1057
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,422
-She hopes so.
-"Back to Ha-jeong."

1058
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,340
Exactly.

1059
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,258
-I'm grateful to Gwan-hee
-Yes.

1060
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,762
because even though the end is near,
we're still not sure what'll happen.

1061
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,513
I'm glad he's making this interesting.

1062
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,891
-He keeps us on our toes.
-Right.

1063
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,643
-Seriously.
-If it was all obvious, it'd be pointless.

1064
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:59,105
I have to admit that he's been
an absolute treasure for the show.

1065
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,023
I agree.

1066
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,359
It wouldn't have been
the same without him.

1067
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,280
INFERNO

1068
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,658
-I bet we're going in the water today.
-You're so right!

1069
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:14,412
If we go swimming,
I'll have to dunk some people.

1070
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,456
Maybe a couple.

1071
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,502
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1072
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,253
-See you.
-See you later.

1073
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,548
-Do you guys share a room?
-Yes.

1074
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,594
If you two share the same room,
you should brag in front of Si-eun.

1075
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,930
-See you.
-Bye.

1076
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,015
Hello, my dears.

1077
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,475
Hello.

1078
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,559
-Gosh.
-So how was it?

1079
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,978
-Hey, you look really pretty today.
-Really?

1080
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,482
Tell us how it went.
We've been dying to hear about the trip.

1081
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,150
It was disappointing.

1082
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,235
-What?
-Really?

1083
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,194
It's not that.

1084
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,946
-Disappointing?
-I chose him, right?

1085
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,156
-Right.
-It was disappointing in the sense

1086
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,575
that he's not the type
who talks about himself.

1087
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,620
-I see.
-He made me feel curious about him, right?

1088
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,664
He said he wanted to talk in Paradise.

1089
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,708
Since there are limits
to what we can say here,

1090
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,378
he wanted to go to Paradise
and talk there.

1091
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,965
But once we got there,
he said he felt so comfortable around me

1092
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:09,426
that he didn't feel the need
to ask me anything

1093
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,010
and was no longer curious.

1094
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,762
-Really?
-Yes.

1095
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,681
-He was no longer curious?
-Yes.

1096
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,518
What? He's kind of peculiar.
Is that his thing?

1097
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,521
It was like, "Why bother?
What matters is that I like you."

1098
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,107
"Your feelings don't matter."

1099
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,567
I think that's how he felt.

1100
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,486
He's a bit different.

1101
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,029
We didn't expect that at all.

1102
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:34,534
I thought Ha-bin would pour
his heart out and tell you everything.

1103
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,870
I thought you'd warm up to him after that.

1104
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:37,871
I thought so too.

1105
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,039
I should've gone with someone else.

1106
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,417
-Right. I see.
-That's how I feel.

1107
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,465
I really thought Ha-bin and Ha-jeong…

1108
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,468
-How was Paradise?
-You looked good together.

1109
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,013
We didn't even have to talk
because it was so comfortable.

1110
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,182
-I see.
-She had a good appetite.

1111
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,600
So I was like, "Eat more."

1112
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,226
Did you talk at all?

1113
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,853
-Yes, of course.
-I see.

1114
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,480
How about the rest of you?

1115
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:07,775
Everyone who went to Paradise said
it was going to be way more fun here.

1116
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,153
-It was infinitely more fun.
-It definitely was.

1117
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,739
Did you talk with Si-eun, Min-woo?

1118
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,033
-I had one last talk with Gyu-ri first.
-Right.

1119
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,619
After ending that,
I went and talked to Si-eun.

1120
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:20,663
Nothing much happened. We just had fun.

1121
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,792
-What happened?
-Have you decided?

1122
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,836
-The thing is…
-Yes?

1123
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,922
Min-woo already made up his mind.

1124
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,423
And so did I.

1125
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,968
But he turned out to be
a much greater guy than I thought.

1126
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,012
He's very clear and straightforward.

1127
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,222
-That's great!
-Totally.

1128
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,681
-That's so mature.
-It is.

1129
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,183
Min-woo's amazing.

1130
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,560
-He's so cool.
-I think I fell for him harder.

1131
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,605
So I made up my mind yesterday.

1132
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,191
-That's huge. Did you go to bed late?
-Good for you!

1133
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,276
I think I made the right choice.

1134
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,696
And although I think
Won-ik is a really nice person and all,

1135
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,449
I don't think I had feelings for him.

1136
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,367
Right.

1137
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,244
I bet Won-ik has a lot on his mind.

1138
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,162
I know, right?

1139
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,248
I feel pretty bad about that.

1140
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,375
But if I waste my time by feeling bad,

1141
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,002
then I'm not being true
to my own feelings.

1142
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:12,131
So I've decided
that Min-woo is the only one for me.

1143
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,135
I'm so thrilled for you.

1144
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,096
-Did you have fun there?
-Yes, but…

1145
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,306
I mean, I don't…

1146
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,474
Did you have fun?

1147
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:25,311
-We just went in the hot tub.
-I see.

1148
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,896
-Good for you.
-We did that and…

1149
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,191
-Look at her face.
-She just heard about the hot tub.

1150
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,609
She told him not to do it.

1151
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,989
I went there twice with the same guy.

1152
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,241
-So how was it?
-Si-eun, you were right.

1153
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:41,035
It really is different
the second time around.

1154
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,036
-Right?
-Yes.

1155
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,248
-It's really different.
-I don't know why I thought

1156
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,959
it wouldn't be fun
to go with the same guy twice.

1157
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,752
-But--
-It's more fun, right?

1158
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:53,089
-You're more at ease.
-Yes, it definitely felt

1159
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,049
-different in a way.
-Right.

1160
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:00,555
Gwan-hee going to Paradise with Hye-seon
actually made me like him more.

1161
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,265
I realized how much I liked him.

1162
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:05,018
Sometimes, you realize
how much you like someone

1163
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:09,606
when you see that person
with someone else.

1164
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,399
This was just part of the process.

1165
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,944
By the way, Min-ji really is something.

1166
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:18,781
She told me that she was determined
to win first place in the chicken fight.

1167
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:22,660
When I asked her why,
she said she wanted to choose you.

1168
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,829
-She wanted to choose you.
-Me?

1169
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,539
-Yes, she told me that.
-I see.

1170
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,207
We were just talking as friends,

1171
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,210
but I was really impressed
by how determined she was.

1172
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,128
I see.

1173
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,546
I bet your head hurts now.

1174
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,257
No, I bet he'll choose Min-ji.

1175
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:41,012
I've kind of made up my mind
to pick Hye-seon.

1176
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:46,517
But if I just consider first impressions,
Min-ji is closer to my ideal type.

1177
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,144
-Right.
-She's closer to my type,

1178
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:51,147
but Hye-seon is just so…

1179
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,275
If I considered marriage,
I'd choose Hye-seon.

1180
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,526
-I see.
-Yes.

1181
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,737
You've got to be kidding me.

1182
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,992
-He's unbelievable.
-I'm so stressed.

1183
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:06,162
-I can't deal with this.
-After we shoot,

1184
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,705
I always get a massage.

1185
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,249
My neck is too stiff.

1186
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,919
-I need to loosen up.
-I can't deal with him anymore.

1187
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,005
If I considered marriage,
I'd choose Hye-seon.

1188
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,091
-I see.
-Yes.

1189
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,635
-You've thought that far ahead?
-Yes.

1190
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,221
-You're planning that far ahead?
-You're going too far.

1191
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,306
-Anyway, that's how I feel.
-Right.

1192
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:29,435
So we were in the helicopter,
and I was between Hye-seon and Min-ji.

1193
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:31,896
I sat there on purpose.

1194
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,107
-I see.
-I wanted to check my state of mind.

1195
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,484
-But the thing is--
-The way I see it…

1196
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,529
He made one girl feel at peace.

1197
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,949
-Right.
-But he made another very emotional.

1198
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,993
And I was the one
who had to deal with all those emotions.

1199
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,829
He was the one on pins and needles.

1200
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,706
Because she cried!

1201
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,375
-Min-ji cried?
-Yes, she did.

1202
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,377
-Why?
-She cried in the helicopter.

1203
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,295
-In the helicopter?
-You didn't know?

1204
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,672
She cried a lot.

1205
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,257
-In the helicopter?
-Yes.

1206
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,260
-Was I not there?
-You were sitting right next to her.

1207
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,594
-She cried beside me?
-Yes.

1208
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,596
-Why?
-I don't know.

1209
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:07,849
Gwan-hee didn't know.

1210
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,058
He didn't know.

1211
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,811
-This is going to affect him.
-Yes, very much so.

1212
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,857
He'll be touched
that she cried because of him.

1213
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,942
Jeez, this is insane.

1214
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,069
I don't see an end to this.

1215
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,904
Who knows what'll happen now?

1216
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,573
She kept crying.

1217
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,742
-I didn't know what to do.
-How did I not know?

1218
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,870
-But why did she cry?
-She was probably hurt.

1219
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:32,123
And I think she loved
the date with him in Paradise.

1220
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,792
Right. They went to Paradise before.

1221
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,544
I had no idea she cried.

1222
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:40,423
Before Min-ji made her choice,

1223
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,760
I asked her to choose Jin-seok.

1224
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,012
But she chose Min-kyu.

1225
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:49,390
I got upset about that,

1226
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,351
so when Min-ji tried to start
a conversation with me,

1227
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,437
I pretended to ignore her.

1228
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,774
I was told that she felt hurt by that

1229
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,192
and ended up crying a lot.

1230
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:02,403
I didn't notice it at the time,

1231
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,698
but when Min-kyu brought it up,
I was pretty shocked.

1232
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:10,328
-I wish he hadn't found out.
-I know.

1233
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,538
-This is like a Möbius strip.
-There's no end.

1234
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,666
I guess Gwan-hee will go talk to her now.

1235
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,960
I'm sure he will.

1236
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,755
-I'm losing my mind.
-"I heard you cried."

1237
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:25,009
Do you think
Gwan-hee wants to meet his ideal type?

1238
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,677
Or his potential wife?

1239
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:31,140
I don't think anyone knows,
including Gwan-hee and his parents.

1240
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,061
No one knows, including Gwan-hee himself.

1241
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,938
-He doesn't know either?
-You're right.

1242
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:38,731
-He doesn't.
-He has no idea.

1243
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,150
-She's right.
-He likes both of them,

1244
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,027
-but we won't know…
-It's hard to tell.

1245
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:46,280
But when Gwan-hee
makes his final decision,

1246
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:49,992
it will all come down
to what he likes more.

1247
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,953
Will he choose comfort or excitement?

1248
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,664
If he wants excitement, then it's Min-ji.

1249
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:57,500
But if he wants comfort,
then he'll choose Hye-seon.

1250
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,044
Is Ha-jeong completely out of the picture?

1251
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:01,003
-Yes.
-Completely?

1252
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,005
-I think…
-I'm still holding out hope,

1253
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,132
but it really doesn't seem likely now.

1254
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,474
Hey, Min-woo.

1255
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,392
You in?

1256
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,686
Gosh, what's going on?

1257
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,938
-My gosh.
-That's so cool!

1258
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,231
They just dove right in.

1259
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,525
Min-kyu!

1260
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:29,740
That's so awesome.

1261
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,200
So cool.

1262
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,203
Hey, I was going to--

1263
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,663
-Get him!
-What are you doing?

1264
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,665
-Hey, come on.
-Get him!

1265
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,716
They're all trying to dunk Gwan-hee.

1266
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,553
Try climbing on while I hold it steady.

1267
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,972
Be careful.

1268
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,308
Here we go.

1269
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,476
Hey, dunk him already.

1270
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:12,408
-He made eye contact with Si-eun.
-Goodness.

1271
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,786
You look like a pineapple!

1272
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,788
A human pineapple.

1273
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,753
-Hi.
-Do it now.

1274
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:25,463
Hey!

1275
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,548
Someone help me!

1276
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:28,633
Get over here.

1277
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,054
Why aren't you in the water, Min-ji?

1278
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:34,555
She doesn't have any shoes.

1279
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,307
-I'll give you mine.
-No, it's okay.

1280
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,725
-I'm fine.
-Just wear them.

1281
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:38,768
Here you go.

1282
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,270
Just my feet, please.

1283
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,272
What are you going to wear?

1284
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,607
I'm fine. Go on.

1285
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,443
-Oh, no.
-Did she see that?

1286
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,863
My gosh! I'm scared!

1287
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:52,698
No, wait!

1288
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:56,285
-Does it look like I'm in a photo shoot?
-Yes, it does.

1289
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:00,790
Hey!

1290
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:09,924
While I was crying yesterday,

1291
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:13,219
he was having the time of his life
with her in Paradise.

1292
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,887
My gosh.

1293
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,516
While I was crying,
they were having fun in the other room.

1294
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,393
That's what shocked me the most.

1295
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,728
And they looked happy the next day.

1296
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,646
I know.

1297
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:27,149
But with Gwan-hee,
it isn't over until the very end.

1298
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,402
-You know?
-Yes. I got that feeling too,

1299
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,070
but I think he'll choose me.

1300
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,280
-Why?
-I make him nervous.

1301
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:35,866
-You can tell, right?
-I'm his ideal type.

1302
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,035
Really? He said that?

1303
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:41,747
He did. So he wanted to talk to me,
but I didn't take him to Paradise.

1304
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,500
It's all set, then.

1305
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:47,211
Be honest. Does he seem interested?

1306
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:49,880
Who do people think
he's more interested in?

1307
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,633
-Who are you referring to?
-I'm talking about Gwan-hee.

1308
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,301
-Be objective.
-Well…

1309
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,137
He even went to Paradise yesterday.

1310
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,722
He can't decide, right?

1311
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,182
I think he's having
a really hard time deciding.

1312
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,600
That's understandable.

1313
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:02,601
Right.

1314
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,271
I'll just make sure to make myself clear.

1315
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,648
-Right.
-I'll help him decide.

1316
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:08,649
You're right.

1317
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:17,116
I'm still shocked that Min-ji cried.
I'm shocked in so many ways.

1318
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,368
-Was I the first to tell you?
-Yes.

1319
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:23,205
How did you feel
when you were in the helicopter?

1320
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,208
I was concerned for Min-ji.

1321
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,752
-Min-ji?
-Yes.

1322
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:28,836
I could tell.

1323
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,048
It seemed like you two were dating.

1324
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,594
Hye-seon…

1325
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,143
Today is the last day to go on a date

1326
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,979
before tomorrow's final decision.

1327
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:51,734
We hope everyone will enjoy
their dates to the fullest.

1328
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:58,282
I think I need to decide
between Hye-seon and Min-ji.

1329
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,703
Just wait for Gwan-hee to make his move.

1330
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:06,207
He told me earlier not to talk to him.

1331
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,124
Still.

1332
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,635
