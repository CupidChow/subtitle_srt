SHIN JI-YEON

CHA HYUN-SEUNG

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,128
I choose…

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,172
Shin Ji-yeon.

15
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,218
My gosh. I got goosebumps.

16
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,930
I'm impressed.

17
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,808
-I admire him.
-Gosh. Se-hoon is really amazing.

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,686
Seriously, I got goosebumps.

19
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,397
I got goosebumps.

20
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,982
Se-hoon really impresses me.

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,401
-Se-hoon.
-I had no idea he was this type of man.

22
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,446
-He really impresses me.
-My gosh. He was a one-woman man.

23
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,532
This is why he was so upset
about So-yeon's advice.

24
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,742
-Right.
-It makes sense.

25
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,535
-He likes her that much.
-Yes.

26
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,789
-Seriously, I got goosebumps.
-Se-hoon is a real go-getter.

27
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,540
-He's a go-getter.
-A real go-getter.

28
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,001
I'd like to get to know Se-hoon better.

29
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,087
I want to be friends.

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,214
If I were in her position,

31
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,299
I would change my mind.

32
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,260
If someone was that serious about me…

33
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,555
Unless he did something really bad,

34
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,849
I would definitely be swayed.
Don't you think so?

35
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,685
-What do you guys think?
-I would definitely feel like

36
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,521
I would like to get to know him.

37
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,064
-Exactly.
-When Se-hoon said,

38
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,441
-I would feel the same.
-"I choose Shin Ji-yeon",

39
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,276
-I thought it was really cool.
-Me too.

40
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,529
As a man myself,
I thought it was really cool.

41
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,488
Right.

42
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:58,118
I choose Shin Ji-yeon.

43
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,668
The person Moon Se-hoon chose is

44
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,211
Shin Ji-yeon.

45
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,673
Ji-yeon, please come outside…

46
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,174
Shin Ji-yeon.

47
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,510
Ji-yeon, please come outside

48
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,930
and leave for Paradise with Se-hoon.

49
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,689
-I told you.
-He finally succeeded.

50
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,525
Shin Ji-yeon.

51
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,652
Ji-yeon, please come outside

52
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,446
and leave for Paradise with Se-hoon.

53
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,157
Good. I'm happy for him.

54
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,242
I got goosebumps.

55
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,311
-You didn't think I'd choose you, right?
-No.

56
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,062
-What just happened?
-What?

57
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,105
What just happened?

58
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,400
-This is my first time going to Paradise.
-I know.

59
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,944
But we haven't talked
for a really long time.

60
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,948
I just followed my heart.

61
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,199
-Really?
-Yes.

62
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,911
Well, I thought talking there…

63
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,247
would be different.

64
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,126
-Okay.
-I made this decision purely for myself.

65
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,044
Really.

66
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,922
So you don't need to feel any pressure.

67
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,758
-All right.
-Well, you've been there,

68
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,259
-Yes.
-so I want you to…

69
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,344
I'll lead you.

70
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,303
No. I mean…

71
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,846
-I can…
-I heard a lot about it.

72
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,193
Amazing, right?

73
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,779
Gosh, I really admire Se-hoon.

74
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,447
Really?

75
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,573
Seriously.

76
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,701
This is the third time.
Is it the third or fourth?

77
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,703
-This is the fourth time.
-Right? Gosh.

78
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,373
I'm a bit taken aback.

79
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,041
-Why?
-I didn't know about that.

80
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,459
Not at all?

81
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,377
Not at all.

82
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,045
Se-hoon has always been like this.

83
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:23,471
Lastly, it's the second runner-up,
Oh Jin-taek's turn.

84
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,891
Please choose the person
you'd like to go on a date with

85
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,309
in Paradise.

86
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,228
I choose…

87
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,939
-Please choose the person you'd like
-Just go out now.

88
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,609
-to go on a date with in Paradise.
-No. We never know.

89
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,777
That's not true.

90
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,533
-Really, it has to be you.
-We never know.

91
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,912
I choose Kang So-yeon.

92
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,666
Kang So-yeon.

93
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,584
So-yeon, please come outside

94
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,877
-Have fun.
-and leave for Paradise

95
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,796
-See you.
-with Jin-taek.

96
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,142
Let's go.

97
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,649
-Let's go.
-Shall we?

98
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,650
Yes.

99
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,111
-To Paradise?
-To Paradise.

100
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,780
Gosh, Se-hoon really surprised me.

101
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:28,036
I feel like things are going
to be different after this night.

102
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,203
-Right.
-Gosh.

103
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,955
Things are going to be so different.

104
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,248
I agree.

105
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:38,254
Hyun-seung and Ji-a went to Paradise.

106
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,299
And to be honest,
it really made me anxious.

107
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,509
It hurt a lot.

108
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,929
I thought I'd be okay, but it wasn't easy.

109
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,015
It wasn't easy.

110
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,152
It happened before I came here,

111
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,947
so I thought there's nothing
I could do about it.

112
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:09,619
That helped me move on.

113
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,040
To be honest, I was pretty upset.

114
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,417
I felt like there was

115
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,503
no space for me.

116
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,546
I had so many thoughts.

117
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,343
But I still have questions
I want to ask him.

118
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,221
So I'll keep trying.

119
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,891
So those were their choices.

120
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,893
HANHAE, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

121
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,062
It always makes us feel bad

122
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,022
-to see the unchosen people.
-Right.

123
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,316
-I find Min-ji's attitude really cool.
-Me too.

124
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,069
-She's so cool.
-"Though I came a little late,

125
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,154
I'll follow my heart anyway."

126
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,572
-Right.
-She said she'd keep trying.

127
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,992
As a viewer, I'm so glad
to finally get to hear

128
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,203
what Se-hoon does for a living.

129
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,162
-Right.
-Exactly.

130
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,081
-I forgot.
-I want to know how old he is.

131
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,251
-It felt like he was living in Inferno.
-We've been merely guessing.

132
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,378
-You're so mean.
-Come on. Don't be like that.

133
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,089
-Seriously. You're so mean.
-What a mean thing to say.

134
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,465
Was he born in Inferno then?

135
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,217
Is he a Grim Reaper?

136
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,052
He's someone who lives on that island?

137
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,346
That's another reason why
I'm excited about this.

138
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,597
Getting to know him.

139
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:16,310
I also wonder how he'll make
the best of the time there.

140
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,229
-That'll be interesting.
-I hope he makes the best of it.

141
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,231
He's going to make the best
of every second he has.

142
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,740
Do we need to wear this?

143
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,702
We do?

144
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,510
-Se-hoon seems fascinated.
-He seems so excited.

145
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,845
He's excited.

146
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,398
I think I hear the helicopter.

147
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,610
There it goes. They're leaving.

148
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,862
There's the helicopter!

149
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,779
Bye!

150
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,033
They probably can't see us.

151
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,129
-Hyeon-joong isn't even looking at it.
-He isn't.

152
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,214
Of course he isn't.

153
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,175
-Min-ji isn't looking either.
-It seems like Min-ji was

154
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,762
-quite interested in Se-hoon too.
-I guess so.

155
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,889
-She looks down.
-At the interview, she said

156
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,350
-that she never gives up.
-I remember.

157
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,353
Min-ji is like
a female version of Se-hoon.

158
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,147
-Female Se-hoon?
-Female Se-hoon.

159
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,696
Are we going to fry the eggs?

160
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,615
I was thinking omelets,
but let's fry them.

161
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,537
We should wash the spring onions.

162
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,039
Right. Let's wash them

163
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,042
and cut them like this.
You know it, right?

164
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,043
Add salt.

165
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,171
-We have a lot of eggs.
-That's enough to make an omelet.

166
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,674
-Leave it. I'll do it. Salt?
-There's so much to wash.

167
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,982
-I need to peel them one by one, right?
-Oh, this.

168
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,943
It's much easier
if you just peel this one layer.

169
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,153
Let me do it.

170
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,906
-Do you know how to do it?
-Yes.

171
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,659
I can't rely on you.

172
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,918
PARADISE
MOON SE-HOON AND SHIN JI-YEON

173
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:46,836
My gosh.

174
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,171
My gosh. This room is huge.

175
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,008
-This is literally a paradise.
-This room is really big.

176
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,637
-This place is amazing.
-My goodness.

177
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,180
There's a swimming pool here.

178
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,641
-That's one huge swimming pool.
-It looks so nice.

179
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,519
My gosh.

180
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,396
If this is the pool we have…

181
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,232
I think I have to swim.

182
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,319
-Gosh. I don't think I can…
-Sleep tonight?

183
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,653
I might not go to bed.

184
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,618
-Let's see what they've got.
-See if there's anything you want.

185
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,456
-First, one grilled cheeseburger.
-Okay.

186
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,333
-And tomato…
-Spaghetti?

187
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,376
Seafood spaghetti.
You had this, didn't you?

188
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,128
No, I had this one.

189
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,921
-Just the tomato spaghetti?
-Yes.

190
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,131
Ribs sound good too.

191
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,507
-Let's order ribs.
-Let's order ribs.

192
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,301
All right. Ribs and a sirloin steak.

193
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,637
-The sirloin steak is great.
-With mashed potato.

194
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,307
-Sirloin steak.
-A sirloin steak, ribs, a burger…

195
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,267
I'll order these first.

196
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,226
-All right.
-Okay.

197
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,688
I'd like to order
one grilled cheeseburger.

198
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,441
Does it come with fries on the side?

199
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,276
I see. Can I have a lot of ketchup?

200
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,488
I'd like to have a lot of ketchup please.

201
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,202
-He wants a lot of ketchup.
-A lot of ketchup.

202
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,870
He's so cute.

203
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,414
The steak. How would you like your steak?

204
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,416
-Well done.
-Okay. The steak…

205
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,377
How about you?

206
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,338
I'd like to have it well done.

207
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,882
Okay. Thank you.

208
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,639
-My gosh. It looks delicious.
-Gosh. It looks delicious.

209
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,727
Let's not act like hungry people.

210
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,354
We need to be elegant here.

211
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,356
No. I've been hungry.

212
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,524
It looks delicious.

213
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,650
You can start first.

214
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,276
-I'll open this.
-Okay. I want ice cream first.

215
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,612
Go ahead and eat up. Let's just eat first.

216
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,030
Before it melts.

217
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,073
Want to try it first?

218
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,866
Want to try it first?

219
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,035
I'm not feeding…

220
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,790
-I thought you were feeding me.
-No, take it. What should I do?

221
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,376
You want to eat it that way?

222
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,837
Just like that?

223
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,966
My gosh.

224
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,094
It's totally different here.

225
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,095
-I know, right?
-Yes.

226
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,889
-Do you get why we've been saying that?
-Before I came here

227
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,183
-You didn't know it'd be so great.
-I thought

228
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,562
-we could just be open about each other.
-You thought that's it, right?

229
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,898
I told you. Once you come out here,
you want to come here every night.

230
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,316
Cheers.

231
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,029
So how old are you?

232
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,615
-None of us know how old you are.
-Right.

233
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,909
No one knows your age.
I know others' ages.

234
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,994
So how old are you?

235
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,954
-You have something…
-I do? Thanks.

236
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,622
So how old are you?

237
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,502
Let me guess.

238
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,546
-Okay. I'll tell you if you're right.
-Okay.

239
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,214
I can guess it correctly.

240
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:42,052
Either 29 or 30.
You were born in 1993 or 1992, right?

241
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,804
-No?
-I'm 27.

242
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,347
-You're 27?
-Yes.

243
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,348
-Really?
-Yes.

244
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,058
Then we're almost the same age.

245
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,059
How old are you?

246
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,562
What do you think?
I'll give you one more chance.

247
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,480
I think you're 26.

248
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,522
I'm 25.

249
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,400
Okay. You're 25.

250
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,360
Yes. I'm younger than you thought, right?

251
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,489
-We're practically the same age.
-Right.

252
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,990
So what do you do for a living?

253
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,909
I'm running a business.

254
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,827
A business? What business?

255
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,912
A culinary business.

256
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,247
-A culinary business?
-Yes.

257
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:19,131
I run a restaurant in Gangnam.

258
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,842
I've been running
this business for four years now,

259
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:26,305
and I've been working in
this field for about six or seven years.

260
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,850
That's so cool.

261
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,061
That's why he cooked well.

262
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:37,358
When I go to work,
I have a meeting with my employees.

263
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,027
We talk about how the wine order went

264
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,946
and what we can improve.

265
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,200
When my employees are
on leave, I serve food

266
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,078
and cook in the kitchen too.

267
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,039
-That's so cool.
-Right.

268
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,040
That's so cool.

269
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,167
I should visit.

270
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,003
Tell me where it is.
I'll bring my friends.

271
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,507
Sure. Anytime.
I'll make you something delicious.

272
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,300
Really? I'm really going to go.

273
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,677
-Sure. Come.
-Okay.

274
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,724
After the second time I went to the hotel,
you avoided talking to me, right?

275
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,768
-Yes.
-Am I right?

276
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,479
I chose you both times.

277
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,151
I really did. I voted for you both
the first and second time.

278
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:28,993
So you went to Paradise
with Si-hun on the first day

279
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,786
and with Jin-taek on the second day.

280
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,915
I tried talking to you,

281
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,794
but you never really responded

282
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,297
or expressed anything at all.

283
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:47,678
All I heard from you were things like,
"I'm so hot. I'm so tired."

284
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:52,683
And that made me feel

285
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,435
a little uncomfortable.

286
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,896
I'm the kind of person

287
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,690
who turns my thoughts
and urges into action.

288
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,986
And that's actually why I chose you

289
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,905
-as my date in Paradise.
-I see.

290
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,365
It's not because I want your answer.

291
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,367
I wanted to talk about all this like this.

292
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,827
So you could feel better?

293
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,245
-Yes. To feel better.
-Right.

294
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,831
-To make myself feel better.
-I see what you mean.

295
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,548
To be honest,
I didn't expect you to choose me today.

296
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,799
-You didn't?
-No.

297
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,052
To be honest,

298
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,804
I thought you wouldn't choose me
because I might have

299
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,681
-Right.
-hurt your ego or your feelings.

300
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,017
But you chose me today,

301
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,020
and it really surprised me.

302
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,939
-And it also impressed me.
-But…

303
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,065
I thought it's so cool.

304
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,108
Others wouldn't have done the same.

305
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,319
That's what I think.

306
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,740
Can I ask you something?

307
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,658
Sure.

308
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,203
Remember what you said
when we had brunch on our second day?

309
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,830
You said you weren't interested

310
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,583
in the person you chose the day before.

311
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,626
Right.

312
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,627
You said that.

313
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,630
-Can I say this?
-What is it?

314
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,758
Right now,
I'm not interested in the person

315
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:12,429
who I wrote to yesterday.

316
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,226
I want to know what changed your mind.

317
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,727
Do you want my honest answer?

318
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,604
-Yes.
-To be perfectly honest…

319
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,231
Let me take a sip first.

320
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,525
-It's really…
-Come on. You're making me nervous.

321
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,694
I'm not.
It's just that it's really nothing.

322
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,238
It's really nothing special.

323
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,240
It's normally like that, right?

324
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,410
-I really love pink.
-Okay.

325
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,371
I love pink button-ups,
pink T-shirts, and pink shirts.

326
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,831
I just love pink.

327
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,624
You once said

328
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,294
that you liked my pink shirt.

329
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,923
-I like the color of your shirt.
-This color?

330
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,466
-Yes. I like that color.
-Really?

331
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,677
-Do you like pink?
-Yes, I like pink.

332
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,220
-Really?
-All my things are pink.

333
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,556
I should only wear pink.
I have a button-up too.

334
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,765
-Really?
-Yes.

335
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,895
You said you liked my pink shirt, and I…

336
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,356
Seriously.

337
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,734
It's not a big deal, right?

338
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,820
Even I think it's funny.
I think it's hilarious.

339
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,614
-Okay. I see.
-Even I find it funny.

340
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,534
It's funny even to me
that one comment made me fall for you.

341
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,703
Really? That one comment?

342
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,663
-It was the start.
-That was the start.

343
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,664
Yes. That's it.

344
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,499
So that was the start. I see.

345
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,459
Yes.

346
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,335
Well, you really looked good in pink.

347
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,504
-I did?
-Yes. You looked really good in pink.

348
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,964
-Really?
-Yes.

349
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,554
To be honest,

350
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,682
I've been quite distressed
since the second date.

351
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,641
Why?

352
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,977
What distressed you?

353
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,731
You know, this isn't
a normal situation we would encounter.

354
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,149
We barely have chances

355
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,610
to focus on our emotions,
stuck in a place like this.

356
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,279
-Right.
-It made me very sensitive emotionally.

357
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,656
I became sensitive
to every word others say

358
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,493
and even to very trivial matters.

359
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,121
At some point,
I just wanted to get away from all this.

360
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:07,336
That's when I realized
that I had become really sensitive here.

361
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,755
-I think that's what happened.
-How are you now?

362
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,715
Now, I'm…

363
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,510
-Are you calmed down now?
-I'm calmed down.

364
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,642
I'm talking a lot about my feelings today.

365
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,435
You make me talk a lot.

366
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,645
-I do?
-Yes.

367
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,068
This is fun.

368
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,823
I can't even remember
how many times I said that today.

369
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,034
I wish this moment

370
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,869
would last forever.

371
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,496
-Really?
-Yes. Really.

372
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,209
-My gosh.
-He wishes the moment would last forever.

373
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,087
-He probably means it.
-Right.

374
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,131
After three attempts,

375
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,424
Se-hoon finally went
to Paradise with Ji-yeon.

376
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,384
Right.

377
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,971
I could feel how he has been feeling

378
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,932
-just by watching him.
-Right. It could've been awkward

379
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,393
and it could've been hard
for Ji-yeon to open up.

380
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,437
I'm glad they got
to open up about their feelings.

381
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,397
Right.

382
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,316
Do you think there's a chance
that she'll change her mind?

383
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,609
I think there is.

384
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,735
-You think?
-Yes.

385
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,614
Se-hoon was…
How can I put it? He was very considerate.

386
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,908
-Yes.
-His repetitive choice

387
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,953
-could've made her feel uncomfortable.
-Right.

388
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,706
But he talked about it so casually,

389
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,167
and he led the conversation so smoothly.

390
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,502
-Right.
-First, he made her feel comfortable

391
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,422
and then opened up about his feelings.

392
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,716
That's probably why
she became comfortable.

393
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,051
He said he chose her for his own sake.

394
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,761
To make himself feel better.

395
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,055
Saying that probably
made her feel comfortable

396
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,057
and made it easier for her to open up.

397
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,394
He led the conversation so smoothly.

398
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,521
PARADISE
OH JIN-TAEK AND KANG SO-YEON

399
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,731
Up for a glass of wine?

400
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,732
Sure.

401
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,109
To our second

402
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,695
date in Paradise.

403
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,405
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

404
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,913
-It's good.
-It is, isn't it?

405
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,373
-Do you like whole grain mustard?
-Yes.

406
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,000
-Let me give you some.
-All right.

407
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,882
-How is it? Is it good?
-Yes.

408
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,717
Try it with the sauce.

409
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,223
It's so good.

410
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,724
-Really.
-Yes.

411
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,728
To be honest,
when we were on our first date here,

412
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,521
-I felt really uncomfortable.
-Really?

413
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,190
Yes, it was really uncomfortable.

414
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,317
I felt like there was

415
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,487
a huge concrete wall between us.

416
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,655
-I didn't know.
-I…

417
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,449
I felt like there was
a huge wall between us,

418
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,660
- because--
-Why are you saying that now?

419
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,161
-Why not?
-What?

420
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,665
-When do you think I should've said it?
-You could've said it the day after.

421
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,125
-The day after?
-After we came back from Paradise,

422
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,002
you went to Paradise again.

423
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,381
That's why I couldn't tell you then.

424
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,298
Let me drink this.

425
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,346
Jin-taek must feel really uncomfortable.

426
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,432
-It's like he's getting scolded.
-Right.

427
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,769
When I was in Inferno

428
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,689
and when you were here
with some other woman…

429
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,609
did you think about me?

430
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,821
-Yes.
-What did you think?

431
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,073
I just wondered what you were doing.

432
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,034
Did you feel insecure?

433
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,328
-It did bother me.
-It bothered you?

434
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,205
-So when I heard…
-Yes?

435
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,917
you went to bed early,

436
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,753
I thought, "Good."

437
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,838
Were you happy?

438
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,215
I tell you to go to bed early
when I'm not around.

439
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,302
-It makes me feel comfortable.
-Right.

440
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,761
I see.

441
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:50,183
At first, I was so grateful
that you showed interest in me

442
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,353
and expressed your feelings for me.

443
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:58,191
Then we got
to misunderstand each other a bit.

444
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,109
Right.

445
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,112
I feel like you're playing with me.

446
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,323
So was I right?

447
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,574
Or was I wrong?

448
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,535
I must say,
this gives me a lot to think about.

449
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,494
Okay.

450
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,788
I think I got to know you better.

451
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,957
What about me did you get to know?

452
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,084
I'd rather not say.

453
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,669
I see.

454
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,005
I was perfectly honest with you.

455
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,048
Right.

456
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,842
Are you okay with it? It might be too--

457
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,344
I actually liked that you were

458
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,887
-honest with me.
-You liked it?

459
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,888
Yes.

460
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,600
We got to know each other better.

461
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,061
What kind of people we are.

462
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,981
Thank you. It means a lot to me

463
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,317
that you think that way.

464
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:50,077
PARADISE
CHA HYUN-SEUNG AND SONG JI-A

465
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:52,954
I'm so happy.

466
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,459
-Thank you.
-Great job, today.

467
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,174
I like it.

468
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,512
I guess we don't need
to talk about those things.

469
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,471
What?

470
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:10,889
Professions and ages?

471
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,140
Yes. We don't need to ask

472
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,143
-things like that.
-I don't remember how old you are.

473
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,103
-You don't?
-No.

474
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,229
I won't tell you.

475
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,980
You need to be open about it here.

476
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,149
-I'll keep it secret.
-Guess.

477
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,276
Thirty-one?

478
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,905
Is that right?

479
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,490
-Did I guess it correctly?
-Yes.

480
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,411
I'm 31 years old.

481
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,749
And I've been a professional dancer
for over ten years now.

482
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,711
I once performed with SUNMI

483
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,422
at a water festival,
and it created a big buzz.

484
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:49,136
People on the internet
called me the tanned guy.

485
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,638
Gosh, that's a famous video.

486
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,516
-Oh, really?
-Oh, really?

487
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,644
I worked with singers

488
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:01,439
like TVXQ, EXO,
Girls' Generation, and BtoB.

489
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,066
That's about it.

490
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:08,738
CHA HYUN-SEUNG, 31, DANCER

491
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,575
-Do you not know him?
-No. He didn't mention Super Junior.

492
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,952
If he was our dancer,

493
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,746
I would've gotten in big trouble.

494
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,375
By the way, why did you choose me?

495
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,418
You?

496
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,214
If I wasn't interested,
I wouldn't have chosen you.

497
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,257
Right.

498
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,052
I chose you because I'm interested in you.

499
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,637
I see.

500
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,434
I'm glad I won the game

501
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,770
-and got a chance to choose my date.
-Why?

502
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,901
I knew I would choose you,

503
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,569
Okay.

504
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,281
but I thought you'd choose Hyeon-joong.

505
00:24:54,576 --> 00:25:00,123
To be honest,
I was hesitant to choose you.

506
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:06,171
I thought, if you like Hyeon-joong,
and he likes you too,

507
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,258
then maybe I shouldn't get involved.

508
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,176
Right.

509
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,636
That's what I thought.

510
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,887
So did you think over it?

511
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,224
-I did think over it.
-I see.

512
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,228
But I thought
that my feelings are more important.

513
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,021
That's why I chose you.

514
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,150
Which is more important?
Love or friendship?

515
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,569
-Me?
-If you have to choose only one.

516
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,863
-Between love and friendship?
-Yes.

517
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,242
To me, love is more important.

518
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,328
-It's the same for me too, because…
-Yes?

519
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,082
If my friends don't understand

520
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,210
that love is more important to me,

521
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,673
they're probably not good friends.

522
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:50,632
Makes sense.

523
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,219
Again, I feel bad for Hyeon-joong,

524
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,722
but as I said, my feelings come first.

525
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,517
My feelings come first.

526
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,230
So Hyun-seung knows how Hyeon-joong

527
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,648
-is feeling.
-He knows.

528
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,109
Which makes Ji-a's feelings
even more important.

529
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,318
They are very important.

530
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,196
How much alcohol can you take?

531
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,782
-One bottle of soju.
-One bottle?

532
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,575
That's a lot.

533
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,996
I get drunk fast
when I drink with someone I like.

534
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,372
Really?

535
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,292
Are you drunk?

536
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,420
Oh, no.

537
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,050
My gosh, Ji-a.

538
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,553
Men love it when women talk like that.

539
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,513
She's completely in control.

540
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,644
There's something I want to do.

541
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,022
Do you want to use the hot tub?

542
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,773
-Did you bring a swimming suit?
-Yes.

543
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,610
Isn't it too small for us?

544
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,279
You're so big.

545
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,990
-No, I'm not. I'm not that big.
-Yes, you are.

546
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,075
I'll do this.

547
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,958
It's like a spa here.

548
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:07,876
Right.

549
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,259
-They're going in the small tub together?
-In there?

550
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,722
-Let me get in there first.
-Is it warm?

551
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,639
Let me check.

552
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,309
It's hot.

553
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,146
-Is it? Let me turn on the water a bit.
-It's a little too hot.

554
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,238
-What's this? Is it because of the game?
-Yes.

555
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,909
-It must hurt.
-It doesn't.

556
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,411
-Let me see your back.
-It's fine. There's nothing.

557
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,747
Right. It was really red earlier.

558
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,374
I just got a little scratch here.

559
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,542
-Is it okay now?
-Is that okay?

560
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,668
Yes.

561
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,175
Could we…

562
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,259
Be careful.

563
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,595
-It's hot.
-Nice and warm.

564
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,641
Is it hot? Should we cool it down?

565
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,725
No, this is good.

566
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,105
We're going to get tipsy.

567
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,815
I'd love to.

568
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,024
-You'd love to?
-Yes.

569
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,070
I have to let the air out.

570
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,116
I really wanted to take a bath.

571
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,159
-After just one day?
-What?

572
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,411
-After just one day?
-Yes.

573
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,081
-I really needed…
-Do you realize whom you're talking to?

574
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,083
-I wanted to do this.
-It was just one day.

575
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,046
Finally, I'm seeing this.

576
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,340
-This thing?
-Yes.

577
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,967
The tattoo.

578
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,138
-Do you want to get a tattoo?
-Me? No, I'm not getting any.

579
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,097
-Don't.
-What?

580
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,849
-Don't.
-Why?

581
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,309
You're already so pretty right now.

582
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,104
-There's nothing.
-Me?

583
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,564
You're already pretty.

584
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,982
-So don't get one.
-No?

585
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,362
Don't do it.

586
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,281
-Don't?
-You're already so pretty.

587
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,953
Are you going to win the game tomorrow?

588
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,205
Me? I want to win.

589
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,541
I wanted to win the race too.

590
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,753
What if I win tomorrow?

591
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:16,921
What?

592
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,133
Do you want me to choose you?

593
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,177
Do you think I can win?

594
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,429
Will there be two
or three winners tomorrow too?

595
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,639
I want to win too.

596
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,558
Then win.

597
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,398
-Are you ticklish?
-Yes. Don't tickle me. I'm super ticklish.

598
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,025
-You're so dead.
-What?

599
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,611
-You're so dead.
-You're so dead too.

600
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,989
All right.

601
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,535
PARADISE
MOON SE-HOON AND SHIN JI-YEON

602
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,703
Gosh, this is nice.

603
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,666
-I like that there are no mosquitoes here.
-I know, right?

604
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,877
I got so many mosquito bites there.

605
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,086
I saw your feet earlier.

606
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,588
-I was really surprised.
-I was surprised too.

607
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,548
I want to make an X on every one of them.

608
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,135
I don't have any cream, so…

609
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,762
If we were outside, I would have…

610
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,138
But I don't have any cream.

611
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,056
An X?

612
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,475
What else can I do? Make an X like this.

613
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,935
One X on each bite.

614
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,938
-I'm serious.
-Stop it.

615
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,774
-That's the only option.
-What's…

616
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:18,733
I'm serious.

617
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,486
When I saw it, I was like,
"Gosh, she needs a lot."

618
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,697
You're killing me.

619
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,451
We almost finished this.

620
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,578
We do still have some white wine.

621
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,955
About half…

622
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,957
I haven't had this much since coming here.

623
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,583
-Really?
-Really.

624
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,879
Ask the guys if you don't believe me.
I only had one sip…

625
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,965
-I asked them a lot.
-I had only one sip and…

626
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:45,260
I asked them what you like to eat,
what you ate here, what you like…

627
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,638
I really did. I mean…

628
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,184
I may not be the most
strategic person in the world,

629
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,062
but when I do something,
I prepare myself thoroughly.

630
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,272
-Is that so?
-Yes.

631
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,816
What did you eat with Ji-yeon?

632
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,026
-With Ji-yeon?
-Yes.

633
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,737
With Ji-yeon…

634
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,739
Right. She loves Korean food.

635
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,824
Okay.

636
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:11,494
Her favorite dish was Korean food.
I think we ordered bulgogi.

637
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,290
And as for pasta,
she only likes tomato sauce only.

638
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,459
And as for steak,

639
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,837
she likes it well done.

640
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,797
She doesn't like medium or rare.

641
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,926
I didn't know they talked about that.

642
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,262
Jin-taek is like Cha Tae-hyun.

643
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,890
-My Sassy Girl.
-My Sassy Girl.

644
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,978
Seriously, when we talked
about it in the lodging,

645
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,023
I heard that song
from the movie, My Sassy Girl.

646
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,482
-See?
-My gosh!

647
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,401
He was right.

648
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,862
-You mean, "I Believe"?
-Yes. That one.

649
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,030
I could hear that song.

650
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,448
"Let me tell you about her."

651
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,158
"Let me tell you about my Ji-yeon."

652
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,410
"She loves iced Americano."

653
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,413
"Her favorite food is Korean food."

654
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,874
I could hear the background music.

655
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,627
If I were Jin-taek,
I would've been like, "Gosh, Se-hoon."

656
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,504
I think I just heard

657
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,423
-Jin-taek's voice
-"Gosh, Se-hoon."

658
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,843
"You're really breaking my heart."

659
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,306
I won't have any regrets now.

660
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,600
-None?
-No.

661
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,271
I think I should swim now.

662
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,940
Okay. Go ahead.

663
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,073
This is what you call happiness.

664
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,202
As long as there's water,

665
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,913
I can play like this all day.

666
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,417
You're like a seal.

667
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,627
-What?
-A seal.

668
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,509
This is nice.

669
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,140
A remote toast.

670
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,058
A remote toast?

671
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,269
Cheers.

672
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,899
Gosh, this is amazing.

673
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,195
Se-hoon is having the time of his life.

674
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,907
This feels different from
when Ji-yeon came here with Jin-taek.

675
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,369
When she was here with him,

676
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,330
she seemed to just follow his lead.

677
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,374
But with Se-hoon,
they're more like friends.

678
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,417
They keep squabbling.

679
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,293
-She seems to be enjoying it.
-Right.

680
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,963
Jin-taek already became Cha Tae-hyun.

681
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,882
-He told him everything she likes.
-Right.

682
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,718
-I think things might work out
-I know.

683
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,302
-between Se-hoon and her.
-Right.

684
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,555
And seeing someone

685
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,599
-so purely happy like that
-Right.

686
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,934
makes you happy too.

687
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:40,852
Right.

688
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,395
PARADISE
OH JIN-TAEK AND KANG SO-YEON

689
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,355
-Are we going to the spa now?
-Yes.

690
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:50,319
Gosh, this really relieves
all the stress I've gotten here.

691
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,743
My hard work paid off.

692
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,996
You did a great job.
I was worried you might hurt yourself.

693
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,414
Is your back all right?

694
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,041
-Yes.
-You did a great job.

695
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,792
You could've hurt yourself.

696
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,587
I thought about you during the game.

697
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,466
Thank you.

698
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,936
I had no idea
I'd get to do things like this here.

699
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,778
Before you had to choose today,

700
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,821
were you torn between me and someone else?

701
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,865
No.

702
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,660
Did it sound like I was scolding you?

703
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,456
-Are you afraid I might scold you?
-I wasn't torn.

704
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,250
You weren't torn at all?

705
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,168
No.

706
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,008
Gosh, I'm so happy right now.

707
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,347
-So-yeon, let's go to bed.
-Okay.

708
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,556
I'll turn the light off.

709
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,519
-Good night.
-Good night.

710
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,895
When do you want to wake up?

711
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,731
Seven.

712
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,150
-Seven?
-Yes.

713
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,528
-Good night.
-Do you think we won't sleep

714
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,113
-if we sleep on the same bed?
-What?

715
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,656
Do you think we won't sleep
if we sleep on the same bed?

716
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,407
Gosh. That's a bold move.

717
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,832
-Good night.
-Do you think we won't sleep

718
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,542
-if we sleep on the same bed?
-What?

719
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,127
Do you think we won't sleep
if we sleep onn the same bed?

720
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,753
Should I sleep here?

721
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,797
What if you get
so nervous you can't sleep?

722
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,261
-I can sleep here.
-Really?

723
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,179
-Yes.
-Then sleep here.

724
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,139
Okay.

725
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,224
-I'll sleep here.
-Okay.

726
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,857
I'm going to sleep here, okay?

727
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,734
What?

728
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,285
-I'm going to sleep now.
-Okay.

729
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,327
Night.

730
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,171
For real?

731
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,506
Of course.

732
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,507
Is this for real?

733
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,884
This is a show for adults.

734
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,594
Oh, my goodness.

735
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,055
You said watching the ocean
in the morning made you happy.

736
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:23,973
Yes.

737
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,726
Seeing you in the morning makes me happy.

738
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,812
Why do you like me?

739
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,022
-Why?
-Yes.

740
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,275
You make me want to take the initiative.

741
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,693
When you're with me?

742
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,652
Yes.

743
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,905
You make me

744
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,199
a different person.

745
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,206
I have a question.

746
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:54,170
Did you turn the cameras off?
Or did you keep them on?

747
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,505
-We kept them on.
-You kept them on. I see.

748
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,550
Do you know why I laughed earlier?

749
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,221
When So-yeon said
he could sleep next to her,

750
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,848
he must've been really surprised,

751
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,850
-though we couldn't see his face.
-Right.

752
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,978
When she said,
"You might not be able to sleep here",

753
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,315
he said, "I can."

754
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,608
Then he kept asking her.

755
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,276
"I'm going to sleep here. Okay?"

756
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,613
"I'm going to sleep here."
He kept saying that.

757
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,323
I found it so funny.

758
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,409
But seriously,
So-yeon really impressed me.

759
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,954
Right. So-yeon became much more proactive.

760
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,830
-She's changed.
-She's changed.

761
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,748
Yes.

762
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,792
She was confused,
but then made up her mind.

763
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,670
-"All right. Jin-taek likes me."
-"I should go with him."

764
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,713
-"I'll give him all my heart too."
-Right.

765
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,215
I guess this is what happened.

766
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,550
But really,

767
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,512
when you sleep with someone

768
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,681
in the same bed, under the same blanket,

769
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,851
even if you don't like that person,
you can develop feelings for them.

770
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,395
Right.

771
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,146
I don't know. Why are you asking me?

772
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,440
-Well…
-I thought you might have…

773
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,817
I've never done that before.

774
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,068
You've never?

775
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,903
Why would I be with someone
I don't like in the same bed?

776
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,238
I guess you're right.

777
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,324
-Wouldn't it be weird?
-You're right.

778
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,618
-So we all haven't done it.
-But I think I know the feeling.

779
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:12,164
If she said that
to become closer with him,

780
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,166
-it definitely worked.
-Right.

781
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,960
-It was a huge success.
-Really.

782
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,050
-What time did you go to bed?
-I fell asleep right away.

783
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,260
I didn't sleep.

784
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,886
-Why not?
-I couldn't fall asleep.

785
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,639
-Because you were worried?
-My heart hurt.

786
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,892
I'm sure you felt uncomfortable.

787
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,437
There are so many things
I want to say to her.

788
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,063
You must've had a lot of thoughts.

789
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,276
I couldn't sleep at all.

790
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,528
I'm always waiting for Ji-a

791
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,155
here in Inferno,

792
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,615
and Ji-a is always on a date
with some other guy.

793
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,993
I have nothing to do
and no one talks to me here.

794
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,287
I'm always lying here alone.

795
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,807
I feel like Ji-yeon
will start liking Se-hoon there.

796
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,100
You think?

797
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,271
What should I do then?

798
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,148
Then…

799
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,276
Steal him.

800
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,531
It won't be easy. They say
once a man knows what he wants,

801
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,950
-he doesn't change his mind easily.
-We never know

802
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,621
-until we hear what happened there.
-We never know.

803
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,830
Right.

804
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,919
I thought about it a lot.

805
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,671
That's why I couldn't sleep.

806
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,091
I know what I want to say now.

807
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,638
Gosh, I had no idea…

808
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,017
I'd get so emotional here.

809
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,570
We're home.

810
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,115
-"Home"?
-We're home.

811
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,242
We're back.

812
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,660
We're home.

813
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,495
We had fun.

814
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,622
-Yes. I had a great time.
-Me too.

815
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,666
I wanted to stay there longer.

816
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,919
Time really flew by yesterday, right?

817
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,170
Time just flew by.

818
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,755
It would've been nice

819
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,508
to stay there a bit longer.

820
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,717
Now, we are…

821
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,678
We're back here.

822
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,645
Hi, guys.

823
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,565
-Hey, you're back. Welcome.
-Who's this?

824
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,740
-Se-hoon!
-Hello.

825
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,825
Look who's here.

826
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,662
You look so much better now.

827
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,414
How was it?

828
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,332
What? It was nice.

829
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,543
-Good.
-Good.

830
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,919
You look so much better.

831
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,214
How was it? I'm sure you had a good time.

832
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,258
We went to a spa. Because it was

833
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,969
-our second date there.
-Did you go to a villa with a pool?

834
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,679
You went there twice. I envy you.

835
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,347
You know, we were the first couple

836
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,682
-to go there twice.
-I know.

837
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,933
So it was more fun.

838
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,936
It was our second date,
so we felt more comfortable.

839
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,980
-I wish I could watch you there.
-And…

840
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,482
-Me too.
-I really do.

841
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,485
We went to the spa
and got massages together.

842
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,903
-That sounds amazing.
-Gosh. You did it

843
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,571
-on your second date.
-It was.

844
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,323
We fell asleep
hearing each other breathing.

845
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,450
-Really?
-In the same bed.

846
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,872
So-yeon didn't seem to mind at all.

847
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,999
She was cool about it.
So we slept in the same bed.

848
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,293
We both woke up at around 6 a.m.

849
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,337
and had a serious conversation on the bed.

850
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,839
Did you sleep well?

851
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,798
Yes.

852
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,092
I fell asleep right away.

853
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,469
Me too.

854
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,971
We had so much fun yesterday.

855
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,265
You kept saying I should drink it up.

856
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,144
I've never chugged
a glass of wine like that.

857
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,858
Remember I said I've only
dated men who approached me first?

858
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,529
So I wanted
to try approaching someone first.

859
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,822
But I have never done it before,

860
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,867
so I had no idea what I should do.

861
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,827
I want you to approach me.

862
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,914
What's so funny?

863
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,086
Do you like this better?

864
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,671
I do.

865
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,713
I see.

866
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,717
We had a serious conversation
at six in the morning.

867
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,927
That sounds great.

868
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,350
What about you, Ji-a? Did you have fun?
Hyeon-joong was all teary last night.

869
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,978
Seriously. I had to walk on eggshells.

870
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:44,937
Why?

871
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,438
He said you're always away

872
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,315
-while he's always here.
-Right.

873
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,858
She's leaving.

874
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,360
She's always leaving.

875
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,655
I talked behind your back
a lot yesterday, Hyun-seung.

876
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,075
-On my way there, I felt bad for you.
-Well…

877
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,248
-How was talking with her?
-We talked so much.

878
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,710
You were the star
of the evening yesterday.

879
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,003
-You were the star.
-Right.

880
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,089
Did you get to say
everything you wanted to say?

881
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,674
-I said everything.
-That's great.

882
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,676
-Everything I wanted to say.
-Do you feel better?

883
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,386
-So much better.
-I'm happy for you.

884
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,139
-That's nice.
-It felt great to get it off my chest.

885
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,975
I thought Ji-yeon would be flustered

886
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,728
by all the things I said.

887
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,648
But she wasn't. She just accepted it.
And she talked about her feelings.

888
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,361
And now, I'll just go with the flow.

889
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:41,327
Hey! How did it go? I can't wait to hear
about what happened between you two.

890
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,911
-Well…
-Yes?

891
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,789
After some drinks,
we had a serious conversation.

892
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,041
Is that Min-ji?

893
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,627
-Yes, Min-ji is in front of them.
-Oh, no.

894
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,087
It wasn't a misunderstanding,
but we cleared the air.

895
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,005
You did?

896
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,757
I mean, at first, it was awkward,

897
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,383
but it got better as we talked.

898
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,219
Se-hoon told me
about how he's been feeling and all.

899
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,679
That's about it.

900
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,349
Now what? Did it change anything?

901
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,933
He turned out to be pretty nice.

902
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,560
-Right?
-He was really sweet.

903
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,689
-He has a great personality.
-I'm kind of glad we had this chance.

904
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,191
-Really?
-Yes.

905
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,693
So do you think
you know what you want now?

906
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,903
I think so.

907
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,530
That's great.

908
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,206
Gosh. This is…

909
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,626
Looks like Min-ji is interested
in Se-hoon only. Don't you think?

910
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,044
I can tell from the air.

911
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,296
She didn't say a single word there.

912
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,381
-Right.
-Right.

913
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,007
It could be she was angry inside.

914
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,802
Because Ji-yeon went
to Paradise with the person she likes.

915
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,554
And I thought Hyeon-joong and Ji-a

916
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,848
were a stable couple

917
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,517
like Jin-taek and So-yeon.

918
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,188
I thought they'd just end up
as a couple, but I'm not sure anymore.

919
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,272
-Right?
-A strong rival

920
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,440
-Exactly.
-has appeared.

921
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,110
It's not over until it's over.

922
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,536
Please.

923
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,580
Participants, please put on
your swimming suits

924
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,334
-and come to the beach.
-All of us? No!

925
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,878
Swimming suits again?

926
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,463
Gosh!

927
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,928
This game thing has been
stressing me out since yesterday.

928
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,431
Are the guys supposed
to wear swimming suits too?

929
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:30,769
INFERNO

930
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,861
I hope we don't have to run today.

931
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,322
I see a lottery box.

932
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,783
Do you think it'll play with our fate?

933
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,910
-I think it will.
-Do you really think so?

934
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:47,953
Play with our fate?

935
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,037
I'm scared.

936
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,750
It's a lottery box.

937
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,475
-There they come.
-Oh, they're all wearing caps.

938
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,392
Caps?

939
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,063
They're not wearing caps.

940
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,065
I thought they'd be wearing caps.

941
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,609
I guess they're playing with us.

942
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,862
What are we going to do?
I can't even imagine what it could be.

943
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,739
Do we steal each other's caps?

944
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,365
We can't be playing the game too.

945
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,118
I bet we'll play the game in pairs.

946
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,453
What do I do with my earrings?

947
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,914
What should I do?

948
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,041
-What do I do?
-I'm not sure if I can do this.

949
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,756
Why are you jumping?

950
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,549
I'm warming up.

951
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,468
I didn't get to warm up yet.

952
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,228
This is our seventh day

953
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,730
in the hottest inferno
in the world, Single's Inferno.

954
00:46:56,813 --> 00:47:00,234
Today, female participants
will play a game.

955
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,570
Like yesterday, you will play the game,

956
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,405
and only the top three players

957
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,492
will get to go on dates in Paradise

958
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:12,037
with the partners they choose.

959
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,457
Now, male participants,

960
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,461
please draw a ball
from the box in front of you.

961
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,464
What's that about?

962
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,927
The female participant whose cap is
the same color as the ball you picked

963
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,096
-will be your partner.
-Oh, my gosh!

964
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,806
That sounds exciting.

965
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,059
-Gosh.
-This sounds important.

966
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,519
-It's very important.
-Right.

967
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,772
-This is worse.
-I know.

968
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:47,447
Male participants, please come out
and draw a ball one by one.

969
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,744
I want to go to Paradise
on my last night here.

970
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,711
Please. Someone sporty.

971
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,463
-I feel like that'll be me.
-This is totally random.

972
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,927
Jun-sik drew a yellow ball.

973
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:13,432
-That's me.
-Jun-sik, please stand next to Ji-a,

974
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,851
who is wearing a yellow cap.

975
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,941
Please.

976
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,404
Se-hoon picked a red ball.

977
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:31,241
-Se-hoon, please stand next to Su-min,
-This is amazing.

978
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,659
who is wearing a red cap.

979
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,373
Hyun-seung is a team with So-yeon

980
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,375
-They are a strong team.
-in a blue cap.

981
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,878
We're so doomed.

982
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,005
They're so going to be the winner.

983
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,883
We're going to win.

984
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,225
Si-hun picked a green ball.

985
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,393
Please stand next to Yea-won

986
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,895
-We can do this.
-in a green cap.

987
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:00,979
-I'm strong.
-Are you sure?

988
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:06,151
Jin-taek picked a black ball.
Ji-yeon is his partner.

989
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,864
-What?
-Oh, no.

990
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,700
-Now, this is awkward.
-This is not good.

991
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,036
-They're reunited.
-I know.

992
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,543
Hyeon-joong is Min-ji's partner.

993
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,923
Now, we have six teams of two.

994
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,592
I'll explain the game rules now.

995
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,097
Male participants will carry
their partners on their backs.

996
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,684
The first team to steal another team's cap
is the winner.

997
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,561
I'm so nervous.

998
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,064
Su-min.

999
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,399
And Ji-a. Please come out.

1000
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,234
Oh, no. Why?

1001
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,945
We can do this.

1002
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,783
I'm not sure if I can do this.

1003
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:57,953
We can do it.

1004
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,082
-Ji-a! You can do it!
-Ji-a must be really light.

1005
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,542
She must be really light.

1006
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,001
-She's competitive.
-She is?

1007
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,128
I mean Su-min.

1008
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,051
You can do it!

1009
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,471
Let's go.

1010
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,644
Let's go.

1011
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,729
Pull your head back.

1012
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,565
They're coming. Stretch your arm.

1013
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,358
-What?
-Stretch your arm.

1014
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,527
Stretch your arm.

1015
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,570
Stretch your arm.

1016
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:34,823
-It's okay.
-Oh, no.

1017
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,241
Oh, no.

1018
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,537
Oh, no! Are you okay?

1019
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,080
I've never seen Ji-a like that.

1020
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,582
Oh, no!

1021
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,833
Oh, no! Are you okay?

1022
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,136
Now!

1023
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,601
-Now! Take it!
-What are you waiting for?

1024
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,938
Now! That's right!

1025
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,866
The winner is Kim Su-min.

1026
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,660
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

1027
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,703
I'm okay.

1028
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,247
Gosh, that was scary.

1029
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,875
Gosh, Su-min.

1030
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,210
That was amazing.

1031
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,504
-She waited for the right time.
-You should reach out.

1032
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,260
-You did a great job.
-You tried really hard.

1033
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,929
I really wanted to go to Paradise.

1034
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,348
-Well done.
-Do you know who's next?

1035
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,393
Now, let's begin the second match.

1036
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,855
So-yeon and Yea-won, please come out.

1037
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,148
-We're doomed.
-Really?

1038
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,316
Who?

1039
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,567
Darn it!

1040
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,860
We're so doomed.

1041
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,195
I'm sorry.

1042
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,363
He's sorry.

1043
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,280
It's our turn.

1044
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,533
I'm sorry, Yea-won.

1045
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,787
He's apologizing to me.
He says he's sorry.

1046
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,963
-This is like the final round.
-It's crazy.

1047
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,006
They're in different weight classes.

1048
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,095
I'm scared. I'm seriously scared.

1049
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,306
No! Don't go forward!

1050
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,101
Don't go forward! Go away!

1051
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,477
Go where?

1052
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,603
Go!

1053
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,439
My gosh. That looks scary.

1054
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,066
Go away.

1055
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,776
You're so far away.

1056
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,280
-Oh, no!
-My gosh!

1057
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,823
Gosh, she's good.

1058
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,867
She's so far away!

1059
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,785
She's so far away!

1060
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,996
She's so far away!

1061
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,797
My gosh.

1062
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,133
-Kang So-yeon wins.
-So-yeon.

1063
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,801
I can't go to Paradise!

1064
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,470
-I'm sorry.
-I can't go to Paradise!

1065
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,598
Now, the last preliminary round.

1066
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,977
Min-ji and Ji-yeon, please come out.

1067
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,193
Min-ji's eyes were so…

1068
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,862
She said she's competitive.

1069
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,406
-She was scowling.
-I wonder what she'll do.

1070
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,866
Her eyes seemed so scary.

1071
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,785
She doesn't really like Ji-yeon
at the moment.

1072
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,078
-Right.
-That's right.

1073
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,705
This is exciting.

1074
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,773
-Oh, no!
-Oh, my goodness.

1075
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:55,899
What's happening?

1076
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,485
-What?
-What's going on here?

1077
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,562
-So hectic.
-We won.

1078
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,147
Shin Ji-yeon wins.

1079
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,566
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

1080
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,735
That was a great match.

1081
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,487
-Seriously.
-He even kneeled down.

1082
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,822
But he managed to hold out.

1083
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,824
-He's good.
-My gosh.

1084
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,200
Ji-yeon is so good.

1085
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,328
Ji-yeon was really good. She's strong.

1086
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,414
-She's so strong.
-She's really strong.

1087
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,331
Great job.

1088
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,960
-What happened though?
-I don't know.

1089
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,003
Four times.

1090
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,838
I did it four times for you.

1091
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:04,092
-To be honest, I thought Min-ji would win.
-Me too.

1092
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,803
-But there was a twist.
-Ji-yeon is so good.

1093
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,180
-She is.
-So the three winners can go to Paradise.

1094
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,640
-The three girls.
-The winners?

1095
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,559
All three of them will go to Paradise.

1096
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,103
But just like yesterday,
the winner of the final match

1097
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,980
gets to choose her date first.

1098
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:22,068
-So their game partners don't really…
-They don't really matter.

1099
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,988
They were just their horses.

1100
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,367
Now, let's begin the final match.

1101
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,953
The finalists, Su-min,

1102
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:33,830
So-yeon,

1103
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,750
and Ji-yeon, please come out.

1104
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,963
In the final match, all three teams
will compete at the same time.

1105
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,841
The ranking will be decided

1106
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,927
in the order of caps lost.

1107
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,972
Don't try too hard, okay?

1108
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,934
-Hey, Se-hoon. No discussing.
-What?

1109
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,228
-No discussing.
-No, that's not what I'm doing.

1110
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,730
-Let's get ready.
-Get ready.

1111
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,402
-Oh, no. I'm scared.
-Let's go.

1112
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,154
Let's go in.

1113
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,869
-The blue team.
-For sure.

1114
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,829
They're going to win. Look at their form.

1115
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:15,872
I know.

1116
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,207
They need to be strategic.

1117
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,334
They should beat So-yeon first.

1118
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,601
Why are we looking at each other?

1119
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,353
So-yeon.

1120
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,188
Good.

1121
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,606
I'll go behind them.

1122
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,529
-Good. This is perfect.
-Let's get closer, Su-min.

1123
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,823
Let's get closer.

1124
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,282
Now!

1125
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,705
Now! Take it!

1126
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,126
Now!

1127
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,050
My gosh. Ji-yeon.

1128
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,260
The hat's in the air.

1129
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,471
Now! Take it!

1130
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,351
What? They both lost their caps.

1131
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,603
Now! Take it!

1132
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,021
-Oh, my gosh!
-I lost it.

1133
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,565
This is crazy.

1134
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,233
Now! Take it!

1135
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,235
-Oh, my gosh.
-This is crazy.

1136
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,071
-We both lost.
-Right.

1137
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,531
What do we do now?

1138
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,117
In third place is So-yeon.

1139
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,495
In second place is Ji-yeon.

1140
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,664
-The final winner is Su-min.
-I'm the winner!

1141
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,083
-Congratulations.
-We shouldn't have fought.

1142
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,168
I can't believe this.

1143
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,461
She won by default.

1144
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,796
She didn't do anything, and she won.

1145
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,131
My gosh.

1146
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,508
Wait. Just like that?

1147
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,510
That was so easy.

1148
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,929
-That was a piece of cake.
-I know.

1149
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,139
Su-min said to Se-hoon…

1150
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,349
I wonder who she'll choose.
What do you think?

1151
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,851
-I'm guessing Se-hoon.
-Se-hoon?

1152
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,853
Yes. Because she said earlier

1153
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,730
that she was interested in him.

1154
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,983
So I feel like she'll choose Se-hoon.

1155
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,653
-Ji-yeon was so good.
-Ji-yeon was really good.

1156
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,739
-She was better than I thought.
-I know.

1157
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,742
-She was so determined to win.
-Right.

1158
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,286
-I could see her passion.
-Right. Me too.

1159
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,538
What do you think I should do?

1160
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,625
-This is hard.
-Things have become much harder now.

1161
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,960
Try to talk
to Se-hoon as much as possible.

1162
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,378
Why don't you go talk to him?

1163
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:31,007
I think Se-hoon is the type of man

1164
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,634
who likes to take time.

1165
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,636
I know. I got the same feeling.

1166
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,472
Which is why I don't know what to do.

1167
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:41,518
I think you need to talk to him

1168
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,186
to figure it out.

1169
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,022
Go talk to him.

1170
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,316
If it doesn't work out, I guess that's it.

1171
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,946
I lied on the hammock once,
and it was comfortable.

1172
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,030
-It is, isn't it?
-Yes.

1173
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,913
I want to take a nap like this.

1174
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,790
Me too.

1175
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,294
-Let's talk.
-You want to talk?

1176
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,379
Yes.

1177
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,592
I'll go up.

1178
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:15,510
Okay.

1179
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,184
This is where I used to sit
and space out every morning.

1180
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,061
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

1181
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:26,854
This is where I space out.

1182
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,900
-It's so windy.
-It is.

1183
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,375
-I don't know what I should say.
-What?

1184
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:51,379
I'm the one who brought you here,
but I don't know what I should say.

1185
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,047
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1186
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,884
Then I think you should say
everything you want to say.

1187
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:02,015
To be honest, I came to think
I wanted to get to know you

1188
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,058
-after our yacht date.
-Me?

1189
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,643
Yes. You made me very curious.

1190
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:10,607
But I didn't know back then.

1191
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,234
After the voting session yesterday,

1192
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,073
and after I heard everything,
I realized what was going on.

1193
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,619
-To me,
-Yes?

1194
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,788
you seemed like the kind of person
who has to get what he wants

1195
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,875
once he falls for something
and who barely gets swayed.

1196
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,085
Am I right?

1197
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,003
-Me?
-Yes.

1198
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,129
-Yes.
-So I was right.

1199
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:37,258
So I want to know what you think.

1200
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,426
-What I think?
-Yes.

1201
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,429
I'd like to hear what you think

1202
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,973
from you, not other people.

1203
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:48,728
You mean you want to know
what I think and how I feel?

1204
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,687
Yes.

1205
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,275
Where should I begin?

1206
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,944
Tell me everything.
Everything you want to tell me.

1207
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,029
Okay.

1208
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:04,869
Did you have fun?

1209
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:06,996
It was fun, right?

1210
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,207
-I heard you ate a lot.
-I ate a lot.

1211
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,166
That's a surprise.

1212
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,876
Well, I felt comfortable.

1213
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,255
-But you were uncomfortable around me.
-That's a good thing.

1214
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:18,633
It means I'm attracted.

1215
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:21,969
-Were you sad?
-Did you sleep well?

1216
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:22,970
No.

1217
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:26,391
I was tired. I went to bed late.
Around 1:30 or 2 a.m.

1218
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:31,229
I thought I'd be okay,
but it really broke my heart.

1219
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:32,647
I'm serious.

1220
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,649
-When my name was called?
-What?

1221
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:35,733
I screamed then.

1222
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,112
It turns out I'm taking this seriously.

1223
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,156
I missed you too.

1224
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,201
I really did. I thought about you.

1225
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,578
In bed, before I went to sleep.

1226
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,839
So how is it now,
after staying here for a few days?

1227
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,926
Well, it's been nice.

1228
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:02,927
-Nice?
-Yes.

1229
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,597
-I won the game. Can you believe that?
-Right.

1230
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,850
Do you know I've never won?

1231
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,523
Right. I've learned so much here.

1232
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,359
Now I'm about to leave this island,

1233
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,070
I finally have my thoughts sorted out.

1234
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:25,992
I realized, as much as I like giving love,

1235
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,786
I like receiving it too.

1236
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,872
That's what I learned.

1237
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:48,139
I don't know what you heard
before you came here,

1238
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,100
but I felt like
yesterday would be my last chance.

1239
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,102
My first and my last
chance to talk to her.

1240
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:56,647
I did also consider choosing you.

1241
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,027
I thought it'd be nice
to get to know you better

1242
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,905
over a glass of wine.

1243
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,074
-But I had only one chance.
-Right.

1244
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,826
I asked myself, whether I should use

1245
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,870
that chance to get to know something new

1246
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,289
or for my own sake.

1247
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:17,043
And I concluded that it'd be right
that I use the chance for myself.

1248
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:20,296
That's what I thought.

1249
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,882
Then when I got back…

1250
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,262
When I got back…

1251
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,643
I found myself smiling.

1252
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:38,189
I found myself beaming with joy.

1253
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:40,316
I'm just…

1254
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,449
Do you perhaps want
to get to know me better?

1255
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,457
-I'm afraid I won't have enough time.
-Right.

1256
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,459
Yes. Really.

1257
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:07,260
Oh, no.

1258
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,222
Se-hoon is such an honest person.

1259
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,348
Isn't it nice?

1260
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,474
-Right.
-He's so honest.

1261
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,767
-He is.
-Right.

1262
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,396
It's over for me.

1263
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,106
Did you talk to him? How did it go?

1264
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,567
Sit here. What did he say?

1265
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,611
I talked to him, but it didn't go well.

1266
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,654
What did he say?

1267
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:27,738
He said he's already…

1268
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:28,865
Made up his mind?

1269
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,157
What do I do?

1270
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,373
I wonder who will go to Paradise.

1271
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,584
Se-hoon is definitely going.

1272
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:40,877
No, we don't know yet.

1273
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,962
-You will. I'm sure.
-You never know.

1274
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,881
It depends on who the winner chooses.

1275
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,716
I have no idea who Su-min will choose.

1276
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,551
She talked with Se-hoon a lot.

1277
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,846
And he was nice to her
when she first came.

1278
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,306
She said it was sweet of him.

1279
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,059
Se-hoon must've put
extra effort into grooming today.

1280
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,687
-He probably thinks he's going.
-He'd be sure of it.

1281
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,938
He probably did his hair.

1282
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,107
Concealing his eyebags.

1283
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,776
Who knew Se-hoon would see
such happy days?

1284
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,111
-Tell me about it.
-I know.

1285
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:16,037
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1286
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,748
The winners of the game
who earned tickets to Paradise,

1287
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:19,957
Kim Su-min,

1288
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:21,751
Shin Ji-yeon,

1289
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:25,880
and Kang So-yeon
may now come to the campfire.

1290
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,228
KIM SU-MIN

1291
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,397
SHIN JI-YEON

1292
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,566
KANG SO-YEON

1293
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:52,448
Su-min, you're the winner of the game.

1294
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:57,161
Please choose the person you'd like
to go on a date with in Paradise.

1295
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,998
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

1296
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,960
-I think she'll choose Si-hun.
-Me too. Si-hun.

1297
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,086
I bet it's Se-hoon.

1298
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,802
What if she chooses Se-hoon?

1299
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:15,304
She might have changed her mind.

1300
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,306
Seriously, I have no idea.

1301
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,475
-I think, either Si-hun or Se-hoon.
-Se-hoon.

1302
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:20,601
-Si or Se?
-Si or Se.

1303
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,228
-Si or Se?
-Si or Se.

1304
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,646
Who will she choose?

1305
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:34,031
The person Kim Su-min chose is…

1306
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:44,250
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

1307
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:47,837
Choi Si-hun.

1308
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,089
Choi Si-hun.

1309
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,216
Si-hun, please come outside

1310
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:55,011
and leave for Paradise with Su-min.

1311
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,846
Guys, I'm going to Paradise!

1312
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,389
-Have fun!
-Have fun!

1313
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,391
-See you.
-I was right.

1314
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:01,559
Have a good time.

1315
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,937
They probably wouldn't want
to stay there in the rain.

1316
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,940
-It's hot and humid there.
-In Paradise, they can use the spa.

1317
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,359
-And Si-hun was picked by the winner.
-Right.

1318
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,570
He may have been hurt by Ji-a,

1319
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:13,821
-Right.
-Right.

1320
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:15,406
but he'll be able to heal there.

1321
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,126
Thank you so much.

1322
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,337
Where's the way out?

1323
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,380
-This way?
-Follow me.

1324
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,050
I know the way.

1325
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:36,886
-Su-min.
-Yes?

1326
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:38,387
Thank you.

1327
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:41,223
-Su-min.
-Yes?

1328
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,641
Let's have fun there.

1329
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:44,977
-Okay?
-Okay.

1330
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:52,318
Next is the runner-up, Ji-yeon.

1331
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:56,739
My gosh.

1332
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:59,575
I wonder who she'll choose.
I'm so curious.

1333
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,870
Who do you think she'll pick?

1334
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:04,330
-Se-hoon.
-Se-hoon, of course.

1335
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,372
Se-hoon.

1336
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,041
Gosh, I'm nervous.

1337
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,253
I had no idea who Ji-yeon would choose.

1338
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,214
MOON SE-HOON

1339
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,512
-But…
-She might choose Jin-taek again.

1340
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:26,018
-I feel like she'll choose Jin-taek.
-No.

1341
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:26,977
-Jin-taek…
-Jin-taek?

1342
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,396
-I think she'll choose Jin-taek.
-I think so too.

1343
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,981
I have no idea.

1344
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,528
She must be torn even at this moment.

1345
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,701
She might choose Jin-taek again.
We never know.

1346
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,287
When he went to Paradise with Ji-yeon,

1347
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:49,041
I was deeply shaken.

1348
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,211
I don't want to be hurt again.

1349
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,381
I'm not sure how it'll go.

1350
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,092
Depending on Ji-yeon's choice,

1351
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,719
-So-yeon might have to change her mind.
-Right.

1352
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,601
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

1353
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:11,147
The person Shin Ji-yeon chose is…

1354
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,036
Is it really Jin-taek?

1355
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,914
I'm so nervous right now.

1356
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:35,462
I'd like to go to Paradise
with Moon Se-hoon.

1357
