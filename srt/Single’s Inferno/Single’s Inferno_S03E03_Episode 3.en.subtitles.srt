00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,103
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,232
The man who will be joining Kim Gyu-ri
on her trip to Paradise is…

3
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:31,322
I've never been the type
to make decisions quickly.

4
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,703
I'm still conflicted
about who to pick among the three.

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,710
In just two days…

6
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,670
She's become the top predator.

7
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,062
I was alone with Min-woo for a whole day,

8
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,857
and I appreciated the way
he kept me company.

9
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,484
On the other hand,

10
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:12,113
it was easier to talk
to Min-kyu or Jin-seok.

11
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,616
You're pretty fun to talk to.

12
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,076
-You too.
-And you're witty.

13
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,118
Same goes for you.

14
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,623
-Are you saying that to be nice?
-No, I mean it.

15
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:25,126
I liked the way you smiled at me,
so I wanted to get to know you.

16
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,128
You're fun to be around.

17
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,797
Really?

18
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:36,471
I'm not sure if going with someone
I had fun with is the best decision.

19
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,726
The man who will be joining Kim Gyu-ri
on her trip to Paradise is…

20
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,186
Park Min-kyu.

21
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,606
-Let's go.
-It's Min-kyu.

22
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,525
Min-kyu is really popular.

23
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,609
Yes, he is.

24
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,657
Please hold hands and leave for Paradise.

25
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,078
KIM GYU-RI & PARK MIN-KYU
SUCCESSFULLY MATCHED

26
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,664
Wait.

27
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,290
Wait.

28
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,959
Let's go.

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,101
It worked out.

30
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,771
"It worked out"?

31
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,606
I didn't think it would.

32
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,816
-You didn't?
-No.

33
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:31,943
I didn't.

34
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:36,364
But ever since we first met,
I've been interested in you.

35
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,741
-Really?
-Yes. I like spending time with you.

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,119
I appreciate that.

37
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,750
Today's Paradise-bound
couple matching is over.

38
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,920
Unbelievable.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,964
I can't believe this.

40
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,051
That was interesting.

41
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,101
The person I chose was Choi Min-woo.

42
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:11,399
I can't really tell
what kind of person Min-woo is,

43
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,943
but he's a good listener,
and he's kind of cute.

44
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,696
So I chose him,
hoping to get to know him better.

45
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,994
Things aren't working out for Min-woo.

46
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:23,912
They're not.

47
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,413
I feel bad.

48
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,624
He does get picked.

49
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,541
-Yes.
-Yes.

50
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,043
But the person he picks

51
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,086
-keeps choosing someone else.
-Yes, right.

52
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,713
-Things aren't going his way.
-No.

53
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,342
When Min-woo sat down to talk with Gyu-ri,

54
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,470
he shouldn't have said
he regretted the decision he made

55
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,472
-in the past.
-It sounded like an excuse.

56
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,182
-But I get why.
-There was no need

57
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,017
for him to bring up the past.

58
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,479
You hate it when people
give excuses about everything, don't you?

59
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,688
-She hates it.
-Totally.

60
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,816
-I mean, she could've forgotten by then.
-I see.

61
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,736
Saying that he regretted it
made him look shallow.

62
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:01,366
He could've just said
that he wanted to get to know her more.

63
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:06,496
INFERNO II

64
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,040
You look much better today.

65
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,250
-I do?
-Yes.

66
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,961
By the way, yesterday,

67
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,839
we got to go on that unexpected walk,
and we talked quite a bit.

68
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,925
We did. The sunset was beautiful.

69
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,637
-Right.
-I liked how it wasn't too hot.

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,639
-Yes, it was wonderful.
-Yes.

71
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,226
Do you want to go to Paradise today?

72
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,144
I do.

73
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,940
What do you look forward to the most?

74
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:38,486
Once I'm there, I'll be able to find out
what the other person does for a living.

75
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,323
I'm excited to find out things like that.

76
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,408
I see.

77
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,786
As you know,
we'll make our choices in a little while.

78
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,497
-Yes.
-Do you have an idea of who…

79
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,458
Do you have an idea
of who you're going to choose?

80
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,043
You're being so straightforward.

81
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,128
Well, I'm just…

82
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,298
-Yes?
-Isn't this what we're supposed to do?

83
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,676
-I thought…
-You're acting so awkward.

84
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,593
-Me?
-Yes.

85
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,761
-Really?
-Yes.

86
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,681
I thought I was really… You know.

87
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:07,682
Not really.

88
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,142
"Really… You know"?

89
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,184
What does he mean?

90
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,270
He's barely able to communicate right now.

91
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,148
-You sound like a robot.
-I do?

92
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,150
-Yes.
-Well, the thing is…

93
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,943
I guess I'm a little…

94
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,155
I guess it's because we're
just getting to know each other.

95
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,157
Do you get nervous?

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,950
I think I'm just shy.

97
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,328
That's not a bad thing.

98
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,040
Why did you make that face?

99
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:32,999
Nothing.

100
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,210
I'm just happy. That's all.

101
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,718
Won-ik is really cute.

102
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,928
-I think that's his charm.
-Right.

103
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,055
He's adorable.

104
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,849
Where have you been?

105
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,143
I was out in the scorching sun.

106
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,439
Do you think you'll go to Paradise today?

107
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,356
Me?

108
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,442
Yes.

109
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,693
"Yes"?

110
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,072
What? You don't think so?

111
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,784
Weren't you the one who told me
that I was being too confident?

112
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,077
Do you think you'll go?

113
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,622
I'm 100% sure I'll go.

114
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,915
You're 100% sure?

115
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,208
-I don't know.
-You don't?

116
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,795
They're very similar.

117
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,339
-They're funny.
-They're both very confident.

118
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,840
-Have fun.
-I will.

119
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,966
As for the macarons…

120
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,469
-I don't like macarons.
-Enjoy them on my behalf.

121
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,138
On your behalf?
I thought you said you were going.

122
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,518
I kind of want to try
spending the night here.

123
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,395
But I'm not sure if I'll get the chance.

124
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,363
I like the way you're thinking.

125
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,241
That's the attitude you need here.

126
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,992
I feel the same way.

127
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,249
If you don't have any more questions,
I'll get going.

128
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,750
Or do you?

129
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,799
They're both trying so hard
to play it cool.

130
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,968
Or do you?

131
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,222
Do we have to go around
and talk to everyone?

132
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,517
No, I'm just trying
to talk to all three girls.

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,018
I see.

134
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,186
And now…

135
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,021
I'm sure they'll drop by.

136
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,443
Who do you want to talk to?
I can ask him to come over.

137
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,695
-You.
-Me?

138
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,072
-You.
-Me?

139
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,117
What?

140
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,663
-Yes, those Bambi eyes.
-Right. Her chin's pulled back.

141
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,666
-You.
-Me?

142
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,921
-Do you have something to tell me?
-No.

143
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,174
You can go if you want.

144
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,968
It's just that…

145
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:55,600
-Won-ik seemed to want to talk to Si-eun.
-He did?

146
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,393
-I see.
-So I told him

147
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,188
-to go ahead and talk to her first.
-To go first?

148
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,606
I see.

149
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,275
She's the hardest one to read.

150
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,776
-Si-eun?
-Yes.

151
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,237
You should talk to her. Knock on her door.

152
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,033
Okay, I'll go talk to her.

153
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,872
Go and feel her out.

154
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,168
I'm going back to my room.

155
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,629
I want to lie in bed.

156
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,925
Go ahead and lie down.
I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.

157
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,010
Seriously.

158
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,388
Gosh, Gwan-hee.

159
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,599
Don't they seem more like best friends?

160
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,725
No, there's…

161
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,020
It feels like there's
a bit of tension between them.

162
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,105
Well, Ha-jeong made herself clear.

163
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,690
-"I want to stay with you."
-Yes.

164
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,692
-But Gwan-hee…
-Is he not interested?

165
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,904
He's truly enjoying the island
and everything it has to offer.

166
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,532
He made Ha-jeong look
like the desperate one.

167
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,449
For real.

168
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,419
That's creepy.

169
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:06,879
What?

170
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,339
Is it time already?

171
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,091
-Yes, your time's up.
-I see.

172
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,468
-I've been waiting for half an hour.
-Really?

173
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,095
Yes, may I talk with her now?

174
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,429
-In that case…
-I see.

175
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,556
Nice talking to you.

176
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,723
-Likewise.
-Sure.

177
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,433
Then, I guess…

178
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,685
-Really?
-Hey.

179
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,813
-You don't mind, do you?
-No, I don't mind.

180
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,857
-Is that okay with you?
-Of course. Hi.

181
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,236
-Did I interrupt a serious chat?
-No, you didn't.

182
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,155
How do you find it here?

183
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,407
-It's fun.
-It's fun?

184
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,201
-I wanted to get to know you better.
-Right.

185
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,787
-That's why I came.
-I see.

186
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,290
When we talked briefly back there,

187
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,709
I couldn't seem to figure you out.

188
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,752
-Me? Really?
-Yes.

189
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,921
-So I got curious.
-I see.

190
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,173
So what's your ideal type?

191
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,051
I like men who are caring

192
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,387
and men who have high self-esteem.

193
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,307
Someone who's confident.

194
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,395
I like someone who expresses his feelings.
It's hard to know if you don't open up.

195
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,940
So I'm looking for someone
who's easy to talk to.

196
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,525
I mean, generally speaking.

197
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,610
Generally.

198
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,154
I see.

199
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,239
-What?
-You're very eloquent.

200
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,242
I tend to be more vocal

201
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:22,246
when it comes to expressing
my thoughts and feelings.

202
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,625
What's your ideal type?

203
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,293
Someone who's calm.

204
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,502
Someone who's calm?

205
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,504
-That's my preference.
-I see.

206
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm very affectionate.

207
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,508
Really?

208
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,426
I tend to be.

209
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,053
-Me too.
-So I…

210
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,096
You seem like the type.

211
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,058
Yes, I'm very affectionate
around people I care about.

212
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,310
I'm usually pretty calm and quiet,

213
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,855
and people often ask me
if I'm the quiet type.

214
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,274
So when I feel less nervous…

215
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,277
Once I feel comfortable around someone,

216
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,279
I show that side of me.

217
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,492
I'm curious.

218
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,163
I can't tell what he's thinking.
It's so puzzling.

219
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,167
Gwan-hee seems more at home
on this island, doesn't he?

220
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,378
Have a seat.

221
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,422
-Thank you.
-Here.

222
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,551
-Are you cold?
-Yes.

223
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,969
Are you coming down with a cold?

224
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,098
-Maybe. I feel a little chilly.
-I see.

225
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,100
-Anyway…
-How was it?

226
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,142
Paradise?

227
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,019
-Well…
-Did you have fun?

228
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,978
Yes.

229
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,899
Not only was it fun,
but it was really rejuvenating.

230
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,819
-I see.
-It was so relaxing.

231
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,946
When I asked you about it earlier,

232
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,116
you said who you go with is… What was it?

233
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,828
I meant that it'd feel different
depending on who you're with.

234
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,955
-That's what I meant.
-I see.

235
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,833
How was it when you were there?

236
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,835
-How was it?
-Yes.

237
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,045
-I'm just curious
-I see.

238
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,923
-because I chose you.
-Yes.

239
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,467
-So I wanted to ask you.
-Ask Min-kyu.

240
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,429
If I get to meet him, I'll ask.

241
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,097
You should ask when you see him.

242
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,098
I will.

243
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,267
Anyway, I had a great time relaxing.

244
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,226
I see.

245
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,144
Yes.

246
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,312
-I see.
-Yes.

247
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:15,484
But to be honest, I thought you chose me

248
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,279
not because you actually liked me,

249
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,448
but because you only had two options.

250
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,032
I see.

251
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,161
I was surprised that you chose me.

252
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,871
You thought I wouldn't?

253
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:33,461
I just instinctively chose the person
I wanted to go to Paradise with.

254
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,795
Is that so?

255
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,964
-But I get it.
-Yeah.

256
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,510
But seriously…

257
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,514
-Ha-jeong isn't making a move on Ha-bin.
-Why isn't she flirting with her eyes?

258
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,851
-She isn't pulling her chin back.
-You're right.

259
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,312
-She looks too comfortable around him.
-Right.

260
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,980
Are you interested in anyone?

261
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,025
-Are you still thinking?
-I really have no idea.

262
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,736
Maybe the guy she likes
is on the other island.

263
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,154
-No.
-Good point.

264
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,657
We quickly became friends,
so I said that we were like siblings.

265
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,992
But now that I'm here,

266
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,702
maybe that was actually better.

267
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,870
-I mean…
-The comfort?

268
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,705
Since everyone's a stranger here,

269
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,457
-I'm not really sure.
-I get it.

270
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,334
I think Si-eun will go this time.

271
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,376
I think so too.

272
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,462
If I fail to go this time,

273
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,839
I'll cry in your arms.

274
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,258
-Sure.
-I'll cry in your arms.

275
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,427
What if no one finds a match?

276
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,845
-Really?
-That'd be fun too.

277
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,846
-Right?
-Yes.

278
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,098
At least one of our choices will overlap.

279
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:33,437
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

280
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,607
Please write down the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

281
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,985
on the Paradise-bound ticket
and put it in the mailbox.

282
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,783
Don't you think
Gwan-hee and Si-eun will go?

283
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,660
-They had chemistry.
-Yes.

284
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,205
They did, but we also need
to think about Ha-jeong.

285
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,124
I think Ha-jeong will pick Gwan-hee,
but he'll pick Si-eun.

286
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,293
-I see.
-This is what we were worried about.

287
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,129
It seems Ha-jeong and Si-eun
are going to pick Gwan-hee.

288
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,423
-Right.
-They have the same taste in men.

289
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,553
Si-eun was a difficult one to figure out,
but I can guess this much.

290
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,638
When she talked to the other guys,

291
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,183
she always talked
in a calm and composed manner.

292
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,228
But she seemed less that way
when she was with Gwan-hee.

293
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,647
-Right.
-She wasn't as composed.

294
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,483
She seemed a bit awkward
because she was nervous and excited.

295
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,528
Do you really think
Gwan-hee has no feelings for Ha-jeong?

296
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,655
I don't think he does.

297
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,991
-I think he does.
-I agree.

298
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:31,787
He just seemed to want to decide
after talking to both Ha-jeong and Si-eun.

299
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,455
This is what I think.

300
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,042
Gwan-hee described himself as mischievous.

301
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,796
-He did.
-But when he talked to Si-eun,

302
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,133
Gwan-hee didn't seem too interested.

303
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,302
He jokes around a lot with Ha-jeong,

304
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,471
because he seems comfortable around her.

305
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,432
-Because they have a good chemistry?
-Yes.

306
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,642
He might feel a connection
because of that.

307
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,352
-Since she's someone he can talk to?
-Right.

308
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,062
In any case, does this mean

309
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,565
Ha-bin and Won-ik won't get to go again?

310
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:11,619
I will now announce
the couples bound for Paradise.

311
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,052
The man who will be joining Yu Si-eun
on her trip to Paradise is…

312
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,811
I hope it's Gwan-hee.

313
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,188
Who will it be?

314
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,534
The man who will be joining Yu Si-eun
on her trip to Paradise is…

315
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,079
Son Won-ik.

316
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,873
Please hold hands and leave for Paradise.

317
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,917
-What?
-What?

318
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,044
-What?
-They chose each other?

319
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,504
Si-eun and Won-ik?

320
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,007
-Won-ik's sincerity must've come through.
-It seems so.

321
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,093
…Son Won-ik.

322
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,137
Please hold hands and leave for Paradise.

323
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,180
Hold hands here?

324
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,515
Okay.

325
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,066
It's so sudden.

326
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,115
-This way.
-You're wearing pink.

327
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,032
I am.

328
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,118
-You look great.
-Really?

329
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,995
I knew you'd look good in pink.

330
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,079
-You did?
-Yes.

331
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,540
We're going to Paradise.

332
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,709
We are.

333
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,549
Didn't time fly by today?

334
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,009
-It did.
-Right?

335
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,685
The man who will be joining Yun Ha-jeong
on her trip to Paradise is…

336
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,649
I'm sure Ha-jeong picked Gwan-hee.

337
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,151
-Right.
-So it's up to him.

338
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,069
I think he could've picked Ha-jeong.

339
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,362
-I agree.
-Do you think so?

340
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,739
-Yes.
-This is crazy.

341
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,591
The man who will be joining Yun Ha-jeong
on her trip to Paradise is…

342
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,718
Lee Gwan-hee.

343
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,596
Please hold hands and leave for Paradise.

344
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,059
See?

345
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,396
-They'll be fun to watch.
-Right.

346
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,982
-Yes.
-I think they'll hit it off.

347
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,901
…Lee Gwan-hee.

348
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,695
Please hold hands and leave for Paradise.

349
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,572
YUN HA-JEONG & LEE GWAN-HEE
SUCCESSFULLY MATCHED

350
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,366
-Do we have to hold hands?
-Here.

351
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,260
-Look at that fly flying around him.
-Oh, no.

352
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,970
-The timing is impeccable.
-I feel so bad.

353
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,305
It knew when to appear.

354
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,184
You must be glad
that you're going to Paradise

355
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,019
-You're also…
-two days in a row.

356
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,438
Same goes for you.

357
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,483
-Well, I'm…
-Don't act like it's not true.

358
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,114
If there's only one bed,

359
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,449
be nice and sleep outside.

360
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,368
-No, why should I?
-I want the bed too.

361
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,787
-Why should I sleep outside?
-Let's share, then.

362
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,580
Fine.

363
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,629
It has begun.

364
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,672
I love it.

365
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,550
-I can't wait.
-It'll be all or nothing with them.

366
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,301
-It's going to be intense.
-Yes.

367
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,306
Today's Paradise-bound
couple matching is over.

368
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,900
My choice was Yun Ha-jeong.

369
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,944
Gosh, Ha-bin.

370
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,614
-Things aren't working out for him.
-Seriously.

371
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,912
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is…

372
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,499
Son Won-ik.

373
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,750
NAME
SON WON-IK

374
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,962
I haven't really had a change of heart.

375
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,338
Now that I'm here,

376
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:38,635
I'm actually getting more curious
about what Jin-seok is up to.

377
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,766
Let's go, Gyu-ri.

378
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,893
Let's go, Min-kyu.

379
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,060
Let's go to Paradise!

380
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,729
-Let's go, Min-kyu.
-Let's go.

381
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,151
Put this on.

382
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,696
-Your ears will hurt a lot.
-Really?

383
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,282
I see.

384
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,757
What's that?

385
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,968
They must be going to Paradise.

386
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,229
-They must be taking that.
-Look at that!

387
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,521
-That was…
-There they go.

388
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,316
They deliberately flew by us. That's mean.

389
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,735
Gosh, seriously.

390
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,696
Enjoy all the delicious food.

391
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,407
Let's go in.

392
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,661
PARADISE
KIM GYU-RI & PARK MIN-KYU

393
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,246
What?

394
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,166
My gosh.

395
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,377
This is nice.

396
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,170
-It's really nice.
-It really is.

397
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,173
It's much better than I imagined.

398
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,883
It's better than the last place I went to.

399
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,679
Oh, my. It's nice.

400
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,930
This is crazy.

401
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:05,889
It's wonderful.

402
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,307
This has to be the suite.

403
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,351
-Seriously.
-Really?

404
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,561
-I don't know.
-Hey, look at this.

405
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,813
What's that?

406
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,981
It's a massage table.

407
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,276
There's a massage table in the hotel room?

408
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,905
It's so big that I might get lost.

409
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,616
-Should we sit? Let's sit.
-Sure.

410
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,412
Aren't you thirsty? I'll get you a drink.

411
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,540
-Let's try this.
-Sure.

412
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,958
-Are you on a diet?
-No.

413
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,459
-No, right?
-No.

414
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,711
You shouldn't be.

415
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,129
-We only had cucumbers.
-Yes.

416
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,052
This is really good.

417
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,929
I've really been craving chocolate.

418
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,389
Me too.

419
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:48,890
Same here.

420
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,684
You too?

421
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,352
Chocolate.

422
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:57,816
When we eat dinner later,
let's see if they have chocolate desserts

423
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,735
-and order them beforehand.
-Sure.

424
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,696
Do you like melons?

425
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,990
-Yes.
-Are there any forks?

426
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,868
-Look at the fruits.
-I'll bring them over.

427
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,956
This is so nice.

428
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,000
-So…
-It's nicer than I expected.

429
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:19,004
I'm curious about
what you do for a living.

430
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,547
Yes, me too.

431
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,090
-Yes, so…
-And your age.

432
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,091
Maybe 29?

433
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,468
-Who? Me?
-Yes.

434
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,429
I'm older than that.

435
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,097
I'm a bit old.

436
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,849
Then, are you 34?

437
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,726
-Yes, I'm 34.
-I see.

438
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,478
You aren't that old.

439
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,188
-You don't think I'm that old?
-No.

440
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,314
-Really?
-Yes.

441
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,107
What about you?

442
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,027
Are you 26?

443
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,195
Well…

444
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,989
You just lost your composure.

445
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,699
No, I didn't.

446
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,658
Are you younger?

447
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,202
I'm 28.

448
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,162
The international standard says you're 26.

449
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,831
I'm just joking.

450
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,166
So you're 28.

451
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,959
You really look much younger.

452
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,504
I mean, I would've never imagined.

453
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,965
-You just scored some points.
-Well, I mean it.

454
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,383
I was really surprised.

455
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,180
Let me try to guess
what you do for a living.

456
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,224
Or do you want to tell me?

457
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,893
I'm currently a model.

458
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,144
I see. You're a model.

459
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,481
Yes, I got a chance
to get into the industry back in school,

460
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,733
-and I've been a model ever since.
-I see.

461
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,029
I'm a model.

462
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,324
I started my modeling career

463
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:33,036
because I loved
that I could stand in front of a camera

464
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,913
and show what I was capable of.

465
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:39,960
I currently model
for fashion and beauty brands.

466
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,298
KIM GYU-RI, AGE 28
FASHION & BEAUTY MODEL

467
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,676
I see. I've been curious.

468
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,721
I wanted to ask earlier too,
but we weren't allowed to talk about it.

469
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,224
So I didn't know what to do.

470
00:23:56,434 --> 00:24:01,106
There were quite a few things
we laughed about together.

471
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,275
-And we only met today.
-Yes.

472
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,485
-It was cool.
-Yes, I thought so too.

473
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,654
I think we have the same sense of humor.

474
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,324
-The cucumber family joke?
-What?

475
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,661
EARLIER TODAY DURING LUNCH

476
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,954
-They're cute.
-Yes.

477
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,455
It's like a cucumber family.

478
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,709
A cucumber family?
Does that mean if someone eats one…

479
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,627
Would that make us homewreckers?

480
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,339
-Doesn't it suit me?
-It does.

481
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,675
I didn't think you'd laugh at that joke.

482
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,510
I thought it was a bad joke.

483
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,513
Thanks for laughing at my joke.
It was nice of you.

484
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,725
I laughed because you were funny.

485
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,271
This is the first time
Min-kyu's led a conversation.

486
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,191
He's usually quiet,
but he's so eloquent with her.

487
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,108
-Right?
-Yes.

488
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,361
We also look for
similar qualities in a partner.

489
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,238
Yes, we talked about that earlier.

490
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,990
Right. It took me by surprise.

491
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:56,119
It's one of the qualities I look for,
and I hadn't shared it with you.

492
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,538
-But you brought it up yourself.
-I see.

493
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,498
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON

494
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,126
I want to meet someone
who makes me comfortable

495
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,961
and has a positive influence on me.

496
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,924
Someone who lives life to the fullest
and motivates me to do the same.

497
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,759
-That's what I like.
-Me too.

498
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,885
-Really?
-Yes.

499
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,763
But it's not easy to tell
in the beginning.

500
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,807
-Yes, especially at a place like this.
-Right.

501
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:25,357
I bet we chose each other
for the same reason.

502
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,524
So why me?

503
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,319
-I felt a connection talking to you.
-Totally.

504
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,906
By the way,
I get why they named it "Paradise."

505
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,534
I'm looking forward to this.
I'm really excited.

506
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,207
Don't they seem similar?
They're both rather calm.

507
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,168
And it's not awkward
when they talk to each other.

508
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,463
-But…
-But I don't feel any romance.

509
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,967
Right? When two people
who have chemistry talk to each other,

510
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,302
-It's different.
-it doesn't matter what you say

511
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,845
because it's fun regardless.

512
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,306
Just looking at each other
should make them smile.

513
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,599
What's wrong with those two?

514
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,309
Does Gyu-ri feel shy?

515
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,186
-Maybe that's just how she is.
-Maybe.

516
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,854
-I guess so.
-You could be right.

517
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:09,401
INFERNO I

518
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,860
This isn't easy.

519
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,991
Who did you choose?

520
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,909
-Me?
-Yes.

521
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,494
I chose Gyu-ri.

522
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,453
What about you?

523
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,372
I chose her too.

524
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,046
It's starting to hit me.

525
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,510
To be honest,
I really thought Gyu-ri would pick you.

526
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,512
But you never know with people.

527
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,513
That's true.

528
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,933
Especially in such a short span of time.

529
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,893
But at lunch earlier…

530
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:44,936
Yes.

531
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,480
I kind of sensed something

532
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,441
when I saw Min-kyu and Gyu-ri talking.

533
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,525
You did?

534
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,738
There isn't enough time
to connect with others.

535
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,160
I think I get why people
try so hard to win the games.

536
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,540
-Right.
-We don't know how things will pan out.

537
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,458
Exactly.

538
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,295
Tomorrow will be another important day.

539
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,213
-Tomorrow?
-I wonder how it will go.

540
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,214
Me too.

541
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,759
Gosh, Min-woo.

542
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,055
He'll feel more and more anxious
if things stay that way.

543
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,599
He needs to do something
to win someone over.

544
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,809
-He has to win the games now.
-Right.

545
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,936
But I have to say,

546
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,481
this really isn't easy.

547
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,648
I know, right?

548
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,025
I'm not sure what I want.

549
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,944
To be frank,

550
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:39,366
every single lady here
is charming and beautiful,

551
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,744
but I don't think any of them are my type.

552
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:47,374
For now, I'm interested in Min-young.

553
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,918
-He's loyal.
-The piggyback ride played a big part.

554
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,295
-They hit it off nicely.
-Yes.

555
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,047
-They had good chemistry.
-Right.

PARADISE
YUN HA-JEONG & LEE GWAN-HEE

557
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,303
Finally.

558
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,225
-This place is amazing.
-What's so amazing about it?

559
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,142
It's the same.

560
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,061
-It is?
-Isn't it the same as before?

561
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,563
No, it wasn't for me.
This place is really nice.

562
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,108
You stayed in a nice room yesterday.

563
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,361
I guess this place is a little bigger.

564
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,323
These are real flowers.

565
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,491
-Really?
-Yes.

566
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,618
They're as beautiful as I am.

567
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,619
Sorry.

568
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,039
The bathroom looks the same.

569
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,834
We have two double beds.

570
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,751
You're right.

571
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,171
This is nice.

572
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,843
Which room do you want?
Do you want the living room or…

573
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,011
Why would I use the living room?

574
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,430
We can't share the room.

575
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,307
Gwan-hee, there are two couches out here.

576
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,978
I mean… This area's more spacious,
so I'll use that room.

577
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,521
I'll use the bedroom.

578
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,189
No, you stay here.

579
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,190
No way.

580
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,901
You can only leave your bag here, okay?

581
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,902
No.

582
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,904
I'm sleeping here.

583
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,452
I never even got to lie on a bed.

584
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,787
Gwan-hee, I want you to sleep on that bed.

585
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,749
-I'm going to sleep here.
-No, this is my bed.

586
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,126
-I already called dibs.
-No way.

587
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,836
This one's mine.

588
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,838
Hey, this is so nice.

589
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,841
Rock, paper, scissors.

590
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,177
How about the winner gets to decide?

591
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,430
Let's make a bet before we sleep.

592
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,473
Okay.

593
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,101
Ha-jeong plays along really well
with everything he says.

594
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,102
-Yes.
-Yes.

595
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,022
The way Gwan-hee talks isn't for everyone.

596
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,107
-Not everyone will get along with him.
-Right.

-Shall we get in the pool?
-Yes.

599
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,905
Let me go in first.

600
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,579
I'll see if it's warm.

601
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,212
I think it'll be cold.

602
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,174
It's this deep. Be careful.

603
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,009
Careful.

604
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,262
See how the water comes up to my chest?

605
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,973
-But it's cold.
-It is?

606
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,727
Be careful here. It suddenly gets deeper.

607
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,859
Are you okay?

608
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,195
-I'm on my tiptoes now.
-Are you?

609
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,157
Come this way. Let's go toward the wall.

610
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:27,909
I…

611
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,621
If we walk around,
we might find the shallower end.

612
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,414
-Tell me if it's too cold.
-Okay.

613
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:34,874
Seriously.

614
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,125
Okay.

615
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,214
Let's go over there.

616
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,132
It might be shallower.

617
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,760
I think it's shallower.

618
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,803
-Really?
-Yes.

619
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,473
It was a bit hard to breathe at first.

620
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,767
It's so cold.

621
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,106
It's better now.

622
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,206
Did you get to talk to Min-woo a lot?

623
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,958
-Is it okay to ask?
-Sure.

624
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,919
-I see.
-We talked…

625
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:24,007
I was wondering if you two talked a lot
while you two were alone.

626
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,426
It was just the two of us there.

627
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,343
Yes.

628
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,431
-So we only had each other to talk to.
-Right.

629
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:35,810
-And we had to work together as a team.
-I see.

630
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,728
Right.

631
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,438
So we did…

632
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,567
We did talk, but I'm not sure.

633
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,995
I'll stop asking.

634
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,414
I won't ask anymore.

635
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,504
But seriously, tell me if it's too cold.

636
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,756
I'm cold right now.

637
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,051
Let's go into the hot tub.
Look at the bubbles.

638
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,969
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

639
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,055
I'm cold.

640
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,564
I love your pedicure.

641
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,482
-These?
-Yes.

642
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,026
I wanted them to resemble the sea.

643
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,236
Everything I own is related to the sea.

644
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,738
I see.

645
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,782
-Aren't my toes pretty too?
-Yes.

646
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,493
-I didn't do anything to them.
-They're still very cute.

647
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,702
Do you think so?

648
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,287
Like this.

649
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,334
Your toes are so tiny and cute.

650
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,252
Aren't my toes pretty long?

651
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,714
Yours are so long.

652
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,258
-Your toes…
-Is that a compliment?

653
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,886
But I have tiny feet.

654
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,973
They're bonding over toes.

655
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,226
It's more intimate
than comparing hand sizes.

656
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,270
I had fun.

657
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,648
Me too. Time just flew by.

658
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,069
-Is it okay if I sleep on the extra bed?
-Sure.

659
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,826
This bed is so nice.

660
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,246
You seem very happy.

661
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,957
Wait, it's already 1:25 a.m.?

662
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,797
-I'll turn the lights off, okay?
-Of course. It's way past bedtime.

663
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,885
But take in the night view
before you sleep.

664
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,055
-I wish we had more time.
-Me too.

665
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:42,687
Are they going to split us up
like they did to you this morning?

666
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,439
I'm pretty sure they will.

667
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,025
That's really sad.

668
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,655
-She's so open about her feelings.
-She is.

669
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,033
That's just who she is.

670
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,452
-Yes, I guess so.
-Yes, that's it.

671
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,496
We had such a relaxing and fun time today.

672
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,456
We did.

673
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,626
I was thinking
that you have a great personality.

674
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,464
And I thought how I was right about you.

675
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,512
I know we should go to sleep,
but it's hard to end the conversation.

676
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,347
Gyu-ri, can I say one last thing?

677
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,391
Yes, sure.

678
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,101
You look great without makeup.

679
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,522
I really mean it.

680
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,445
-They're talking more with the lights off.
-You're right.

681
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,697
I know they're sleeping in separate beds,

682
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,951
but spending the night talking
to each other in the same room

683
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,954
feels like a pretty big deal to me.

684
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,207
It must feel romantic.

685
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,042
You can't do that with someone

686
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,835
-you're not attracted to.
-Right.

687
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,587
-What is it?
-I don't think…

688
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,255
-No?
-they'll end up together.

689
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,883
-Don't they seem interested?
-Even after all that?

690
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,928
Gyu-ri doesn't seem
very attracted to Min-kyu.

691
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,097
-That's just the way she is.
-Really?

692
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,017
Doesn't she seem to be
going out of her way to show her feelings?

693
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,230
That last conversation they had
just before they went to sleep

694
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:11,025
made me think,
"Maybe that's just how she is."

695
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,320
I feel like maybe she's the type
who just needs time.

696
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,240
Yes, maybe she needs time
to open up about her feelings.

697
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,367
-The cautious type.
-I guess that could be it.

698
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,327
PARADISE
YUN HA-JEONG & LEE GWAN-HEE

699
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,246
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

700
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,338
What's all this?

701
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,424
This looks great.

702
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,643
This is nice.

703
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,561
What's this?

704
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,730
It's alcohol.

705
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,399
Alcohol? Do you want a drink?

706
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,318
-Sure, if we can finish it.
-What do you say?

707
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,403
We can't finish it.

708
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,238
Gosh, it smells…

709
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,948
-How is it?
-I think it's strong.

710
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,908
How much can you drink?

711
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,827
I can't drink that much.

712
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,288
Is that why…

713
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,747
No, I just…

714
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,416
You're going to use this glass?

715
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,333
No.

716
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,085
-This glass?
-No.

717
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,587
Let's mix these.

718
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,630
Kaoliang liquor and beer?

719
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,841
-It's a thing.
-Kaoliang liquor and beer?

720
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,301
You must know your liquor.

721
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,468
No, not at all.

722
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,012
Cheers.

723
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,688
-Isn't it nice?
-Yes, it's nice.

724
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,939
-Right?
-Yes.

725
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,567
Dig in.

726
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,278
Bon appétit.

727
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,363
-What do you want?
-What's this?

728
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,364
-This?
-Yes.

729
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,409
I think it's chicken.

730
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,669
What's this?

731
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,464
No idea. Try it and see what it's like.

732
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,507
Are you sure about this?

733
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,551
-Just try it like this.
-Really?

734
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,220
Yes.

735
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,721
Try that one.

736
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,231
Look at the way she's looking at him.

737
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,774
-Exactly.
-It's her weapon.

738
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:15,691
Yes.

739
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,907
We wasted too much time
traveling around today.

740
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,535
I wish we'd just stayed here the whole day

741
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,621
after meeting this morning.

742
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,583
Did you know you'd come here with me?

743
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,671
Yes.

744
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,469
Since when?

745
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,140
About a minute after you got in the car.

746
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,393
-As soon as we met?
-Yes.

747
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,230
EARLIER THIS MORNING

748
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,523
What's your name?

749
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,901
My name is Lee Gwan-hee.

750
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,112
What's your name?

751
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm Yun Ha-jeong.

752
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,197
-Ha-jeong?
-Yes.

753
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,115
Yun Ha-jeong.

754
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,621
I see.

755
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,124
But why?

756
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,085
You didn't think we'd be back?

757
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,379
To be honest, I knew we'd come back.

758
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,380
-You did?
-Yes.

759
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,887
-What made you think so?
-I just had the feeling

760
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:31,309
that I'd end up coming here with you
the moment we first met.

761
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,727
-Really?
-Yes.

762
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,271
What?

763
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,023
Was it love at first sight?

764
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,110
It wasn't that, but I had this feeling.

765
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,278
Didn't you?

766
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,865
-She's pulling her chin back.
-The chin.

767
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,241
-Gosh.
-That move.

768
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,744
-It's become her trademark.
-Yes, seriously.

769
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,704
-It's now official.
-Yes, it's official.

770
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,913
-She used her move.
-Yes.

771
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,582
-It's a skill.
-Ha-jeong's chin move.

772
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,750
Ha-jeong's chin move.

773
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,129
It wasn't that, but I had this feeling.

774
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,297
Didn't you?

775
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,888
Well, yes. I think so.

776
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,389
Right?

777
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,726
How funny.

778
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,398
After spending time with Min-kyu,

779
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:23,361
you thought of coming here
with me as soon as we met?

780
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,363
Isn't that wrong?

781
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,114
You weren't any different.

782
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,657
In my case…

783
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,579
It's a little different for me.

784
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,747
How so?

785
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,502
Well, as for me,

786
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:43,923
I wanted to explore my options
and get to know other people.

787
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,466
I see.

788
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,552
That's how I felt when I met you.

789
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,595
Right, I see.

790
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,347
So what about you?

791
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,226
Do you have feelings
for both me and Min-kyu at the moment?

792
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,143
Well…

793
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,105
That's not weird, right?

794
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,400
Then tell me.

795
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:06,320
Was Min-kyu your top pick
among the three guys?

796
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,279
Yes.

797
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,073
Is he close to your ideal type?

798
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,293
Why are you asking me that?
You said you had a great time yesterday.

799
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,170
I did.

800
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,175
That's why it'd be nice
to see her one more time.

801
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,510
-Who?
-I want a chance

802
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,847
to spend more time
with the girl I met yesterday.

803
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,848
Go ahead.

804
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,809
Meet her.

805
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,602
-How? She's not here.
-Right.

806
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,729
Ask for her. Or go back.

807
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,443
That was tense.

808
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,361
Things just got awkward.

809
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,113
What's wrong with them?

810
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:52,199
They're really something.
Neither of them is giving in.

811
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,244
-So this is how it's done.
-They're both good at this.

812
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,248
I feel like I need to meet her again
to know for sure.

813
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,917
I see.

814
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,420
I don't feel that way.

815
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,348
I guess you don't have
any questions for me.

816
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,184
I do.

817
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,644
But we're in the middle of a meal.

818
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,062
You don't seem to have any.

819
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:24,732
You think so?

820
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,695
Come on. Why would I have picked you then?

821
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,033
Maybe you were curious.

822
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,453
I don't know.

823
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,496
What about you?

824
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,207
What do you want to ask me?

825
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,709
Not much.

826
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,670
-No?
-I think I know how old you are.

827
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,506
Oh, no.

828
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,049
-Seriously?
-Look at her.

829
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,512
What's wrong with him?

830
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,181
Not much.

831
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,226
-No?
-I think I know how old you are.

832
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,146
And I think I know
what you do for a living.

833
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,231
You're wrong.

834
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,483
You got it all wrong.

835
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,528
I haven't even told you
how old I think you are.

836
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,532
I have a feeling
that you'll guess my age right.

837
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,367
Fire away.

838
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,331
-No, you'll get it wrong.
-Around 31?

839
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,250
Really?

840
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,834
Thirty-one.

841
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,422
Did I get it right?

842
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,300
Stop joking around. Do I really look 31?

843
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,719
-Should I get serious?
-Yes.

844
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,346
Thirty-two.

845
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,769
-Gosh, is he serious?
-Seriously.

846
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,981
His guesses are always high.

847
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:47,982
That's Gwan-hee.

848
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,234
-He's just messing with her.
-Right.

849
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,944
-That's so annoying.
-Is he joking?

850
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,029
-I can't tell.
-He's feeling her out.

851
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,906
He's quite mischievous.

852
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,620
You can't be serious.

853
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,122
You can't be in your twenties.

854
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,206
-Me?
-Yes.

855
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,750
Are you kidding me? I am in my twenties.

856
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,294
Just tell me. How old do I look?

857
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,211
Twenty-eight?

858
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,754
No.

859
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,843
You can't be 26.

860
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,428
I am.

861
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,265
So you were born in 1998?

862
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,516
Yes.

863
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,601
Show me your ID.

864
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,687
-I'm serious.
-You have your bag? Let's see your ID.

865
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,439
What's your zodiac year?

866
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,565
Tiger.

867
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,900
-So you were born in 1998?
-Yes.

868
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,944
When were you born?

869
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,489
-I was born in 1988.
-In 1988?

870
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,533
Well, it seemed obvious

871
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,619
that you're older than me.

872
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,413
But that was really mean.

873
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,500
Honestly, I'm a little hurt.

874
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,296
You just give off that vibe.

875
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:56,675
The way you talk and the way you walk

876
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,636
just seem a bit…

877
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,845
Old?

878
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,096
No, it's…

879
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,225
Wait. I don't mean it in a bad way.

880
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,895
You just look experienced, that's all.

881
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,314
-In what way?
-That's the vibe you give off.

882
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,942
If we talked over the phone,
I would've thought you were older than me.

883
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,653
I see.

884
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,905
What on earth is he doing?

885
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:21,659
He should just keep
his mouth shut right now.

886
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,455
Seriously, you really need
to stop provoking me.

887
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,333
I'm ten years older, so show some respect.

888
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,460
What? I refuse.

889
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:36,840
By the way, I don't recall
telling you to speak casually to me.

890
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:41,762
But you started talking casually
as soon as we got in the helicopter.

891
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,101
It's not like we're three
or four years apart.

892
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,812
-Are you serious?
-Ten years is a big gap.

893
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,939
-Are you one of those boomers?
-Yes, I am.

894
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,148
-Really?
-Yes.

895
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,733
Fine, I'll be more respectful.

896
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,195
Okay, but I'll continue to speak casually.

897
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,823
-No way. Then I'll talk casually too.
-I'll speak…

898
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,284
You thought I was 31 anyway.

899
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,869
-That's my bad.
-Yes.

900
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,038
Make better guesses next time.

901
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,542
She's tough.

902
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,794
It's like watching a sitcom.

903
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,880
Ha-jeong's playing along well
instead of getting offended.

904
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,632
-It means they really click.
-Yes.

905
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:20,926
Yes, this is good. They're a good match.

906
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:25,180
Now that I know your age,
I'll have to change my guess

907
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,849
about what you do for a living.

908
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,226
See? I told you that you were wrong.

909
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,145
-I think I know your job.
-No.

910
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,312
That's wrong too.

911
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,318
So your job is…

912
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,028
I just have an office job.

913
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,948
An office job? What do you do?

914
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,492
I work for a clothing company.

915
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,788
What about you? What do you do?

916
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,790
I'm a YouTuber.

917
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,584
-Really?
-Yes, I'm a YouTuber.

918
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,501
Really?

919
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,003
-Yes, I'm a YouTuber.
-Really?

920
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,880
Don't I seem familiar?

921
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,798
No, I've never seen you.

922
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,925
-No?
-I don't watch boring YouTubers.

923
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,554
How do you know I'm boring?

924
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,389
It's just obvious.

925
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,184
-Well, I do have a YouTube channel.
-Yes?

926
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,269
But I'm also into sports.

927
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,481
There's this sport called basketball.

928
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,901
I spend a bit more time
playing basketball.

929
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,110
Really?

930
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,405
Do you like

931
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,949
tall guys?

932
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,285
Yes.

933
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,746
-You like tall guys?
-Yes.

934
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,875
Isn't Min-kyu taller than me?

935
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,044
I heard he's around 193 cm.

936
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,673
I'm not sure. I don't remember.
I must be drunk. I don't remember.

937
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:48,347
Out of all the guys and girls here,
I'm most curious about Min-kyu.

938
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,307
Why? Because he spent time with me?

939
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,683
No, it's just that…

940
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,190
Ha-jeong is so cute.

941
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:02,319
She gets her hopes up about something
then she gets let down soon after.

942
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,446
She easily shows it on her face.

943
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,447
"Why?"

944
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,116
This is so much fun.

945
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,120
No, it's just that the guys told me

946
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:19,169
that he and I look similar
and give off similar vibes

947
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,338
but have opposite personalities.

948
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,382
Yes, but you don't look similar either.

949
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,468
What's your take?

950
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:31,807
Your facial features
are round and cute like a puppy.

951
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,141
-Me?
-Yes.

952
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:38,647
On the other hand,
Min-kyu looks like a dinosaur.

953
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,775
-You two are different.
-You think we're different?

954
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,443
You're completely different.

955
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,989
What's your ideal type?

956
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:47,906
My ideal type?

957
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,203
Someone who's tall and looks like a puppy.

958
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,043
Oh, my god.

959
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,795
-She made her statement.
-It's big.

960
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:04,131
-She made it crystal clear for him.
-Yes.

961
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,926
-How about personality?
-Personality?

962
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,554
A guy less talkative than I am.

963
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,181
-He can't be more talkative?
-No.

964
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,309
And I don't like loud men.

965
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,519
-Really?
-Yes.

966
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,190
So am I the talkative type
or the quiet type?

967
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,358
Just average.

968
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,194
-Average?
-Average, but more on the quieter side.

969
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,492
So you don't like talkative guys.

970
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,785
No.

971
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,371
I get your ideal type.

972
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,542
You've said enough.
We're not a good match.

973
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,298
-I'm really talkative.
-You are?

974
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,594
Are you done eating?

975
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,930
I'm not done with my questions.

976
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:55,932
You have more to ask?

977
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,477
Yes, I didn't get to ask you much.

978
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,728
What's your ideal type?

979
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,229
-My ideal type?
-Yes.

980
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,858
My ideal type is…

981
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,527
I think

982
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,698
you're pretty close to my ideal type.

983
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:14,951
What…

984
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,204
She's getting her hopes up.

985
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,164
I feel dizzy.

986
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:26,046
…you're pretty close to my ideal type.

987
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,635
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

988
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,849
It kind of felt like…

989
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,397
you already knew quite about me
before we came here.

990
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,817
I felt…

991
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,028
-I don't know much about you.
-It's because of the way you talk

992
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,613
and your tone of voice.

993
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,450
I mean, it's a lot of things

994
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,495
including the vibe you give off.

995
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,790
That's what I find amazing.

996
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,125
-I see.
-Yes.

997
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,296
Is my face red?

998
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,134
-No, you look fine.
-Really? That's a relief.

999
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,762
I'm feeling a little hot.

1000
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,144
I'm starting to wonder
how we were able to get to this point.

1001
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,061
-With me?
-Yes.

1002
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:23,979
What about me?

1003
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:25,814
What do you mean?

1004
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:30,026
I'm starting to feel
like we've gotten closer.

1005
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:30,944
Really?

1006
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:34,364
From my perspective,
it felt like you were the one who started…

1007
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,075
You joked around with me first.

1008
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,495
I joked around because…

1009
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,290
Oh, we both think
the other person made the first move?

1010
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:47,294
That's how I felt.
So it felt like you were the one

1011
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,130
who took the first step.

1012
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,716
-So you could too?
-So I tried to reciprocate…

1013
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,177
-You took it further?
-by taking things further.

1014
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,428
Really?

1015
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,307
I tend to keep my guard up at first.

1016
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:06,438
It was never really easy for me
to start anything

1017
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,984
with the people I had feelings for.

1018
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,402
Really? Why?

1019
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:17,032
Because neither one of us
really made the first move.

1020
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,617
I see.

1021
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:22,788
As for me,

1022
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,208
I go for it when I like someone.

1023
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,168
-You just go for it?
-Yes.

1024
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,753
I just tell them how I feel.

1025
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,546
Like I did earlier.

1026
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,425
-What do you mean?
-When we talked at our lodging,

1027
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,010
-Yes?
-you asked me something,

1028
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,470
and I pointed at you.

1029
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,935
Who do you want to talk to?
I can ask him to come over.

1030
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:46,603
You.

1031
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,397
Me?

1032
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,902
This is both good and bad.

1033
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,780
As you know,
it's hard for me to hide how I feel.

1034
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:57,697
Right.

1035
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,866
-It shows.
-It just shows?

1036
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,660
It instantly shows on my face.

1037
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,703
-Right.
-It's impossible to hide.

1038
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,039
-Really?
-It's pretty bad.

1039
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,922
I just realized something.
I think I get it now.

1040
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,382
Get what?

1041
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:19,386
I think I left
a really good first impression on you.

1042
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,303
Okay.

1043
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,723
And I bet you like me even more now.

1044
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,771
What was that?

1045
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,858
-Gosh, Gwan-hee.
-He's really something.

1046
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,401
You're the best, Gwan-hee.

1047
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,903
-They're both so good at this.
-He's just too much.

1048
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,197
Are you serious?

1049
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,240
Am I right?

1050
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,869
No, I just want to get out of here.

1051
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,622
You must have high self-esteem.

1052
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,207
I do too.

1053
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,543
-You do?
-Yes.

1054
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,169
-I can tell.
-Right?

1055
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,504
You can tell, right?

1056
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:57,340
I haven't felt this way in a while,

1057
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,010
but I think I've met my match.

1058
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,261
Is that so?

1059
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,724
Good luck doing the rounds.

1060
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,520
Do you think I'll end up
coming back to you?

1061
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,148
You won't pick anyone else.

1062
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,316
-You think so?
-Why bother?

1063
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,692
-Seriously?
-Yes.

1064
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,528
I think you will too.

1065
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,739
You think I'll also end up…

1066
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,991
-You think?
-You'll eventually choose me.

1067
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,453
You'll end up picking me in the end.

1068
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,789
-How are you so confident?
-You'll eventually come back to me.

1069
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,833
-What makes you so confident?
-What?

1070
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,251
I just have a feeling.

1071
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,128
Don't you agree?

1072
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:39,841
NEXT EPISODE

1073
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:44,387
Starting from today,
the two Infernos will merge into one.

1074
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,849
This place is going to give me
a heart attack.

1075
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:51,144
There's more to consider
now that we're all together.

1076
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:53,480
What if he suddenly loses interest in me?

1077
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,858
This place is making me feel
all kinds of new feelings.

1078
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,819
I'm attracted to three people.

1079
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,279
Her, her, and her.

1080
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:06,409
I'm upset with your behavior.
Do you think I'm being jealous?

1081
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,620
This is driving me crazy.

1082
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,080
I'm so stressed.

1083
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,332
If you're done with me, then so am I.

1084
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,209
I want to win and take first place.

1085
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,419
I didn't want to lose him to anyone else.

1086
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,089
I think a new participant is here.

1087
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,966
Who could it be?

1088
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,258
She left a strong impression.

1089
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,803
She's totally different.

1090
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,180
-Do you think I'm pretty?
-Of course, you are.

1091
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,181
Didn't you know?

1092
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,768
I love you.

1093
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,259
