SINGLE'S INFERNO

00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,742
-It's her.
-Oh, it's…

14
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,868
-It's A-rin.
-A-rin.

15
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,994
A-rin.

16
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,919
-Someone's coming.
-What?

17
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,587
-Someone's coming.
-You're right.

18
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,256
You're right.

19
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,717
Why is Theo so funny?

20
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,638
He's so transparent.

21
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:39,891
You're right.

22
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,484
-Hello.
-Hello.

23
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,571
-Hello.
-Hello.

24
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,073
-Hello.
-Have a seat.

25
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,158
-Have you eaten yet?
-No, not yet.

26
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,452
We'll need to cook more eggs.

27
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,537
I'll just…

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,455
-I'll make them.
-Thank you.

29
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,665
-I'll go too.
-Okay.

30
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,916
Just wait a little.

31
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,292
We'll do it for you.

32
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,003
Two eggs?

33
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,466
Over here?

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,385
Did you just eat it like this?

35
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,469
-Yes.
-You scrambled them?

36
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,637
And with rice.

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,180
We just made scrambled eggs.

38
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,099
-I'll fry the rice for you.
-Okay.

39
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,475
Chef's special.

40
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,727
I don't know how I can help.

41
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,357
I was really nervous
about meeting new people again

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,692
in a new environment.

43
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,611
But they stepped forward
to take care of me,

44
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,280
so I was moved.

45
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,158
Can you finish all of this?

46
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,742
This is all for you.

47
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,327
I'll take that.

48
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,080
I first thought
she was bright and beautiful.

49
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:49,085
When I first saw A-rin,
I thought she had a very pure look.

50
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,296
In terms of looks, she's not my type,

51
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,589
but she's still very pretty.

52
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,923
Men are all the same.

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,051
WOMEN'S INFERNO

54
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,971
-You think the guys are curious too?
-Of course.

55
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:04,434
Only one of us is there right now.

56
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,477
-Right.
-They must be.

57
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,480
I guess A-rin isn't coming back.

58
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,942
-She went alone and hasn't come back yet.
-Right.

59
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,529
Wow, it was an important battle.

60
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,823
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON

61
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,575
Now, the women will play a game.

62
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,663
The winner will move
straight to the Men's Inferno.

63
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,332
-Just first place?
-That's it?

64
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,298
Gosh.

65
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,142
-Who won?
-Kim Hye-jin is out.

66
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,646
My nose.

67
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,857
-She hit her nose.
-It must've hurt.

68
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,403
We'll move straight to the finals.

69
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,288
In the chicken fight
to head to Men's Inferno,

70
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,208
the winner is Kim A-rin.

71
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,253
I somehow won.

72
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,132
I wonder what they're up to.

73
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,636
Probably chatting away.

74
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,845
Must be fun.

75
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,224
Your earrings are so big.

76
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,476
They're noisy too.

77
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,144
They suit you.

78
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,229
Thank you.

79
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,897
-Lucky her.
-Seriously.

80
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,024
-It must be nice.
-Lucky her.

81
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,027
Have you been speaking
casually with the guys?

82
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,821
No. Should the two of us do that?

83
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,283
-Okay.
-Sure.

84
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,826
-All right.
-Okay.

85
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,371
We're so low on dopamine right now.

86
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,914
We need a real boost.

87
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,249
An energy boost.

88
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,459
I prefer "T" types.

89
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,003
That's my personality.

90
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,255
Really? That's my type.

91
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,010
Theo!

92
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,178
Why is he so funny?

93
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,347
-He's charming.
-He's hilarious.

94
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,932
-He's the life of the party.
-Yeah.

95
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,642
What if he can't go to Paradise?

96
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,852
I don't think he will.

97
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,780
Let's get ready to go.

98
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,325
I don't want to go back to Inferno!

99
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,951
PARADISE
YUK JUN-SEO & CHUNG YOU-JIN

100
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,037
I…

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,371
-Yeah?
-I…

102
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,040
What?

103
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,416
While I was waiting…

104
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,834
-Yeah?
-I drew…

105
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,795
I drew something while I was waiting.

106
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,255
-Really?
-Yeah.

107
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,592
-I just drew this.
-It's so pretty.

108
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,595
I was looking that way,
and it caught my attention.

109
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,472
The curtains had been drawn a bit.

110
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,684
THIRTY MINUTES AGO

111
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,035
-So sweet.
-Right?

112
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,704
He saw something pretty
and wanted to give it as a gift.

113
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,916
That's such a sweet gesture.

114
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,459
-It's impressive.
-I agree.

115
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,003
The covered windows looked pretty.

116
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,130
-And the flowers were there.
-That's so sweet.

117
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,715
-It has a title.
-What is it?

118
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,175
-Waiting.
-The title…

119
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,093
Yeah.

120
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,345
-Waiting?
-Endless Waiting.

121
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,431
"Endless"? Was I taking that long?

122
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,810
Write down the title and sign it for me.

123
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,311
-Please.
-Okay.

124
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,440
I was just kidding though.

125
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,943
But I really like it.

126
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:48,241
Because you were endlessly waiting,
but the pretty flowers caught your eye.

127
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,742
You're right.

128
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,829
-Thank you.
-For the memories.

129
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,957
-Who knows if we'll get another chance?
-Thanks.

130
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,917
-I'll treasure it.
-Okay.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,836
You're so sweet.

132
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,543
He must've gotten hurt.
He's showing her.

133
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,628
-You're right.
-Just stop.

134
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,280
I feel sick.

135
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,781
I'm nauseous.

136
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,701
Do you feel sick?

137
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,286
She's nauseous.

138
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,954
I wonder what he'll do for her.

139
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,016
Give me your hand.

140
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,953
I was feeling sick on the helicopter.

141
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:01,082
He kept massaging my hand until we got off
even though I said I was fine.

142
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:06,546
The way he kept looking out for me
felt so sweet,

143
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,631
and it made me really swoon.

144
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:20,935
She seems fine now.

145
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,812
-She's fine.
-She looks happy.

146
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,438
That's not easy.

147
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,523
-Like I said…
-Yes.

148
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,735
It's not easy to calmly
come up with a clear solution.

149
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,738
The worst thing to do here
is pat them on the back.

150
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,241
No, it's asking the pilot to slow down.

151
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,577
-"Mr. Pilot!"
-I would have raised my hand.

152
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,538
-"Excuse me. She's sick!"
-"Producers, please help!"

153
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,128
Gosh.

154
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,258
What was that sound?

155
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,552
The couples who went
to Paradise yesterday…

156
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,058
cannot return to Inferno together today.

157
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,520
What does that mean?

158
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,691
Ladies, please get out of the helicopter.

159
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,611
Bye, Jun-seo.

160
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,448
-You-jin packed her bags really fast.
-Yes.

161
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,741
-Bags were first.
-You see it?

162
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,117
"Bye, Jun-seo."

163
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,996
Bye, Jun-seo.

164
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,583
Gosh, I guess I have to
carry this by myself.

165
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,085
I knew it.

166
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,631
-Oh, no.
-Bye.

167
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,299
-Seriously?
-Bye, Jun-seo.

168
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,759
-Make it back alive.
-Bye.

169
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,469
Goodbye.

170
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,012
No.

171
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:38,929
Bye.

172
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,974
What's going on?

173
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,771
It was disappointing.
I kept thinking about him.

174
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,439
Rather than being disappointed,

175
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:52,360
I was more excited
about what would happen next.

176
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,779
I was wondering who else was there.

177
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,489
I've only met one person.

178
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,200
My curiosity kicked in right away.

179
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,701
Yes.

180
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,830
MEN'S INFERNO

181
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,500
What do you guys think the newcomers
will be like?

182
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,501
Are you excited?

183
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,337
Who's the prettiest on Women's Inferno?

184
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,588
I'm the prettiest.

185
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,839
-Really?
-Yes.

186
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,511
I see them.

187
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,262
What?

188
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,056
They're the ones who went to Paradise.

189
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,103
Hello.

190
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,896
-Hello.
-Hello.

191
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,523
Hello.

192
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,775
What's going on?

193
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,776
-Welcome.
-This is…

194
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,237
Why are you so late? We've been waiting.

195
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,488
Theo is making a move.

196
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,281
Say "yo" again.

197
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:43,869
-Welcome.
-This is…

198
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,122
Why are you so late? We've been waiting.

199
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,291
-What is this?
-Is this our lodging?

200
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,376
It's that way.

201
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,293
Okay.

202
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,753
Hello.

203
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,880
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

204
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,424
Why are you here?

205
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,342
I got here yesterday.

206
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,802
-Really?
-Yes.

207
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,679
Te-hwan isn't good at mingling.

208
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,596
Right?

209
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,014
-Right?
-He wants to.

210
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,058
-It's unnatural.
-I know, right?

211
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:06,976
He's hesitating.

212
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,811
He keeps hitting the brakes.
It's so funny.

213
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,896
Want me to carry your bags?

214
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,231
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

215
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,566
Thank you. It's so heavy.

216
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,692
-Why are you here?
-It is.

217
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,694
-I got here yesterday.
-Yes, thank you.

218
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,532
Want me to carry your bags?

219
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,201
Thank you. It's so heavy.

220
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,119
It is.

221
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,037
Yes, thank you.

222
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,710
Right as I was thinking I should meet
at least three people before deciding,

223
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,044
three people came.

224
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,339
From that point on,
I slowly started to think about my choice.

225
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,633
Hello.

226
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,843
-Hello.
-How are you?

227
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,511
-Hello.
-How are you?

228
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,680
-Nice to meet you. I'm Jang Theo.
-I see.

229
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,640
-What's your name?
-Lee Si-an.

230
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,017
-Lee Si-han?
-No.

231
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,227
-I see.
-It's Si-an.

232
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,188
-What's your name?
-Chung You-jin.

233
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,314
-You-jin.
-You-jin.

234
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,482
I'm Jang Theo.

235
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,442
-Tae-ho?
-Theo.

236
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,194
I see. Theo.

237
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,362
I'm Kim Te-hwan.

238
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,198
-Kim Te-hwan?
-Yes.

239
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,616
I'm Kook Dong-ho.

240
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,993
-Dong-ho.
-Kook Dong-ho.

241
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,454
Have you been here since yesterday?

242
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,498
Yes, since yesterday morning.

243
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,665
We were left behind.

244
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,000
-I see.
-I see.

245
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,127
-It seems better here.
-My gosh.

246
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,838
It feels a bit more open.

247
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,298
Yes, and our lodging is great too.

248
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,883
-Really?
-This is Paradise.

249
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,800
For real.

250
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,681
In You-jin's case,

251
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,226
when she smiles or even just in general,

252
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,019
she gives off a bright energy.

253
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,730
That made me curious and interested.

254
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,983
I'm more drawn to Si-an.

255
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,985
She seems like she'd be aloof.

256
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,154
But I bet she's not once you know her.

257
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,908
Si-an seemed a bit cold at first glance.

258
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,868
It felt difficult to approach her.

259
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,788
So I thought I should talk to her first.

260
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,499
You-jin smiles and laughs a lot.

261
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,501
She seems to have
a nice, friendly personality.

262
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,712
It felt like they were contrasting types.

263
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,883
Did you become close
with the person you went to Paradise with?

264
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,051
How was it?

265
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,511
First off…

266
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,557
It was really fun.

267
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,433
I enjoyed it a lot.

268
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,019
I didn't have any moments
that were not fun.

269
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,230
So it was fun,
but it didn't make you swoon?

270
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,940
Was that too on the spot?

271
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,066
-Okay.
-Well…

272
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,234
No comment?

273
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:26,949
But rather than that fluttery feeling,
I think I had more of a fun time.

274
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,033
How was it for you?

275
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,287
How was it?

276
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,288
Me?

277
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,833
I think I swooned quite a bit.

278
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,335
-Really?
-Yeah, for me.

279
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,838
That fluttery feeling was stronger
than the feeling of fun?

280
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,591
It was both, and it was relaxing.

281
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,592
Seriously?

282
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,801
-That's…
-Incredible.

283
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,679
-That's so…
-Isn't that the best combination?

284
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,306
I think so.

285
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,766
I thought it'd be nice
to have a boyfriend like him.

286
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,769
-That's how nice it felt.
-It was that good?

287
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,272
He seemed like a great person.

288
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,190
It's a wrap.

289
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,192
To that extent? That's amazing.

290
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,777
It's exactly how we saw it.

291
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,279
-Right.
-Yes.

292
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,156
And…

293
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,409
-I just…
-She's totally smitten!

294
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,620
-She looks so smitten!
-No.

295
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,371
Your face has turned red.

296
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,665
-You're so into him.
-No, I just…

297
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,086
There were moments
where I wasn't prepared, so…

298
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,172
So it was…

299
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,342
I just kept…

300
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,427
-It made you smile.
-Yeah.

301
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,889
Even when I was in bed, I kept…

302
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,016
-I kept thinking about it.
-To that extent?

303
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,142
That's amazing.

304
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,603
I just kept smiling.

305
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,188
So I swooned a bit.

306
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,734
It must've been fun.

307
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,658
I'm scared.

308
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,117
Singles.

309
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,579
Today, there will be another
Paradise-bound couple matching.

310
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,707
My hands are shaking.

311
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,794
We will start
the couple matching in an hour.

312
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,004
Shall we get going?

313
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,965
Let's go.

314
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,526
Hello.

315
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,528
-Hello.
-Hello.

316
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,698
-Can I sit here?
-Of course.

317
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,661
What brings you here?

318
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,870
I chose to come here.

319
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:37,955
-Really?
-Yes.

320
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,291
I wanted to talk to you too.

321
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,376
-Really?
-Yes.

322
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,837
-That's nice.
-It is.

323
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,214
I like your necklace. It's stylish.

324
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,384
Look at all those pearls.

325
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,681
-Would you like some water?
-Yes, please.

326
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,890
Where do we get water?

327
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,811
Water? I worked really hard
to bring some earlier.

328
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:01,729
Don't get up.

329
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,194
Move.

330
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,699
You're a pretty tough guy.

331
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,243
What is he doing?

332
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,786
What did he do?

333
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,414
He doesn't hesitate with his actions.

334
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,957
But…

335
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,417
Wasn't that unnecessary?

336
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,173
So you chose to see me first?

337
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,924
Why?

338
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:32,843
You seemed…

339
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,222
a bit unapproachable,
so I took it as a challenge.

340
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,724
-Really?
-Yes.

341
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,061
I was most excited to talk to you.

342
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,479
-Right.
-I chose you first.

343
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,897
So I can assert myself.

344
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,608
To intimidate me?

345
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,403
Why does Theo keep wanting
to assert himself?

346
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,906
So I can assert myself.

347
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,617
To intimidate me?

348
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,785
What I mean is

349
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,120
first impressions matter.

350
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,373
Your personality seems very…

351
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,254
-What?
-You're very manly.

352
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,548
-I'm not.
-You seem like a tough guy.

353
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,550
I'm just messing around.

354
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,389
I prefer people who are bold

355
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,141
and straightforward.

356
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,601
-I like talkative…
-Easygoing?

357
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,894
-And easygoing people.
-Right.

358
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,564
-If we fight, they're intense and shout.
-I see.

359
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,775
And they don't hold grudges. That's great.

360
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,320
That is exactly me.

361
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,238
Really?

362
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,031
Goodness.

363
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,367
Goodness gracious.

364
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,287
Should I send a video message
to my future mother-in-law?

365
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,998
-Come on.
-Hold on, Theo.

366
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,166
Slow down a bit.

367
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,377
-He's in a rush.
-Yeah.

368
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,296
It's almost like a whirlwind, isn't it?

369
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,883
Should I send a video message
to my future mother-in-law?

370
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,721
I've never met anyone like you.

371
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,598
That's a compliment, right?

372
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,225
-I'll take it that way.
-I mean…

373
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,061
-Too bad if it's not.
-You're very unique.

374
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,065
Si-an seemed to enjoy our conversation.

375
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,484
I thought, "She's a bit crazy like me."

376
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,319
I felt we clicked pretty well.

377
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,905
In terms of personality,
she's my ideal type.

378
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,492
A-rin.

379
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,911
-Did you have a good chat?
-Yes.

380
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,622
How was it for you?

381
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,042
Since we just met,
we were all a bit awkward.

382
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,754
But we still have to make
a decision with these circumstances.

383
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,382
-We do.
-It's so difficult.

384
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,259
Even though we talked a lot…

385
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,177
Right.

386
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,971
With decisions,

387
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,056
when it's time to decide…

388
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,016
Yes?

389
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,185
You have to go with your gut.

390
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,353
You can't decide before that.

391
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,521
-Really?
-Yes.

392
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,233
We're very…

393
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,359
different.

394
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,528
-That's what I think.
-I…

395
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,155
-Yes?
-I don't want to regret.

396
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,950
I believe you have to think things through
carefully to have less regrets.

397
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,955
When it comes to things like relationships
and having feelings for someone,

398
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,751
I don't think it's good
if you can logically explain it.

399
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:14,379
I need something that goes
beyond that for me to pursue it.

400
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:19,218
If it doesn't go beyond that,
I don't consider it attractive.

401
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,429
He was just fascinating
and funny to watch.

402
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,724
He was so unique and different from me,
which made me curious.

403
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,935
I spent a lot of time thinking about that.

404
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,854
So what was your first impression of me?

405
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,440
When I first saw you,

406
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,693
you resembled a cat.

407
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,820
That's what I thought.

408
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,405
What do I resemble?

409
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,492
A carrot…

410
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,244
-I look like a carrot?
-No!

411
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,997
You're like a cute donkey.

412
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,332
-A donkey?
-Yes.

413
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,126
It's okay. I like that.

414
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,675
You're very cute.

415
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,176
-I'm cute?
-Yes.

416
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,637
You have a cute look.

417
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,930
Donkeys are cute.

418
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,849
That's a memorable answer.
I've never heard that before.

419
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,976
Really?

420
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,146
When she said I resembled a donkey,
I was amazed in a good way.

421
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,526
What's your ideal type?

422
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:22,864
Personally, I think
I don't smile very often.

423
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,368
When I see someone
who smiles a lot, it makes me melt.

424
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,248
You prefer puppy-like faces,

425
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,833
but I'm a donkey.

426
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,834
No.

427
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,877
-I like it.
-You just smiled.

428
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,129
I did?

429
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,006
You look much better with a smile.

430
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,882
-Okay. I'll try to…
-Yeah.

431
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:45,012
Smiling is hard
when I'm conscious of it.

432
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,640
When I look at you,
I want to make you smile.

433
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,808
-Me?
-Yes.

434
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,102
-Go ahead, then.
-Wait.

435
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,564
Look! You're smiling again.

436
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,525
You're just looking at my mouth now.

437
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:03,363
It's much more attractive when you smile.

438
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,242
You smiled.

439
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,160
Wait…

440
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,287
I keep looking at your mouth now.

441
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,583
Smile. You look better when you do.

442
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,500
Okay.

443
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,085
-You're so funny.
-I'll stop.

444
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,632
What is this? It's oddly amusing.

445
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,800
It is.

446
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,929
Then, in that case,

447
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,099
do you have an ideal type,
in terms of looks or personality?

448
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,644
Even if someone's appearance
perfectly matches my ideal type,

449
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,105
their way of speaking or their actions

450
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,441
can instantly change my opinion of them.

451
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,818
You must pay attention to details.

452
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,571
You look and watch,
not just at the big picture.

453
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,740
Yes, that's right. I tend to do that.

454
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,827
For me, someone who's positive
and has a beautiful smile

455
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,913
is my ideal type.

456
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,623
I like cheerful people.

457
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,875
I think we're similar.

458
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,835
We both seem to focus

459
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,838
on the vibe or the energy of someone.

460
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,549
That's why it's hard.

461
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,344
-It's not easy to know right away.
-I agree.

462
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,388
Even if I think someone is my type,

463
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:15,060
like you said earlier,
things can change as you talk.

464
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,312
You could be eating
sweet potatoes together

465
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,232
and suddenly find yourself
becoming curious.

466
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,193
You're right.

467
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:29,491
Dong-ho approached me
with a serious, sincere vibe.

468
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:34,412
I felt like he was
the most in tune with me.

469
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,625
How was it?

470
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,253
Your first impressions of us.

471
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,004
They were good.

472
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,635
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

473
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,761
How old are you?

474
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,763
We can't…

475
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,890
-I must be crazy.
-It's okay. It happens.

476
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,684
"I must be crazy." That's so cute.

477
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,436
-Doesn't he seem young?
-He does.

478
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,813
-Yeah.
-Right?

479
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:04,025
-He's young and trying to act experienced.
-You're right.

480
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,528
How old are you?

481
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,071
We can't…

482
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,157
-I must be crazy.
-It's okay. It happens.

483
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,533
Your name is Si-an.

484
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,868
-Yeah.
-I'm Te-hwan.

485
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,120
-Right, Te-hwan.
-Yes.

486
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:18,498
-Are you usually calm like this?
-Me?

487
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,499
-Yes.
-I am.

488
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,002
-I'm calm but…
-Yes?

489
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,837
When my playful side comes out…

490
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,505
-I see. That's inside you.
-Yes.

491
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,259
When that comes out, it's hard to control.

492
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,095
But I can't show that side of me here.

493
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,680
-So I'm holding back.
-Why not?

494
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,348
-Just be yourself.
-Should I?

495
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,559
-Some might find it more charming.
-Really?

496
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,102
You might regret saying that.

497
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,062
It could be too much to handle.

498
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,648
-I'll try to keep it under control.
-Okay.

499
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,816
Do whatever you want.

500
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,861
-I think that'll be more attractive.
-I see.

501
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,655
That makes me feel more at ease.

502
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,616
Yeah, just act natural.

503
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,830
It seems like Te-hwan
is younger than Si-an.

504
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,249
It's like she was talking
to her cute younger friend.

505
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,668
-She seemed to have more control.
-Right.

506
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,671
And Dong-ho seems to be
doing well overall in this group.

507
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,882
Doesn't he give off a genuine vibe?

508
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,426
He might be a stronger candidate
than we expected.

509
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,595
-Right. I think he'll get a lot of votes.
-Yeah.

510
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,971
Who do you think he'll choose?

511
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,681
-Si-an.
-Si-an.

512
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,599
-Si-an?
-Yeah.

513
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:22,479
I have a feeling that most of the guys
will end up choosing Si-an.

514
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,814
You-jin did get along with Dong-ho too.

515
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,568
What's going to happen to Theo?

516
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,320
He's quirky.

517
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,823
But once you fall for Theo,
you might not be able to break free.

518
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,992
We need to see more of his charm though.

519
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,285
It's all or nothing.

520
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:38,954
Seriously.

521
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,581
PARADISE-BOUND COUPLE MATCHING

522
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,335
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

523
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,760
Chung You-jin.

524
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,846
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

525
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,682
and deliver your ticket.

526
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,353
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

527
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,447
Kook Dong-ho.

528
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,616
Kook Dong-ho.

529
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,454
Here.

530
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,998
CHUNG YOU-JIN SELECTED KOOK DONG-HO

531
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,759
Kook Dong-ho.

532
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,555
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

533
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,223
and deliver your ticket.

534
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,437
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

535
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,156
I think he chose Si-an.

536
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,658
-He got along well with You-jin too.
-True.

537
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,493
It'll be either Si-an or You-jin.

538
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,706
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

539
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,458
Kim A-rin.

540
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,127
Kim A-rin.

541
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,216
-What?
-What?

542
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,844
That was unexpected.

543
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:18,887
-Seriously.
-What?

544
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,764
KOOK DONG-HO SELECTED KIM A-RIN

545
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,015
Thank you.

546
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,946
I did feel attracted to You-jin
when I first saw her.

547
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,783
But I still chose A-rin,

548
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:43,661
because after we talked last night
and on the swings earlier today,

549
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,707
my desire to continue
our conversation grew.

550
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,210
Just because I feel attracted
to another person

551
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:55,673
doesn't change the fact
that I was curious about A-rin first.

552
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,468
That's why my decision will stay the same.

553
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,305
I guess he had his own principles.

554
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,682
-You need to take a number.
-Right.

555
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,226
-You have to wait your turn.
-Yeah.

556
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,229
Kim A-rin.

557
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,399
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

558
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,234
and deliver your ticket.

559
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,321
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

560
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,793
Jang Theo.

561
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,254
Jang Theo.

562
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,257
-What?
-What's going on?

563
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,968
I didn't expect that at all.

564
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,931
KIM A-RIN SELECTED JANG THEO

565
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,025
No one will find a match at this rate.

566
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,861
Right? What if no one gets to go?

567
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,824
Jang Theo.

568
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,578
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

569
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,288
and deliver your ticket.

570
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,000
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is

571
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,168
Lee Si-an.

572
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,004
Lee Si-an.

573
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,922
What's wrong with him?

574
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:20,967
"Lee Si-an."

575
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,552
"What's wrong with him?"

576
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,180
What's wrong with him?

577
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,432
JANG THEO SELECTED LEE SI-AN

578
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,641
What on earth?

579
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,412
Kim Te-hwan.

580
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,957
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

581
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,501
and deliver your ticket.

582
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,754
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is

583
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,963
Lee Si-an.

584
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,847
KIM TE-HWAN SELECTED LEE SI-AN

585
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,694
Lee Si-an.

586
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,114
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

587
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,783
and deliver your ticket.

588
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,790
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

589
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,177
All three of them were very different.

590
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,346
They're really different.

591
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:54,394
Dong-ho has such a nice smile.

592
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,481
I found myself constantly laughing

593
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,149
and I wanted to make him laugh.

594
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,485
I think he's been on my mind a bit.

595
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,780
Theo is…

596
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,574
He's a bit weird.

597
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,995
Should I send a video message
to my future mother-in-law?

598
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,415
He's weird, but I'm kind of curious too.

599
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:21,296
Te-hwan didn't really leave
much of an impression on me.

600
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:26,050
I didn't feel any attraction
while talking to him.

601
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,760
If she picks Theo, they can go?

602
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,970
-Yes.
-That makes one couple?

603
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,889
It's with either Theo or Te-hwan.

604
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,181
-Right.
-Yes.

605
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,850
It just can't be with Dong-ho.

606
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,355
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

607
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,948
I hope one couple makes it.

608
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:49,991
-Yes.
-At least one.

609
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:50,909
-Theo.
-Theo.

610
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,327
-It'll be Theo.
-Let's go.

611
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,078
It'll be fun if she chooses Theo.

612
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,207
Jang Theo.

613
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,251
Jang Theo.

614
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,342
That's right.

615
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,177
He has that kind of charm.

616
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,094
Right.

617
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,347
-If you fall for that weird charm…
-Right.

618
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,514
You can't escape.

619
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,725
Jang Theo.

620
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,358
Stop it.

621
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,527
LEE SI-AN SELECTED JANG THEO

622
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,375
Today's Paradise-bound
couple matching is over.

623
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:46,381
Couples that have matched,
please hold hands and leave for Paradise.

624
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,642
Stop! What are you doing?

625
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,314
Theo isn't faking it.

626
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,358
-He's genuine, so it's charming.
-Right.

627
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,818
-Genuine insanity?
-Yeah.

628
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,571
Stop! What are you doing?

629
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,785
-She's shaking her head.
-She's like, "No."

630
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,041
I'm so happy.

631
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,877
-Aren't you happy?
-But…

632
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,129
What's wrong with you?

633
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,965
-Seriously, what's with you?
-What's wrong?

634
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,967
-What's the problem?
-I mean…

635
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,677
It's annoying.

636
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,970
-Really?
-Yes.

637
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,805
Isn't that a good thing?

638
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,890
No?

639
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,893
This couple is going to be fun.

640
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,186
Right.

641
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,104
Theo is funny.

642
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,566
One thing for sure is
every time Si-an thinks of Theo,

643
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,900
she can't stop laughing.

644
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:48,818
-Yeah.
-Right.

645
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,738
It's a good thing when thinking
of someone makes you laugh.

646
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,865
Comedians often marry beautiful women.

647
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,074
-Right.
-That's true.

648
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,576
You can't beat a good laugh.

649
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,618
-Yes.
-You're right.

650
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,246
There's something about it
that really hooks you.

651
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,049
It's disappointing.

652
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:18,639
I wonder if I misread the signs
or if there was another reason.

653
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,726
I think this is really Inferno.

654
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:29,942
Not being chosen
by anyone is a bit upsetting.

655
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:34,489
I'm suddenly starting to miss Jun-seo.

656
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:39,077
Among all those women,

657
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,414
Jun-seo chose me right away,
and I'm beginning to miss him.

658
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,462
I kind of regret it now.

659
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,342
If I'd carefully thought about it,
I would've picked Dong-ho for sure.

660
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,968
I thought, "Was I too hasty?"

661
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,179
A wave of regret suddenly washed over me.

662
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,890
I realized the person
I was curious about

663
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,476
might not feel the same about me.

664
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,980
I think it might make her uncomfortable
if I continue to express my interest.

665
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,400
If there's a chance
to talk to others in Inferno,

666
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,238
I'd like to chat with You-jin
since we only spoke briefly.

667
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,448
Her turn is over.

668
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,617
-She's used up her turn.
-Yeah.

669
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,535
Next in line.

670
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,744
-"Next!"
-It's over?

671
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,454
-He's moved on now.
-Her turn's over?

672
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,372
Yes.

673
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,998
She needs to take another number.

674
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,250
-You have to wait.
-Yes.

675
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,793
This is crazy.

676
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,259
LET'S GO, SI-AN!

677
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,564
I don't think we need these.

678
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,745
My goodness.

679
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,997
Did you see his moves?

680
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,707
He was so casual.

681
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,292
-And he grabbed her hand.
-I know.

682
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,960
-My heart skipped.
-Can we replay that?

683
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,253
-He was playing and…
-Again.

684
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,130
Can you show us his hands again?

685
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,382
-What happened was…
-It was sleight of hand!

686
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,009
-How does he do it?
-I mean…

687
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,399
That's crazy.

688
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,109
That gave me the chills.

689
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,904
I got goosebumps.

690
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,155
He must be a pro.

691
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,281
-He is.
-"A pro"!

692
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,199
He's a pro.

693
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,950
He was smooth like flowing water.

694
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,868
-I know.
-Really.

695
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,704
-All of it.
-Si-an even gave her own hand.

696
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,623
He held his hand out and grabbed it.

697
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,898
Your second ride probably
isn't as exciting, right?

698
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,107
That's not true.

699
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:21,989
It's beautiful.

700
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,950
So beautiful.

701
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,164
What did I just see?

702
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,208
Things that seemed odd at first

703
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,294
are slowly becoming charming
the more we see him.

704
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:39,006
If Si-an goes and comes back
completely smitten with Theo…

705
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,217
-Right.
-Then, we have to give him respect.

706
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,219
-For sure.
-It means he's charming.

707
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,764
PARADISE
JANG THEO & LEE SI-AN

708
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,769
This is amazing.

709
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,735
Look at the night view.

710
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,281
The night view here is nice.

711
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,996
It smells delicious.

712
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,039
Pizza.

713
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,582
Since we're hungry…

714
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,626
-Eat first? Sure.
-Let's eat.

715
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,337
Enjoy your meal.

716
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,047
Enjoy!

717
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,091
Hot sauce?

718
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,884
Yes.

719
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,469
Actually, I don't want it.

720
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,684
Let's speak casually.

721
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:33,811
Then…

722
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,771
How old are you?

723
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:36,856
My age?

724
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,066
I'm 29 years old.

725
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,318
I was born in 1994.

726
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,739
-Why are you so happy?
-I'm not. So you're older than me.

727
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,491
-Yeah, I am.
-I see.

728
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,410
-It's obvious that…
-You think you're older?

729
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,828
Yeah.

730
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,872
You look young.

731
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,498
How old do you think I am?

732
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,584
-Twenty-four.
-Twenty-four?

733
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,961
Twenty-seven?

734
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,129
-Twenty-six.
-Twenty-six?

735
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,464
Yeah, I was born in 1999.

736
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,631
-In 1999?
-Yes.

737
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,093
No wonder.

738
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,597
There's something vivacious
about the way you act.

739
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,765
-Vivacious?
-Yeah.

740
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,476
I like that.

741
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,561
-Right?
-Yeah.

742
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,813
-A good selection of words, right?
-Totally.

743
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,317
-I've never heard that description before.
-You have that in you.

744
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,488
That's why I think
I was more drawn to you.

745
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,575
That surprising charm
and contrast made a big impact.

746
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,370
What do you do for a living?

747
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,121
I used to act.

748
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,957
I was going to quit a few years ago.

749
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,085
I met bad people and got stressed out.

750
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,294
-Acting?
-Yeah.

751
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,212
I see.

752
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:44,298
I felt like it was hurting me.

753
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:50,679
So just when I had given up acting,
I got the chance to film a movie abroad.

754
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,808
And acting in English was so much fun.

755
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:58,521
So that's when I decided
I wanted to pursue acting abroad.

756
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,898
-So what do you do?
-So my dream is…

757
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,360
My dream is to become
an actor in Hollywood.

758
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,114
I'm an actor.

759
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,286
My ultimate dream is to act in Hollywood.

760
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,416
Recently, I've been trying to find
opportunities to act overseas in English.

761
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,752
JANG THEO, AGE 29
ACTOR

762
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,921
A few months ago,
I just went to New York alone

763
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,340
and took acting classes near Broadway.

764
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,301
-It was…
-That explains a lot.

765
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,387
I was so happy every day in New York.

766
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,266
You're pretty adventurous, right?

767
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,183
I am.

768
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,937
But after talking to you like this,

769
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,232
you seem completely different.

770
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,692
It's a new vibe.

771
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,943
-It is?
-Yeah.

772
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,111
Is it exhilarating?

773
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,447
Yeah, it is.

774
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,159
You have a great personality.

775
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,493
I love it.

776
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,831
I really focus on personality.

777
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,167
Well, I'd be lying if I said
I don't care about looks.

778
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,794
Just say you care about looks.

779
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,046
You should say you care most about looks.

780
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,840
I only care about looks.

781
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,720
We really click.

782
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,849
If you're done eating…

783
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:17,808
Let's go.

784
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,816
I think long skirts
look really good on you.

785
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,569
When you walked out of the lodging…

786
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,239
-Your heart skipped a beat?
-Yeah, for real.

787
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,367
Is that your necklace?

788
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,622
-Didn't you mention it earlier?
-I did.

789
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,915
That's why I kept it on.

790
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,210
For you.

791
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,893
Your eyes are so…

792
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,479
-They're puppy-like.
-Mine?

793
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,980
-Yeah.
-Really?

794
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,774
-Like a puppy's?
-Yeah.

795
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,567
Really?

796
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,985
I've never…

797
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,320
I've never heard that before.

798
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,615
For women, I'm pretty hit-or-miss.

799
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,786
Many people are scared of
or don't like me since I look fierce.

800
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,748
They usually can't approach me easily.

801
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,167
Isn't it like that with you too?

802
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,919
-People think you're cold?
-And I hate it.

803
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:27,836
Really?

804
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,718
That's why I try to smile more
and make them feel comfortable.

805
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:36,679
That's surprising.

806
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,597
You resemble a cat,

807
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,100
but you're really like a puppy.

808
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,060
As we talk more,

809
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,814
you're so different
from my first impression of you.

810
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,107
-Really?
-Yeah.

811
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,317
At first, it felt like you were thinking,

812
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,987
"You seem fun.
Let's see what you're about."

813
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,905
-Me?
-Yeah.

814
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,827
I was intimidated when I first saw you,
so that's why I may have felt that way.

815
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,537
But you're so kind and gentle.

816
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,581
When we first met,

817
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,541
you caught my attention first.

818
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,458
-Really?
-Yeah.

819
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,543
Why?

820
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,796
Because of your looks.

821
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,133
Because I looked fierce?

822
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,175
No.

823
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,304
-You're handsome and put together.
-Really?

824
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,346
-Yeah.
-Put together?

825
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,264
Yeah.

826
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,516
That's interesting.

827
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,980
Your view of me is the exact opposite
of what most people think.

828
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,318
In terms of looks,
I'm not husband material.

829
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,447
No, you're good-looking.

830
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,032
Thanks. You're pretty.

831
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,663
What was that?

832
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,166
-It's a bit…
-The way they flirt…

833
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,292
Seriously.

834
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,209
I'm immersed.

835
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,338
He has such a fierce presence.

836
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,589
-Yeah.
-Theo?

837
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,759
He said, "You're pretty" so naturally.

838
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,428
It's as if he's lived
in the US for 30 years.

839
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,805
I was also impressed by Si-an.

840
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,642
When she was with Jeong-su yesterday,

841
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,645
it felt like she was trying
to match his vibe.

842
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,939
Today, I feel like she showed
more of her true self.

843
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,484
-She was being herself today.
-Right?

844
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,861
They didn't say much,
but I was so immersed.

845
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,989
And they complimented each other a lot.

846
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,534
I felt a strange sense
of excitement watching them.

847
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,079
I honestly don't know.

848
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,998
What it felt like was…

849
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:32,169
It seems like they're honestly expressing
with words how they feel,

850
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:36,298
but I still don't quite feel
the sincerity from them.

851
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,968
So I really don't know
what I can say for certain yet.

852
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,721
I'm really not sure.

853
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,056
But one thing's for sure.

854
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:47,476
Si-an is slowly being drawn to Theo.

855
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,686
It's slowly happening.

856
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,275
It's deep.

857
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,658
I love it.

858
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:06,662
Dog paddle.

859
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,249
-It's nice though.
-It's so nice.

860
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,335
You can't swim at all?

861
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,294
I can swim.

862
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,629
Let's race.

863
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,214
You said you know how to swim.

864
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,674
-Any style?
-The breaststroke?

865
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,342
Breaststroke? Let's do it.

866
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,597
Go.

867
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,267
Hey, why are you doing freestyle?

868
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,873
Impressive. That was cool.

869
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,249
I thought my trunks came off.

870
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,585
If they do, pretend not to see.

871
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,380
Want some champagne?

872
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,176
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

873
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,305
-Do I look okay?
-Totally.

874
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,848
-I do? Do I look sexy?
-Very sexy.

875
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,932
-Amazing?
-Amazing.

876
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,601
-You're in trouble.
-I am.

877
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,524
You're just so…

878
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,027
unfiltered.

879
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,155
Just completely unfiltered.

880
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:24,740
Thanks.

881
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,159
I'm being serious.

882
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,911
I take it as a compliment.

883
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,538
-Without any affectations.
-Right.

884
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,499
-Without being fake.
-You're not fake.

885
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,386
Having fun?

886
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,388
It seems like it.

887
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,900
Seriously, I'm having so much fun.

888
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,113
It would've been fun on Inferno too.

889
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,532
Even on Inferno?

890
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,534
-With you.
-With me?

891
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,662
Who you're with is what matters.

892
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,666
I'll work hard
to chop firewood for you.

893
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,626
And I'll cook warm meals for you.

894
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,877
-Okay.
-Got it?

895
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,129
I'll fetch water for you too.

896
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,548
I'll go into servant mode.

897
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,716
Gosh.

898
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,301
What? Are you touched?

899
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,554
Yeah, I'm touched.

900
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:31,682
Say it.

901
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,813
This is romantic and nice.

902
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,865
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

903
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,995
I'm glad I came to Paradise with you.

904
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:53,912
-Really?
-Yeah.

905
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,207
I've laughed so much since we came here.

906
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,292
Really?

907
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,836
Her whole body is facing towards him.

908
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:04,006
That's a clear sign
from her body language.

909
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,299
It's twisted around.

910
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,675
This…

911
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,427
This pretty much says…

912
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,679
That pose really suits you.

913
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,974
That makes it very clear.

914
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,892
-She's opened up to him.
-Right?

915
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,104
I've laughed so much since we came here.

916
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,272
Really?

917
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,482
You made a wise decision earlier then.

918
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,775
You wrote down my name.

919
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,861
-I had to think about it though.
-Really?

920
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:27,863
Really now?

921
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,197
I'm not curious.

922
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,198
You're not?

923
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,284
We ended up here, didn't we?

924
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,994
That mindset is very…

925
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,537
You don't get jealous either?

926
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,539
Of course, I get jealous.

927
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,083
Who doesn't get jealous?

928
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,753
If you like someone, it's only natural.

929
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,172
But…

930
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,967
For things I can't control…

931
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,763
-You're…
-They're separate events.

932
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,640
For example,
who you went to Paradise with.

933
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,266
Of course, I'm curious.

934
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,351
But I don't want to ask.

935
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,811
And I think, "I bet it's nicer with me."

936
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,691
I knew I had to talk to you.

937
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,901
You mean that in a good way?

938
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,902
Yeah, definitely.

939
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,947
Let's have fun
when we get back to Inferno.

940
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,532
Let's do it.

941
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,287
This couple makes you smile.

942
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,539
Just watching them makes me content.

943
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,958
Theo didn't even do much.

944
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,795
He didn't say anything impressive.

945
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,546
But he did say impressive things.

946
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,090
-Like?
-"I'll chop firewood for you."

947
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,217
-How is that impressive?
-"I'll fetch water."

948
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,802
He's saying he'd do anything for her.

949
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,471
-He's expressing himself.
-It's too much, but it doesn't seem so.

950
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,389
Right.

951
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,016
-Is that so?
-He basically promised her the stars.

952
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,184
It's too much.

953
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,978
-But it magically doesn't seem like it?
-He's so nonchalant.

954
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,107
WOMEN'S INFERNO

955
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,027
I'm going to be genuinely
so happy to see them.

956
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,821
-Whoever it may be.
-Me too.

957
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,197
I agree.

958
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,908
They're not coming together, right?

959
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,993
-As a couple?
-As a couple.

960
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,912
What if they walk in holding hands?

961
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,837
-Hey.
-Goodness.

962
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,553
Is it a couple?

963
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,096
-No.
-No, it's a guy.

964
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,180
They're two guys.

965
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,265
My gosh.

966
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,725
-No, it's a couple.
-No, it's not!

967
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,101
No?

968
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,650
But aren't they the same guys
from yesterday?

969
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,403
-Maybe not. They're so far away.
-What's going on?

970
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,487
I think they are.

971
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,989
-They are.
-The guys from yesterday?

972
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,032
Aren't they the two who came yesterday?

973
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,242
You're right.

974
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,077
My goodness.

975
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,582
To the women,
they're the guys who didn't pick them.

976
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,668
If you think about it…

977
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,336
-There could be some resentment.
-True.

978
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,796
-Right.
-That'll be awkward.

979
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,425
Let's get up and welcome them.

980
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,718
-Welcome them?
-"They're here."

981
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,927
-They didn't pick us.
-Right.

982
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,304
-We have to welcome them?
-Right.

983
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,638
"Welcome."

984
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,640
"Yes, I see."

985
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,934
Still, I'm glad to see them.

986
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,312
-Don't clap.
-Let's not do that.

987
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,399
They're coming.

988
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:12,778
Hello.

989
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,363
Did you have a good trip?

990
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,116
-Hello.
-Hello.

991
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,576
Hello.

992
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,787
-Why are you out here?
-What?

993
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,663
-Why are you outside?
-To greet you.

994
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,706
-To greet you.
-Really?

995
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,333
-To welcome you.
-There are two seats.

996
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,335
-Make yourselves at home.
-Okay.

997
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:32,255
-Want to try lifting this bag?
-Is it heavy?

998
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,217
I can't lift it.

999
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,803
You packed so much
to have fun in Paradise.

1000
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:38,720
Right?

1001
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,806
-Are you coming back from Paradise?
-Yes.

1002
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,726
It was a bit annoying.

1003
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,814
I was a bit angry.

1004
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,358
Honestly, I was really glad
to have people come.

1005
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:55,862
But I was happier since it was
the same guys from yesterday.

1006
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,157
-Did you have fun?
-I've only heard about Inferno so far.

1007
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,826
-"Only heard about"?
-That's so mean!

1008
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,619
-"Only heard about"?
-That's so mean!

1009
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:03,703
Seriously.

1010
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,957
Well, Inferno hasn't been so bad…

1011
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,501
-It's not bad. We chopped firewood.
-Really?

1012
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:13,171
You said you wanted to greet us,
but you're all just sitting.

1013
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,215
-Should we dance?
-I'm kidding.

1014
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,133
-It's great to see you.
-I'm kidding.

1015
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,805
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1016
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,890
I was so curious
about what you were up to.

1017
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:28,186
I thought you had met the guys
and bonded already.

1018
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,272
-We haven't met them yet.
-Not even once.

1019
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,608
-We're the first?
-You're all we've met so far.

1020
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,235
You must've been pretty bored.

1021
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,529
What did you three do all day?

1022
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,656
-We just…
-We would just chat all day.

1023
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,199
-And chop firewood.
-Right.

1024
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,117
Firewood?

1025
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,118
-Make fires.
-Cook.

1026
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,578
-Those?
-Yes.

1027
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,621
LAST NIGHT

1028
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,040
It worked. That's so cool!

1029
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,750
-Cool!
-It worked!

1030
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:51,751
That should do it.

1031
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,963
-Okay.
-Incredible!

1032
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,923
They actually chopped firewood.

1033
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,091
Yeah, you just need to try.

1034
00:52:58,174 --> 00:52:59,426
Gosh.

1035
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,767
No, I'm hungry.

1036
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,312
Seriously, let's eat a lot. Okay?

1037
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,022
Let's eat all the rice in there.

1038
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,106
Yeah, we should.

1039
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,774
Starting the fire was so tough.

1040
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,651
-You do this.
-You did it like that?

1041
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,612
-Like this…
-We couldn't do it at first.

1042
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,239
We took the flint shavings,
and it finally sparked.

1043
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,408
-That's right.
-Now that Jun-seo's here…

1044
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,618
-No.
-Don't worry.

1045
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,535
Are you good?

1046
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,245
-I think you would be.
-Yes, with sticks…

1047
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,538
What makes you say that?

1048
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,497
You're very…

1049
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,208
-The survival expert.
-Really?

1050
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,002
I'll try. Just tell me what to do.

1051
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:34,961
That's reassuring.

1052
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,004
Make him do everything.

1053
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,839
Not too much.

1054
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,883
-Do everything for us.
-What?

1055
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:40,884
Like, "Hey, Jun-seo."

1056
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,302
I'll do what I can.

1057
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,888
Jun-seo is so cute.

1058
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,973
His sunglasses are slightly crooked too.

1059
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,976
She has a sharp eye.

1060
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,311
Like, "Hey, Jun-seo."

1061
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,646
I'll do what I can.

1062
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,024
I feel like you'd be INTP.

1063
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,443
-I think you're ISTP.
-ISTP.

1064
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,861
-ISTP and INTP.
-Right?

1065
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,279
-ISTP.
-Why?

1066
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,949
-Why?
-You seem like you'd be ISTP.

1067
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,116
-Really?
-Yes.

1068
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,661
How did you guess right in one try?

1069
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,912
-What are you?
-INTP.

1070
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,205
-Really?
-Yes.

1071
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,623
-You're an "N" type?
-Yes.

1072
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,916
-Really?
-Yes.

1073
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,376
-Why?
-You seem like an "S."

1074
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,293
-Really?
-Yes.

1075
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,962
Aren't "S" types realistic?

1076
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:17,879
Yes.

1077
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:21,257
I just sit around all day,
spacing out and daydreaming.

1078
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,384
I'm an "N" type.

1079
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,844
-I see.
-INTP.

1080
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,477
Finally, I think now…

1081
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,396
-It'll be fun.
-Right? It feels fun now.

1082
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:38,942
The impression I got
from these guys yesterday is a bit…

1083
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,568
-It's different.
-It's different today.

1084
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,613
-I feel like we're closer than yesterday.
-You're right.

1085
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,907
-Just like that?
-We saw them for 30 seconds.

1086
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,534
Right.

1087
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,704
-We didn't get a chance to talk yesterday.
-None at all.

1088
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,873
I was pretty intimidated.

1089
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,836
After talking to Jun-seo,
he didn't seem like a scary person.

1090
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:58,837
-Yeah.
-Right.

1091
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,756
-He seems to have a bit of a clumsy side.
-I agree.

1092
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,259
I'm curious to know more about him.

1093
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:05,885
-Jun-seo?
-Really?

1094
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,888
I'm still curious about both of them.

1095
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,142
I feel like there might be
a surprising side to his personality.

1096
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,059
So I'm curious.

1097
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,854
People who look like that
are usually the kindest.

1098
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:16,771
True.

1099
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,066
I'll keep my eye on them.

1100
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,903
They all seem to be interested in Jun-seo.

1101
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:27,407
Jun-seo seems to trigger
one's maternal instincts.

1102
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,325
-You want to take care of him.
-Yeah.

1103
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,287
And he's sensitive.
That seems certain.

1104
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,622
-Yes.
-Jeong-su gives off a manly vibe.

1105
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,082
He's boyfriend material.

1106
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,500
But in the beginning,

1107
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:41,921
aren't you usually more drawn to someone
with a unique character like Jun-seo?

1108
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,632
Personally, this may be
too much information,

1109
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,217
but there's someone I'm into.

1110
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,260
-What?
-Really?

1111
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,554
If I was there,
I'd go to Paradise with her.

1112
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,972
-With who?
-Who is it?

1113
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,265
Ji-yeon.

1114
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,266
Ji-yeon?

1115
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:58,063
She reminds me of a more athletic Sana.
I'm a fan of Sana as well.

1116
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,564
Isn't it because you like Sana?

1117
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,982
I do see the resemblance.

1118
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:04,736
But that's not the reason.
I think she has a very attractive look.

1119
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,404
-She does look like Sana.
-I see it.

1120
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,447
She looks like her.

1121
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,574
Earlier, I only watched
Ji-yeon the whole time.

1122
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,159
Really?

1123
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,328
If I came in first, I'd choose her.

1124
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,246
You're a host.
Shouldn't you watch everyone?

1125
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,164
Right.

1126
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,543
Cheers.

1127
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,461
With this?

1128
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,298
I think they'll get along well.

1129
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,092
-I'm curious about these two.
-Yes.

1130
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,010
You just want to see Ji-yeon, right?

1131
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,137
That's part of the reason.

1132
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,473
Is it good?

1133
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,977
You didn't steam them yourself, right?

1134
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:38,895
-Me?
-Yes.

1135
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:39,938
I did steam them.

1136
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:40,897
-Yesterday?
-Yeah.

1137
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,065
-Really?
-No.

1138
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,903
You seem like you'd be a good cook.

1139
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,154
I do enjoy cooking.

1140
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,074
I cut myself chopping wood yesterday.

1141
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:51,991
-Really?
-Yeah.

1142
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,952
-I cut myself here.
-Be careful.

1143
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,162
Avoid physical work if you can.

1144
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,705
Can you do it for us?

1145
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,124
-Well, I'm also…
-We asked…

1146
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,208
Your hand!

1147
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:01,960
"Well, I'm also…"

1148
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,170
"I'm also"!

1149
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,296
I love it.

1150
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,591
This is great.

1151
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,009
-Well, I'm also…
-We asked…

1152
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,010
Your hand!

1153
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,180
-We're in the same boat.
-Yes, we are.

1154
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,934
Still, I'll do anything you ask me to do.

1155
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,062
You've seen everyone.

1156
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,356
-All the women.
-I did.

1157
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,400
-You're the only one.
-Yes.

1158
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,485
What was your first impression of me?

1159
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:28,987
My first impression of you? Well…

1160
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,197
-Second in line, right?
-Yes.

1161
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,323
You were right beside her.

1162
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,285
Were you wearing green also yesterday?

1163
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,203
-No.
-Sorry.

1164
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,205
-No.
-Sorry.

1165
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,250
I shouldn't talk.
That would be better for me.

1166
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,461
-It'll be better for you?
-Yes.

1167
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:47,505
Your hair and everything
seemed so vibrant.

1168
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,674
I guess that's why I thought
of a primary color.

1169
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:53,261
-So you did stand out.
-I see.

1170
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,680
-May I ask you something too?
-Sure.

1171
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:59,601
I stared at everyone with a frown.
And then, I left with someone.

1172
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,227
-Right.
-How did you feel then?

1173
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:05,231
-You chose the person right next to me.
-Yes, right next to you.

1174
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:07,066
So…

1175
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:11,112
In my mind, I was like, "Hmph!"

1176
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:14,949
Hmph!

1177
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,160
That's so cute.

1178
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,332
-They look nice together.
-Yes.

1179
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,584
-I want to keep watching.
-Yes, it's nice.

1180
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,503
You have a kind heart.

1181
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,547
What do you think I would've done?

1182
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,758
-Let's say it happened to me.
-If roles were reversed?

1183
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,593
"Damn it."

1184
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,513
Right. "Darn. Fine, then."

1185
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,598
I think you would've said that,
like a tough guy.

1186
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,434
Your reaction of "Hmph" was too nice.

1187
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,314
But how do you pull off this color?

1188
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,900
-This?
-Yes, do you like this shade?

1189
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:49,943
-Well…
-This green?

1190
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,195
I like things with a bit of color.

1191
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,697
-Does it look good?
-It matches your hair.

1192
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,698
-Really?
-Yeah.

1193
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,494
Are you keeping the sunglasses on?

1194
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,663
-Should I take them off?
-I want to see your eyes.

1195
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,456
I get shy when things
are set up like this.

1196
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,250
-Really?
-I'll take them off naturally.

1197
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,876
Then, I'll look this way. Go.

1198
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,255
My gosh. This weather's nice.

1199
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,714
-I like your nails.
-Really?

1200
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,383
Did you just get them done?

1201
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,801
Yes, three days ago.

1202
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:22,684
On the outside, it seemed like
he'd be cold and have a fierce presence.

1203
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:26,104
But after talking with him,
I saw that he laughed a lot.

1204
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,565
He was very different
from his first impression.

1205
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,525
I'm really hungry.

1206
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,193
-You're good at peeling.
-Right?

1207
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,987
-Want some?
-Sure.

1208
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,199
-So yesterday…
-Yes?

1209
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,535
-You picked someone and left.
-Right.

1210
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:43,913
How does it feel to see those
who were tragically left behind?

1211
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:44,998
"Tragically"…

1212
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,377
Honestly, I felt bad.

1213
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,964
Because I'm just a slave to this system.
They told me to do something.

1214
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,675
-I'm not sure about that!
-I just did what I was told. Seriously.

1215
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,511
-Really?
-I'd take everyone.

1216
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,179
All six of you.

1217
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,599
-I don't think that's right.
-Exactly.

1218
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,686
There are rules, so I just followed them.

1219
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,605
-You're a bit of an "I" type.
-Right.

1220
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,816
When you were around others,
you were so quiet.

1221
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:16,112
-Now, you just naturally keep talking.
-Yes, that's true.

1222
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,697
I've become more of an introvert.

1223
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,907
So what's your MBTI?

1224
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,284
Take a guess.

1225
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,660
-"E" type.
-"E" type?

1226
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,412
Yeah. ENTJ?

1227
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,039
I seem like a "T" type?

1228
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,707
I'm ENFP.

1229
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,709
Totally.

1230
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,961
-You don't seem that way at all.
-Really?

1231
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,213
I have a lot of ENFP friends.

1232
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,882
They get along well with INTPs.

1233
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,966
I'm ENFP.

1234
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,301
-Really?
-It's true.

1235
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,553
It wasn't even intentional,

1236
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,640
but whenever my friends take the test,
it says they're ENFPs.

1237
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,850
Isn't that interesting?

1238
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,143
-It is.
-Yeah.

1239
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:48,728
Actually,

1240
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,982
you have kind of an aloof appearance.

1241
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,567
-Me? I get that a lot.
-I felt that.

1242
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,485
Right?

1243
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,986
On the outside…

1244
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,697
-You seemed a bit cold.
-True.

1245
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,615
I was scared.

1246
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:01,532
-Really?
-Yes.

1247
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,785
-But not anymore, right?
-No, I don't think so.

1248
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,496
But I felt the same way about you.

1249
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,373
-Yesterday…
-Right.

1250
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,042
-You had your hair down.
-Right.

1251
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,960
You looked so intimidating.

1252
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,796
You were so scary.

1253
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,215
I wanted to avoid talking
to you until the end.

1254
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,050
That was my initial thought.

1255
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,386
But after speaking with you today,

1256
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,640
it was totally not the case,
and you're so kind.

1257
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:28,351
-That's how I felt.
-Yes, I'm not that bad.

1258
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,480
The goats agree too.

1259
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,315
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1260
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,026
Why did you thank them like this?

1261
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,570
-Is that how you show gratitude?
-Yes.

1262
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,530
This says a lot.

1263
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,073
I see. Like this?

1264
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,450
The goats can climb pretty high.

1265
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:45,868
They're at the top.

1266
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,954
They're welcoming us too.

1267
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:48,871
You're right.

1268
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,916
He said ENFPs and INTPs get along well.

1269
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,252
I felt so comfortable after that.

1270
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:56,963
She's Gen Z for sure.

1271
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,548
-Gen Z.
-Seriously.

1272
01:01:58,631 --> 01:01:59,465
She's Gen Z.

1273
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:04,929
Also, he makes me want to tease
and joke around with him.

1274
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,807
What's your ideal type?

1275
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,308
-My ideal type?
-Yes.

1276
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,643
Take a guess.

1277
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,186
-Your ideal type?
-Yes.

1278
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,940
-My ideal type is…
-Yes?

1279
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:19,527
It's just someone who's fun
and who gets along with me.

1280
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,155
-What's your personality like?
-Me?

1281
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,615
People say I'm pretty quirky.

1282
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,786
My friends often say I'm funny.

1283
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,747
You're funny? Really?

1284
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:31,914
My friends say that.

1285
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,666
-I can't picture it.
-Really?

1286
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,419
That's what everyone says.

1287
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:38,546
So you're…

1288
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,131
a bit of a weirdo?

1289
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,259
-Sorry.
-Hey.

1290
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,844
-I hear that a lot.
-Really?

1291
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:45,845
-Yes.
-Then, I'm right.

1292
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,557
But people like that are fun.

1293
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,559
I really like people like that.

1294
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:52,685
-Really?
-Yes.

1295
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,520
I'm not so sure that I am a weirdo.

1296
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,898
Weirdos usually don't know they are.

1297
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:58,983
-I can't believe it.
-True.

1298
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,651
-I can't admit it.
-True.

1299
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,612
What was…

1300
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,363
What was your first impression of me?

1301
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,157
-Sorry?
-You didn't pick me.

1302
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,284
-What?
-You didn't pick me.

1303
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,243
How was it?

1304
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,369
-At first?
-Yes.

1305
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:15,291
-Well, honestly…
-You don't remember? Okay.

1306
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,834
I thought about choosing you.

1307
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:17,877
-You did?
-Yes.

1308
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,128
Really?

1309
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,131
I thought about it.

1310
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,092
But you weren't smiling much.

1311
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,469
-At first?
-Yes.

1312
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,429
-Actually…
-Yes?

1313
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,097
I was a little nervous.

1314
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,308
I'm a bit shy.

1315
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:35,520
You seemed like it.

1316
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,231
You still feel shy now, right?

1317
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,483
-A little.
-I think you're keeping some distance.

1318
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,777
No, it's not that.

1319
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,030
We all need to get a bit closer.

1320
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:52,620
First off, it seemed like
our sense of humor clicked.

1321
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:56,541
So I wanted to talk more.
We didn't get much time to talk.

1322
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,794
What should I do with my hair tomorrow?

1323
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,213
This and…

1324
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,591
Wait, I might not even go. Calm down.

1325
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,095
I don't think I'll end up going, so why…

1326
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,681
Knock on wood.

1327
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,725
I have a feeling Min-seol won't make it.

1328
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,686
-Why not?
-I just feel like she won't.

1329
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:17,895
She'll be left alone.

1330
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:18,813
Really?

1331
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:22,900
I think Ji-yeon and Jun-seo
have feelings for each other.

1332
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,944
-They have great chemistry.
-I agree.

1333
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,612
-Their chemistry's great.
-True.

1334
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,240
And I think they'll choose each other.

1335
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,659
So Ji-yeon is definitely
the UDT's choice?

1336
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:32,994
"The UDT's choice"!

1337
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,328
-The UDT's choice.
-Right.

1338
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,663
-Ji-yeon.
-Is that so?

1339
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:45,089
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1340
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,641
Kim Hye-jin.

1341
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,562
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1342
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,230
and deliver your ticket.

1343
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,694
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1344
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,700
Kim Jeong-su.

1345
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,078
Kim Jeong-su.

1346
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:23,794
KIM HYE-JIN SELECTED KIM JEONG-SU

1347
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,680
Kim Jeong-su.

1348
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:38,684
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1349
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,436
and deliver your ticket.

1350
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:45,107
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1351
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,945
Kim Hye-jin.

1352
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,031
Kim Hye-jin.

1353
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:55,743
That's right.

1354
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,537
Jeong-su isn't attracted
to the gentle ones.

1355
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,665
-"The gentle ones"!
-"The gentle ones"!

1356
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:03,376
And the gentle ones
can't control Jeong-su.

1357
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,129
KIM JEONG-SU SELECTED KIM HYE-JIN

1358
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,470
Bae Ji-yeon.

1359
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:19,141
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1360
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,060
and deliver your ticket.

1361
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:26,065
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1362
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,525
I'm so eager to see.

1363
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,412
Yuk Jun-seo.

1364
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,581
Yes, the UDT's choice.

1365
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,208
That's right.

1366
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:51,799
BAE JI-YEON SELECTED YUK JUN-SEO

1367
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:03,853
Kim Min-seol.

1368
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,898
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1369
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,608
and deliver your ticket.

1370
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,990
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1371
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,707
Yuk Jun-seo.

1372
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,344
Look at her expression.

1373
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,929
She's looking.

1374
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,474
-A competition has begun.
-They overlapped.

1375
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,936
KIM MIN-SEOL SELECTED YUK JUN-SEO

1376
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:02,912
Yuk Jun-seo.

1377
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:07,083
Say the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1378
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,709
and deliver your ticket.

1379
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,422
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1380
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,971
Please, pick Ji-yeon.

1381
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,723
-I think it'll be Ji-yeon.
-Yeah.

1382
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,892
He was talking about goats with Min-seol.

1383
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:27,436
But they seemed to get along well too.

1384
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,522
He did click with both of them.

1385
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,358
With Min-seol,
they were talking more like friends.

1386
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:37,655
We all tend to show
an over-polished version of ourselves.

1387
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,491
But it felt like
she had done that the least.

1388
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,869
Our conversations progressed
based on that,

1389
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,455
and I felt like we had a good connection.

1390
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,958
So I thought it'd be nice to go together.

1391
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,550
If it's not Ji-yeon, I'm leaving.

1392
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,396
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1393
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,847
