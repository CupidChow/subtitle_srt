15

This is the men's game final ranking
for an opportunity to go to Paradise.

16
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,478
First place goes to Yoong-jae.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,481
Thank you.

18
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,735
Second place.

19
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,987
Jong-woo.

20
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,782
-Good job.
-Gosh.

21
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,205
And third place goes to Jin-young.

22
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,292
Great job, everyone.

23
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,015
Gosh.

24
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,477
Goodness.

25
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,188
-I think I'm going to cry.
-Me too.

26
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,317
He said he'd do
his best for Seul-ki, and did.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,235
Yes.

28
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,089
Oh, gosh.

29
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,507
What's wrong with us?

30
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,679
-Honestly, what is this?
-This show is so weird.

31
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,682
-I'm tearing up because of Jong-woo.
-Why is everyone crying?

32
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,851
-What is this?
-But why is Kyuhyun crying?

33
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,436
Why is he crying?

34
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,815
-What is this?
-And why is the music so…

35
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,400
-I feel…
-I mean.

36
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,526
I feel so strange.

37
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,905
Jong-woo is the star of this season.

38
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,615
Jeez.

39
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,492
It's so sad.

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,245
This is a triumph for him.

41
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,707
He made this happen
through his own hard work and effort.

42
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,251
This is because we knew

43
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,964
Jong-woo's state of mind
when he was competing against the others.

44
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,549
-We did.
-I mean,

45
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,093
even as he was being dragged out
by the other two,

46
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,471
he kept telling himself,
"I can't let this happen."

47
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,557
He nearly got dragged out a few times.

48
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,142
-Right.
-But in that situation,

49
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,312
you could see him thinking,
"I have to win, no matter what."

50
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,023
-And he kept going back in.
-Yes.

51
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,525
Seeing him do all that just…

52
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,194
-Great job.
-Great job.

53
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,738
-Great job.
-Great job.

54
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,240
-Great job.
-Congrats. You're the real winner.

55
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,658
-Nicely done.
-Jong-woo, you…

56
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,453
Everybody, don't forget
to take your shoes.

57
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,538
-Jong-woo was really amazing.
-Really.

58
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,457
-He was determined to hold out.
-Jong-woo…

59
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,168
-I can't believe Jong-woo came second.
-It's amazing.

60
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,587
He did his best,
thinking it was his last chance.

61
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,838
-Yes.
-He did it.

62
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,674
-I'm exhausted.
-Go tell Jong-woo he did well.

63
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,217
-Right.
-Go say something.

64
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,385
-Now?
-Yes!

65
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,763
No, I don't want to.

66
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,264
-Why not?
-Why?

67
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,433
Why not? This is the last game.

68
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,268
-Right, why?
-No, I'm just…

69
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,646
I want to choose my words wisely.

70
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,232
This isn't easy.

71
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,234
-But it's fun.
-Right.

72
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,985
-It wasn't fun.
-I'm so tired.

73
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,862
I don't think I can do it again.

74
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,906
-Everyone's smiling.
-They're all happy.

75
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,783
Earlier, their faces were…

76
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,952
-I know. They look cheerful now.
-Exactly.

77
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,246
-Good job!
-You all did well, guys!

78
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,205
Thanks.

79
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,041
-This is fun.
-Jong-woo's going to Paradise.

80
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,626
-He's going!
-Jong-woo's going!

81
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,711
-Jong-woo's finally going!
-Jong-woo.

82
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,963
Jong-woo.

83
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,093
-It was a good fight.
-It feels like I competed instead.

84
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,762
-I competed with my heart.
-It was intense.

85
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,930
But they were cool.

86
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,139
-So cool.
-Seriously.

87
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,225
-They refused to give up.
-Right.

88
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,770
Jong-woo, Han-bin,
and Jin-young were the most fun to watch.

89
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,729
Yes.

90
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,023
It was fun.

91
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,317
-But Seul-ki has a lot on her mind.
-A lot.

92
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,277
No, I don't.

93
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,279
What do you mean no?

94
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,697
-Just admit it.
-Enjoy it.

95
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,698
You're so funny.

96
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,283
Just enjoy it.

97
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,038
Jong-woo must be excited.

98
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,165
-He must be proud.
-He did it on his own.

99
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,836
He really wanted to accomplish
something on his own.

100
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,798
Jin-young was strategic.

101
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,341
-Yes, he…
-He used techniques.

102
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,051
Yes. He kept using techniques.

103
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,512
-He used ground moves.
-Like a pro athlete.

104
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,806
-I think so too.
-It looked like jujitsu.

105
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,932
-Right?
-Yes.

106
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,353
-I can't predict who Jin-young will pick.
-Jin-young?

107
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,609
This is fun.

108
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,365
-Everyone was shaking at the end.
-Yes, they were.

109
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,871
Are you supposed
to solve it without looking?

110
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,830
HANHAE, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

111
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,542
The way Nadine is turning the cube
makes her look anxious, right?

112
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,377
Don't you usually look at it?

113
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,254
-She's just anxious.
-Right.

114
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,214
I wonder who Jin-young will choose.

115
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,508
-If Seul-ki is already chosen, right?
-Right.

116
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,765
-I wonder what'll happen.
-Me too.

117
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,308
I think Se-jeong will go.

118
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,352
-Se-jeong? I hope she goes.
-Me too.

119
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,106
-We already know…
-Yes?

120
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,151
…who Yoong-jae and Jong-woo will choose.

121
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,487
Yes, that's too obvious.

122
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,781
But now, Jin-young is the wild card.

123
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,910
Right, who will Jin-young choose?

124
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,375
I think I'm getting sunburned.

125
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,211
Same here.

126
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,426
I think Jin-young stays true to his heart.

127
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,427
LEE NADINE

128
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,181
So I think he'll do
whatever his heart tells him.

129
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:35,019
I haven't been able to express myself
a lot to Jin-young so far,

130
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,480
so I don't think he'll pick me.

131
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,317
It's okay.

132
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,868
Hey, isn't this my lodge?

133
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,537
-It is.
-Why are you here?

134
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,206
-Can't I just sit here?
-Of course, you can.

135
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,376
You've been acting cold
since you came back from Paradise.

136
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,293
What?

137
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,546
You've been acting cold
since you came back.

138
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,463
I'm not.

139
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,632
-I'm joking.
-I'm not.

140
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,887
The ice cream was good.

141
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,349
-You had ice cream?
-Ice cream and sherbet.

142
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,476
-Come on.
-Are you jealous?

143
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,146
Looks like you ate something good there.

144
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,024
But I hope you don't go this time.

145
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,526
-This time?
-Yes.

146
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,445
It'll be more fun if you don't go.

147
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:31,701
I know. Of course, I'm in a good mood
since I went to Paradise yesterday.

148
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,829
But everyone had so much fun here, so…

149
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,873
Honestly, we did have fun yesterday.

150
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,166
-Really?
-Yes.

151
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,502
Seo-eun, Se-jeong, Seul-ki, and everyone

152
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,588
said it was so fun.

153
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,047
They laughed so much…

154
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,425
-Really?
-…that their throats hurt.

155
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,470
But you weren't there, so…

156
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,180
You missed out on all the fun.

157
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,514
I know.

158
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,184
Basically, I bring all the fun.

159
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,768
Okay.

160
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,062
I'm telling you. I bring all the fun.

161
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,232
-So let's stay here today and have fun.
-Okay.

162
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,735
We should brainstorm
about what to do today.

163
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,111
-Brainstorm?
-Yes.

164
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,864
Go inside. You'll get sunburned.

165
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,866
I don't get burned easily.

166
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,117
Jeez.

167
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,412
You have to stay healthy.

168
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,456
And not get hurt.

169
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,626
-Go inside.
-Okay.

170
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,338
-See you later.
-Enjoy your talk.

171
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,297
No, no.

172
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,550
She's about to collapse from the heat.

173
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,761
Bye.

174
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:48,986
Hi, Seul-ki.

175
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,115
Do you have time to talk?

176
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,744
-You busy?
-I don't, so I'll go inside.

177
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,454
-What?
-I don't, so I'll go inside.

178
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,872
I thought you might be busy.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,545
-Do you want to go talk over there?
-Okay.

180
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,546
Good.

181
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,258
You're so dressed up for Paradise today.

182
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,470
You're even more dressed up, Seul-ki.
I haven't seen you like this.

183
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,068
-Why did he have to…
-Gosh, of all places.

184
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,029
-My goodness.
-Why was he watching them from behind?

185
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,322
Why was he there?

186
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,256
-Did you get hurt?
-What?

187
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,258
-Did you get hurt?
-No, I'm fine.

188
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,969
Gosh.

189
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,971
It's too bad.

190
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,390
I wanted to come in second.

191
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,101
I wasn't interested in coming in first.

192
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,062
But I should've at least come in second.

193
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,398
It's too bad.

194
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,026
Still, I thought you were awesome.

195
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,532
I tried my best, so I accept the outcome.

196
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,533
I see.

197
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:19,952
Jong-woo.

198
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,330
Jong-woo was strong.

199
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,543
Jong-woo was really desperate to win too.

200
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,423
Well, I lost, so obviously,

201
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,761
he's going to take you,
but there's nothing I can do.

202
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,930
When you went to Paradise with me,

203
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,644
the impact we had on each other…

204
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,689
You really like the word "impact."

205
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,275
-I heard everything about the "impact."
-It's useful.

206
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,235
What? What about it?

207
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,654
I heard everything.

208
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:59,200
That your trip to Paradise with someone
also impacted you in a different way.

209
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,660
It impacted me differently…

210
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,286
That's true.

211
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,330
That's what Paradise is for.

212
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,960
Have you decided who you'll go with?

213
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,712
Who I'll go with?

214
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,091
-Yes, I've decided.
-I see.

215
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,595
Can I ask you something?

216
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,847
-What?
-What was your choice based on?

217
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:26,685
-What was it based on?
-I'll be able to go peacefully if I know.

218
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,770
I see.

219
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,189
Well…

220
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,568
It's someone I've been curious about.

221
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,405
I chose based on that.

222
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,744
Well, anyway…

223
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,624
I understand. Let's go now.

224
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,591
-She's a little upset.
-Right.

225
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,552
-Yes.
-She wanted him to hold on to her.

226
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,179
I think she expected
to hear something like,

227
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,932
"It's someone who doesn't matter to me."

228
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,518
He could've said,
"You're the only one who matters."

229
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,519
Why'd he say that?

230
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,021
-Because he's honest.
-He's honest.

231
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,983
I think that's part of Jin-young's charm.

232
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,234
-Yes.
-Right.

233
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,905
Gosh, there's someone sneaky here.

234
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,323
I can't figure him out.

235
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,534
-Who?
-Why are you looking there?

236
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,662
First off, how many people
are you interested in?

237
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,165
-Two.
-Interested?

238
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,375
-I see.
-I didn't know that.

239
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,002
-What?
-Two people?

240
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,587
You're taking the second person?

241
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,838
-The second one?
-Yes.

242
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,883
Because I think
the first person whom I like

243
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,302
will get chosen
by the second-place winner.

244
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,848
-Things will become clear today, right?
-Right.

245
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,642
-Things definitely will.
-This will be interesting.

246
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,770
I think things will become more certain.

247
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,989
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

248
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,116
COUPLE MATCHING TO PARADISE HAS BEGUN

249
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,451
Have fun.

250
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,787
The ones who won
the chance to go to Paradise

251
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:13,000
are Jo Yoong-jae, Choi Jong-woo,
and Kim Jin-young.

252
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,628
Please come out to the campfire.

253
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,171
-Let's go.
-See you later.

254
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,632
-Have fun!
-See you tomorrow.

255
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,511
-Congrats, really.
-Have fun there.

256
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,429
-I mean it.
-Just have fun there.

257
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,556
I'm happy for you. Happier, even.

258
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,108
JO YOONG-JAE

259
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,820
CHOI JONG-WOO

260
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,157
KIM JIN-YOUNG

261
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,702
First-place winner Jo Yoong-jae,

262
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:53,040
please choose the person you'd like
to go on a date with in Paradise.

263
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,709
He's going to say it right away.

264
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:05,010
The person I would like to go
to Paradise with is Seo-eun.

265
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,224
The person Yoong-jae
has chosen is Seo-eun.

266
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,226
-What?
-Seo-eun, please come outside.

267
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,561
-Meet Yoong-jae.
-Have fun.

268
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,771
-And leave for Paradise.
-Bye-bye.

269
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,064
Have a great time.

270
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,024
-See you tomorrow.
-It should be fun.

271
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,278
Yoong-jae owes me dinner
when this show is over.

272
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,071
-Seriously.
-Yes, he does.

273
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,532
-I totally helped him win.
-You did.

274
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,243
-He won in the end.
-See you tomorrow, guys.

275
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,412
-See you tomorrow.
-We'll miss you.

276
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,361
So this is what it feels like to watch on.

277
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,947
-It's heartwarming.
-Yeah.

278
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,866
They look so good together.

279
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,911
Look how he ran out to greet her.

280
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,748
-So considerate.
-Do we go in this way?

281
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,749
Yes.

282
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,293
I told you we'd go together next time.

283
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,378
-Yes.
-I guess that's today.

284
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,340
I told you
I'd like to go again, remember?

285
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,299
Yes.

286
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,093
-Together with you.
-I was so glad to hear that.

287
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,053
This is great.

288
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,433
They really look
like a newlywed couple now.

289
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,353
They were like a couple from the start.

290
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,356
-They look good together.
-First and last visit to Paradise…

291
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,025
-Together from beginning to end.
-…is together.

292
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,654
Next is second-place winner,
Choi Jong-woo.

293
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,659
Jong-woo, choose the person you'd like
to go on a date with in Paradise.

294
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,494
We don't know until the end.

295
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,704
What do you mean by that?

296
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,623
We know why he was desperate to win.

297
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,540
Right.

298
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,756
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is…

299
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,968
Seul-ki.

300
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,144
-The person Jong-woo has chosen is…
-Named you quick.

301
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,354
…Seul-ki.

302
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,190
-Seul-ki, please come out…
-See you.

303
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,443
-…and leave for Paradise with Jong-woo.
-Enjoy the food there.

304
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,778
Enjoy the food there.

305
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,196
Jong-woo's finally going.

306
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,365
-He's going.
-Jong-woo.

307
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,859
We're finally going.

308
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,610
Let me carry that.

309
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,903
-Thanks.
-This one too?

310
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,530
Let's go.

311
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,410
Be careful of the fire.

312
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,375
You clean up nice.

313
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,628
-How's my denim-on-denim look? Is it okay?
-Yes, it's nice.

314
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,672
You look good in that strawberry color.

315
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,639
Gosh, I'm so excited to go.

316
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,142
Do whatever you want to there, Jong-woo.

317
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,979
No, let's discuss what to do together.

318
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,565
Let's make the most out of it.

319
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,984
It's my first time walking up these steps.

320
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,236
-You're finally walking on them.
-Right?

321
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,196
With me.

322
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,990
This all feels so new to me.

323
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,204
Gosh, how long has he waited for this?

324
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,497
This precise moment.

325
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,456
He won.

326
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,083
Good job, Jong-woo.

327
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,506
Lastly, the third-place winner
is Jin-young.

328
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:16,386
Please choose the person you'd like
to go on a date with in Paradise.

329
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,263
This is important.

330
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,266
-Today's highlight.
-Name the person you would like to…

331
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,352
-Try and guess.
-…go to Paradise with.

332
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,271
-It's either Se-jeong or Min-su.
-It's not Nadine, right?

333
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,067
-There's no way to know that.
-I really can't guess.

334
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,154
I know his first choice, but he hasn't
hinted about his second choice at all.

335
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,240
I don't know
who his second choice is.

336
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,076
I'm not sure. Maybe Nadine?
Nadine could go.

337
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,328
-It's not me.
-I can't figure out Jin-young.

338
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,746
I think it's Nadine.

339
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,081
I don't think it's me.

340
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,041
-Why not?
-Because we didn't talk.

341
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,836
I can't tell what Jin-young is thinking.

342
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,295
-I really can't.
-Seriously.

343
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,506
I gave up on making predictions about him.

344
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,926
I wonder whom he'll choose.

345
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,303
I think it's Nadine.

346
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,140
-But Se-jeong should go at least once.
-Right, Se-jeong.

347
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,809
I hope it's either Se-jeong or Nadine.

348
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,356
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is…

349
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,733
I'm really curious.

350
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,653
I think it'll take him a while.

351
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,739
-He'll think it through.
-He'll think it through.

352
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,784
The person Jin-young has chosen is…

353
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,333
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is Nadine.

354
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,712
…Nadine.

355
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:37,718
Nadine, please come out
and leave for Paradise with Jin-young.

356
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,469
Nadine.

357
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,929
-Nadine.
-Gosh.

358
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,641
It's Nadine.

359
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,102
Seriously?
I really didn't see this coming.

360
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,354
What should I do?

361
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,690
Go and show off your pretty outfits today.

362
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,775
But I can't…

363
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,653
Did you pack all your things?

364
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,739
-No.
-You didn't?

365
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,741
I mean, I did pack, but…

366
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,410
-You didn't think you'd go, right?
-Right.

367
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,413
-Still, go have fun.
-Yes, go have fun.

368
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,624
See you tomorrow.

369
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,833
See you.

370
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,126
I love you guys.

371
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,794
-We love you.
-Love you.

372
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,395
-Hi.
-Hi.

373
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,986
-Let's go.
-Need help?

374
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,155
No, it's fine. I can carry it on my own.

375
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,617
-Did you expect this?
-No.

376
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,619
I really didn't expect this.

377
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,788
-Not at all?
-No.

378
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,374
Let's have fun today.

379
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,546
-We'll have fun.
-Okay.

380
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,049
-There's lots to do.
-I need to know your job

381
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,927
-and your age.
-Me too. It's the same for me too.

382
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,179
-We were on the same page just now.
-Right.

383
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,890
-I'm so curious.
-I'm very curious about who you are.

384
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:07,808
Right.

385
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,021
Did you know he'd choose her?

386
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,149
-I said that earlier, remember?
-That's right.

387
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,669
She feels bitter.

388
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,087
She must be so disappointed.

389
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,381
When I saw Se-jeong's face,

390
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,010
I think she was secretly hoping
that she would get chosen.

391
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,511
That's how I'd feel.

392
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:49,308
But when he chose Nadine, a lot
of thoughts must've gone through her head.

393
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:53,186
She's the only one
who hasn't been to Paradise.

394
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,229
Yes, that's right.

395
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,481
Se-jeong is so charming, though.

396
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,150
-Yes, she is.
-Right?

397
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,486
About Jin-young and Nadine,
they became curious about each other

398
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,323
while having conversations.

399
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:08,744
Also, Nadine was on Jin-young's mind
the most after Seul-ki.

400
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:13,457
And Nadine has a lot of feelings
for Jin-young right now,

401
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,667
-so I think this date in Paradise…
-Yes?

402
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,461
…will be very important.

403
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,254
-To Jin-young, that is.
-Right.

404
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:26,595
PARADISE

405
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,849
-We're not there yet, right?
-Two doors.

406
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,309
-There are two doors?
-Yes.

407
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,560
That's rather shocking.

408
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,775
What's this? The decor is all in gold.

409
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,611
It's all marble and gold.

410
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,656
What is this?

411
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,158
This place…

412
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,369
-is meant for two people?
-Yes.

413
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,662
This is the pool.

414
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,249
-Want to go for a swim?
-Let's do it.

415
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,417
This is nice.

416
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,007
Where are we?

417
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,676
What is this?

418
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,596
-It's like a maze in here.
-Right?

419
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,182
-Even the bedroom.
-I got lost once.

420
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,435
Shall we play hide-and-seek?

421
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,230
-We can totally do that here.
-I think it'd be fun.

422
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:22,609
I'm going to make a lot of money
and buy a place like this one day.

423
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,112
First, let's order room service.

424
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,364
Okay. Teach me what to do.

425
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,323
Okay.

426
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,242
I'm so happy.

427
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,744
-This is written in different languages.
-Right?

428
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,496
How about a dish from each country?

429
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,582
-I'll eat everything.
-Let's do whatever you want. Seriously.

430
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,130
-They have burgers.
-Do you want some?

431
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,132
-Yes. You like burgers too?
-Yes.

432
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,008
Great, there's Korean food too.

433
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,094
-Want to order a Korean dish?
-Sounds good.

434
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,971
-This is sirloin and…
-Lamb chops.

435
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,430
-Lamb chops.
-It's a must.

436
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,184
-I'll give it a try.
-All right.

437
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,228
What do I press first?

438
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,063
-I need to lift this, right?
-Right.

439
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,064
Here.

440
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,027
-A burger, sirloin and…
-Lamb chops.

441
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,028
…lamb chops.

442
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,574
-Are we ordering too much?
-No.

443
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,951
-Order some more.
-Order more?

444
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,911
Order everything you want.

445
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,832
Yes, that'll be it for now.

446
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,877
Oh, gosh, did we order too much?

447
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,879
-Who cares?
-It's fine.

448
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,131
You need to enjoy today, Jong-woo.

449
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,968
-I want to make that happen for you.
-I plan on seeing you eat a lot.

450
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,014
Then let's unpack, get ready, and regroup.

451
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,604
This is just crazy.

452
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,625
He's on top of the world.

453
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,085
He's looking back on today.

454
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,962
And the intense game.

455
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,132
No, not just today.

456
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,761
-Probably the past eight days.
-He really had a hard time.

457
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:18,558
PARADISE
YOONG-JAE AND SEO-EUN

458
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,988
We're at…

459
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,201
-a very meaningful place.
-A very meaningful place.

460
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,245
We put our things here last time.

461
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,788
This is nice.

462
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,624
When we first came here…

463
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,085
-When we first came here…
-It's the same place.

464
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:51,716
Our first visit to Paradise
and now our last visit too.

465
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:53,969
I like that.

466
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,679
With the same person.

467
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,638
Right.

468
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,474
Is this what it means to come full circle?

469
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,982
Shall we go experience
something different now?

470
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,899
Yes.

471
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,111
They're in the same room as before.

472
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,488
It's like their wedding anniversary.

473
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,411
This is nice.

474
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,330
-We're back.
-We're back.

475
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,498
Yes.

476
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,625
-But it's better this time.
-Yes.

477
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,505
The pool was really nice before too.

478
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,715
-Right.
-Right.

479
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,759
-It feels the same, but somehow different.
-Right?

480
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,221
Maybe it's because we've changed a bit…

481
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,558
from back then.

482
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,770
I'm not sure. I'm just not sure.

483
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,482
-The sunset is beautiful right now.
-Yes.

484
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,361
Gosh, time really does go by quickly.

485
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,487
Right.

486
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,906
What do you think?

487
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,576
Well…

488
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,162
-I'm glad we came.
-What?

489
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,621
-It's good we came.
-Really?

490
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,706
For many reasons.

491
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,125
-It's good that we came.
-I see.

492
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,418
Even here.

493
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,214
-Thanks to you.
-Me too. I feel the same way.

494
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,718
But looking back,

495
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,599
I think I made the right choice

496
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,560
every single time.

497
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,605
I mean, from where I stand.

498
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,817
So I think I did well.

499
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,652
I feel the same way now.

500
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,240
Right.

501
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,827
I also thought about this.

502
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,332
I think there were moments
when our timing was really good.

503
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,752
And I think we were able to make it here…

504
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,924
because of those moments.

505
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,844
And you know,

506
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,138
in the beginning

507
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:06,476
-when we just happened to talk that day…
-Yes.

508
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,521
…if I hadn't caught on to how you felt,

509
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,066
or if we just didn't have
that conversation at all,

510
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,195
-things could've turned out differently.
-Right.

511
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,655
I agree.

512
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:27,122
Anything could happen
at any moment, but in the end you…

513
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,582
-You choose a path by deciding.
-…choose a path.

514
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,586
-Right, but we took that path.
-Right.

515
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,215
If we didn't have
that chance encounter with each other,

516
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,468
it could've taken us longer

517
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,971
-to get to this moment.
-That could've happened.

518
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,474
But it didn't, so I'm very…

519
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,645
thankful for these small coincidences.

520
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,108
I don't know. I mean…

521
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,988
Apparently, I look happy
when I'm with you, Yoong-jae.

522
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:00,947
Why?

523
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:05,076
The girls say it's heartwarming
when they see us talk.

524
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,203
Right, they did say that.

525
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,581
-I don't know why, though.
-I don't know.

526
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,959
I said something to them once.

527
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,129
They asked what kind
of relationship I want to be in.

528
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:20,967
And what I wanted
to get out of Single's Inferno.

529
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,927
So I just said,

530
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,223
"I want to be with someone who makes me
happy just by looking at him."

531
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,391
I see.

532
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,477
That's what I said.

533
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,773
So did your hope
actually come to fruition?

534
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,526
Why do you think I brought it up?

535
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,153
I'm really not sure…

536
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,493
In many ways,

537
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,413
I'm very happy to be here
with the person who won first place.

538
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,548
INFERNO

539
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,966
Let's eat.

540
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,428
-I think it's raw chicken.
-My gosh.

541
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,347
-Spicy braised chicken?
-Sounds good.

542
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,312
You got skills.

543
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,941
We should eat good food too,
like those who went to Paradise.

544
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:18,900
Right.

545
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,654
Do you eat chicken necks?

546
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,072
-Yes.
-Yes.

547
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,408
-You eat the neck too?
-Yes, I chew it up.

548
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,705
-You must think she's cute.
-What?

549
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,415
-You must think she's cute.
-Yes.

550
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,297
-Add potatoes if you want.
-Se-jeong, how many potatoes?

551
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,383
-Let's put in five.
-Five?

552
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,060
It's too…

553
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,103
Chicken tenderloin.

554
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,062
Be careful.

555
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,105
Chicken tenderloin.

556
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,189
Be careful.

557
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,233
I think I cut this wrong.

558
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,901
It's fine. You did well.

559
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,904
I just learned by observing.

560
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,701
-What do I do?
-It's okay. I'll do it. It's dangerous.

561
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,536
Do I do it like this or in thirds?

562
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,579
-I cut this wrong.
-Two.

563
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,496
It's fine.

564
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,706
-Two?
-Yes.

565
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,124
-One?
-In the middle. Yes.

566
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,961
-Thank you.
-Okay. Don't worry.

567
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,089
-I'll clean it. You won't.
-I'll mess it up.

568
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,425
-You did well.
-Okay.

569
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,845
Would corn starch be better?

570
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,686
-Se-jun and So-e's chemistry is…
-Right.

571
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,607
He's stuck to her like glue
and hovering over her.

572
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,693
-Let's eat.
-Enjoy your meal.

573
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,528
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

574
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,905
Gosh, it smells great.

575
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,532
-What would you like?
-Potatoes.

576
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,952
Look at how nice this looks.

577
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,746
-Isn't it great?
-Amazing.

578
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,331
Why are you giving me so much?

579
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,836
Gosh, this is really good.

580
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,463
-The broth is so good.
-Right.

581
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,797
-It is.
-I want more rice.

582
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,424
-Right.
-Mix it in with rice.

583
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,509
-It's really good.
-I've been doing that.

584
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,471
The view's nice.

585
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:15,058
The ocean is kind of like emerald green.

586
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,225
-Like a picture.
-Yes.

587
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,812
-I feel relaxed.
-Me too.

588
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,523
When else would we be able

589
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,609
-to eat and sleep near the ocean?
-Right?

590
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:42,961
It's like a painting.

591
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,798
-It's better than a painting.
-Yes.

592
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:52,095
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND NADINE

593
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,986
This is next level.

594
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,696
-As expected.
-What is this?

595
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,740
My gosh.

596
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,994
This is so pretty.

597
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,584
-Are you amazed?
-I am. It really is amazing.

598
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,548
-I'm hungry, Nadine.
-Me too. Let's dig in already.

599
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,135
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

600
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,223
You must be starving.

601
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,434
Yes, I used up a lot of energy today.

602
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,811
Right. By the way,
you were really awesome.

603
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,479
-Really?
-Yes.

604
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,190
-Who do you think was the best?
-You.

605
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,525
-Really?
-Yes.

606
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,902
-Even though I lost?
-Yes.

607
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:50,862
I see.

608
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,072
-I cheered for you.
-Really?

609
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:53,990
Yes.

610
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,952
-I didn't expect that.
-What?

611
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:58,911
I didn't expect that.

612
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,750
-She can express herself…
-Nadine…

613
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,168
…since it's just both of them.

614
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,505
-Yes.
-Why do I want to cheer for this couple?

615
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,923
Yes, they're cute.

616
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,884
-I want to cheer for them too.
-Right?

617
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,430
-Shall we reveal just our age first?
-Our age?

618
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,389
Yes.

619
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,184
How old are you?

620
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,188
-In Korean age?
-Yes.

621
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,523
-Twenty-three.
-Twenty-three?

622
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,738
-Twenty-eight.
-Twenty-eight?

623
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,573
Yes. I knew you'd be 28.

624
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,532
-Really?
-Yes.

625
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,576
Or maybe 27.

626
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,370
So you're 23.

627
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,623
You seem cute all of a sudden.

628
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,958
All of a sudden, your actions seem…

629
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,087
I see.

630
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:54,008
-No, I think you have it in you.
-I don't. I really don't act cute.

631
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,010
You don't have to act cute to be cute.

632
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,265
Then there's a five-year age difference.

633
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,936
What?

634
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,854
But age is something I don't…

635
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,274
-You usually don't care…
-…care about much.

636
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,777
-What matters is the person.
-I see.

637
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,406
I'm curious about your job.

638
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,699
What do you do?

639
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,326
No, don't say it.

640
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,411
-Don't say it.
-Why not?

641
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,289
Okay, then.

642
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,292
Are you a YouTuber?

643
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,379
-What?
-Are you a YouTuber? YouTube.

644
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,175
What? Really?

645
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,555
-Yes, I'm a YouTuber.
-Really?

646
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,557
-What?
-How did she know?

647
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,434
-How did she know?
-How did she know?

648
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,228
-Gosh.
-That's not easy to guess.

649
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,482
-No way.
-Why not?

650
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,734
What kind of YouTube content? Workouts?

651
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,237
At first, it was tactics.

652
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,698
-Like shooting guns…
-Tactics? Guns?

653
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,909
Yes, I created YouTube content
about shooting guns,

654
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,371
but now, I'm trying
a lot of different things.

655
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,207
That's amazing.

656
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:13,045
To be honest, it's difficult
to make gun-related content in Korea

657
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,423
-because of legal restrictions.
-Right.

658
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:20,386
So I have plans to go to the US
at the end of this year

659
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:23,264
and try to create content there.

660
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,349
Come visit.

661
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,270
Where do you live, Nadine?

662
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,148
-I live in Boston now.
-Boston?

663
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,567
-Because of school.
-Because of school?

664
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,195
-So you're a student.
-Yes.

665
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:42,116
I'm a pre-med student.
I'm going to med school.

666
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,284
-Med school?
-Yes.

667
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,077
-So are you preparing for it?
-Yes.

668
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,207
I'm going to med school after undergrad.

669
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,417
So you have to go through
all of those steps

670
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,002
-to become a doctor?
-Yes.

671
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,921
-But--
-You're a future doctor.

672
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,300
Yes, I study the brain.

673
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,802
-You study the brain?
-Neuroscience.

674
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,179
I really…

675
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,516
can't imagine you as a doctor.

676
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,977
Come visit Boston.

677
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,812
-Boston?
-Yes.

678
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,231
I really should one day.

679
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,275
Where do you want to visit in the US?

680
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:20,404
I think I should go somewhere secluded
where there's a shooting range.

681
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,199
-I want to train there.
-I see.

682
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,620
I want to do that
because I used to be in the army.

683
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,955
-Really?
-Yes.

684
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,332
-Four years.
-I thought so.

685
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,416
-Right?
-Yes.

686
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,211
-Do you know what the UDT is?
-Yes.

687
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,837
I used to serve in the UDT.

688
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,005
Really?

689
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,800
So from the beginning, did you…

690
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,051
-Serve in the UDT?
-Yes.

691
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,804
From the beginning,
I applied to join the UDT.

692
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:46,973
That's awesome.

693
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,558
-That's really awesome.
-Really?

694
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,811
-Thank you.
-Good job.

695
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,022
-I briefly served in the army too.
-You did?

696
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,524
You served in the army?

697
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,651
-You know ROTC?
-Yes.

698
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,778
-I was in the ROTC.
-For how long?

699
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,737
Just for a year.

700
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,449
-I see.
-So I wore a uniform too.

701
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,076
-So you were in the ROTC.
-Yes.

702
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,497
Gosh. You never cease to surprise me.

703
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,417
I like military stuff.

704
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,295
-I didn't expect that.
-I've fired guns a lot.

705
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,754
-Really?
-Yes.

706
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,215
-What kind?
-I've never shot a sniper rifle.

707
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,177
-I see. Then AR rifles or shotguns?
-Yes. AR rifles, shotguns, pistols.

708
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,473
-Then when I go to the US, we could…
-Guns?

709
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,143
-It'd be great to shoot together.
-I'm quite good.

710
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,269
-You like it?
-Yes.

711
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,270
And you're good?

712
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,896
-I am.
-I see.

713
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,232
-This is interesting.
-It is.

714
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,110
-This is so interesting.
-It all feels different, right?

715
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,028
I feel the same.

716
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,323
Everything feels very different.

717
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,162
They have something in common.

718
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:55,082
She keeps saying
that she likes all the things he does.

719
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,419
I didn't expect them
to have that in common.

720
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,337
Right.

721
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,508
Do you do anything related to fashion?

722
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,678
-I don't do fashion content.
-But you dress really well.

723
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,846
-Really?
-Yes.

724
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,140
I paid extra attention
because of the show.

725
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,476
-I usually wear all-black.
-All-black?

726
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,854
-I usually wear all-black too.
-Really? All-black?

727
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,231
My motorcycle is also black, and--

728
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,026
-Motorcycle?
-Yes, do you like motorcycles?

729
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,652
-Really?
-You like motorcycles?

730
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,653
Harley-Davidson?

731
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,281
No. I have a Yamaha MT-09.

732
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,493
-Yes, I know what that is.
-I have that, and it's super-fast.

733
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,536
I really like vehicles.

734
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,830
Cars and motorcycles.

735
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,165
-You do?
-Do you know F1?

736
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,459
-I do.
-Are you a fan of it?

737
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,503
Yes. That.

738
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,005
-I like things like that.
-I see.

739
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,341
-I like the sound of the exhaust.
-I see.

740
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:49,011
-So it's not "hing!" It's "vroom, vroom."
-I see.

741
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,891
You know what it is, right?

742
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,976
Why do you keep making sounds?

743
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,813
-Always wanted to ride one.
-You own one?

744
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,315
No, I don't. I can't ride motorcycles.

745
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,400
-Really?
-Yes.

746
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,943
I just drive. I have a car.

747
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,945
-I should give you a ride sometime.
-Yes.

748
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,530
-I'd like a ride.
-Seriously.

749
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,447
Yes.

750
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,033
-It's good to know more about you.
-Yeah.

751
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,119
We finally got to know each other.

752
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,415
Jinx!

753
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,719
What was the best moment you had here?

754
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,099
-Or a memorable moment.
-A memorable moment?

755
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,434
Yes, since coming here.

756
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,355
This moment.

757
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:42,982
I see.

758
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,455
-She meant it.
-Her heart skipped a beat.

759
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,249
-My gosh. This date is crazy.
-Right.

760
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,918
-It was short, but--
-She said, "This moment."

761
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,170
Had a strong impact, right?

762
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,589
-Jin-young's heart skipped a beat.
-Right.

763
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,340
-At that moment.
-You felt it, right?

764
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,301
Since they're alone together,

765
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,762
Nadine's tone and facial expressions
of focus are completely different

766
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,348
-from when she was on Inferno.
-Yes.

767
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,516
She's so charming.

768
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,102
I think Nadine is revealing
all of her charms here.

769
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,312
-Exactly.
-Right.

770
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,105
-Right.
-I can't close my mouth.

771
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,107
-I can't stop smiling.
-She's so adorable.

772
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,525
-Right.
-She's so charming.

773
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,735
-And pure.
-Yes.

774
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,738
A lot of women
aren't interested in things like that.

775
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,656
-They're not.
-Right. Yes.

776
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,409
-So he must think she's very attractive.
-Right?

777
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,205
When someone says they ride one,
the usual response is, "Oh, motorcycle?"

778
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,706
-since they're dangerous.
-Yes.

779
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,166
It could've ended there,

780
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,876
-but they keep talking about it.
-Right.

781
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,003
Even talked about exhaust sounds.

782
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,672
She's interested in different fields,
not just that.

783
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,342
And they all happen to be related

784
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,593
-to what Jin-young does.
-Yes.

785
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,762
-It's destiny.
-They suit each other well.

786
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,973
PARADISE
JONG-WOO AND SEUL-KI

787
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,642
Everything looks so good.

788
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,353
There are two forks per person.

789
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,897
-This?
-Yes.

790
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,067
This is the thickest steak I've ever seen.

791
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,278
This looks so good.

792
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,324
Medium? What sauce would you like?

793
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,451
Try smelling it first.

794
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,496
-What does it smell like?
-Steak sauce.

795
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,497
Steak? Okay.

796
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,461
Does it melt in your mouth,
or is it tough?

797
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,004
Try it right now.

798
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,012
It's really good, right?

799
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,724
-So this is why people don't eat…
-Right.

800
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,018
…much on Inferno.

801
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,480
It's really good, right?

802
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,775
I'm really happy.

803
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,739
This is the most delicious food
I've had here so far.

804
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,285
-What did you have last time?
-I don't remember.

805
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,581
-Remember everything you eat today.
-Of course.

806
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,876
-Seul-ki, do you eat shrimp?
-Yes.

807
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:09,920
Thanks.

808
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,424
-Do you eat mushrooms?
-Yes, I like mushrooms.

809
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,845
-Thanks.
-Try this and this.

810
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,474
Try the lamb chop before it gets cold.

811
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,770
That's enough for me.

812
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,689
-Are you full?
-You should have more.

813
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,817
I don't need anything.

814
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,445
Just being here with you is great.

815
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,866
It feels like I'm dreaming right now
because what I've been dreaming of

816
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,743
-has become a reality.
-Jong-woo.

817
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,751
Can I ask you something?

818
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,710
-Now?
-Yes.

819
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,340
-What on earth do you do?
-My job?

820
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,508
We don't know anything right now.

821
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,553
It's your first time here with me, so…

822
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,929
Can you take a guess?

823
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,765
Do you have a hunch?

824
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,185
Model, actor, or K-pop idol?

825
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,354
I'll give you a hint.

826
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:09,855
A hint.

827
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,650
It's very close to us right now.

828
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,779
It's what we just ate. It's very close.

829
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,240
I don't know.

830
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,326
I have no idea.

831
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,662
Well…

832
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,121
It's this.

833
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,667
-Coffee?
-Right. A café.

834
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:35,047
I run a café with my parents.

835
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:39,677
-We run the business together.
-I see.

836
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,053
Where is it?

837
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,182
-Gangwon-do.
-Gangwon-do?

838
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,558
Yes, it's in Gangwon-do.

839
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:50,521
I've been to many cafés in Gangwon-do.

840
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,606
-Really? Recently?
-Yes.

841
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,024
If you tell me, I might know it.

842
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,025
-Really?
-Yes.

843
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,236
It's called Super Sweet Corn Coffee.

844
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,405
It's called Super Sweet Corn Coffee.

845
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,698
I know that place!

846
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,034
-You do? How do you know?
-Yes.

847
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,956
-So I'm--
-I saw you on Instagram.

848
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,374
-Me?
-Yes.

849
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,875
-Really?
-Yes.

850
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,462
I really wanted to drink
super sweet corn coffee.

851
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,298
I looked it up, and that was
the first place that popped up.

852
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,258
Really?

853
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,053
I am a barista.

854
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,764
I run a café with my family

855
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,143
that is famous
for its super sweet corn coffee.

856
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,853
SUPER SWEET CORN COFFEE
SOLD OUT

857
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,479
Isn't that place famous?

858
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,106
How can a barista be so cool?

859
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:39,111
As a barista,
I take pride in how my coffee tastes.

860
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,656
To ensure the best quality,

861
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:46,493
I usually make the cream first
in the morning.

862
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,580
Then I adjust the coffee grinder
and set the coffee machine.

863
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:54,585
I always try to make
the best coffee for my customers.

864
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:00,299
CHOI JONG-WOO,
BARISTA

865
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,343
You can guess how old I am, right?

866
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,012
Twenty-eight?

867
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,138
-Twenty-eight?
-Yes.

868
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,974
Why don't you go first?

869
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,143
-Tell me how old you are first.
-What?

870
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,686
I'm 25.

871
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,605
-Really?
-Yes.

872
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,399
-Really?
-Yes. Why?

873
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,276
-I see.
-Are you 25?

874
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,194
Yes.

875
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,530
I'm 25 years old.

876
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,949
We're the same age.

877
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,077
No wonder I felt comfortable
calling you by your name.

878
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,787
Really? I…

879
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,582
I thought you were older than me.
The way you talk is very…

880
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,375
But wait.

881
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,712
-You're really 25?
-Yes, I was born in 1998.

882
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,130
March 3rd, 1998.

883
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:46,970
That's amazing. This is fun.
You were born in 1998.

884
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:52,100
Seul-ki, you look like

885
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,895
you could be an idol trainee.

886
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,899
-Do you want me to tell you?
-Yes.

887
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,276
I'm studying piano.

888
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,737
-The piano?
-Yes, I'm a piano major.

889
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,822
Is that why
you don't have your nails done?

890
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,451
Right. I've never had
my nails done in my life.

891
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,829
-Can I see your palms?
-My hands are really small.

892
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,666
Your fingertips have to be plump.

893
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,668
Really…

894
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,836
-They're very plump.
-Yes.

895
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,589
They're kind of like paws.

896
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,926
They feel like a puppy's… You know.

897
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,803
You know what I mean, right? Puppy paws.

898
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,221
-Yes.
-They feel like that.

899
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,684
They're soft.

900
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:37,020
Are they like that because you play a lot,
or are they just like that?

901
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,856
I'm not sure, but if you look,
they're all calluses.

902
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,903
If you played the piano
to the point where you have calluses,

903
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:49,533
you must have reached
a goal that's really hard to achieve.

904
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,617
In my opinion.

905
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,619
I failed a lot too. But--

906
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,329
-You didn't give up.
-No.

907
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,124
There's a lot to learn from you.

908
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,502
I used to be an athlete.

909
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,337
-What sport?
-I used to play soccer.

910
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,132
-For about ten years.
-That's crazy.

911
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,050
I got to the point

912
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:11,763
where I almost joined
a professional soccer club.

913
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:16,852
I should've stayed strong
and just toughed it out.

914
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:20,856
I've realized recently
that I still have some regrets

915
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,357
about quitting soccer.

916
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:28,447
But I chose another path,
so I'm not going to give up anymore.

917
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:30,866
I want to tell you…

918
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,747
that it's a new challenge
rather than giving up.

919
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,206
Yes, you're right.

920
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,792
So are you graduating now?

921
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,045
-Yes, I'm a senior.
-You're a senior?

922
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,380
I have a graduation performance
next year too.

923
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,424
You should come.

924
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,927
-Can I really?
-To my graduation performance.

925
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,096
I'll bring two cups
of super sweet corn coffee.

926
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,515
Well, your friends will be there,

927
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,226
-so I'll have them ready to go.
-Like a coffee truck?

928
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,436
-You want that?
-Yes!

929
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,438
Really? Okay. I promise.

930
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,523
-First, the cream…
-This is so nice.

931
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,691
…I need enough of it.

932
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,111
-I'll do it for you.
-Thanks. That's sweet of you to say.

933
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,495
It feels fun and amazing all of a sudden.

934
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:19,956
-Right, our age--
-I'm talking so much.

935
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,210
I think this is the first time
I've talked this much.

936
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,420
-With me? Or in general?
-Yes.

937
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,630
Right, that's what…

938
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,467
Right. That's what this place is for.

939
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,220
-I know.
-I was dying to tell you on Inferno.

940
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,972
I know. It seemed like
you wanted to tell me badly.

941
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:39,476
I kept thinking about this on Inferno.

942
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,480
Then you must've really wanted
to win today.

943
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,947
Did you get hurt earlier?

944
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,740
Yes. It's fine, though.

945
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,242
Are you hurt anywhere else?

946
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,954
-I got hurt a lot. My knees and shoulders.
-You did?

947
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:03,583
To be honest, I played the game thinking
that I had to win no matter what.

948
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,254
Remember when you cried that one time?

949
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,672
When I saw you cry,

950
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,509
I became more determined to win.

951
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,180
If I had come in third place,

952
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,059
and if Jin-young had picked you,

953
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,271
I think I would have
actually cried on Inferno.

954
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,064
That's how serious I was.

955
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,861
You've been pretty expressive
towards me as well.

956
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,738
Yeah. Do you mean the compliments?

957
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,617
Right, the compliments
and other little things.

958
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,286
Last night, you asked me

959
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,204
-to take some Polaroids together.
-Yes?

960
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,206
When you just wanted a picture of us…

961
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,499
Let's take one together.

962
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,667
-How?
-Selfie-mode.

963
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,044
Three, two, one.

964
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,549
-You two look good together.
-You two look good.

965
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,551
It was so nice.

966
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,512
-I brought this.
-My gosh.

967
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,847
-Is it a Polaroid?
-Yes.

968
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,682
-To take pictures.
-We should take some.

969
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,477
-Wait, did he bring the shared camera?
-He did.

970
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,774
-Shall we take one here first?
-Okay.

971
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,194
Three, two, one.

972
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,702
-Hey, what's wrong with this?
-Is it not printing?

973
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,705
Wait.

974
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,415
Maybe there's no film inside.

975
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,125
-No, there is.
-Open it.

976
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,084
No way.

977
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,588
Excuse me, sir. There's no film.

978
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,591
Oh, gosh.

979
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,469
My gosh.

980
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,597
But that's what makes
Jong-woo attractive. Even all of that.

981
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,808
-His awkward ways.
-Right.

982
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,310
And he's still quite young.

983
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:50,023
-I should've been prepared.
-No, let's enjoy this moment.

984
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,610
-We can take pictures with our eyes.
-Commit it to memory.

985
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:57,030
Right. There's a lot to do, like swimming.

986
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,533
-Want to swim?
-Shall we?

987
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,617
Yes.

988
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,619
-Let's change.
-Get changed.

989
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,915
-Seul-ki doesn't like drinking alcohol.
-Right.

990
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,167
That's why she likes coffee,
going to cute cafés,

991
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,377
-and taking pictures.
-Yes.

992
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,549
"But the owner of the famous café
that I wanted to go to was actually you?"

993
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,050
That's what's so amazing.

994
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:18,468
-Right.
-There are so many cafés

995
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,845
-in Gangwon-do.
-I know.

996
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,555
-So I think…
-This is so amazing.

997
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,640
…her feelings for him could've grown more

998
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,725
-compared to before.
-I agree.

999
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,894
-Right.
-And another thing is,

1000
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,397
it felt like Seul-ki took the lead
with Jong-woo

1001
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,233
compared to the other guys
she was with in Paradise.

1002
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,651
Yes. I felt that too.

1003
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,280
It seemed like she was trying to stay
on the same page as Jong-woo,

1004
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:41,241
so I saw that as a positive thing.

1005
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:45,328
I'm actually nervous about that
because it seemed like

1006
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:50,792
Seul-ki didn't exactly feel excited
or enjoy her time with him.

1007
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:55,297
It seemed like she felt
forced to be on the same page as him.

1008
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,717
"I'm going to make sure
that Jong-woo is happy today."

1009
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,510
I felt that kind of determination.

1010
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,804
She could've felt that way
in the beginning,

1011
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,098
but as they talk,
I think she's becoming more--

1012
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,559
-Relaxed?
-Yes, I think she is.

1013
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:11,605
Well, Jong-woo is expressing
his feelings to the fullest.

1014
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,733
But I don't think
Seul-ki knows how to respond to that.

1015
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,277
I think she wants to repay him
for all he's done.

1016
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,904
-Out of gratitude?
-That's like…

1017
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,323
-It's like that…
-That's what I'm worried about.

1018
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:25,660
But at the end of the day,
women eventually go for men like Jong-woo.

1019
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,830
I think someone like Seul-ki
could choose a man like Jong-woo.

1020
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,957
-I see.
-At the end of the day.

1021
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,626
We'll have to watch and see.

1022
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:38,715
I'm curious about whether
a woman's feelings can change

1023
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,301
when a man is so noble
and pure towards her?

1024
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,802
-Of course.
-Really?

1025
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,720
Of course.

1026
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,680
It depends on the person.

1027
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:50,185
A person's feelings can change,
but some don't change at all.

1028
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,854
-It really depends on the person.
-Right.

1029
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,607
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND NADINE

1030
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,610
-When you won today…
-Yes.

1031
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,822
…you know how there was
a first, second, and third place?

1032
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,907
-Yes.
-Right?

1033
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,785
You came in third,
so the person you couldn't go with,

1034
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,996
or the person you wanted to go with
was already chosen, right?

1035
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,415
-The one you wanted to go with the most.
-Well…

1036
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:15,919
But the most…

1037
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,131
You can be honest. It's okay.

1038
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,634
-There were two people.
-Yes.

1039
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,388
I had two people in mind.
One was you, Nadine.

1040
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,682
-Right.
-And there was another person, but…

1041
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:35,438
I really wanted to talk to you here.

1042
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,316
-I was so curious about what you do.
-I see.

1043
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,735
-This is the only place we can talk.
-Right.

1044
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,364
I really wanted
to find out more about you.

1045
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,573
Okay.

1046
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,451
So I did want to come here with you.

1047
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,665
But the other person I had in mind?

1048
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:54,582
Yes.

1049
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:59,921
I hoped that she wouldn't come here
with another guy, and she stayed there.

1050
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:03,842
Even if I came,
I wanted to come with you or her.

1051
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,427
-Either way.
-I see.

1052
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,846
So I don't think I was
too torn about anything.

1053
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,182
She left with someone else,
so I chose you right away.

1054
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,767
-I see.
-Yes.

1055
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,481
-I don't think she was happy to hear that.
-Exactly.

1056
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,734
-She asked, so he answered.
-He was being honest.

1057
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,027
-Jin-young is honest.
-He is.

1058
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,111
He's very honest.

1059
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,950
But will you be able to juggle

1060
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,286
your studies and dating?

1061
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:37,792
Right, but I go all-in
when I'm in a relationship.

1062
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,294
-Really?
-Yes.

1063
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:42,756
I think that's why it's harder for me.

1064
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:48,219
I'm usually not that emotional,
but I become like that when I'm in one.

1065
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,929
-I see.
-I become like that.

1066
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,431
That's why I haven't been dating.

1067
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,976
-But you have a clear dream, Nadine.
-Right.

1068
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,687
I thought that could be…

1069
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,900
a challenge for you in a relationship.

1070
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:06,237
Well, that's what
I had thought earlier as we were talking.

1071
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,449
You're so sure about it,
and you know what steps to take.

1072
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,366
Yes.

1073
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,244
-The path you have to take is so clear.
-Yes.

1074
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:18,124
But I really believe
that I can find someone

1075
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,668
who can support my dream.

1076
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:21,586
I see.

1077
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:26,007
Of course, I might not be able
to spend a lot of time with him,

1078
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,551
but the time that we do spend together

1079
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:33,306
could be even more meaningful,
in my opinion.

1080
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,858
Why are you quiet all of a sudden?

1081
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,610
-What?
-Why are you so quiet?

1082
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,028
I was just thinking.

1083
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:08,466
I think I learn new things about myself
that I wasn't aware of when I'm here.

1084
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:14,055
-There are types that I tend to go for.
-Right.

1085
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,807
But now I'm drawn to people…

1086
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,854
-who are different from them…
-I see.

1087
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:21,896
…for the first time.

1088
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,068
-You really learned a lot about yourself.
-Yes.

1089
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,487
I think I did.

1090
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:31,614
I see.

1091
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,455
-Jin-young seems like he's conflicted.
-Right.

1092
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,665
So Nadine is studying him right now.

1093
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:46,004
It feels like they've encountered
a real problem in a way.

1094
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:50,341
To see this in a positive light,
Jin-young is already wondering

1095
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,470
what it would be like
to be in a relationship with Nadine.

1096
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,514
-Yes.
-The fact that he's worried about this

1097
00:57:56,598 --> 00:58:00,810
makes me think
that he's developing feelings towards her.

1098
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,312
He's thinking about that

1099
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,105
-because he's interested?
-Right.

1100
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,567
He said he learned new things
about himself he wasn't aware of…

1101
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,902
-That means something.
-Right.

1102
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:13,239
Ultimately, it means he's thinking
about Nadine. That's how I took it.

1103
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:17,619
"Am I thinking about flying
to Boston for the person I love?"

1104
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:18,578
-"Is that it?"
-Right.

1105
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,456
He wasn't interested in her at first,
and she wasn't his type,

1106
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,958
but he feels differently
because he's interested.

1107
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:28,129
I think that's why he said his feelings
have changed ever since coming here.

1108
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,464
-I see.
-Yes.

1109
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,134
If nothing happens between him
and Seul-ki when they go back to Inferno,

1110
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,054
then I think this could work out.

1111
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,680
-I wonder what--
-But I think

1112
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,307
as soon as they go back to Inferno,

1113
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,644
Seul-ki and Jin-young will talk,

1114
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:45,939
and Nadine and Jong-woo
will watch them again.

1115
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,106
-Yes.
-Oh, no.

1116
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,778
PARADISE
JONG-WOO AND SEUL-KI

1117
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,990
It's not really that cold.

1118
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,245
-Gosh. Shall we check the temperature?
-Okay.

1119
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,330
It's steaming. It's warm.

1120
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,833
Gosh, that's hot.

1121
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,545
That must've stung. Are you okay?

1122
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,005
I can take it.

1123
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,550
Like I did today.

1124
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,514
The night view here is amazing.

1125
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,099
-I can see the lights.
-I know.

1126
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:26,771
-What's that? Is that the moon?
-Yes, I think it's the moon.

1127
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,731
The moon is really pretty.

1128
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:34,487
-It rose just for the two of us to see.
-Yes, again.

1129
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,199
The moon is pretty tonight.

1130
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,159
Everything is pretty.

1131
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,246
Really. Everything is pretty.

1132
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,375
-Don't say that.
-Why? Is that embarrassing?

1133
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:52,422
This is fun.

1134
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,549
I didn't think that coming here

1135
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:59,554
could make me feel so overwhelmed.

1136
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,931
Me too. I never imagined

1137
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:08,396
that my heart would flutter
and get swayed here.

1138
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,691
I think our time here

1139
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,486
has allowed me to learn
something new about myself.

1140
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:18,906
I have a question.

1141
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:25,538
We're on our seventh or eighth day.

1142
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:31,711
-We've experienced a lot during that time.
-Right.

1143
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,547
Now that we're nearing the end,

1144
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:39,010
have you come to a decision
about your feelings?

1145
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,722
-I'm just curious.
-I see.

1146
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:57,320
Honestly, I thought
I had my mind made up.

1147
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,237
Right.

1148
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,530
But…

1149
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,163
-I'm not sure…
-All right.

1150
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:11,000
All right. I won't pressure you.

1151
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,169
I'm just…

1152
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:16,923
very…

1153
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,635
Well…

1154
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,388
How should I say this?

1155
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,439
Since I've been really interested in you…

1156
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,779
I'm mentally preparing myself

1157
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:44,117
not to feel too hurt by your final choice.

1158
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:52,542
Oh, gosh.

1159
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,046
I feel so…

1160
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,217
But…

1161
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,971
well…

1162
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,641
How should I say this?

1163
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,688
Everyone has a different way of thinking.

1164
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:23,406
Since I came here,

1165
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:27,368
I've always thought about the same thing.

1166
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:32,081
That while I should do
what my heart tells me to do,

1167
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,584
-I should always try my best.
-I see.

1168
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,212
I'm doing that right now.

1169
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,382
-So Jong-woo--
-You seem like it.

1170
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:45,219
Jong-woo, you should
also follow your heart.

1171
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,889
Let's both do our best.

1172
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,434
Okay, my born-in-1998 friend.
Let's do our best,

1173
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,020
especially since we were born
in the Year of the Tiger.

1174
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,229
Right?

1175
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,314
Yeah…

1176
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:18,336
It's so sad because she's the one
who made him feel love.

1177
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:23,090
He must want to express it so much,
and he probably has strong feelings,

1178
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:26,469
but he also knows
that she feels pressured.

1179
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,596
So he's controlling himself,

1180
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:33,226
holding it in, and trying to give up.
I can see all that.

1181
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,435
So I feel bad for him.

1182
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,771
It's like we're watching someone in love…

1183
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:40,566
When we have a crush on someone,
we all act like that.

1184
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,694
We always feel small when we're with them.

1185
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:44,612
Right.

1186
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:49,283
I think Seul-ki
is doing her best just like she said.

1187
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,203
-Right.
-But Seul-ki…

1188
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:56,833
You don't need to do
your best to feel love.

1189
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,418
It's something you can't hide,
like having a cold.

1190
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,713
-Seul-ki is just doing her best right now.
-Right.

1191
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,048
That's what I think.

1192
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:07,760
-I feel so bad.
-My heart is…

1193
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:12,098
INFERNO

1194
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:17,311
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you wearing warmer clothes?

1195
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,563
We have to talk.

1196
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:22,525
-You go first. I'll bring you a jacket.
-Okay.

1197
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:32,034
-Wear this. You're cold?
-Wear this?

1198
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,704
-Like this?
-Like this. This should be a bit warmer.

1199
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,498
-This is big, so…
-Okay.

1200
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,334
It's so cold.

1201
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,631
-Today…
-Yes?

1202
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:50,094
I thought I should at least talk to you

1203
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:54,974
since I didn't go
to Paradise with you

1204
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,894
after winning first place.

1205
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,730
So I wanted to talk to you.

1206
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:04,275
It's okay. I really don't care about that.

1207
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,985
-Really?
-Yes.

1208
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,487
If you had chosen me

1209
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,574
because I picked you, it could've seemed

1210
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,535
-like a give-and-take situation.
-Right.

1211
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:19,707
But I was rather happy
that you didn't, and picked someone else.

1212
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,167
Really?

1213
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:26,380
Yes, I just want you
not to care about what others think,

1214
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,925
do what you want to do here,

1215
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,761
and follow your heart.

1216
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,180
-I just…
-Yes?

1217
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:38,893
I just kept thinking,
"What's good is good."

1218
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:41,687
I kept trying not to get hurt.

1219
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,191
I tried to make decisions
that'd be best for everyone.

1220
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:48,986
-But that kept making things hard for me.
-Right.

1221
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:56,953
I didn't want to think of other people,

1222
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:03,084
and just do what I wanted,
but it didn't work.

1223
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:07,296
-So it was frustrating.
-Right. I understand.

1224
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,467
But right then,

1225
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:15,972
you took me to Paradise with you, so…

1226
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,849
How can I say this? I was thank--

1227
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:21,769
You told me not to say it,
so I don't know how you'll respond,

1228
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:22,853
but I was thankful.

1229
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,149
-I told you not to say thank you?
-Yes, that's what you said.

1230
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:36,659
It's just that with you,
before I chose you,

1231
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:41,998
when we talked briefly,
I kept thinking about you.

1232
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,000
-Really?
-To me…

1233
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,962
you seem very bubbly, but…

1234
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,424
I could tell you were having a hard time.

1235
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:55,261
I didn't know why, but it felt like
you were having a hard time.

1236
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,595
I could feel it.

1237
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:00,599
So you were on my mind a lot,

1238
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:05,062
and I guess I wanted to go there with you,

1239
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:07,815
and help you relax in a comfortable place.

1240
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,234
Really.

1241
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,906
It's understandable
that you're having a hard time.

1242
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:18,409
Cheer up.

1243
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,582
-Okay.
-I'm really worried.

1244
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:26,584
Thank you.

1245
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,335
I can feel it.

1246
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,131
I don't know. It's just that you…

1247
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:36,052
When I'm here,
I feel relaxed when you're around.

1248
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,181
Oh, my.

1249
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,349
-He feels relaxed around her.
-Se-jun.

1250
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,477
-That's nice.
-He's like her protector.

1251
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,064
I feel relaxed when you're around.

1252
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:52,943
I need you to be around me
because it relaxes me.

1253
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:53,986
I see.

1254
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,323
Oh, gosh.

1255
01:07:58,282 --> 01:07:59,700
You make me worry about you.

1256
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,378
-So-e really had a hard time.
-Right.

1257
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:15,758
And when So-e made her second choice,
she chose someone else.

1258
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:18,469
When she did,
he said he didn't care,

1259
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:23,265
that he wants her to choose someone else,
and that he just wants So-e to be happy.

1260
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:27,061
I thought maybe Se-jun said that
because he didn't have feelings for her,

1261
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:28,020
but it wasn't that.

1262
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,857
He's pursued only So-e all along
because he actually has feelings for her.

1263
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,860
Now that I think about it,
I think that's Se-jun's style.

1264
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,363
So-e looked like
she was bothered by it, right?

1265
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,990
-Right.
-About how she took someone else with her.

1266
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,409
I think So-e felt better,
thanks to Se-jun.

1267
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:43,494
-Yes.
-Yes.

1268
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,122
PARADISE
YOONG-JAE AND SEO-EUN

1269
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,081
Cheers.

1270
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,920
What do you think?

1271
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:55,381
-Is it okay?
-Yes!

1272
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:56,966
This is so good.

1273
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:58,759
Do you like melon?

1274
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,344
I love melon. Really.

1275
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,805
I like fruit.

1276
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,015
Pretty people tend to like fruit.

1277
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:07,726
I really like it.

1278
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:10,604
-Really pretty people…
-I seriously like them.

1279
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,648
Really pretty people really like fruit.

1280
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:14,692
Do you like fruit?

1281
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:16,819
-I like it a lot.
-Then you're pretty.

1282
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:24,535
There are so many
delicious things in this world.

1283
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,912
When we get out of here,
we should have sashimi and soju.

1284
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,248
We should.

1285
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,293
So should I go to Yeouido?

1286
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:35,087
You're welcome anytime. Really.

1287
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,048
Really? I don't know anything
about Yeouido.

1288
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,466
I know a lot.

1289
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:43,220
Then I should stick with someone
who knows many places

1290
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,139
-and learn about Yeouido.
-Of course.

1291
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:48,684
-I'll teach you everything.
-It's an island like Inferno.

1292
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,606
-We drank quickly.
-So fun.

1293
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,233
Yes, this is really fun.

1294
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,822
This drink is really good.

1295
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:02,781
Right.

1296
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,456
It's really good.

1297
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,209
Haven't had something cold
and sweet in a long time.

1298
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,210
This is great.

1299
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,631
-It's good, right?
-Yes.

1300
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,300
It's good
because you fed it to me.

1301
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:24,511
I fed you
because you won't eat it yourself.

1302
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,932
Do you know why I didn't eat it?

1303
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:30,559
Because I was waiting for you to feed me.

1304
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:32,853
This can't become a habit.

1305
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,073
-My gosh.
-What is this?

1306
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:46,450
This is like the honeymoon stage
of a relationship.

1307
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:48,994
It's not funny at all,
yet they're still laughing.

1308
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,163
-They just look at each other…
-They're happy.

1309
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,957
-Everything is great to them.
-Exactly.

1310
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,708
Imagine how happy they feel.

1311
01:10:57,836 --> 01:11:00,923
You're someone I'm very curious about.

1312
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,550
You're someone I want to get to know.

1313
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:08,514
I wonder what you think about things.

1314
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,809
I wonder what you usually think about.

1315
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,062
You're someone I'm curious about.

1316
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,844
I'm not going to wash my hand.

1317
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:51,098
I'm only going to wash my right hand.

1318
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,102
Should I not wash this hand either?

1319
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,732
These two love birds…

1320
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,775
-Gosh, they're too sweet.
-Yes.

1321
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:07,114
I'll request an extra bed,
so get ready to sleep.

1322
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:09,158
-Okay. No, wait.
-Okay.

1323
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,162
I mean, anyway…

1324
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:19,585
Wait, let's think about it.

1325
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,633
I have to wash up before I sleep.
Just a second.

1326
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:30,054
Let me lie down for just a second.

1327
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:33,891
Before I wash up,
I need to think about how I'll wash up.

1328
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:35,267
Oh, dear.

1329
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,270
Oh, dear.

1330
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,245
Seo-eun.

1331
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,585
Seo-eun.

1332
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,632
You're still not waking up.

1333
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,133
What are you going to do?

1334
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,887
I'm not a pushover.

1335
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:43,043
Wake me up in five minutes.

1336
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,002
Okay.

1337
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,843
Am I seeing things,
or is the sun rising right now?

1338
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,388
-It is. Just a little.
-Right?

1339
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,306
What time is it? Is it 5:00 a.m.?

1340
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,891
Either 4:00 a.m. or 5:00 a.m.

1341
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:00,853
-What?
-Did they stay up all night?

1342
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,439
-Did they drink all night?
-They talked until sunrise?

1343
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,023
That's crazy.

1344
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,859
-They must've had a good time.
-Yes.

1345
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:16,076
-This is amazing.
-What is?

1346
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:18,579
Everything is amazing.

1347
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:20,873
It's fun.

1348
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:21,915
It's fun?

1349
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,293
It's fun, amazing, and good.

1350
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:30,466
Thank you for coming today.

1351
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:32,134
Thank you…

1352
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:35,888
for telling me to come out today.

1353
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:47,941
I don't think anyone can get
in between them, right?

1354
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:49,568
-It's exciting.
-Right.

1355
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:52,112
Since they left Inferno,

1356
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:56,450
they've been together for about 12 hours,
and that includes sleeping time.

1357
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:58,202
-Right.
-But they don't want to sleep.

1358
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:01,246
-My gosh.
-Every minute counts for them.

1359
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,123
I thought it was around evening.

1360
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,334
-No wonder they're sleepy.
-Stayed up all night.

1361
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,877
My heart was racing watching them.

1362
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,755
You know how couples
are so excited in the early stages

1363
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:12,799
of their relationship
because they're so happy, right?

1364
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:15,928
I think rather than sharing a bed,

1365
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:18,639
lying down a bit apart
and facing each other

1366
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:21,350
-is much more romantic.
-Right.

1367
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:27,523
FINAL DECISION
D-1

1368
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,777
We're back on Inferno.

1369
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,614
-Be careful.
-Okay. Take it slow.

1370
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:38,700
-This is familiar.
-This is familiar.

1371
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,035
It really is.

1372
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:43,413
-I wonder what everyone is doing.
-Right?

1373
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:45,415
They ask so many questions
when you return.

1374
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,334
-Right.
-"What'd you do? How was it?"

1375
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:48,460
"Was it nice?"

1376
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,380
-"Did you change your mind?"
-"Did you change your mind?"

1377
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:56,301
I can't believe
it's the last night already.

1378
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,595
-We're back.
-We're back.

1379
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:02,599
You're back!

1380
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,726
-Hi.
-Hi.

1381
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,853
-Hello.
-Did you have fun?

1382
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:09,398
You both look like you did.

1383
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,364
-Did you have fun?
-Hi.

1384
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:18,907
Yes.

1385
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:21,451
-You're finally back.
-Here's our star!

1386
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:22,995
-Hey!
-How was it?

1387
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,205
I don't really remember.
I was too nervous.

1388
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:28,500
-You were nervous?
-Because I was so excited.

1389
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,586
You pictured this
in your head a dozen times.

1390
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:31,587
Gosh, yes.

1391
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:35,215
-It was a dream come true, so…
-You did great.

1392
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:38,927
You look good, Seul-ki.

1393
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:43,599
You know how we can talk
about our jobs, age, and everything?

1394
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,559
-Yes.
-So now, I feel more comfortable

1395
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:46,893
-around Jong-woo.
-I see.

1396
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,479
-I want to know what he does.
-Only you know.

1397
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:50,939
-Only Seul-ki knows.
-Right.

1398
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:54,735
But I found out he's someone
I already know, and it gave me chills.

1399
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,069
-I mean…
-You already knew him?

1400
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:59,489
-I saw Jong-woo once.
-You saw him? Is he a YouTuber?

1401
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,076
-I'm curious.
-It was really amazing yesterday.

1402
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:06,455
-I feel closer to Jong-woo now.
-That's good.

1403
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:07,539
Well, I…

1404
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,166
You just liked it.

1405
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:10,751
Cut it out!

1406
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:12,210
Then what can I ask him?

1407
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:15,881
Jong-woo didn't say anything,
but you guys started laughing.

1408
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,007
It was good for me.

1409
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:19,593
As soon as we brought it up,
Jong-woo smiled.

1410
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:20,510
No, no.

1411
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,763
I couldn't stop smiling
when we went inside.

1412
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:25,849
We talked a lot.

1413
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:28,685
When we revealed our jobs, age,
we were both surprised.

1414
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:29,978
Both? Really?

1415
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:33,065
I was surprised at what she does.

1416
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,942
It suits her really well
when I think about it.

1417
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:39,696
How do you feel? Now that you know?

1418
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,407
I was shocked.

1419
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:45,827
It was something I didn't expect.

1420
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,704
-What about you, Nadine?
-Nadine.

1421
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,415
-Nadine.
-It was fun. It was really fun.

1422
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:55,337
We had some experiences in common.

1423
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,630
Similar things.

1424
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,467
-Min-su probably knows already.
-Yes.

1425
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,970
But I did the things he did too.

1426
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:09,309
-So there was a lot to talk about.
-You guys would've talked nonstop.

1427
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,103
They seemed to vibe pretty well.

1428
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,979
She's basically on her honeymoon.

1429
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:15,190
-I know.
-She's back from her honeymoon.

1430
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:17,401
Once this ends, get your marriage license.

1431
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:21,113
-Somebody told me you're sealing the deal.
-What are you talking about?

1432
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:24,157
-She only slept an hour.
-No, two hours and a half.

1433
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,785
-You talked all night?
-Honeymoon?

1434
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,622
There's a rumor
you only slept for an hour.

1435
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:31,581
-Me?
-Yes.

1436
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:32,791
I heard you hardly slept.

1437
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:35,043
-Really?
-What on earth happened?

1438
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,629
-No. We did sleep.
-I'm curious.

1439
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,298
-How much sleep did you get?
-About an hour?

1440
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:42,676
Did you talk all night?

1441
01:18:42,759 --> 01:18:44,678
-You talked all night?
-Yes, basically.

1442
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:47,264
-That's such a long time.
-You have good stamina.

1443
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:51,226
We got there, and you know,
this was our second time going.

1444
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:54,020
We ended up getting
the same room as before.

1445
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:56,398
So we were in the same place

1446
01:18:56,481 --> 01:19:00,485
from beginning to end,
but we felt a bit different.

1447
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,445
-I see.
-I see.

1448
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:03,071
So it was very meaningful.

1449
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:10,120
-Leave our bags and go there.
-Take our bags to the dressing…

1450
01:19:10,203 --> 01:19:11,079
Okay.

1451
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,207
-My gosh!
-I hate free time the most now.

1452
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:20,922
-Why? Don't you want to talk to Jin-young?
-I do, but I'm also scared.

1453
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:22,549
-What? Why?
-I'm scared.

1454
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,302
Once I actually get there,

1455
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:27,012
-I think I can do it.
-It's okay.

1456
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:28,430
But to call him out…

1457
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:31,808
I'm worried he'll friendzone me.

1458
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:34,478
-Because he made up his mind before?
-If I tell him.

1459
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:37,689
Jin-young wouldn't do that.

1460
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,941
-You think?
-You went to Paradise together twice.

1461
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,193
You guys are close.

1462
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:50,827
The hottest inferno in the world,
Single's Inferno.

1463
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:57,459
Today is the last day to go on free dates
before the final decision tomorrow.

1464
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:02,214
Please enjoy your date until the end
so that you won't regret it.

1465
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:04,883
Excuse me.

1466
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:06,718
See you.

1467
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,929
Go tell her.
