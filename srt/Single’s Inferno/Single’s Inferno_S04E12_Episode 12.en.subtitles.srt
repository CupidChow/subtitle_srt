SINGLE'S INFERNO

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,559
Who is it?

16
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,685
Who got there first?

17
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,440
Hey, what's up?

18
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,568
Hey! Wait…

19
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,652
"Hey, what's up?"

20
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,238
"Hey, what's up?"

21
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:13,782
Hey, what's up?

22
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,160
Hey! Wait…

23
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,703
Gosh, you're so funny.

24
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:23,166
I mean, this is the first time
Jun-seo has come to our room to get me.

25
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,084
Let's go now.

26
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,085
Go where?

27
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,211
Let's go outside.

28
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,879
Where outside?

29
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,380
I know a nice place.

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,675
It's so funny how he knocked.

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,719
I guess everyone's sprinting
at the home stretch.

32
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,637
Yeah.

33
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,730
My goodness.

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,277
That one question made
her heart start to race again.

35
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,446
This time, the way he said it was nice.

36
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,614
-Yeah.
-The "Hey" too.

37
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,407
But did you see her laugh?

38
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,034
-Yeah.
-I did.

39
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,161
-She loved it.
-They're tied, right?

40
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,162
I think so.

41
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,249
Forget being tied.

42
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,417
-Jun-seo might be ahead.
-Right?

43
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,460
Jun-seo's up 60 to 40.

44
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,795
-Yeah.
-It's unbelievable.

45
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,256
It's 60 percent Jun-seo
and 40 percent Jeong-su.

46
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,340
"Sixty percent."

47
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,802
I think Jun-seo left to go talk to Si-an.

48
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,264
He seemed to have a lot on his mind.

49
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,099
-What?
-He seemed to have a lot on his mind.

50
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,684
Yeah, I'm sure he does.

51
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,731
It seemed like he came
to a decision yesterday.

52
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,693
-Yesterday?
-Yeah, for the most part.

53
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,445
I think he's decided.

54
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,948
He can't be thinking that.

55
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,950
Don't reassure him.
It's not the time for that.

56
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,414
What's gotten into you?

57
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,208
-What's gotten into me?
-You came looking for me first.

58
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,044
Right? It's been a while
or maybe my first time coming over.

59
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,379
I was a little surprised.

60
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,297
-Really?
-Yeah.

61
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,466
You have to do things to the fullest.

62
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,266
What did you do? What?
Why are you smiling so broadly today?

63
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,101
Why are you smiling so much?

64
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,561
Well, it's nice to see you.

65
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,062
-I see.
-Yeah.

66
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,110
-Yesterday…
-What did you do?

67
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,570
Hey, so yesterday…

68
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,531
When you were choosing,
I knew I wouldn't go.

69
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,532
-I…
-You knew?

70
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,534
Yeah, it felt like
you'd pick someone else.

71
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,827
-Right.
-But…

72
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,622
-Once it actually happened…
-Yeah?

73
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,665
it really hurt.

74
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,670
So I was really amazed by it all.

75
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,881
-I see.
-My feelings.

76
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,675
-Right.
-My emotions.

77
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,346
I've been to Paradise a lot,
so I have no regrets about not going.

78
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,263
Right.

79
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,517
But the sky looked so pretty
yesterday on Inferno.

80
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,477
-So…
-Yeah.

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,188
I thought it would've been nice
if we'd seen it together.

82
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,358
Damn it.

83
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,193
-What's with you?
-What?

84
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,157
It's over!

85
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,575
"Wait, did he really say that?"

86
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,452
-That's what she's thinking.
-Right?

87
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,120
-The look she gave was priceless.
-Yeah.

88
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,789
It was adorable.

89
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,833
Damn it.

90
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,001
What's with you?

91
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,589
That's just how it was.

92
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,886
Also, we didn't really have
any separate conversations or anything.

93
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,804
Okay.

94
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,181
We all gathered and talked outside.

95
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,892
Then, we went to bed early.
I think it was around 11 p.m.

96
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,394
-That's early.
-Yeah.

97
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,979
I slept early and well too,

98
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,272
so I feel better today.

99
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,314
-You do?
-Yeah.

100
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,941
I see. That's good.

101
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:35,858
Yeah.

102
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,070
-That's what happened.
-Right.

103
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,447
-So you and I went to Paradise twice.
-Yeah.

104
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,865
On our second time,

105
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,369
I thought back on how I acted.

106
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,663
"My mind's been sorted out."

107
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,499
-Right.
-That was my thought before I went to bed.

108
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,417
I see.

109
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,751
-So…
-So you sorted things out?

110
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,794
Yeah.

111
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,964
I told Min-seol too.

112
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,258
That's what I did.

113
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,426
-I see.
-Yeah.

114
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,928
-I just did my part.
-Right.

115
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,930
-You did.
-I tied up loose ends.

116
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,141
And I've clearly expressed
my feelings now.

117
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,061
I don't have to do
or put more effort into anything now.

118
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,772
Then, all you need to do
is be sweeter now.

119
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,275
That's right.

120
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,193
I'll try to be.

121
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,737
Yeah, try to be a bit softer.

122
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,654
Right.

123
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,574
-You just need to be a little sweeter.
-Yeah.

124
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,910
-Call me by my name.
-What?

125
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,413
Si-an.

126
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,585
I'll have to practice.

127
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,378
-Not "Hey, Si-an."
-Not "Hey."

128
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,546
-My name isn't "Hey."
-Okay.

129
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,464
It's Si-an.

130
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,841
Okay.

131
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,511
He's trying to change.

132
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,973
The beast is being tamed.

133
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,898
I can't believe it's already the last day.

134
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:57,815
Yeah.

135
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,692
Somehow,

136
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,861
-I went to Paradise with you a lot.
-Yeah.

137
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,738
And we spent a lot of time together.

138
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,531
-Yeah.
-So I don't have regrets about that.

139
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,033
-Right.
-We were together a lot.

140
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,117
-You're right.
-Yeah.

141
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,455
The feelings I had inside…

142
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,373
Yeah?

143
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:18,294
-As we talked on our first Paradise date…
-Right.

144
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,213
-I let a lot of those things out.
-Right.

145
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,965
-The feelings I had been holding back.
-Yeah.

146
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,678
Back then,

147
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,223
I was on the verge of tears too.

148
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,059
Yeah, you kept saying that.

149
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,310
Yeah.

150
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,816
You gave me a huge hug.

151
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,779
DAY 6 PARADISE

152
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,030
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

153
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,116
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

154
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,450
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

155
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,327
It hurts so much.

156
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,082
-I was thankful.
-I see.

157
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,209
After I cried,

158
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,628
it just all came out.

159
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,547
It all went out.

160
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,008
-Like this?
-Everything inside of me all came out.

161
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,307
I don't know what to say.

162
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,225
What?

163
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,603
You don't have to say anything.

164
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,817
-There's nothing to do back there.
-Yeah. What?

165
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,860
You have nothing to do.

166
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,778
Just pretend there's nothing
and stay here.

167
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,535
I've never seen him like this before.

168
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,786
He's trying so hard.

169
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,163
Yeah, he is.

170
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,747
Yuk Jun-seo has sweetness installed.

171
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,583
-That's huge.
-That's hard to beat.

172
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,709
-Yeah.
-It really is.

173
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,712
-I think it's 70 to 80% in his favor now.
-It is.

174
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,923
But with Si-an, I don't know.

175
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,759
I think there's a side of her
she only shows Jun-seo.

176
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,428
-That's exactly right.
-There is.

177
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,514
-She had a huge smile when he came to her.
-Yeah.

178
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,516
-And her face has been so expressive.
-Right.

179
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,642
When she's with Jeong-su,

180
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,728
-it's like they're an old couple.
-Yeah.

181
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,770
But with Jun-seo,

182
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,732
it feels like that period
at the start of a relationship.

183
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,276
The biggest difference
between them is

184
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,320
Si-an doesn't expect anything
from Jeong-su.

185
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,030
She keeps expecting things from Jun-seo.

186
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,323
Like, "Do this, do that."

187
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,033
She asked him to treat her more kindly.

188
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,076
She already expects a lot from him.

189
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,204
So this seems to be something instinctive.

190
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,372
Si-an's heart is set on Jun-seo.

191
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,584
If she's so sure about Jeong-su,

192
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,003
I don't think Jun-seo's words
would make her melt

193
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,422
or make her look at him
so lovingly like that.

194
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,341
-Exactly. Didn't I tell you?
-Yeah.

195
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,885
I don't want to talk anymore.

196
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,054
I just want to watch now.

197
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,263
-I won't talk.
-Let's watch.

198
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,557
-You don't know.
-Premature assumptions are forbidden.

199
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,978
A-rin?

200
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,564
Are you going to take long?

201
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,900
Just five minutes. No, three.

202
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,318
-Two minutes.
-Two minutes?

203
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,154
What's with him?

204
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,324
"What's with him?"

205
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,201
She loves it.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,918
Let's go.

207
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,587
How's my outfit? Does it look tropical?

208
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,713
You look like a drink.

209
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,714
I look like a drink?

210
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,633
A fruit drink.

211
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,221
-Should we sit here?
-Okay.

212
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,728
I put on some glasses today.

213
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,021
Are they prescription glasses?

214
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,815
They're weak ones that block blue light.

215
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,484
There's no blue light to block out here.

216
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,610
Just trying to be stylish?

217
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,862
What are you talking about?
Stylish? Please.

218
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,408
-They suit you.
-So, what did you do yesterday?

219
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,409
-Yesterday?
-Yeah.

220
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,661
-I talked big about having a blast…
-Yeah.

221
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,579
But it wasn't fun.

222
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,623
There wasn't anyone
I wanted to have talks with.

223
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,960
I just watched Jun-seo and Min-seol.

224
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,629
You were so pumped to have fun,
but I guess nothing happened.

225
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,589
Seriously.

226
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,925
When you're in Paradise,
you actually wonder what people are up to

227
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,844
and what pictures they take on Inferno.

228
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,429
You were curious about that?

229
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,723
You seem very interested in Inferno.

230
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,434
-Well, because you were here.
-I see.

231
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,436
-Well, because you were here.
-I see.

232
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,314
In that case,
it's good to show interest then.

233
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,903
When I went to Paradise yesterday,
it was a bit different.

234
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,408
I heard. I was so jealous.

235
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,951
-You don't have to be.
-Why?

236
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,661
-I heard you went to an izakaya.
-We did.

237
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,746
You went bowling too.

238
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,289
-We did.
-Exactly.

239
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,332
It was nothing special.

240
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,959
There wasn't anything fun
like that when we went.

241
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,544
Bowling was pretty boring.

242
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,922
It would've been fun with me.

243
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,591
That would've made it different.

244
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,556
How cute.

245
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,893
-We went straight to an izakaya.
-Okay.

246
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,227
We ate dinner.

247
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,772
We had some tea after dinner.

248
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,815
-We ate some fruit.
-I see.

249
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,235
We talked for a bit.
Then we washed up and went to bed.

250
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,825
You're explaining
your timeline in detail again

251
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,285
-about what you did.
-Well…

252
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,662
I'm just saying what happened.

253
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,081
There was nothing special.

254
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,624
I see.

255
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,921
-What?
-What?

256
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,590
Why are you laughing?

257
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,717
Gosh, how funny.

258
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,642
-Why do you keep laughing?
-What about you?

259
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,977
Stop laughing. You're making me laugh.

260
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,939
-You laughed first.
-No, you did.

261
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,904
What? Why do you keep laughing?

262
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,701
-What are they so happy about?
-They just are.

263
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,952
They must be happy.

264
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,453
-They're so close now.
-Right.

265
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,456
You don't have earrings on today.

266
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,333
No, I didn't get a chance
to put anything on.

267
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,626
Because you had no time?

268
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,879
You gave me two minutes.
So I came out after one.

269
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,256
-I'll pick them for you.
-Really?

270
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,298
What are the choices?

271
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,717
Those leaves.

272
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,845
Now that I'm seeing you from the side,

273
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,264
your earrings are so big.

274
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,182
They're noisy too.

275
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,684
I saw them…

276
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,061
-They're huge.
-And they look so heavy.

277
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,896
They suit you.

278
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,981
Thank you.

279
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,816
Those leaves.

280
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,484
-Not the leaves.
-No?

281
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,488
Wear what I pick out for you.

282
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,409
But I didn't bring that many accessories.

283
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,953
This is what I have.

284
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,413
That looks good on you.

285
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,790
-This is better, right?
-Yeah, that and…

286
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,125
Try this one on.

287
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,418
Let's go with this.

288
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,586
No, not that one.

289
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,338
These ones…

290
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,340
-These scare me.
-You hate these.

291
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,884
They scare me.

292
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,386
-These scare me.
-No, I'll put them to my ears.

293
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,388
They could be okay
if you look at them now.

294
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,514
-Let me see.
-How are they?

295
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,224
Those scare me. Don't wear them.

296
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,143
They're scary.

297
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,104
-Wear these.
-Forget it.

298
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,647
I want to wear what I want.

299
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,065
Really? Then, let's do that.

300
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:56,901
Why did you bring me…

301
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,445
I don't want to wear this either.
It's too bold.

302
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,365
-"Really? Then, let's do that."
-"Why did you bring me?"

303
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,493
This one's nice.

304
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,994
-It suits you.
-Help me put it on.

305
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,539
-This is hard. I've never tried before.
-My nails are too long.

306
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,793
Try your best,
or I can ask someone outside.

307
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,339
Is that okay? Good?

308
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,632
-Yeah, it's good.
-Let's go.

309
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,549
Good.

310
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,343
Why did you even ask for my opinion?

311
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,260
What?

312
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,096
These two are just on a real date.

313
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,097
-Right.
-Yes.

314
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,182
A date on Inferno.

315
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,851
It's a done deal for them.

316
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,561
-That's right.
-Yeah.

317
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,605
They make me smile.

318
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,191
Knock, knock.

319
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,779
-What are you doing?
-What?

320
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,905
Let's hang out.

321
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,073
Okay.

322
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,244
Do you want to take a Polaroid?

323
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,411
Sure.

324
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,040
The weather's nice.

325
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,043
It sure is!

326
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,879
It sure is.

327
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,799
We didn't get a chance to take any.

328
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,217
I'll take a nice one for you.

329
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,179
I'll take one for you two.

330
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,057
Really? That would be great.

331
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,975
Sure.

332
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,894
Okay, one… That pose was better.

333
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,812
Yeah.

334
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,314
The tour guide.

335
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,902
-When did he appear?
-The tour guide!

336
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,404
Give us a count.

337
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,822
Okay, I'll take it.

338
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,450
Okay, one, two.

339
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,663
One more.

340
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,749
Okay, smile. One, two.

341
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,336
-Last one.
-That's too fast.

342
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,130
Let's take a funny one.

343
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,047
Okay.

344
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,841
What are you going to do?

345
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,599
Gosh, they're such a good-looking couple.

346
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,600
Seriously.

347
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,560
Let me see.

348
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,563
I think I'm going to be scolded.

349
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,316
Jong-hoon took the pictures and just left.

350
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,069
Is he a real tour guide?

351
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,071
-When? I didn't know he left.
-I think he is.

352
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,116
Let me see.

353
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,036
I think I'm going to be scolded.

354
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,331
You didn't make a silly face, did you?

355
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,958
This is my silly face.

356
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,464
Hey!

357
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,633
No, I tried!

358
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,968
I tried to make a face.

359
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,387
-Come on!
-I don't know you went that far.

360
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,265
I mean, you should've told me
how far to go.

361
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,143
Come on, what is this?

362
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,479
You can't suddenly crank it up
all the way like that.

363
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,441
I'm going to keep this one.

364
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,068
No.

365
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,611
They came out great.

366
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,199
Gosh, even your silly face
looks perfect too.

367
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,585
Wow, this is like a photoshoot.

368
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,670
Wait.

369
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,423
That's it.

370
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,639
-Here it comes.
-Here it comes.

371
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,186
You'll obviously look pretty.

372
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,446
Aren't you tired? You seem really tired.

373
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,572
-I look tired today?
-Yeah.

374
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,367
You're tired, aren't you?

375
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,998
The old man's tired.

376
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,541
This old man is…

377
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,876
The old man's tired.

378
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,507
You really love that.

379
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,928
That's how you laughed.

380
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,563
I can't believe it's the last day.

381
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,024
-Right?
-Yeah.

382
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,405
How relaxing.

383
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,533
Seriously…

384
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,786
it feels like a dream.

385
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,580
It does?

386
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,293
Time went by so fast.

387
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,258
What's the current score? Who's leading?

388
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,718
-"The current score"!
-Yes.

389
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,053
The current score…

390
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,096
-definitely favors Yuk Jun-seo.
-Yes.

391
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,556
-Yes.
-I agree.

392
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,225
Si-an seems like she's happy
and having fun.

393
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,394
But it seems her heart is somewhere else.

394
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,812
That's what it feels like.

395
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,147
She looks too comfortable.

396
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,026
Why do you keep sighing?

397
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,694
Is there trouble at home?

398
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,489
Da-hee always seemed to have

399
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,449
-a soft spot for Jeong-su.
-That's right.

400
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,242
Why do you think Si-an will pick Jeong-su?

401
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,745
Well, when she was with Jeong-su,

402
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,748
I saw how she occasionally seemed
to have things on her mind.

403
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,666
It seems like her heart's with Jun-seo,

404
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,711
but I still think she'll end up
picking Jeong-su in the end.

405
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,005
What? Really?

406
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,757
You're so…

407
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,967
Wow, you're so unwavering.

408
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,969
It's not who you'd choose yourself, right?

409
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,888
-It's not that.
-She's steadfast like Dong-ho.

410
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,850
Don't you think she'll pick someone
who feels more stable and comfortable?

411
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,186
But since it's Si-an, I'm not sure.

412
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,188
So even though she has more feelings

413
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,023
-for Yuk Jun-seo…
-Yes.

414
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,608
-She may look at the long term.
-Yes.

415
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,693
-And she may go for comfort?
-That's right.

416
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,945
You never know.

417
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,323
I think Si-an will pick Jun-seo.

418
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,367
-Really?
-Really? I thought it'd be Jeong-su.

419
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,576
Yeah, Jeong-su.

420
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,703
-Why?
-You still have no clue.

421
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,957
Why all of a sudden?
I mean, Si-an isn't in my room.

422
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,376
I don't think we talk about it
in our room either.

423
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,669
Why Jeong-su all of a sudden?

424
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,962
It's not sudden.

425
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,463
They went to Paradise at the start.

426
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,257
-She said she kept swooning.
-Yeah.

427
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,051
She said Jeong-su
massaged her hand like this.

428
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,761
-Si-an hasn't forgotten about that.
-But…

429
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,012
Really? Still?

430
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,473
She told us. She said it made her swoon.

431
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,434
Didn't she go to check one last time?

432
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,730
I want to pick Jun-seo.
Do you think he'll pick me?

433
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,234
-She hears what she wants to hear.
-My goodness!

434
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,736
-She's so cute.
-It's what she wants to believe.

435
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,946
Gosh, Min-seol.

436
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,284
I want to pick Jun-seo.
Do you think he'll pick me?

437
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,453
-What?
-You think he'd pick me?

438
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,289
Should I go talk to him now?

439
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,332
If it were me,
I would've told him everything.

440
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,376
I can't speak on their behalf,

441
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,005
but from what I heard,
"If we had time, things could change."

442
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,006
What are you doing?

443
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,217
A-rin, let's go.

444
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,802
-Where are you going?
-No, you can't!

445
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,221
-I want to talk to you.
-Jeez, you're so mean!

446
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,514
-You're so mean.
-He's with me.

447
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,808
-Dong-ho and I haven't talked much.
-Fine.

448
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,560
-Let's all sit and talk here.
-Here.

449
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,520
A-rin and I will go and hang out.

450
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,730
Hey, can I sit here?

451
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,814
Yeah, you can.

452
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,149
-They're our beds.
-Okay.

453
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,401
Did you sleep well last night?

454
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,738
Me? I slept so well. I just passed out.

455
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,115
-I was so quiet yesterday, right?
-Yeah.

456
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,700
I was walking on eggshells.

457
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,118
-Really? Sorry.
-Yeah.

458
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,829
When we were doing the dishes,
you looked angry.

459
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,122
I couldn't even talk to you.

460
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,248
I looked angry?

461
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,960
Yeah, you made it so obvious
that you hated doing the dishes with me.

462
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,545
Why would I hate that?

463
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,963
I don't know, but you showed it.

464
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,632
-No, I didn't hate it.
-Really?

465
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,300
It was just

466
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,053
that my personal feelings
and concerns weren't sorted out then.

467
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,221
-That's why.
-I see.

468
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,931
-Are they sorted out now?
-Yeah.

469
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,349
-Definitely.
-That's good.

470
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,059
I don't care about the results.

471
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,145
I just need to go with what feels right.

472
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,232
-Right?
-Me too.

473
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,942
-Yeah.
-I'm going to do the same.

474
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,986
-I think that's right. Don't you?
-Yeah, it is.

475
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,614
Let's drink tonight.

476
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,949
I swear,

477
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,368
-you just treat me like a little sister!
-What?

478
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,036
Seriously, you…

479
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,704
-Are you insane?
-What?

480
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,916
Sure, let's drink.

481
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,836
Is this your look today?

482
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,213
-Yeah, an innocent look.
-Get up.

483
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,799
Wait, let me see.

484
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,385
It looks nice.

485
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,387
Don't I look okay?

486
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,764
-Right?
-You don't have any accessories?

487
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,432
-I do.
-It looks a bit plain.

488
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,518
Put a necklace on.

489
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,020
"Put a necklace on"!

490
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,357
I have some,
but I don't know what to wear.

491
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,109
Pick one for me.

492
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,195
-Not this one.
-Let me see then.

493
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,280
Pick one from these.

494
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,452
They're accessories picked out
by someone who has no feelings for her.

495
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,663
-What's the point?
-But she has feelings for him.

496
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,831
-Yeah.
-Really?

497
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,499
-For Min-seol…
-Isn't it sad?

498
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,625
-Yeah.
-It's a fun time.

499
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,584
Really?

500
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,086
-Yes, from her perspective.
-Yes.

501
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,381
-Not much, right?
-Something like this could be better.

502
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,674
-What? This?
-This. Yeah.

503
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,591
Okay.

504
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,262
-This one's good?
-It's not bad.

505
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,513
Put it on for me.

506
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,265
-Me?
-My nails are too long.

507
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,850
Jeez, you're such a hassle.

508
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,060
Do it for me. My nails are too long.

509
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,228
-Okay.
-I can't do it.

510
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,146
Let me see.

511
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,817
Don't make it too short.

512
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,569
Right, a little loose.

513
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,321
Thank you.

514
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,534
I should take a look.

515
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,369
Yeah. You've tanned a lot too.

516
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,996
Yeah, I'm really tan.

517
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,124
-Hey!
-Yeah?

518
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,418
-Not bad, right?
-This is it.

519
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,964
Jun-seo is 200% picking Si-an.

520
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,883
Gosh, but…

521
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,345
Jun-seo's so weird. He keeps…

522
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,806
He keeps leading me on.
It's driving me crazy.

523
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,893
He keeps flirting.
And he put the necklace on me too.

524
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,978
Even though he has feelings
for someone else,

525
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,688
he keeps flirting with me.

526
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,609
He didn't lead her on at all.

527
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,614
-He did absolutely nothing.
-You're so mean.

528
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,407
I mean, seriously though.

529
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,117
I can see why Min-seol thought that way.

530
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,536
Wait, so did Jun-seo flirt with her?

531
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,288
-Not at all.
-He didn't flirt.

532
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,665
-He's always been comfortable around her.
-Right.

533
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,833
But to her,

534
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,169
she keeps thinking that he's flirting.

535
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,130
And Jun-seo just came to hang out.

536
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,924
-He was bored.
-That's right.

537
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,801
Also, he picked the necklace

538
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,677
-because she asked him to.
-Right.

539
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,722
She asked him to put it on her
and he said, "You're such a hassle."

540
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,015
You're right.

541
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,644
If you watch again,
you'll see he really wasn't flirting.

542
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,355
I think Min-seol wants to
think what she wants.

543
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,982
-When she talks with the other women…
-Right.

544
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,361
She asks, "Don't you think so?"
and tries to get the answer she wants.

545
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:28,281
But when someone's in love,
they tend to believe what they want.

546
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,868
-They put meaning into every little thing.
-Yes.

547
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,995
So that was why.

548
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,833
-Should we talk in that private room?
-Sure.

549
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,170
-I'll be sad to see it end.
-Yeah.

550
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,505
It's already almost over.

551
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,590
I didn't think time would fly.

552
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,093
Ten days felt so long to me at the start.

553
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,387
-Yeah.
-I was worried.

554
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,806
-But it flew by.
-Yeah, I agree.

555
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,517
It felt even quicker
since we went to Paradise twice.

556
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,601
Right.

557
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,355
Anything you regret
during your ten days here?

558
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,360
I regret losing the game
and staying on Inferno the first day.

559
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,653
-Really?
-Yeah.

560
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,572
I've always

561
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,701
-looked for situations to win in life…
-Right.

562
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,538
So I learned that I needed to
put up with that kind of thing here.

563
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,083
That wasn't easy for me on the first day.

564
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,213
What are "situations to win in life"?

565
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,381
Business. Being successful.

566
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,841
-He meant that, right?
-Conquering.

567
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,343
It seems he's consumed
in his own world.

568
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,845
-He's too self-absorbed.
-Yeah.

569
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,972
The three chocolate coins.

570
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,766
I wanted to give all of them to you.

571
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,059
-Really?
-Yeah.

572
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,770
-Do you know who I gave mine to?
-No.

573
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,189
-You're not curious?
-Nope.

574
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,106
-Really?
-Yeah.

575
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,066
-You're not curious?
-No.

576
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,904
I don't care who you gave yours to.
I don't care who gave me mine.

577
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,406
I'm not the type
who gets curious about those things.

578
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,324
Is that so?

579
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,118
You're not curious?

580
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,036
That's right.

581
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,913
-Really?
-Yeah.

582
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,501
-I don't think it has any real meaning.
-That's interesting. I see.

583
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,378
To me, my feelings and my thoughts

584
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,381
are the most important things.

585
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,716
I see.

586
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,719
That's interesting.

587
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,388
"That's interesting"!

588
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,724
That really is interesting.

589
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,268
But women want men to be curious.

590
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,186
-That's it.
-Yeah.

591
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,313
To her, it's strange
that he's not curious.

592
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,023
-It's weird.
-Why isn't he?

593
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,691
If someone is interested in me,

594
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,652
he should be curious
about who I voted for.

595
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,362
-She wants him to be curious.
-Yes.

596
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,532
-I talked about this.
-What?

597
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,575
"I don't think Te-hwan
is that interested in me."

598
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,493
-Really?
-Yeah.

599
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,078
I just think…

600
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,540
I've always been indifferent

601
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,458
-toward other people.
-Exactly.

602
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,043
I'm that way with myself too.

603
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,545
-I see.
-So…

604
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,838
I'm firm with my beliefs,

605
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,675
-so I don't pay attention to other things.
-They're not important.

606
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,928
"They're not important."
That's what I think about a lot of things.

607
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,723
-So misunderstandings like earlier happen.
-Right.

608
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,976
-But you can resolve those by talking.
-Right.

609
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,562
To be honest, I was unsure at first.

610
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,147
You say you were unsure…

611
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,732
You say that,

612
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,651
but the other girls say

613
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,905
I'm really lovey-dovey with you.

614
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,365
-Us?
-Yeah, with how I treat you.

615
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,283
Really?

616
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:21,913
So I thought, "Why is Ji-yeon
unsure about how I feel?"

617
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,165
Why was I unsure though?

618
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:25,875
I don't know either.

619
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,210
Isn't that your personality?

620
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,463
-Maybe I was being cautious.
-Yeah.

621
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:35,760
Maybe I didn't easily believe
if you were being sincere or not.

622
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,678
That's how I am.

623
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,348
-I see.
-When you say something,

624
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,975
I kind of think, "Is this real?"

625
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,269
"Is he just trying to make me feel good?"

626
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,813
-Right.
-It makes me think about things like that.

627
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,398
Yeah.

628
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,358
Yeah.

629
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,195
Anything else you want to ask me?

630
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,906
During those two days in Paradise,

631
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,450
-I think I asked everything.
-Right.

632
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,869
-I wonder what the others are doing.
-Yeah, should we go?

633
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,870
-Should we?
-Yeah.

634
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,374
Listening to that was so frustrating.

635
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,919
I just feel so stifled in here.

636
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,672
There's no back-and-forth
in their conversations.

637
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,758
-Right.
-I don't feel that when they talk.

638
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,927
The thing about Te-hwan is…
How can I put it?

639
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,805
I think he's really absorbed with himself.

640
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,474
-That's how I feel.
-I think he's…

641
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,684
-pretty absorbed with himself.
-He doesn't consider

642
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:29,314
changing his thoughts
through conversations with others.

643
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,691
It's like, "I am who I am,
and these beliefs are fixed."

644
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:36,488
"I don't care if you accept that or not,
because this is what I think."

645
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,073
-"This is how I've been."
-Yeah.

646
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,200
-"Because this is me."
-"Because this is who I am."

647
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,576
But if that's the case,

648
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,952
it won't be easy to date.

649
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:47,957
I think it's a bit of that negative side
of being an artist.

650
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,835
Simply put,
he's a bit snobby about his art.

651
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,463
To be honest, I'm a bit like that too.

652
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,547
-So…
-Why?

653
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,508
In my early twenties,

654
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,677
I was so into hip-hop.

655
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,137
-I was once completely absorbed in it.
-Yeah.

656
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,722
-I thought, "I'm the best."
-Right.

657
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,683
-"You're all nothing."
-I see.

658
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,267
-But…
-You see a lot of that

659
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,602
-in a rapper's lyrics.
-Yeah.

660
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,104
I was reminded of that time.

661
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,021
I see.

662
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,982
So to be honest,
this makes me kind of sad.

663
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,275
I have a question.

664
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,737
Did that mindset carry over
into your relationships

665
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,656
-or with your girlfriend?
-So…

666
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,574
It did,
because you live with that mindset.

667
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,534
-I see.
-I see.

668
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,286
-So you think you're this grand person.
-Right.

669
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,622
And saying things offhand
was part of being cool.

670
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,998
-I see.
-Boom.

671
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,335
But he really cares about his culture
and has these big dreams,

672
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,255
so I think he's a bit immersed
in that right now.

673
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,923
-And I think he can change.
-Right.

674
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:37,924
Just like me.

675
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,218
I wish Te-hwan would be

676
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,304
just a bit more considerate
to the other person.

677
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,061
Finally, a swim in the ocean.

678
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,354
This is going to be fun!

679
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,245
They're all dead.

680
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,371
They're all done for.

681
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,206
This is great!

682
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,333
-She's like a seal!
-This is great!

683
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,377
It's so cold!

684
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,131
Wow, is that Jun-seo?

685
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,091
He's practically a fish.

686
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,844
-Grab him!
-Give it!

687
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,471
No, wait!

688
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,652
Want to get on the tube?

689
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,904
That's cold!

690
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,699
-See you in Seoul!
-Bye!

691
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,284
It's so cold!

692
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:54,167
You're the best, Jong-hoon.
You're the only one taking care of me.

693
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,718
-Aren't you cold?
-I'm cold!

694
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,596
What's Jun-seo doing?

695
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,098
What is he, Tarzan?

696
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,394
How did he get up there?

697
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,021
"Tarzan"!

698
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,564
Goodness!

699
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,149
What's he doing though?

700
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,321
-Tarzan!
-Tarzan!

701
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,533
Jun-seo! Look at Jun-seo! Did you see him?

702
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,243
Amazing!

703
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,286
-He jumped like a diver.
-He dove off the cliff.

704
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,788
-Jun-seo's cliff diving.
-Really?

705
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,085
What on earth is he doing?

706
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,086
I don't know.

707
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,839
Give it to me.

708
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,675
Answer me first. Are we on the same team?

709
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,468
We're on the same team!

710
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,554
-Okay, that's on record.
-No, we're not!

711
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,973
-Excuse me?
-We're the same team. Sorry.

712
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,724
-What? Suddenly?
-I'm sorry.

713
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,977
Hey, be careful.

714
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,311
You're doing fine in the water.

715
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,063
-I am.
-Is this depth okay?

716
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:57,981
This is okay.

717
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,818
Si-an, where are you going?

718
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:03,778
Bye!

719
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,573
What did you do?

720
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,119
How far is she going?

721
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,620
She's going too deep.

722
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,289
-What? Right?
-Yeah.

723
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,964
Come back!

724
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,052
Hey! When did you get that far?

725
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,555
-He's going in.
-No way.

726
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,723
Are they going to swim off?

727
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,641
Hi!

728
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,352
I'm coming!

729
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,105
Jeez, You-jin.

730
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,692
-Gosh, You-jin.
-Come on, You-jin.

731
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,488
Are you really trying to float away?

732
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,537
I'm rescuing her.

733
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,333
-Hey, you…
-Don't take her away. She's my princess.

734
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,877
-You're out.
-You go over there.

735
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,545
-No!
-Let me join.

736
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,588
No!

737
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,551
No!

738
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,640
Are you rescuing her with me?

739
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,892
I don't feel good.

740
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,021
I can go on my own.

741
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,106
Why are they getting farther away?

742
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,316
They must be leaving now.

743
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,734
They are?

744
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,070
That was fun.

745
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,488
Yeah, it was.

746
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,954
Towels.

747
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,748
Any leftover towels?

748
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,472
-I'm freezing.
-I'm so cold.

749
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,224
-Wait.
-Hey, give me a towel.

750
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,436
I shouldn't have gone in.

751
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,313
-Why not?
-I think I caught a chill.

752
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,524
Really? What do we do?

753
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,026
If you're that cold,
you really must be feeling ill.

754
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,944
I guess so.

755
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,793
-Are you okay?
-I don't know.

756
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,545
-You don't know?
-I'll take some medicine.

757
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,589
We have to drink though, right?

758
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,800
Yeah, you can't drink if you take meds.

759
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,843
Yeah.

760
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,599
But did something happen earlier?

761
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,268
Something to upset Jeong-su?

762
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,771
Si-an suddenly mentioned Jun-seo
while hanging with Jeong-su.

763
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,273
She said, "Where did Jun-seo go?"

764
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,191
-Maybe he got upset then?
-Right.

765
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,693
So that happened.

766
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,654
She asked that when she was with Jeong-su?

767
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,114
-Yes, with Jeong-su.
-That's right.

768
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,115
That was it.

769
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,658
-That was it.
-That was when.

770
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,661
Right now, Jeong-su is a little…

771
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,164
-No, they're both being active.
-Yeah.

772
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,459
But when Jeong-su sees
Jun-seo and Si-an together,

773
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,169
he becomes kind of…

774
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,336
-Upset.
-Not happy.

775
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,215
-I think he's tiring.
-Jeong-su said he was conservative.

776
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,133
Yeah.

777
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,845
But Jun-seo doesn't get that upset
when Si-an is with Jeong-su.

778
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,472
But you can tell with Jeong-su.

779
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,723
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

780
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,274
I'm so hungry.

781
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,400
I am so hungry.

782
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,652
-Wow! Amazing!
-What?

783
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,945
Meat to grill?

784
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,656
-What? Meat?
-This is insane!

785
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,076
-What is it?
-This is insane.

786
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,245
-A-rin can sit here, and you sit there.
-Okay.

787
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,753
-Are you good at grilling?
-Yeah.

788
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,260
-It's good.
-It's so good.

789
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,721
Should we toast?

790
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,098
Okay.

791
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,182
What beer do you want?

792
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,433
-You want this?
-Yeah.

793
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,313
Good job during these nine days.

794
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:11,734
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

795
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,117
I can't believe this is the last night.

796
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,827
-That it's the last night?
-Yeah.

797
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,454
It's the last night.

798
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,249
Should we slowly get started then?

799
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,542
-How fun.
-I'm so curious.

800
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,459
We'll take turns.

801
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,002
I'm most curious about Dong-ho.

802
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:30,920
Dong-ho…

803
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:31,921
Dong-ho…

804
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,340
You'll be shocked.

805
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,758
I'm so curious.

806
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,009
-I bet he's young.
-A CEO?

807
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:37,927
Right?

808
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,388
I'm 30 years old.

809
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,472
What year were you born?

810
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,431
In 1993.

811
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,683
I see.

812
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,351
I'm a certified public accountant.

813
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,729
He's a CPA!

814
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,106
Mr. Accountant.

815
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,567
An accountant? That's cool.

816
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,110
An accountant.

817
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,112
-I knew it.
-An accountant this handsome?

818
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,822
I knew it'd be something professional.

819
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,115
Yeah.

820
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,075
I bet you're a professional, unnie.

821
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,326
Don't assume I'm older.

822
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,788
Don't make me angry.
I'm sensitive right now.

823
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,584
As if I'm obviously older than them,

824
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:13,629
everyone keeps using honorifics with me.

825
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,133
Do I look that much older
to make them so sure like that?

826
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:20,052
So earlier over there, unnie…
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

827
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,679
Are you trying to pick a fight?

828
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:25,641
-I keep doing that today.
-Are you trying to start a war with me?

829
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,143
So you're not older?

830
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,144
You-jin unnie…

831
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,189
I'm not older than you.

832
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,107
-I feel so comfortable around you.
-Yeah.

833
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,484
But it's just in case you're older.

834
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,612
For some reason…

835
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,779
You're a bit older, right?

836
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,448
Right?

837
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,326
-Look at her face!
-"Why do they think I'm older?"

838
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,578
They are younger though.

839
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,662
-How cute.
-Poor thing.

840
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,289
Are you the oldest?

841
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,749
Let me ask this.

842
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,126
How old do I really look?

843
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,836
-Why?
-No, just tell us, unnie.

844
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,921
Yeah, just tell us.

845
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,007
I'm 28.

846
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,384
-I see.
-I see.

847
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:04,305
As for my job,
I'm a dancer in a dance troupe.

848
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,725
-I dance and do choreography too.
-Really?

849
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,810
-Doesn't it suit her?
-It really does.

850
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,772
I'm a teacher and an artist.

851
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,274
-"Artist."
-Incredible.

852
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,776
-I never imagined that.
-Really?

853
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,238
But when I made gestures
or imitated something,

854
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,865
I thought,
"Did my hand look too graceful?"

855
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,325
-Things like that.
-Not at all.

856
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,910
"Did I reveal my secret?"

857
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,162
-I had those thoughts at times.
-Not at all.

858
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,165
You said, "Whoosh!"
to describe bungee jumping.

859
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,667
-"Whoosh!"
-You're right.

860
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,085
-"Whoosh!"
-That was a spoiler.

861
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,756
-Min-seol?
-Min-seol?

862
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,259
I was born…

863
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,594
in 2000, and I'm 23.

864
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,637
See? I told you.

865
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,972
You seem exactly like your age.

866
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,765
Wow, that's insane.

867
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:52,270
I am… 25 years old.

868
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,980
-Incredible.
-I was born in 1999.

869
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,481
-Wow, 1999.
-What?

870
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,858
See? I told you
you were a year older than me.

871
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,026
-Your age?
-Yeah.

872
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,944
I see.

873
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,863
I was born in 2000.

874
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,324
What? I knew you were my age!

875
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,994
I'm 25. I was born in 1998.

876
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,412
-We're the same age.
-I told you.

877
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,622
Gosh, I was so surprised.

878
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,167
Damn it, I am the oldest!

879
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,796
She is.

880
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,718
-She had her hopes up.
-Yeah.

881
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,553
-We told you.
-Our oldest girl.

882
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,680
It was obvious you were
from your presence.

883
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:31,517
I thought, "Well, I must seem mature,
so it's understandable."

884
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,440
Since I seem so smart and elegant,
they probably saw me that way.

885
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,984
But now that I know I'm the oldest,

886
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,195
it makes me feel slightly unhappy.

887
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,074
Why do we age?

888
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,790
That poor thing. It's okay. Come on.

889
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,752
Should we sort out
how to address each other now?

890
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,753
How?

891
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,671
Girls? I was right back then.

892
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,840
-They're all older than us.
-I have a question.

893
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,924
Hye-jin.

894
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:10,056
Was there a moment
when your heart completely skipped a beat?

895
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,557
And not just butterflies.

896
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,060
You're heart skipped.

897
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,479
When Jong-hoon…

898
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,487
After coming back from Paradise,

899
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,324
when he gave me
a response full of certainty,

900
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,159
it made my heart skip a beat.

901
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,160
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON

902
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,829
I've never wavered even once.

903
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:38,250
I just thought
it could make you a little worried,

904
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,502
so I didn't want you to be.

905
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,340
I was touched. Yeah.

906
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,136
Things are starting
to feel warm and fuzzy.

907
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,554
Warm and fuzzy.

908
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,182
Yeah, what about you, Jeong-su?

909
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,059
Has your heart ever skipped a beat?

910
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,812
Since coming here,
has your heart ever skipped a beat?

911
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:58,813
Yeah.

912
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,648
Then, tell us.

913
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,982
-What?
-Tell us.

914
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,401
-When it happened?
-Yeah.

915
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,743
On the first day,

916
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,913
when you were standing.

917
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,915
What?

918
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,126
When I was a winner
of the game on the first day,

919
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,254
you were standing there
when I was choosing.

920
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,341
On the first day…

921
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,112
Si-an, have you sorted out your feelings?

922
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,513
Yeah, I think I have.

923
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:26,734
Jun-seo, are you set
on your final decision tomorrow?

924
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,325
I can't listen to this.

925
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,368
Oh, dear.

926
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,288
I made up my mind yesterday.

927
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,664
I see.

928
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,665
I'm all set.

929
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,641
Jun-seo.

930
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,249
Still…

931
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,209
I think I might cry.

932
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,962
-What do you want to ask?
-I think I might cry.

933
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,421
I'm about to cry.

934
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,383
No, don't comfort me.

935
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,097
Still,

936
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,517
you had fun with me in Paradise, right?

937
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,062
She's asking him so directly!

938
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,313
Don't do that. Please.

939
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,398
Okay.

940
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,734
-It was fun, right?
-Don't cry.

941
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,320
Of course, I had so much fun.

942
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,863
You were the easiest to talk to.

943
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,117
We never had a dull moment.

944
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,873
-He kept telling us that too.
-Yeah.

945
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,542
I mean it. We'd talk forever.

946
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,168
You can do it.

947
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,170
-Gosh.
-Don't cry.

948
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,505
It's okay.

949
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,756
My goodness.

950
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,674
It's okay.

951
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,564
I think I was trying to say,

952
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,649
"Don't forget about me."

953
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,611
It was so much fun.

954
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:43,245
It felt like I had
an experience of a lifetime.

955
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:47,958
It was fun.

956
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:49,877
And…

957
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,421
I want to tell Jun-seo…

958
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,009
Whenever I mention Jun-seo, I keep crying!

959
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,095
Thank you.

960
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:16,654
My biggest question was,
"Could I fall in love within ten days?"

961
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,824
But I felt a variety of emotions
beyond that.

962
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,752
It was nice.

963
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,424
What should I say?

964
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,928
-"It was nice."
-It was just nice.

965
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,555
I don't want to go home.

966
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,349
I don't want to go either.

967
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,106
Ever since I was discharged
from the military,

968
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,733
I'd always felt like an outsider
wherever I went.

969
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,319
So I always felt like

970
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,947
I couldn't get along with others.

971
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,700
Whether it was at work
or anywhere else, I felt that way.

972
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:07,162
But here, it's like I've found a family,
so I was really happy.

973
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:09,748
I see.

974
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,834
I don't think I'll forget this.

975
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,302
During my time here,

976
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,472
of course, it's been tough
physically and mentally.

977
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,267
But I think…

978
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,645
it's been like an unforgettable getaway.

979
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,897
I'm grateful to everyone.

980
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:42,156
This truly has been
the most precious gift I've ever received.

981
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,243
I think it will be a nice memory
that I will cherish for a lifetime.

982
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,801
It's so nice.

983
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:39,296
The hottest Inferno in the world.
Single's Inferno.

984
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,714
This is the final day.

985
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,675
YUK JUN-SEO

986
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:47,930
From this moment,
you will now make your final decision.

987
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,225
JANG THEO

988
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,894
AN JONG-HOON

989
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:57,105
KIM JEONG-SU

990
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:03,278
The women have already moved
to the final decision location

991
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,489
and are waiting for the men.

992
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,575
PARK HAE-LIN

993
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,203
KIM A-RIN

994
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,917
KIM HYE-JIN

995
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,170
KIM MIN-SEOL

996
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,633
LEE SI-AN

997
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,260
Gentlemen,

998
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,848
please proceed to the location
of the person you've chosen.

999
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:40,524
If the man who arrives
is the person the woman has chosen,

1000
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,693
they will become a final couple.

1001
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:50,117
If the man who arrives
is not the person the woman has chosen,

1002
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,452
they will remain on Inferno.

1003
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,581
Okay, all that's left now is
the final decision.

1004
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,417
-Let's predict who everyone will choose.
-Okay.

1005
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,334
-Okay.
-All right.

1006
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,253
I don't know who You-jin will pick.

1007
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:02,838
No idea.

1008
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,174
I think Theo will stay true
to his feelings.

1009
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,551
-Right.
-Then Theo,

1010
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,595
Jun-seo, and Jeong-su will pick Si-an?

1011
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:10,721
Yes.

1012
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,805
Si-an's the issue.

1013
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,432
This season, Si-an was…

1014
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,058
-Yes.
-It's all about her choice.

1015
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,310
It's not Theo.

1016
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,605
I think Si-an will pick Jeong-su.

1017
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,772
You're still on that?

1018
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:22,733
A personal wish.

1019
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,817
It's not that.

1020
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,570
-In the end, I think…
-She won't break.

1021
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:32,242
Si-an will pick Jeong-su
despite being drawn by Jun-seo.

1022
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,244
He's someone safe and comfortable.

1023
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,081
I think she'll pick Jun-seo in the end.

1024
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,082
-I see.
-Yuk?

1025
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,083
Yuk.

1026
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,169
In the end, I think she'll pick Yuk too.

1027
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,962
-Wow, Yuk?
-Me too.

1028
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,380
-Really?
-Yuk.

1029
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,341
I want to take your side.

1030
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,468
-No, you don't have to.
-Yeah, I won't.

1031
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,389
I won't. I pick Yuk Jun-seo.

1032
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,892
But last time, we were all wrong.

1033
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,144
But for the final decision,

1034
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,605
they always tend to pick
someone who's safe.

1035
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:06,068
When it comes to Si-an,
she's very sincere about this show.

1036
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,277
-Yeah.
-Because of that,

1037
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,780
I think she'll pick the safe option

1038
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,950
who she can have
a long-term relationship with.

1039
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,629
Jang Theo, please make your way down.

1040
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,130
Me?

1041
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,057
-Theo was so cool.
-Yeah.

1042
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,600
-Seriously.
-He was.

1043
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,602
I think he actually feels relieved.

1044
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,024
Good luck.

1045
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,237
You look so glamorous today, You-jin.

1046
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:51,947
Good luck.

1047
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,078
I've regained
those pure emotions from my youth,

1048
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,039
along with the courage
to express everything I felt.

1049
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,375
Those feelings are still within me,

1050
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,628
and I believe it's right to follow
where my heart races.

1051
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,673
Why are you so far away?

1052
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,758
Hey, be careful.

1053
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,601
What is it?

1054
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,519
What?

1055
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,653
Kim Te-hwan, please make your way down.

1056
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,161
From the moment I first saw her,
I was sure.

1057
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,539
As we spent time together,
I found myself opening up more.

1058
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,916
And it was charming
how she became more adorable,

1059
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,376
so it made me like her more.

1060
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,923
-Hi.
-Hi.

1061
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,427
Your outfit's pretty.

1062
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,772
An Jong-hoon, please make your way down.

1063
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:17,449
We shared so many memories on Inferno,

1064
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:22,162
and I feel like our feelings
for each other were truly genuine.

1065
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,500
Jong-hoon will probably
pick Hye-jin, right?

1066
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,086
-I think he will.
-Yeah, it's Hye-jin.

1067
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,557
What?

1068
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,184
What?

1069
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,436
What?

1070
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,897
Wait. Did he pass by her?

1071
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:02,702
-He's going back.
-Gosh, that startled me. Jeez.

1072
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,454
You need to make jokes as a tour guide.

1073
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,539
-I see.
-Yes.

1074
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,332
You need a little bit of wit.

1075
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,003
What was that?

1076
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,927
Jeez, you scared me.

1077
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,224
It's hot, isn't it?

1078
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,809
-It's so hot.
-Yeah.

1079
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:33,024
Kook Dong-ho, please make your way down.

1080
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,547
I spent the most time with her
at both Inferno and Paradise,

1081
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,258
and I was attracted to
how we were compatible in many ways.

1082
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,178
I hope we can maintain
our good relationship going forward.

1083
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:14,566
Bye.

1084
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,871
There's no hesitation from Dong-ho.

1085
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,206
He's in a hurry.

1086
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,123
Yeah.

1087
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:49,809
Isn't it hot?

1088
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,019
-What?
-Are you hot?

1089
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:51,937
Yeah.

1090
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,481
Now that you're here, I have some shade.

1091
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,194
It's nice.

1092
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,912
Yuk Jun-seo, please make your way down.

1093
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,313
She's the first person

1094
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,650
who made me dedicate myself
to this experience.

1095
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,985
"The first person"?

1096
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,112
-What?
-Then, is it Min-seol?

1097
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,827
She makes me want to protect her.

1098
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:18,857
Really?

1099
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,525
-Really?
-No way.

1100
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,236
Isn't it hot?

1101
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,321
-What?
-Isn't it hot?

1102
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,488
It's hot.

1103
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,741
It's hot.

1104
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,039
-He got so close to her.
-Seriously.

1105
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,291
-Just to pass by?
-For crying out loud.

1106
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,208
-Damn it, Yuk!
-Yeah.

1107
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,044
-Come on.
-I bet Min-seol was so nervous.

1108
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,545
Right?

1109
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,751
Kim Jeong-su, please make your way down.

1110
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,355
Good luck.

1111
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,606
-What?
-Good luck.

1112
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,526
Thank you.

1113
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,367
Good luck.

1114
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:00,959
You wore your favorite dress.

1115
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,253
He keeps making stops.

1116
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:14,556
It was always Si-an from the start,
and for ten days, it was always her.

1117
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:19,436
I used to be someone
who never believed in love at first sight,

1118
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,980
but looking back,
I realized I fell for her at first sight.

1119
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:22,897
Yeah.

1120
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,991
That's a cool shirt.

1121
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,576
You let down your bangs today.

1122
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,744
I did.

1123
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,978
They all look beautiful.

1124
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,897
They're all so charming in their own way.

1125
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,148
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1126
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:16,576
It's really the end.

1127
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,619
Yeah.

1128
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:18,620
It feels…

1129
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,373
I was so happy to have met you on Inferno.

1130
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,793
And I really enjoyed
the time we spent together.

1131
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,754
Let's leave and get some coffee.

1132
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,301
-She doesn't look happy.
-She doesn't want to.

1133
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,720
She looks a bit restless.

1134
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:46,397
Thanks to you, our hard time
on Inferno was more enjoyable,

1135
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,108
and I relied on you a lot.

1136
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:53,655
During the time we spent together,
you expressed your feelings so well.

1137
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,616
You kept telling me I was pretty and cute.

1138
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,118
You made me really happy,
and I was grateful.

1139
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,092
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1140
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,770
Gosh, I don't know. It's just…

1141
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,439
It's just a little…

1142
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,984
It feels like
I'll go through some hard times.

1143
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,527
It's…

1144
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,177
Will she pick him?

1145
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,013
She doesn't look so happy.

1146
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,230
Kim Te-hwan.

1147
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,150
Kim Te-hwan.

1148
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,112
-She did pick him.
-Yeah.

1149
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,241
After many conversations with Te-hwan,

1150
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,620
I thought not everything
was a perfect match between us.

1151
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,997
I was uncertain about a few things.

1152
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,915
Still, I believe what he says.

1153
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,960
He was entirely focused on me
and no one else.

1154
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,796
He was straightforward
and invested all of his time with me.

1155
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,632
I think that's why I was drawn to him.

1156
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:42,180
Why did you make that face
before you started talking?

1157
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,474
-You smirked a little.
-I did?

1158
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,684
It was like, "I don't like him, but…"

1159
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:47,935
-Really?
-Yeah.

1160
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,812
-That was spot on.
-He read it.

1161
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,648
-So he wasn't clueless.
-He was spot on.

1162
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:52,732
Seriously.

1163
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,942
-He wasn't clueless.
-Yeah.

1164
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,528
"I'll pick you. I'm grateful."

1165
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,863
-Like this?
-"I don't like him."

1166
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,323
"But I can't leave him here."

1167
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,991
"I'll pick you." It was like that.

1168
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,872
Did you think I'd pick you?

1169
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,832
-No.
-What? Really?

1170
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,084
No, I knew you would.

1171
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,001
What?

1172
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,212
How were you so sure?

1173
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:18,049
Because I'm always sure of myself.

1174
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,009
Gosh, that sounds so arrogant.

1175
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,219
-Did I sound arrogant?
-Yeah.

1176
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,096
I want to pick again.

1177
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:24,847
It's too late.

1178
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:49,789
A-rin,

1179
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,834
let's see each other often on the outside.

1180
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,170
Okay.

1181
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:00,007
After we leave here,
let's have fun together.

1182
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,890
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1183
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,483
Kook Dong-ho.

1184
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,485
Kook Dong-ho.

1185
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:23,489
No surprise here.

1186
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,491
-Dong-ho was so popular.
-Right.

1187
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,451
A-rin won his heart.

1188
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,368
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1189
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,579
This is what I think.

1190
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,164
It could be fate.

1191
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,083
We'll see after this.

1192
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,085
Beep, boop.

1193
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,465
She believes in fate.

1194
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,716
-Yeah.
-They both do.

1195
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,009
-The same work area.
-Yeah.

1196
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,594
-They live near each other too.
-Yeah.

1197
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,429
I bet it would be perfect for dating.

1198
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:49,015
-I hope they last.
-It would be awesome if they got married.

1199
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,224
Yeah.

1200
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,603
Let's go.

1201
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,520
Okay.

1202
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,858
-It's hot.
-Yeah.

1203
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,619
Goodbye.

1204
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,413
I'll stay here.

1205
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,961
For me, it's always been you
from the start.

1206
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,214
I was a big fan.

1207
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,846
It's embarrassing now.
Should we let go for a moment?

1208
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,306
It's stuck.

1209
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,891
-It is?
-Yeah.

1210
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:45,488
We've been on Inferno together
for far too long.

1211
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,282
Let's leave together.

1212
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,830
Thanks for showing up in the middle.

1213
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,716
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1214
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,513
An Jong-hoon.

1215
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,266
An Jong-hoon.

1216
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,187
Let's go.

1217
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,360
-Watch your feet.
-Okay.

1218
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,158
Bye.

1219
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,538
Bye, Inferno.

1220
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:08,321
Si-an.

1221
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:12,617
I wanted to show you
all of my true feelings,

1222
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,328
and I wanted to see yours as well.

1223
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,747
And both happened.

1224
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,665
I have no regrets. I'm grateful.

1225
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,543
Every moment I spent with you
made me really happy.

1226
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:23,628
My voice is gone.

1227
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:25,796
I wish you more happiness.

1228
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,183
Si-an.

1229
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,604
Since coming here,

1230
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:45,274
from the beginning to the end
of this journey,

1231
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,986
nothing went as I had expected.

1232
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:52,073
Along the way,
I discovered a new side of myself,

1233
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:56,202
and I think I was able to find it
because I met you.

1234
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,748
I feel like I've rediscovered
really pure and wonderful memories,

1235
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,249
so that makes me really happy.

1236
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,543
And I'm sad this is the end.

1237
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,800
I'm glad I could make
so many good memories. Thanks.

1238
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,101
From the moment…

1239
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,022
you first smiled at me

1240
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:26,524
until now,

1241
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:28,693
I've liked you.

1242
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:34,865
I hope whatever choice you make

1243
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,035
is a good one.

1244
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,252
Gosh, that's a subtle expression.

1245
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,344
Theo…

1246
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:00,683
When I was with you, I laughed the most.

1247
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,146
I could feel how sincere you were.

1248
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:08,149
My feelings were really sincere as well.

1249
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:10,943
Let's be happy.

1250
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,320
I am happy.

1251
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:21,620
Jun-seo, when I'm with you,

1252
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,124
you made me feel all sorts of emotions.

1253
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,460
Things like sadness,

1254
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:30,880
happiness, and excitement.

1255
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,435
Thank you for taking me
to Paradise the first time.

1256
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:52,026
I was glad to spend
my last day in Paradise with you as well.

1257
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,741
Your hair looks good with it down.

1258
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,173
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1259
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,157
Yuk Jun-seo.

1260
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,410
Yuk Jun-seo.

1261
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:32,668
I got a tingling sensation.

1262
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:34,461
-In the end…
-So this is how it turns out.

1263
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:37,298
She picked the person
who makes her heart race.

1264
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,426
Yuk Jun-seo.

1265
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,939
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1266
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,024
It must've been tough.

1267
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:58,861
Thanks.

1268
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,626
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye. Good job, you two.

1269
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:19,298
The sight of these two from behind…

1270
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,591
Incredible.

1271
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:22,343
And Min-seol…

1272
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,514
Jun-seo, did you prepare a celebration?

1273
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,641
-A celebration?
-Yeah.

1274
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,101
-A celebration…
-You need to carry me and run.

1275
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:33,562
Really?

1276
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:36,565
Hey!

1277
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,567
Are you crazy?

1278
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,989
Is that his version of the bridal carry?
What on earth?

1279
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,036
Wait!

1280
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,330
What are you doing?

1281
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,499
My shoe!

1282
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,584
Where did it go?

1283
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,044
Wait…

1284
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,313
Yeah, this is the relationship she wanted.

1285
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:18,649
It's over.

1286
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:23,237
I bet time flew especially for you.

1287
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,238
-Me?
-Yeah.

1288
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,449
-It's so…
-My time with you went by the quickest.

1289
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:28,367
Really?

1290
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:31,078
Honestly, we didn't start out
interested in each other.

1291
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:32,162
Yeah.

1292
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:35,541
Then, things started out of nowhere
during the second day.

1293
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:36,500
Right.

1294
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,335
And we spent two straight nights together.

1295
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:43,882
I wonder how this happened.

1296
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:46,385
How interesting.

1297
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,263
How did this happen?

1298
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,309
To be honest,

1299
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:56,603
my time with Jun-seo
felt like a whirlwind.

1300
01:11:56,687 --> 01:12:00,107
When I'm with Jun-seo,

1301
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:03,902
instead of comfort,
I feel excited, uneasy, and awkward.

1302
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:08,949
I kept feeling concerned, jealous,
and other emotions like that.

1303
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:12,369
That made me certain
he was the one for me.

1304
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,207
The person I'd like to go
on a dessert date with is…

1305
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,876
Yuk Jun-seo.

1306
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,964
I think you don't know
how to interact with women.

1307
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,135
-Really? Is there a specific way?
-Yes.

1308
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,141
I've kept saying
that I wanted to talk to you.

1309
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:35,601
-Really? Why?
-Yeah.

1310
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,895
I've been saying,
"I want to talk to Si-an."

1311
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:40,064
My feelings have grown,
and it's really confusing.

1312
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,233
You and I will come here one more time.

1313
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:45,235
Tomorrow, I'm definitely going to win.

1314
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,085
Get some more sleep, Jun-seo.

1315
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:03,212
I'm so sleepy.

1316
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:04,296
What?

1317
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,631
I'm so sleepy.

1318
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:06,965
Let's sleep a bit more.

1319
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,884
-What time is it?
-Let's sleep a bit more.

1320
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,558
For me,

1321
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,437
-my last date in Paradise…
-Yeah?

1322
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,231
was something I needed.

1323
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,565
-Right.
-Yeah.

1324
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,110
That romantic attraction I have…

1325
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:27,027
Yeah?

1326
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,655
-I feel that more with you.
-Right.

1327
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:39,790
I want to go out with Jun-seo
and have our relationship out in the open.

1328
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:42,543
Will it happen?

1329
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,086
Yes.

1330
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,427
My final choice is…

1331
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,762
Yuk Jun-seo.

1332
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,765
From start to finish here,

1333
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,684
he's the person I laughed the most with.

1334
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:00,936
Also,

1335
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,148
until the very end,

1336
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:08,235
he was the person who kept me on my toes.

1337
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:16,827
My final choice is Kook Dong-ho.

1338
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:20,581
Be honest.
You wavered for a moment, right?

1339
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:21,707
Admit it.

1340
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:29,465
I never got a chance
to go to Paradise with Dong-ho,

1341
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:32,759
so I had already given up on him.

1342
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,180
My final choice is Kim Jeong-su.

1343
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:40,309
He's the person
I had the deepest conversations with.

1344
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:44,646
We respected and thought of each other
as amazing people,

1345
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:47,983
and we would often tell each other that.

1346
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,573
All right.

1347
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:00,370
Like a midsummer storm, we had a whirlwind
of emotions on Singles' Inferno.

1348
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,247
Four couples were formed this season.

1349
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,415
-We congratulate them.
-Yes.

1350
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,833
Congratulations.

1351
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,961
Well, out of all the seasons
we've seen so far,

1352
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,964
this season seemed to truly be
the most emotionally intense.

1353
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,299
-Right.
-Us too.

1354
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:13,842
-We were swayed a lot.
-And immersed.

1355
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,094
We were able to empathize and connect.

1356
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:22,100
The participants really tried to stay true
to their own emotions in this season.

1357
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,560
Our reactions too.

1358
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:26,647
-They might've been excessive.
-They were intense.

1359
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:28,440
-We were so immersed.
-They were intense.

1360
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,526
-But we were genuine too.
-Seriously.

1361
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:33,737
-We all made this season with sincerity.
-We watched and felt it all.

1362
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,280
We hope you can understand.

1363
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,782
That thought comes to mind now.

1364
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,992
We're very sorry.

1365
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:41,411
-That's how sincere we were.
-Right.

1366
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:42,579
-We all were.
-Yeah.

1367
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,698
