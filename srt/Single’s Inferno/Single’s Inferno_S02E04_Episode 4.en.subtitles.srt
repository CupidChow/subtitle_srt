SINGLE'S INFERNO

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,464
Jin-young, you are the final winner.

13
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,258
Please choose two women you would like

14
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,470
-to enjoy the special meal with.
-He's going by first impressions.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,431
I'd like to have a meal
with the second woman

16
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,600
and the fourth woman.

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,185
The second to last.

18
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,229
-The second and the fourth.
-Kim Jin-young has chosen Choi Seo-eun

19
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,357
and Shin Seul-ki as his dates.

20
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,776
Both have been to Paradise.

21
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,872
Choi Seo-eun and Shin Seul-ki
will enjoy the meal with Kim Jin-young.

22
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,916
-Great job, everyone.
-Sounds delicious.

23
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,259
-The two who went to Paradise?
-Right.

24
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,220
HANHAE, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

25
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,930
So it's the three of them again.

26
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,516
What a twist of fate.

27
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,727
Anyway, Jong-woo and Han-bin…

28
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,853
Jin-kyung, don't say it.

29
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,564
They must do something.

30
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,026
But the new guy won the special meal.

31
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,110
-Yes.
-He just came…

32
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,905
-They lost their chance again.
-And he's already having a meal.

33
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:58,952
Also, the women who've been to Paradise
have both been chosen again.

34
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,912
-Right.
-So it's like…

35
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,163
I think

36
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,834
-Seul-ki and Jin-young could hit it off…
-Right?

37
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,837
-Because when Dong-woo was too forward…
-Right.

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,630
-…she felt uncomfortable.
-She did.

39
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:14,008
But Jin-young comes off
as someone who seems indifferent.

40
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,552
-Right.
-That's what I think.

41
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,972
I think Seul-ki would feel
more comfortable approaching him.

42
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,890
-They seem like a great match.
-Yes.

43
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,228
We didn't see that coming at all.

44
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,896
We didn't know he'd come.

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,190
But you two are very different.

46
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,609
-Your styles are different.
-Right.

47
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,237
-You're right.
-I bet it's because you're pretty.

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,238
-No.
-No.

49
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,489
I don't think…

50
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,324
But…

51
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,037
What?

52
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,540
But it's like…

53
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:52,338
-You don't know what to do with yourself.
-No, but really, wasn't he kind of cool?

54
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:53,923
Go tell him.

55
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,842
Don't tell us.

56
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,594
I agree.

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,389
-You're really…
-She's fallen for him.

58
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,141
No, it's not that.

59
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,851
He was just really cool.

60
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,312
-He was.
-When he was done, he turned around…

61
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,938
-Yes.
-…and went like this.

62
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,735
-Right? His face was so calm.
-Yes.

63
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,114
-Her heart fluttered.
-Yes.

64
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,116
It seems like she fell for him.

65
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,493
-She's actually expressive.
-Right.

66
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,872
-What were your first impressions of him?
-Let's talk about it.

67
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,291
-He doesn't seem like the type…
-He seems--

68
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,293
…to have a nine-to-five job.

69
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,254
I think he would have more freedom.

70
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,631
For me, it was his hair.

71
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,049
It looked interesting.

72
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,551
-For a man to have that kind of long hair.
-Yes. True.

73
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,261
-He's good-looking.
-Yes.

74
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,180
He seems quite serious.

75
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,266
-But…
-When he was walking, he wasn't fidgeting.

76
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,851
-But…
-He looked at the ocean.

77
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,271
-He could have acted all shy like this.
-Right.

78
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,565
-But he looked at the ocean.
-Right.

79
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,734
-I know, right?
-He was cool.

80
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,152
He seemed confident.

81
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,779
-He did.
-So he seemed cool.

82
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,865
This is the first time
I've heard Seul-ki call someone "cool."

83
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,492
-Right.
-Seriously.

84
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,160
Yes, this is the first time.

85
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,956
-What?
-What's that?

86
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,249
No.

87
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,209
Isn't her reaction different?

88
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,503
-Her reaction is…
-She's acting different.

89
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,129
…different than before.

90
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,259
-You're doing this because you're shy.
-Really?

91
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,885
-You're smiling.
-In an adorable way.

92
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,929
-Really?
-You keep smiling.

93
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:23,888
Gosh.

94
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,349
I'm so curious.

95
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,602
What kind of person has
that immense power--

96
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,897
Look into it for us.
Maybe he lived overseas.

97
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,440
"Have you lived abroad?"

98
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,734
Tell us everything.

99
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,112
-Tell us how he is.
-Tell us.

100
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,949
-I really want to know why he picked you.
-I'm curious why he picked you.

101
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,993
I will ask him in detail.

102
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,911
It feels like
everything's going to change.

103
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,788
All of it.

104
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,582
They're going crazy.

105
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,042
He caught their attention.

106
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,712
The impact's greater than
anything in the last three days.

107
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,714
He took over everything in 30 minutes.

108
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,596
I don't know why, but I'm excited.

109
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,224
Maybe it's the cold buckwheat noodles.

110
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,727
I think I'm excited about that.

111
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,854
-Where are you off to?
-To eat the special meal.

112
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,231
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

113
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,983
-See you later.
-See you. Bye.

114
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,820
Why are all the men outside?

115
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,533
-They look excited.
-Yes.

116
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,745
-I'm hungry.
-Me too.

117
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,915
Let's make guesses on our way there.
What kind of person do you think he is?

118
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:37,587
I think he'll be exactly like how I think.
Very reserved.

119
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,921
Reserved and what else?

120
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,341
I also think he could be

121
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,803
quite fun to talk to.

122
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,513
Or maybe not.

123
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,852
You think he'll be fun to talk to?
What makes you think that?

124
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,731
I think he might also be different
from how he seems.

125
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,816
-You think there could be a twist?
-Yes.

126
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,044
-Hello.
-Hello.

127
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,504
-Hello.
-Hello.

128
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,173
Have you been waiting long?

129
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,216
No.

130
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,383
I just got here too.

131
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,384
Isn't it hot?

132
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,844
Yes.

133
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,014
-Did you hear them?
-What?

134
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,642
Most say, "Yes, but I'm okay."

135
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,811
-He's not ordinary.
-He's not ordinary.

136
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,854
I've never seen anyone like him before.

137
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,858
Thank you.

138
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:41,818
Don't mention it.

139
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,278
-Thanks for choosing us.
-We don't…

140
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,990
You may not know this,
but it's not every day

141
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,867
-we get to eat like this.
-Really?

142
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,911
So this is very nice.

143
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,457
-You must be hungry.
-Yes, let's eat.

144
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,709
-Thanks for the food.
-All right, let's eat.

145
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,670
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

146
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,228
-Thank you for treating us to pork cutlet.
-It's my pleasure.

147
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,611
Do you usually pour the sauce?

148
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,739
No, I'll only cover half of it.
So you can eat it the way you prefer.

149
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,491
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

150
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,742
Jeez.

151
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,369
-Considerate.
-He didn't pour it all.

152
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,872
-He has manners.
-Yes, that's right.

153
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,918
Help yourselves.

154
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,466
"Help yourselves."

155
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,886
-He's unique.
-He's funny.

156
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,055
Help yourselves.

157
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,728
You don't seem to show your emotions.

158
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,605
You're charismatic.

159
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,315
-I'm just nervous.
-Really?

160
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,526
-You're charismatic.
-What's your personality like?

161
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,903
-Me?
-Yes.

162
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,448
-I'm a bit shy around people I don't know.
-Really?

163
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,410
I know I asked you to eat with me,

164
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,329
but I'm shy.

165
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,167
Why did you choose us

166
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,586
-when you didn't even know our names?
-Yes.

167
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,881
-Why did you choose us?
-I had a good feeling about both of you.

168
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,176
You seemed very cheerful.

169
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,223
And you're pretty.

170
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,393
-So I was…
-You're honest.

171
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,562
-Just cheerful?
-Cheerful and pretty.

172
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,277
-Thank you.
-I really like how cheerful you are.

173
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,869
What's your type?

174
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,039
I like someone

175
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,959
who I feel a spark with
when I first see them.

176
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,171
-Isn't that kind of hard?
-Right?

177
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,507
How I feel about her is
the most important thing.

178
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,594
And it would be nice
to have things in common.

179
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,681
What about looks?

180
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,141
Well, I like someone who's pretty.

181
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,021
-You're honest.
-Yes.

182
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,399
He's honest.

183
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,402
He's interesting.

184
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,238
Doesn't he seem like

185
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,991
the prince of that island or something?

186
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,535
-Yes.
-"You're here."

187
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,495
-"Have a seat."
-"Help yourselves."

188
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,496
"Help yourselves."

189
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,833
What about you ladies?

190
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,670
I like someone who has good manners…

191
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,463
-Yes.
-…and speaks politely.

192
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,548
I see.

193
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,717
I like someone who is joyful

194
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:58,055
and someone who can be my role model.

195
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,518
-Someone you can look up to?
-Yes. I like someone who I can look up to.

196
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,650
These are sweet potatoes
and chicken breast.

197
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,819
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

198
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,030
-Thanks for the food.
-What a feast.

199
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,282
-Right.
-It's full of protein.

200
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,037
The one with the mayonnaise?

201
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,791
This sweet potato is really good.

202
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,335
-Right?
-It's good, right?

203
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,378
How was Paradise?

204
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,799
Well. It was pleasant.

205
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,384
The bathroom was nice, right?

206
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,845
-The shower was really great.
-I'm curious.

207
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,138
I heard it was nice.

208
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,348
I have a question.

209
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:44,268
Have your feelings changed
after going there?

210
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,312
-Did my feelings change?
-Yes.

211
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,313
Yes, did they?

212
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,900
Well, you have to talk to them in person
to know them.

213
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,236
-So it changes everything.
-Right.

214
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,613
-The thing is…
-Everything?

215
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,449
…you get to know the person better.

216
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,161
He knows the most
about Seul-ki out of all of us.

217
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,086
What about you, Yoong-jae?

218
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,422
-Me?
-Have your feelings changed too?

219
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,383
I would say so.

220
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,595
This is hard.

221
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,518
But it's not like this is the end
because we went to Paradise.

222
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,477
-Right.
-True.

223
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,605
-We can get to know more people.
-It hasn't really started.

224
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,273
-It did start.
-It starts now.

225
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,858
-It did start.
-It begins now.

226
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,069
Right, we need to start. The five of us.

227
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,241
I'm curious to see how things play out

228
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,784
-with the new guy here.
-Me too.

229
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,993
Right.

230
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,704
How is the new guy?

231
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,040
We haven't talked much.

232
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,250
Is he rather quiet?

233
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,292
He seems very calm.

234
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,086
-Yes. He seems really calm.
-I see.

235
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,713
-We were right.
-Exactly.

236
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,673
Yes.

237
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,009
What do you have for dinner?

238
00:11:59,093 --> 00:11:59,969
Well…

239
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,679
Yesterday, we had radishes.

240
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,055
-Radishes?
-Yes.

241
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,265
And pumpkins.

242
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,392
But they were raw pumpkins.

243
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,812
So that's the kind of food they give you?

244
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,022
Yes, and you have to cook them.

245
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,233
Let me tell you something funny.

246
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,902
-We have to fetch water…
-Yes.

247
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,654
-Water?
-…from over there.

248
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,781
-We do.
-Isn't it fun?

249
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,909
-We get seaweed from the ocean too.
-We also catch anchovies.

250
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,370
Sometimes, you can catch big fish too.

251
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,957
You're messing with me.

252
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,298
-He's adorable when he smiles.
-Right?

253
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,424
He's full of surprises.

254
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,260
If someone who always smiles
suddenly frowns, people complain.

255
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,345
But it's cute
when it's the other way around.

256
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,430
-Right.
-Right.

257
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,767
We do have a bathroom.

258
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,269
Do we have to dig a hole?

259
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,108
-I didn't see that coming.
-Me neither.

260
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,570
-Of course not.
-No, of course not.

261
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,156
But when you go to Paradise,

262
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,699
you get to have

263
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,327
-a luxurious experience.
-Right.

264
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,329
-Have you been there?
-Us?

265
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,413
Take a guess.

266
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,043
I feel like at least
one of you went there.

267
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,295
That's for later.

268
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,130
-Yes.
-You'll find out later.

269
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,220
-This is fun.
-It is.

270
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,681
I like someone…

271
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,807
SHIN SEUL-KI

272
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,602
…who seems kind and friendly,

273
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,606
but Jin-young is
the complete opposite of that.

274
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:40,861
So I felt a different kind
of vibe from him.

275
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,073
But I thought it would be nice
to get to know him.

276
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,033
CHOI SEO-EUN

277
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,619
When I first saw Jin-young,
he seemed intense

278
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,663
and charismatic.

279
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,623
But I had a feeling that he'd be funny

280
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,626
once I got to know him better.

281
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,796
So I want to keep an eye on him.

282
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,715
You're back!

283
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,010
-Did you have fun?
-How was the food?

284
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,637
-Yes.
-I couldn't eat much.

285
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,433
There are sweet potatoes
and chicken breast.

286
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,393
There's rice too.

287
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,228
We cook here.

288
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,399
-Please introduce yourself.
-We want to get to know you.

289
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,442
-Since you're new.
-A self-introduction.

290
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,075
Just as I introduced myself earlier,

291
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,536
my name is Kim Jin-young.

292
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,079
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

293
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,123
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

294
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,376
-Do you have--
-Any questions?

295
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,544
-Well…
-For now--

296
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,421
-About this place.
-About this place.

297
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,672
About this place?

298
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,802
Who went to Paradise yesterday?

299
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,970
These two.

300
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,889
The ladies you talked to.

301
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,640
And these two men.

302
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,142
These two and these two.

303
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,354
He's confused.

304
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,274
He's confused already.

305
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,069
-He has a lot on his mind.
-Inferno's okay too.

306
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,321
It's okay?

307
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,240
Right?

308
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,326
Why are you making that face?

309
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,206
Gosh, this…

310
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,042
Such tension.

311
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,132
He shouldn't walk by himself.

312
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,387
Everyone's really tall.

313
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,390
I'm not usually one to be intimidated.

314
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,184
-You're all tall.
-Right.

315
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,271
-Really?
-How was it when you walked in?

316
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,689
-When I walked in?
-Yes.

317
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,985
Everyone seemed really cool.

318
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,571
-I was nervous.
-You could see everyone?

319
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,449
Yes, but the way everyone was dressed
was so impressive.

320
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,702
I made an effort to look pretty today.

321
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,499
So I was a bit intimidated.

322
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,833
Don't feel that way.

323
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,877
-You were so cool today.
-The clothes…

324
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,254
The women were all saying you were cool.

325
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,590
LEE NADINE

326
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,717
We talked really briefly,

327
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,178
and he made good eye contact.

328
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,723
He's way more adorable than I thought.

329
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,350
I don't know.

330
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,726
I think he's adorable.

331
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,690
He seems to have an adorable charm.

332
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,108
-Yes.
-Right.

333
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,235
-If someone's adorable to you, it's over.
-Right.

334
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,946
I mean, don't the women all look
very interested?

335
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,532
They're all focused on him.
Nadine once said

336
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,952
she usually doesn't express herself
or approach someone first.

337
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,830
But did you see that last part?

338
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,708
She was very proactive with him.

339
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,918
Dong-woo keeps giving her these glances.

340
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,213
He keeps looking at Nadine
talking to Jin-young.

341
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,258
He instantly shook things up.

342
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,052
Right, he's a force to be reckoned with.

343
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,512
They're in trouble now.

344
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,893
Hello.

345
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,603
-Hello.
-Yes.

346
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,771
Come out for a second.

347
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,403
I think Han-bin and Seo-eun left just now.

348
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,406
Seo-eun is amazing.

349
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,742
I'm not sure

350
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,453
who I should go for.

351
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,955
I want to talk to the new guy.

352
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,458
At least once.

353
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,334
I'm curious.

354
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,505
I'm going to go.

355
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,466
Go where?

356
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,760
-I don't know.
-Okay.

357
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,428
She's rushing.

358
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,763
She's in such a rush.

359
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,014
She can't talk.

360
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,060
I wanted to have a conversation with you.

361
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,187
But you've been so busy.

362
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,438
-Me?
-Yes.

363
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,564
You're too popular.

364
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,899
No, I haven't been busy.

365
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,693
You haven't? Then I just lacked courage.

366
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,446
So I wanted to talk to you.

367
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,948
Sounds good.

368
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,284
Sit here so you can see the ocean.

369
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,243
Thank you.

370
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,747
How do you feel?

371
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,748
About what?

372
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,874
Just in general.

373
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,001
-In general?
-Well, like…

374
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,588
Putting aside this situation now,
how are you feeling?

375
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,131
How am I feeling?

376
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,221
I'm a bit more relaxed.

377
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:24,895
You always try so hard to help everyone
get along with each other.

378
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,314
I can see you keep making an effort.

379
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,607
-Really?
-So…

380
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm glad I worked hard.

381
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,152
-What?
-I'm glad I worked hard.

382
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,113
-You really did.
-I'm glad.

383
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,364
It's really great.

384
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,366
You see…

385
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,871
Almost since the beginning…
No, right from the very beginning,

386
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,831
I've been…

387
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,959
feeling this way.

388
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,586
-I see.
-I've felt this way since the beginning.

389
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,756
You were really good
at chopping the onions.

390
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,848
I LOVE HOW YOU CHOP ONIONS

391
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,517
You were great at that.

392
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,020
Right, onions.

393
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:12,818
I wanted to talk to you yesterday.

394
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,947
But I didn't want
to make you feel uncomfortable.

395
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,283
I also didn't want to seem too shallow.

396
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,995
So that's why I didn't.

397
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,957
But we don't know each other well,
much less the others.

398
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,294
-Right.
-So don't feel pressured or anything.

399
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,087
The same goes for me too.

400
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,046
Right.

401
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,968
This isn't a confession of love
or anything like that.

402
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,513
I'm just letting you know
that I wanted to talk to you the most.

403
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,099
So…

404
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,143
How was the pork cutlet?

405
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,645
The pork cutlet?

406
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,480
I don't really like pork cutlet.

407
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,275
Then the next time
there's something delicious,

408
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,527
I'll make sure to win
so that we can eat it together.

409
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,154
It's…

410
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,532
really thoughtful of you to say that.

411
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,287
-Nice to say that without any pressure.
-Adorable.

412
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,288
He is.

413
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,624
I hope things work out for him.

414
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,584
-He's sincere.
-Yes, he is.

415
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,173
-Is that Jong-woo?
-He must be waiting for someone.

416
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,438
-Seul-ki.
-Yes?

417
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,648
Do you have time to talk?

418
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,941
-Shall we talk?
-Shall we?

419
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:34,900
Sure.

420
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,361
The view here's going to be great.

421
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,197
-Sit wherever you want.
-On the left?

422
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,452
I've been really wanting to talk to you.

423
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,411
Really?

424
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,121
-But I haven't had the chance.
-Right.

425
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,749
There wasn't any free time
or an opportunity.

426
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:57,047
So I wanted to talk to you
since we have some time right now.

427
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:58,882
So yesterday,

428
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,802
talking to you briefly

429
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,763
and learning that you're left-handed
and things like that,

430
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,598
I felt we had things in common.

431
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,141
So I became more curious…

432
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,143
-I see.
-…about you.

433
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,770
-Right.
-And when we talked,

434
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,692
you were good at giving small compliments.

435
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:21,113
You were good at noticing little details
and asking about them.

436
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,283
You seem to say a lot of things
that make people feel good.

437
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,997
It's important that I express
my feelings to you.

438
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,915
I see.

439
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,419
That's why I asked if we could

440
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,546
talk separately.

441
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,676
I have trouble making eye contact.

442
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,927
I see.

443
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:44,928
Why?

444
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,596
I'm not sure. I wonder why.

445
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,182
I'm not sure why.

446
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,686
I just have trouble making eye contact.
Are you good at it?

447
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,854
-Yes.
-Really?

448
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,239
You have a nice nose.

449
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,198
-My nose?
-Yes.

450
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,493
-You hear that a lot, don't you?
-I get that a lot.

451
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,871
Me too. See?

452
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,830
As for you…

453
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,417
Everything about you is pretty.

454
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,252
Your face is this small…

455
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,047
and everything on it is very pretty.

456
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:21,840
Thanks.

457
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,553
Is your personality energetic by nature?

458
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,305
-Yes.
-Yes.

459
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,974
I think it tends to be obvious

460
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,020
if I'm physically exhausted.

461
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,396
-You show it?
-Yes.

462
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,400
There will be many
exhausting situations here.

463
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,652
-Right.
-I'll read your face.

464
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,947
Since it shows on your face.

465
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,658
I'll be able to tell.

466
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,954
When you're exhausted,
I'm sure you'd rather be alone.

467
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,336
Look at the ocean.

468
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,255
-See how it sparkles?
-It's really pretty.

469
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,133
Apparently, the way it sparkles
is called yunseul.

470
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,843
-Yunseul?
-Yes. Isn't the name pretty?

471
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:07,761
-Yunseul?
-Yes.

472
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,847
Yun Seul-ki.

473
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,265
Sorry. That was lame.

474
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,561
That's nice.

475
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,105
"Yun Seul-ki."

476
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,233
Yun Seul-ki.

477
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,859
Sorry. That was lame.

478
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,403
I like it.

479
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,696
Yes. Yun Seul-ki.

480
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,615
Because you're Shin Seul-ki.

481
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,617
That's yunseul?

482
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,868
It's very pretty.

483
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,412
It's as if diamonds are sparkling.

484
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,707
This is really nice.

485
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,960
There's so much I want to talk about.

486
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,756
Who's inside?

487
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,466
No one?

488
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,343
No one?

489
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,554
Do you want to go
watch the ocean together?

490
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,680
Sounds good.

491
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,228
Go ahead.

492
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,897
-Come with us.
-With you?

493
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,150
It's boiling.

494
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,109
It's hot, right?

495
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,611
-I think my face is going to get tanned.
-Right.

496
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,280
Where?

497
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,906
-Over there.
-There are only two seats.

498
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,866
Go on without me.

499
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,745
I'll stay here by myself.

500
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,874
Bye.

501
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,753
-Why? Go with them.
-Why?

502
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,674
Earlier, Nadine said she was interested

503
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,301
-in Jin-young.
-She did.

504
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,552
But then Se-jeong…

505
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,762
-Maybe she has feelings for him too.
-Does she?

506
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,847
I think she does.

507
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,390
-Yes.
-Nadine's trying hard.

508
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,475
But Nadine gave up again.

509
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,768
-Right.
-Right?

510
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:45,025
You've been here for two days now?
Three days?

511
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,443
Three days including today.

512
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,111
How has it been?

513
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,947
Do you think someone here
fits your ideal type?

514
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,574
-Here?
-Is there anyone?

515
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,202
Not 100%.

516
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,871
But close?

517
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,458
What about you?

518
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,503
-Is there anyone?
-I'll have to talk to everyone.

519
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,843
But for now, I think there might be.

520
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,012
Is that so?

521
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:14,971
Yes.

522
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,141
But people's first impressions

523
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,393
don't always match once you get a chance…

524
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,062
-Right.
-…to talk to them.

525
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,273
-So it's interesting.
-I see.

526
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,032
When you're dating a guy

527
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:37,535
or when you choose someone,
do you not have a certain threshold?

528
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,621
What do you mean?

529
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,375
You know, if he has drinks…

530
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,919
-Yes.
-…with a female friend, for example?

531
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:49,381
Are you cool about things like that?

532
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,341
Well, yes.

533
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:56,304
It's fine as long as he still texts me.

534
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,765
Or if he lets me know beforehand.
Then it's okay.

535
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:00,934
That's cool.

536
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,524
I can't keep my eyes open.

537
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,819
-Do you want to sit here?
-I can't open my eyes.

538
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,989
-Am I sitting where I can't open my eyes?
-Yes.

539
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,865
-My eyes…
-Because of the sun.

540
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,075
I can't open my eyes.

541
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,243
You can sit here.

542
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,369
No, it's fine.

543
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,246
I don't want to frown.

544
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,749
He's adorable.

545
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,044
Jin-young's smile is quite charming.

546
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,924
This is my bed, but you can just sit down.

547
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,551
You can sit here.

548
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,722
What? It's So-e.

549
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,516
What? Really? That's right.

550
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,187
-How is it for you?
-In what respect?

551
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,107
Would you say…

552
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,944
you're curious about me?

553
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,654
-Am I curious about you?
-Yes.

554
00:26:54,738 --> 00:27:00,160
So, I mean, we did talk a little.

555
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,411
Yes.

556
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:06,791
So I was wondering if you wanted
to get to know me better.

557
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,463
You're right. I am curious about you.

558
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,595
-You're curious about me.
-Yes.

559
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,222
Ever since I met everyone
for the first time,

560
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:25,310
I've been talking about the same person.

561
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,270
-Yes.
-So…

562
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,858
You've been interested in the same person
ever since you met everyone?

563
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:32,817
Yes.

564
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,861
Just one person?

565
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,907
-Yes, I was never confused.
-I see.

566
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,368
Ever since we first sat down
in the beginning.

567
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,831
What about you?

568
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,625
-Me?
-Yes, how were things for you?

569
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,419
I think it kept changing.

570
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,796
-Really?
-Yes.

571
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,924
I'm going to see it

572
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:02,138
as a process of deciding on who I like
until the final decision.

573
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,390
It sounds nice.

574
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,017
-You should talk to a lot more people.
-That's where I'm at.

575
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,394
You haven't, have you?

576
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,525
Right, that's true.
At first, it was all of the women,

577
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,568
but it did narrow down.

578
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,782
Anyway, that's me.

579
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,951
Yes, that's good.

580
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,119
That's good?

581
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,120
-Good.
-Good?

582
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,704
-Yes, good.
-Okay.

583
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,667
Are you curious about me?

584
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,130
Of course, I am. I am curious about you.

585
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:42,011
But you know, even if we do talk,
what we can talk about is limited.

586
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,681
So I do feel like

587
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,394
I want to have conversations with people
without all that.

588
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,981
-And you're one of them…
-I see.

589
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,149
-So-e.
-Okay.

590
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,991
Did you have fun?

591
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,951
Yes, I had a nice talk.

592
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,455
Bye, So-e.

593
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,129
I talked to Seul-ki. We talked.

594
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,922
-I see.
-Yes.

595
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,177
What?

596
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,262
It's kind of nice.

597
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,097
-Talking with her was nice.
-I see.

598
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,515
I like her even more.

599
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,934
I want to talk to her more.

600
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,686
-You like her even more?
-Yes.

601
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,319
How was your conversation with So-e?

602
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,946
She's a really good person.

603
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,406
She's nice.

604
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,116
Who initiated the talk?

605
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,659
So-e.

606
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,827
-So-e initiated it?
-Yes.

607
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,621
Yoong-jae, you're popular.

608
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,039
-What?
-You're popular.

609
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:51,998
No.

610
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,546
-You're back.
-Yes.

611
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,714
-How was the talk?
-Good.

612
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,549
Who did you talk with?

613
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,092
Me? I…

614
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,762
It was Se-jeong, right? I saw you guys.

615
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,846
Yes, the girl crush.

616
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,972
The girl crush.

617
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,768
-You summed her up with one phrase.
-Girl crush.

618
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,436
But with unexpected charm.

619
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:15,897
That's amazing.

620
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,107
It was really nice.

621
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:24,155
He seemed really cold at first.

622
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,324
I think he's kind of adorable.

623
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,953
He's different when you talk to him.

624
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,621
He seems really cold.

625
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,873
-He said so himself.
-Yes.

626
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:38,294
Once we talked,
he seemed a bit similar to me.

627
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,297
That's really nice.

628
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,342
I think that's why we clicked.

629
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,720
And he said he was surprised by me.

630
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,515
That I'm cool and charming.

631
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,103
But well, he could just be saying things.

632
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,646
I think he's right, Se-jeong.

633
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,731
-Right, I agree.
-Right.

634
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,941
I don't know.

635
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,571
But we talked today

636
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,157
-in pairs, right?
-Yes.

637
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,993
-And you can't go…
-We all talked.

638
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,078
…with the person you went with yesterday.

639
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,037
Yes.

640
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,206
Doesn't that mean we might all
be going to Paradise?

641
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,251
You never know, though.

642
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,837
But it's not like we'll be
making risky choices.

643
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,130
Right, all things considered.

644
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,089
Right?

645
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,760
So-e gained confidence after her talk.

646
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,263
-Yes, with Yoong-jae just now.
-Yes.

647
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:34,142
I'm in tears because the new guy,
Jin-young, is now here.

648
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,351
-Right.
-Yes.

649
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,687
But only So-e's feelings are the same.

650
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,855
-Right.
-Her feelings.

651
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,817
Everyone is like,
"I wonder what kind of person he is."

652
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,485
But So-e isn't even interested.

653
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,155
-Only Yoong-jae?
-She said she's been

654
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,657
interested in the same guy
since the beginning.

655
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,786
I do think Yoong-jae and So-e will go.

656
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,833
It's likely that he'll go to Paradise
with So-e since he's curious about her.

657
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,921
He'll spend time with her there
and come to a conclusion about So-e.

658
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,255
That's what I'm thinking.

659
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,549
I really hope So-e and Yoong-jae
go together.

660
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:12,555
Don't you think they are expressing
their feelings for each other now?

661
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,350
Jong-woo cares only for Seul-ki.

662
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,517
"Yun Seul-ki."

663
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,353
-He likes her.
-Right.

664
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,730
Han-bin has his eyes on Seo-eun.

665
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,148
-Yes.
-Yes.

666
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,983
Do you think Seo-eun will go with Han-bin?

667
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,652
-No, I don't think she will.
-She won't.

668
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,655
-You don't think she'll choose him?
-I don't think so.

669
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,574
-But I think Yoong-jae will go with So-e.
-Yes.

670
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,744
-I bet he's going to love it.
-I wonder what'll happen.

671
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,746
I hope things really unfold that way.

672
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,789
-Let's watch.
-Yes.

673
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,124
-I'm curious.
-No use talking among ourselves.

674
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,671
INFERNO
5:00 P.M.

675
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,008
I feel more and more nervous
as time goes by.

676
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,136
Jong-woo, you think you'll be going today?

677
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,805
I want to go.

678
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,016
But I'm not sure I will,
so I'm not really getting my hopes up.

679
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,394
Because it'll be hard.

680
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,105
-It'll be really hard if I don't go.
-Today?

681
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,274
It'll be my second day in a row not going.
It's really hard.

682
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:12,156
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

683
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:18,955
The women have already chosen the men
they want to go to Paradise with.

684
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,834
30 MINUTES AGO

685
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,844
There's no safe choice.

686
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,431
I guess it's the choice
that best represents how I feel.

687
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,766
I know, right?

688
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,853
What if I'm the only one
who's left behind?

689
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,356
It's time for the men

690
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,026
to come out to the campfire one by one

691
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,321
and say the name of the woman
they'd like to go to Paradise with.

692
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:57,326
But couples who went
to Paradise together yesterday

693
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,454
can't choose each other.

694
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,497
The second time's harder.

695
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,875
It is harder for people
who've already been.

696
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,128
And there's another variable
added to the mix.

697
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,382
I wonder who will be going.

698
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,176
I hope everyone gets to go.

699
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,761
I hope we all get paired up.

700
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,139
I think there's a chance we might.

701
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,933
I'm not going to get my hopes up.

702
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,226
I won't get my hopes up.

703
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,352
If we go, good.

704
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,854
-If not, too bad.
-Right.

705
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,566
Well, you never know
the other person's decision.

706
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,776
Right.

707
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,943
I don't know.

708
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:36,240
MATCHING THE COUPLES TO GO TO PARADISE

709
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:44,582
KIM JIN-YOUNG

710
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,643
They're all so different.

711
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,562
And those differences
are all so unique and charming.

712
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,480
KIM JIN-YOUNG

713
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,274
Seul-ki, my instincts
really pointed to her,

714
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,362
so I'm really curious about that.

715
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,615
And to me, Seo-eun seemed different
than how I thought she'd be.

716
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,119
She maintained a certain level of energy
and was easygoing.

717
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,787
I liked that about her.

718
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,455
As for Se-jeong,

719
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,875
I felt like we had good chemistry
when we had our conversation,

720
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:32,130
and I think that's very charming.
So I'm conflicted right now…

721
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,094
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is…

722
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,389
I suddenly feel so…

723
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,183
Why am I so nervous right now?

724
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:57,029
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is Shin Seul-ki.

725
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,657
-I see.
-Yes.

726
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,950
-It took three seconds.
-Yes.

727
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:01,909
Three seconds.

728
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:02,869
Right.

729
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,180
CHOI JONG-WOO

730
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,689
The person I want to go to Paradise with…

731
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,858
is Shin Seul-ki.

732
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,455
Right now, I just want to get
to know Seul-ki better.

733
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,623
CHOI JONG-WOO

734
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,960
So I think I'll keep trying
until the day we go to Paradise together.

735
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,929
One person is so carefree…

736
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,431
-While the other is so desperate.
-Yes.

737
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,975
-I wonder.
-Seul-ki…

738
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,728
-She has to choose now, right?
-Right.

739
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,658
-Seul-ki's here.
-She came out.

740
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,296
-Who did she pick?
-We have to see her face.

741
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,048
What?

742
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,688
-The color of his shirt.
-Yes.

743
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,358
-Hello.
-Hi.

744
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,071
Shall we go?

745
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,990
Shall we? Where is it?

746
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,825
-It's this way.
-This way.

747
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,123
-Well…
-Yes?

748
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,666
Can you carry this for me?

749
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,376
-You want me to carry that?
-Yes.

750
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,296
-I'll carry it for you.
-No, I can carry it.

751
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,922
Okay, carry it.

752
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:22,925
My gosh!

753
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,052
Really?

754
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,556
-This is great.
-That's attractive.

755
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,598
I mean…

756
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,309
I mean, hang on.

757
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,893
Isn't he really attractive?

758
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,021
-I really…
-Carrying it would be so predictable.

759
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,522
I've never seen anyone like that.

760
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,275
-This is great.
-But weirdly enough, I don't hate him.

761
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,818
-Right.
-I don't hate him at all.

762
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,153
No, but wait.

763
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,488
Saying "Okay" is different

764
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,615
from saying, "Okay, carry it."

765
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,909
Jin-young just said…

766
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,829
-Jin-kyung. That's Jin-young's charm.
-He said, "Okay, carry it."

767
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,331
No, wait.

768
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:58,711
No, but I think it'd be very funny
if Seul-ki's carrying both bags tomorrow.

769
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,630
And he walks behind her
with his hands behind his back.

770
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,717
I want to see that image in person.

771
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,219
-He's a very rare character.
-Please.

772
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,512
What's with that guy?

773
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,516
-I'll carry it for you.
-No, I can carry it.

774
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,101
Okay, carry it.

775
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,068
We somehow matched.

776
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,404
Did you know I'd come out?

777
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,032
No. I thought you wouldn't.

778
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,205
Go ahead.

779
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,835
So isn't this your second time already?

780
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,961
Yes.

781
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,925
I think it'll be Jong-woo.

782
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,428
Because they went on a date earlier,
and they seemed to have talked a lot.

783
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,930
-Seriously?
-That's amazing.

784
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,558
And when she came back,
he kept talking to Seul-ki.

785
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,518
Yes.

786
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,314
Shin Seul-ki

787
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,817
did not choose

788
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,736
Choi Jong-woo.

789
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,448
Choi Jong-woo will not be
going to Paradise today.

790
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,231
I don't know.

791
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,697
-He looks so heartbroken.
-Gosh, I feel so bad.

792
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,658
-No one can talk to him in this situation.
-Right.

793
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,536
-Jong-woo likes her so much now.
-Right.

794
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,955
KIM HAN-BIN

795
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,332
It's Han-bin.

796
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,384
The woman I want to go
to Paradise with is…

797
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,845
I don't know who Han-bin…

798
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,723
-I don't know who he has feelings for.
-Right.

799
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,851
-I can't read him even if I try.
-Right.

800
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,312
Right, I couldn't.

801
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,233
The woman I want to go
to Paradise with is…

802
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:09,735
Choi Seo-eun.

803
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,578
Come out.

804
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,579
-Let's go.
-Go.

805
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,914
-At least talk with him.
-Right.

806
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,624
-Talk.
-Come on out.

807
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,709
-Gosh.
-So he can go and eat good food…

808
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,753
I don't think she'll come out.

809
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,865
-She's here!
-She came out?

810
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,075
That's a relief.

811
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,368
Jin-kyung, she came out.

812
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,953
Yes, she showed up.

813
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,547
My gosh, Han-bin!

814
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,260
-His sincerity worked.
-Right.

815
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,270
That looks so heavy.

816
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,898
-It'll be a bit hard for me to carry.
-Right?

817
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,110
Let's go.

818
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,658
I'm so nervous.

819
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,161
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

820
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,120
Let's go.

821
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,539
-To Paradise.
-Yes, let's go.

822
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,210
This is so nerve-racking.

823
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,503
Why?

824
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,381
It's heavy, isn't it?

825
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,091
It's super light.

826
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,720
It feels like nothing.

827
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,849
-I bet I can even run.
-No, wait.

828
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,768
Slow down.

829
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,812
I think he's gone.

830
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,483
Yes, I guess so.

831
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,777
Han-bin must have left.

832
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:22,701
SHIN DONG-WOO

833
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,631
The woman I want to go
to Paradise with is…

834
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,717
Lee Nadine.

835
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,223
I really don't know.

836
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:50,145
I'll have to choose
between the guy I'm interested in…

837
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,105
LEE NADINE

838
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,815
…and the guy I've talked to the most.

839
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:58,404
Dong-woo was nice to me,

840
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,864
but he didn't choose me the first time.

841
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:06,120
I think Jin-young is adorable,

842
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,914
but I don't know him at all.

843
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,084
-I wonder whether Nadine's feelings…
-Nadine…

844
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,877
Nadine's situation is a little…

845
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,297
-I hope she gets to go to Paradise.
-Right.

846
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,757
-Exactly.
-Let's go.

847
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,402
I'll go now.

848
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,882
Hello.

849
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:00,841
Hello.

850
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,720
-Do we just walk there?
-May I?

851
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:05,846
This is really heavy.

852
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,181
It's fine.

853
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,849
Gosh. Kidding.

854
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,563
-Be careful.
-Yes.

855
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,149
I didn't think we'd be going together.

856
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:20,569
You really didn't?

857
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,279
No, I really didn't know.

858
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,825
-Good choice.
-She has to talk a lot somehow.

859
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,160
Good for her.

860
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,162
They'll be able to talk
in English as well.

861
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,998
I think their vibes
will match up well to each other.

862
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:33,916
Right.

863
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,752
I'm excited about this couple.

864
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,589
-What if it's just the two of us left?
-What?

865
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,673
It's fine.

866
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,677
I just hope I'm not the only one.

867
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,931
-No, we have to go.
-We have to go.

868
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,891
We both should go.

869
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:56,563
JO YOONG-JAE

870
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,453
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is…

871
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:21,296
I bet you that So-e and Yoong-jae
will go to Paradise together.

872
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,923
It's So-e. Please.

873
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:38,063
The person I want to go
to Paradise with is Lee Nadine.

874
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,149
What?

875
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:42,734
What?

876
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,237
-What?
-That's so out of the blue.

877
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,030
-That's so out of the blue.
-This…

878
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,117
I think he avoided going with So-e.

879
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:51,994
I see.

880
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,830
-Someone he has no connection with.
-So-e…

881
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:55,872
He avoided her.

882
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,835
They could've gone to Paradise together.

883
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,629
-So-e said all that.
-But he didn't want to go.

884
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,339
-Yes.
-He avoided her.

885
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,593
Lee Nadine

886
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:12,139
did not choose Jo Yoong-jae today.

887
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,934
Jo Yoong-jae will not be
going to Paradise today.

888
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,728
Please return to the lodging.

889
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,992
I really don't know.

890
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,829
Lots of thoughts
are running through my mind.

891
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,381
I guess the interval is long.

892
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,676
-The period in between.
-Really? Was it like this yesterday?

893
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,805
That concludes the matching…

894
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,392
-It must be over.
-…of the second set of couples in Inferno.

895
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,037
KIM JIN-YOUNG

896
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,631
JO YOONG-JAE

897
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,144
I was literally abandoned.

898
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,775
I even said all that…

899
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:53,198
I guess Yoong-jae left with someone else.

900
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,912
Yoong-jae must have left
with someone else.

901
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,208
No, if the person that Yoong-jae chose

902
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,420
ended up choosing someone else,

903
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,964
and the two left together,
he could still be here.

904
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,429
This is…

905
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,932
-Jong-woo was always into Seul-ki, too.
-Yes.

906
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,935
Jong-woo was very straightforward
about how he felt.

907
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:10,192
In this situation,
So-e's feelings would be the most hurt.

908
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,570
I think it's his way
of being considerate toward Seo-eun.

909
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,989
He might have wanted
to stay behind with her.

910
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,699
-That could be right.
-I see!

911
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,285
-I see!
-That could be right.

912
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,496
But Seo-eun left.

913
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,168
Excuse me.

914
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,294
Yes.

915
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,171
-Can we come in?
-Yes.

916
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,716
-Hi.
-Who is it?

917
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,803
-What?
-Hi.

918
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:38,804
Hi.

919
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,181
I didn't expect you two to be left here.

920
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,974
Hurry, come in.

921
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,768
Why are you two left?

922
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,852
Did you expect this?

923
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,855
-I didn't. Why are you two left?
-Really?

924
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,816
Yoong-jae must be surprised.

925
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,567
-But he would've known.
-He must've known.

926
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,445
-That it's not Seo-eun.
-Because Seo-eun's not here.

927
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,030
-He's surprised.
-He's shocked.

928
00:51:57,113 --> 00:52:00,033
-He's shocked it's not Seo-eun.
-His expression says, "She's gone."

929
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:02,786
-He's having a mental breakdown right now.
-Right.

930
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,497
Sit where you're comfortable.
Sit over here.

931
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,499
Sit where you're comfortable.

932
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,003
The three of us are here again.

933
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,506
-Hey.
-I know.

934
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,094
I'm wearing this shirt. I should have…

935
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,930
I should've worked harder.

936
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,181
Wear it again.

937
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:26,309
Should I?

938
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,813
I don't even know if I'll ever get to go.

939
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:41,283
I packed my swimsuit.
I wanted to swim. This is disappointing.

940
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,495
Are you okay?

941
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,916
I just really wanted to go to Paradise.

942
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,919
I'm disappointed I didn't get to go.

943
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,882
I think it's because I just have
huge expectations.

944
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,887
So who went?

945
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,681
Can you guess?

946
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,850
Because I can't, judging by who's left.

947
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:07,934
Yes, I can.

948
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:08,935
I can guess.

949
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,688
Because you can't go with the people
you've been there with.

950
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,398
It's just a guess.

951
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:14,983
Nadine.

952
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,277
-Dong-woo?
-Dong-woo?

953
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,488
No, not Dong-woo. Jin-young.

954
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,283
-The new guy.
-What? Did he tell you?

955
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:26,077
No, but I felt something.

956
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,580
I think he would have gone with Nadine.

957
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:32,417
-What about Seul-ki?
-Seul-ki with Han-bin.

958
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,503
Did Seul-ki and Han-bin
have any connection?

959
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,423
I saw them say hi earlier.

960
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,966
-They just said hi.
-It's just a hi.

961
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,345
No, I saw them say hi
as if it were some kind of telepathy.

962
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,139
-No.
-I didn't know about that.

963
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,266
My guess is different.

964
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,893
Tell us. What do you think?

965
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:50,977
I think

966
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,939
Jin-young left with Seul-ki

967
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,357
and Han-bin left with Seo-eun.

968
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,441
Yes, that's what I think.

969
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,109
-I thought so too.
-Really?

970
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,486
Dong-woo and Nadine.

971
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,238
-Dong-woo and Nadine.
-Am I kind of oblivious?

972
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,074
Your instincts…

973
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,743
I feel like you have terrible instincts.

974
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:10,497
Right. It's very hard to predict
other people's emotions.

975
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:12,958
I thought you'd be going.

976
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,417
-Me too.
-Me? Really?

977
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,462
I said you're definitely going.

978
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:22,092
Did you vote because you were certain?
Or did you have to think about it?

979
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,596
From when we first came here until now,

980
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,641
I just did what I wanted to do.

981
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,937
I didn't care about
the other person's feelings.

982
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,231
Even if they do reject me,

983
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:40,068
I'm just going to go with how I feel.

984
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,487
You stayed true to your feelings.

985
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,826
Why are you sitting there like that?

986
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,244
Come here and talk with us.

987
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,203
Okay.

988
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,748
-You're having a hard time?
-I just keep curling up.

989
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,421
So did you think a lot when you chose?

990
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,797
Yes, a lot.

991
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,174
I thought about it a lot.

992
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,471
Can I ask what factor you think is
the most important?

993
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:11,850
I…

994
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,519
Myself?

995
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,107
-Thinking of oneself should come first.
-The way you feel?

996
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:24,612
I really don't like giving vague answers.

997
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,782
I just think

998
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,618
about the person I want to choose.

999
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,787
That's how I choose…

1000
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,375
I have no idea what I'm saying.

1001
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,004
-Why are you so restless?
-What? It's nothing.

1002
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:48,011
-It's Yoong-jae's first time, right?
-What?

1003
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,471
Being rejected.

1004
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,931
Right, but I don't think I was rejected.

1005
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,892
It's just that we weren't right
for each other.

1006
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,728
-Not right for each other?
-Yes.

1007
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,563
That's even more sad.

1008
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:03,068
If you're not right for each other,
it's hard to make things work.

1009
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,527
Did you like her a lot?

1010
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,863
-What?
-Did you like her a lot?

1011
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,074
I guess so.

1012
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,618
-Were you really certain?
-Really?

1013
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:17,749
It could have been just me
who was certain.

1014
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,418
From my perspective, I think I'm trying,

1015
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,462
and I think it's getting somewhere.

1016
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,048
But still,

1017
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,134
I think it's a bit slow.

1018
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,514
It's hard for me to tell
what the other person is thinking.

1019
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,973
I've realized that by coming here.

1020
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,517
I used to think it was easy.

1021
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:40,146
-How could you know what others think?
-Right?

1022
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,982
I think sincerity works.

1023
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,454
Won't we feel better once we eat?

1024
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,455
You think so?

1025
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,125
Would we even be able to cook?

1026
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,544
-See you once we're dressed.
-See you soon.

1027
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,879
Let's go. We have to go get our things.

1028
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,135
Let's go. Yoong-jae, let's go.

1029
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,928
At least I'm not here alone.

1030
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,472
-What?
-I would've cried if I'd been left alone.

1031
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,850
Thanks for staying with me.

1032
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:21,855
This is really hard. It's impossible
not to have a mental breakdown.

1033
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:27,735
CHANGING ROOM

1034
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,199
So-e.

1035
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,827
What if I cry later?

1036
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,079
I feel like crying.

1037
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,804
It honestly doesn't matter
if I'm rejected.

1038
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,140
The way people feel can't be helped.

1039
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,434
But I'm so sad.

1040
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,066
LEE SO-E

1041
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:11,154
I expressed my feelings to Yoong-jae,

1042
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,531
but he didn't choose me.

1043
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,077
He could have purposely made
a different choice

1044
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,205
thinking of his relationship with Seo-eun,

1045
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,373
whom he went to Paradise with before.

1046
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:27,712
Or it could have been because I didn't
approach him more actively.

1047
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,255
There could be many reasons.

1048
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:33,635
But it hurt my feelings.

1049
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,638
But people can't help
how their heart feels.

1050
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,487
She's been cheerful this whole time.

1051
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,406
This is really intense.

1052
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,910
So-e was talking

1053
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:02,413
as if she was consoling Jong-woo,
but actually,

1054
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,082
she was talking to herself.

1055
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,292
-All those things she said earlier.
-Right.

1056
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:10,421
And she smiled cheerfully in front
of the others, but then burst into tears

1057
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,257
where there were no cameras.

1058
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:16,970
There are things that can be done
through working hard.

1059
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:22,058
Jobs or things like that are something
that you can work hard at and achieve.

1060
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:26,437
But for relationships with people,

1061
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,816
even if you work hard,
you won't always get the results you want.

1062
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,735
Especially with issues
between men and women.

1063
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:37,532
This isn't something that can be done
through dedication or sincerity.

1064
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,950
That's why it's hard.

1065
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,076
So it's really sad.

1066
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,121
-So-e really expresses herself well…
-Right.

1067
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:46,207
…and if she meets someone
who is right for her,

1068
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,502
then things will work out great.

1069
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:54,966
Yoong-jae just isn't right for So-e.

1070
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,135
So-e did all she could.

1071
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,639
-Let's go eat.
-Let's go eat.

1072
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,520
-What will we get for dinner today?
-What'll be there?

1073
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:11,441
-I only see green onions. What's that?
-What? There's something new.

1074
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,651
-It's ramyeon.
-It's insane

1075
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,069
It's ramyeon.

1076
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,446
-There's ramyeon.
-Gosh!

1077
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,198
Jong-woo, get up.

1078
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,700
-Jong-woo, get up.
-Get up.

1079
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:22,577
No way.

1080
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,912
Yes, this is Paradise.

1081
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:28,541
Eggs!

1082
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,211
-Should we fry them? Or scramble them?
-Like this.

1083
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,381
-Me too. I love scrambled eggs.
-Then I'll whisk the eggs.

1084
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,593
-This is so nice.
-I'll prepare the vegetables.

1085
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,054
I was so happy the second
I saw the ramyeon.

1086
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,055
It's crazy.

1087
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,058
All my troubled feelings went away.

1088
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,893
Right. They're all gone?

1089
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,437
-Good.
-Let's enjoy the food.

1090
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:23,846
What?

1091
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,349
-My gosh.
-Did you put in too much salt?

1092
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,351
-A crazy amount of salt.
-Hang on.

1093
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,103
Stay still.

1094
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,187
Don't stir it…

1095
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,272
-Where did you put it?
-Here.

1096
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,158
Wait, let's stir it.

1097
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,369
We'll stir it and then taste it.

1098
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,079
It'll be so salty.

1099
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,667
It's not that bad.

1100
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,129
Yes, I think it's good.

1101
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,463
-Yes?
-Yes.

1102
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,090
-It's okay.
-Then good.

1103
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,801
-Yes.
-I don't think you have to worry at all.

1104
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:07,890
-So-e, don't fall for this.
-Gosh.

1105
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,684
Don't fall for this. Just give up.

1106
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,853
He just took away some salt!

1107
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,855
Now, I'll add the noodles.

1108
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,106
Yes.

1109
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,316
I'm so happy right now.

1110
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,486
It smells great.

1111
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,409
Amazing.

1112
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,870
It looks nice.

1113
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,123
What are you doing?

1114
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:33,666
I'm going to have raw radish.

1115
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,834
I see.

1116
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,961
You eat radish raw?

1117
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,254
Yes, I like it.

1118
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:46,512
Good.

1119
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,223
I'm so excited.

1120
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,641
This looks so good.

1121
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,894
This looks really good.

1122
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,187
Thank you for the food.

1123
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,521
-Thanks for the food.
-Thanks.

1124
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,242
We cooked the ramyeon really well.

1125
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,952
-I know, right?
-It's so good.

1126
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,205
-I feel good now that I'm eating.
-Me too.

1127
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:15,500
I feel even better since I'm eating this
while looking at the ocean.

1128
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,459
Really?

1129
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:17,919
I can't see the ocean.

1130
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:25,092
He didn't even look at the ocean
when he said that.

1131
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,052
This is good.

1132
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,523
Since I'm eating radish
while I'm eating ramyeon,

1133
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,983
I feel like I can cut myself some slack.

1134
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:42,735
Really?

1135
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,278
It's like I'm doing a detox.

1136
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,699
It feels like it.

1137
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:53,412
Isn't the ramyeon we're eating now
better than the special meal in Paradise?

1138
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,831
-It's good.
-Right?

1139
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,416
-Yes, it's good.
-You should keep staying in Inferno.

1140
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,169
-Okay?
-He's dragging you in.

1141
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,129
Hey, you should think of going yourself.

1142
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,465
Seriously. We have to go, Jong-woo.

1143
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,217
I will go. I trust that I can.

1144
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,262
What did you say earlier? Sincerity works.

1145
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,681
Yes. Push your way forward.

1146
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:12,640
I should.

1147
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,067
-That was good.
-That was really good.

1148
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,902
-Are you full?
-Very.

1149
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,822
I've been eating a lot more
since coming here.

1150
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,366
The fog is really bad.

1151
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,661
It's nice to see a different view.

1152
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,413
-It feels mysterious.
-Yes.

1153
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,502
They didn't create the fog, right?

1154
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,504
It's like a scene from a movie.

1155
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,673
-How is this so--
-Pirates of the Caribbean.

1156
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,133
Right.

1157
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,594
-It does feel like that.
-With the wrecked ship.

1158
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,347
-Yoong-jae.
-Yes?

1159
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,516
I have something I want to tell you.

1160
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,018
-Should we talk there?
-Sure.

1161
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,900
-If conversations end vaguely…
-Yes.

1162
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:08,279
…I tend to go to sleep
feeling uncomfortable.

1163
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:14,577
If you have something to say
that will make you feel better,

1164
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,829
I'm ready to hear it.

1165
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:18,581
Thanks.

1166
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,211
People really can't help
having expectations.

1167
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:28,925
-Yes.
-And I did imply that by saying,

1168
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,886
-"I'm curious about you."
-Yes.

1169
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:35,306
And I'm not saying I'm frustrated

1170
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:42,313
just because you didn't choose me.

1171
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,398
I'm just saying that that's how I felt.

1172
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:48,527
But I felt like you have

1173
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:52,865
different values in terms of dating here.

1174
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:57,411
You're like, "I'm going to meet
as many people as possible first,

1175
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,539
and there should be someone
who's right for me among them."

1176
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,832
Am I right?

1177
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:06,587
Yes, I'm a bit cautious
about making decisions.

1178
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,342
It's true that I'm curious
about all the women,

1179
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:15,763
and I'd like to get a chance
to talk to everyone.

1180
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:19,141
So I think it's right to meet them…

1181
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,061
if it's possible

1182
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,271
and if I have the chance.

1183
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,568
I respect that very much.

1184
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:31,654
But…

1185
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:39,495
I just thought that it would be nice
if I was part of that, at least once.

1186
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,503
I also thought that I wish
I was one of the people…

1187
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,805
that you're curious about.

1188
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:02,268
To be honest, many people…

1189
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,103
It's kind of embarrassing

1190
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:07,314
not to have the same feelings returned

1191
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:10,568
by someone I like publicly.

1192
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,362
And it's a little sad.

1193
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:16,323
So I've put a lot of thought
into this and…

1194
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,540
I've come to the conclusion
that this is just who I am.

1195
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,292
This is just who I am.

1196
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:30,337
Even if it's a little embarrassing
and sad…

1197
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:36,761
I thought that I should act in a way
that stays true to who I am.

1198
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:37,803
So…

1199
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,348
I would never want you to feel pressured.

1200
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:45,686
I don't want that.

1201
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,402
I see.

1202
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,196
Yes.

1203
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:04,830
-I'm a bit flustered, but…
-Yes.

1204
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:09,960
Thank you for telling me
I shouldn't feel pressured.

1205
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,841
I think it's really cool.

1206
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:23,265
-This is a very surprising situation, so…
-Really?

1207
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,309
-Yes.
-Is this an unexpected situation?

1208
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,770
To be honest,

1209
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:29,855
I did think

1210
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:34,235
maybe you chose me

1211
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:37,571
when we were talking earlier.

1212
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:42,910
So I thought you would

1213
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,539
be disappointed

1214
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,333
or angry at me.

1215
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,878
So I was actually very cautious

1216
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,840
when we had dinner earlier.

1217
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:56,757
I see.

1218
01:08:56,841 --> 01:09:00,261
To be totally honest, I was upset.

1219
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,763
You really did seem to be.

1220
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,851
-I'm sorry. I couldn't hide it.
-No, it's nothing to be sorry about.

1221
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,979
I just thought that perhaps…

1222
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,941
it could have been my fault.

1223
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:20,614
So the way you approached me just now,
saying how we should talk,

1224
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:24,076
I think you really expressed

1225
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,662
your feelings a lot.

1226
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,123
So I don't want to say

1227
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,667
that I've changed my mind,

1228
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:37,298
but I do feel like
maybe I could look at things differently.

1229
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,722
So I'll let you know how I feel
before it's too late.

1230
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:46,765
Okay, thank you.

1231
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,684
Yes, I'll tell you
before it's too late.

1232
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,104
Thanks.

1233
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,480
No, thank you.

1234
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:10,039
I've told you how I feel,
and I've said everything there is to say.

1235
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,999
Honestly, I've thought a lot about this.

1236
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,293
I tried some new things.

1237
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,629
Of course, I'm curious about other people.

1238
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,423
I can't really pretend everything's okay.

1239
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:21,759
You never really know
what's going to happen.

1240
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,011
It was really cool.

1241
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:25,387
Can I cross the line?

1242
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:35,314
I thought I knew exactly
when things started going wrong.

1243
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,359
My emotions are running high
because I'm so focused on how I feel.

1244
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,694
I wanted to take things a bit slow.

1245
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:43,197
My heart hurts so much.
