LEE SI-AN

2
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,312
CHUNG YOU-JIN

3
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,314
KIM MIN-SEOL

4
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,316
BAE JI-YEON

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,318
KIM HYE-JIN

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,320
KIM A-RIN

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,322
KIM TE-HWAN

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,324
KOOK DONG-HO

00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,326
JANG THEO

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,328
KIM JEONG-SU

11
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,330
YUK JUN-SEO

12
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,963
SINGLE'S INFERNO

13
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,273
I've had one-on-one conversations
with everyone else

14
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,025
and went to Paradise with them.

15
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,195
But I've never even had
a chance to talk with Jun-seo.

16
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,530
That's why I chose him.

17
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,076
-Hello.
-Hello.

18
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,579
Sorry for making you wait.

19
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,497
No, don't be.

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,498
Okay.

21
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,916
-Did you shower?
-Yes.

22
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,417
You didn't finish drying your hair?

23
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,294
-I let it air-dry.
-I see.

24
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,545
Because my hair's long.

25
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,132
It smells like shampoo.
Is this women's shampoo?

26
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,051
Yes, you can think of me as a woman.

27
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,011
What is he talking about?

28
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,681
He's rambling out of embarrassment.
I know well.

29
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,142
-Is this how UDT soldiers act?
-A little bit.

30
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,769
It's a common trait.

31
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,483
-They did a great job here.
-Right?

32
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,318
-Do you like dessert?
-Yes, I do.

33
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,946
-You do? Then, have some.
-Okay.

34
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,281
Thank you.
I get to be here because of you.

35
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,368
You pushed everyone in.

36
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,579
How did you do so well despite all that?

37
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,582
I thought that even if I fall,

38
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,419
just focus on moving quickly.

39
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:13,216
I've lost a bit of confidence
after making those three fall in.

40
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,551
No, it's okay.

41
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,428
Until yesterday,
I was known for winning games.

42
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,222
Exactly. First among the guys.

43
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,765
But now…

44
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,601
-What?
-I feel so weak right now.

45
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,478
-We both won our games.
-You're right.

46
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,148
You're strong.

47
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,149
You mean just now?

48
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,489
Did you know I'd choose you?

49
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,407
Nope.

50
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,117
You had no clue?

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,493
-Of course not.
-Really?

52
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,412
-How would I know?
-You didn't expect it?

53
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,166
Not even a glimmer of hope?

54
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,877
I was in a bit of a daze,
and my mind was blank.

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,462
Because you were discouraged
by what everyone said?

56
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,047
I mean, you can't always do well.

57
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,090
That's true.

58
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,341
Yeah.

59
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,093
You weren't that curious?

60
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,052
-About?
-Me.

61
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,262
I see. I was curious.

62
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,179
You were?

63
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,473
-You sat beside me on the helicopter.
-Right.

64
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,644
YESTERDAY MORNING

65
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,236
So is that all?

66
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:16,946
Yes.

67
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,948
-That's all?
-What more do you need?

68
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,491
Yeah, I'm just asking.

69
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,993
-Right.
-Okay.

70
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:29,584
Why did you choose You-jin
for your first Paradise date?

71
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,045
We just made the most eye contact.

72
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,590
You-jin smiled at me two or three times.

73
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:40,803
Her smile seemed so kind and pure.

74
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,888
So I thought

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,432
if I go with her,

76
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,894
I won't break into a cold sweat,
so I chose her.

77
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,229
Did you two become close?

78
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,522
At the time, I thought we did.

79
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,399
Now, she doesn't even look my way.

80
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,734
-She doesn't?
-Nope.

81
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,486
Oh no.

82
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,655
We reunited after two days.

83
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,739
-Right.
-So…

84
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,200
We made memories at the start.

85
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,244
Right. And that's tough to forget, right?

86
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,453
Yes, and because of that,

87
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,747
I expected a warm welcome.

88
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,624
But she was so formal with me.

89
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,335
So I was like, "What's going on?"

90
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,796
That's what I thought.

91
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,801
I'll have to wait and see.

92
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,929
What's your ideal type?

93
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:23,972
-My type?
-Yes.

94
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,519
I think I like people
who are honest and not fake.

95
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,603
How about you?

96
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,771
-Me?
-Yes.

97
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,065
I like guys who are a bit masculine.

98
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,483
-I see.
-That's my type.

99
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,445
Some people just catch my eye instantly.

100
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,571
-Really?
-Yeah.

101
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,823
As for personality,

102
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,867
I think I like someone
who's deep and serious.

103
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,577
Deep and serious.

104
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,495
I see.

105
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,373
What kind of person are you?

106
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,416
-Me?
-Yes.

107
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,917
Well,

108
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,836
I'm pretty serious.

109
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,341
Jun-seo has these cute little quirks.

110
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,218
I'm pretty serious.

111
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,929
You're serious?

112
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,389
I'm kidding.

113
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,474
I don't know what kind of person I am.

114
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,644
It feels like I'm figuring that out here.

115
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,271
Before…

116
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:17,275
Before, I'd never reflected
on myself that much.

117
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,235
But being here makes you think a lot.

118
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,364
Are you a shy person?

119
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,991
I tend to be shy.

120
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,075
Yes.

121
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,785
Sorry. I'm not being very masculine.

122
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,580
It's okay. I'll help bring it out of you.

123
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,748
Okay.

124
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,250
-When we have the chance to talk…
-Right.

125
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,794
-I already feel comfortable with you.
-Let's chat.

126
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:37,754
Really?

127
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,258
Because when I first walked in,
you were standing right in front of me.

128
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,218
-Right.
-You were so tall.

129
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,848
You looked kind of tough and intimidating.

130
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,016
-Really?
-Yes.

131
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,768
You were a bit intimidating.

132
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,687
I thought we wouldn't have
much reason to meet.

133
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,397
-That's what I thought.
-Really?

134
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,818
But after talking with you in person,
I realized things were different.

135
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,658
I hope we can get to know each other
without any pressure.

136
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,494
-I'd like that.
-Yeah.

137
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,661
-Seriously.
-Yes.

138
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,164
-Sounds good.
-Don't…

139
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,707
-Don't just say "Yes."
-What?

140
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,294
-Then why?
-What?

141
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,213
Why do you want to get to know me?

142
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:24,842
It feels like there's more to you
that you haven't shown yet,

143
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,760
and I'd like to…

144
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,512
-You want to see that?
-Yes, I do.

145
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,182
I think you don't know
how to interact with women.

146
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,184
Really?

147
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,769
-Yes.
-Is there a specific way?

148
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,274
Just be like Jeong-su.

149
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,692
-That's true.
-Yes.

150
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:49,700
I think if we drop the formalities,
we could get really close.

151
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,077
-Right?
-Yes.

152
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,453
I like speaking casually.

153
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,371
-Me too.
-Yes.

154
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:57,250
That's why I mix in some casual language.

155
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,005
Nice. You're like me.

156
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,511
Let's go.

157
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,428
What?

158
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,471
We can have real talks.

159
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,389
Yes.

160
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,184
We can talk
about a lot of things if we go.

161
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,728
I see. Sure.

162
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,646
Okay.

163
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,779
I tend to be attracted to honest
and straightforward personalities.

164
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,449
Surprisingly, Si-an seemed to be

165
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:34,328
genuine in how she acted and spoke.

166
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,664
That caught me off guard.

167
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,915
I'm just curious.

168
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,544
I want to bring out
more of his personality.

169
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,881
I think he hasn't shown all of it yet.

170
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,758
That's so interesting.

171
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,011
Si-an seems to be adventurous.

172
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,846
That's something
people don't commonly say.

173
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,056
She said she wants to
bring out his personality

174
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,394
instead of saying she's curious
and wants to get to know him better.

175
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,023
But rather than a romantic attraction
between Si-an and Jun-seo…

176
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,649
They're getting to know each other.

177
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,319
They want to know more,
but there's no attraction yet.

178
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,530
-Si-an seems really skilled at dating.
-Right.

179
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,948
It seems she has experience.

180
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,035
If you're someone as pretty as Si-an,

181
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,496
then you've been very popular

182
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,248
and a lot of guys
have been interested in you.

183
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,125
So she seems to be full of confidence.

184
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,044
That's why she wants
a guy who won't waver.

185
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,755
And it's why she can say
she wants to bring out his personality.

186
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,424
You can't bring it out of anyone
just because you want to.

187
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,884
-That's true.
-Right?

188
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,843
That's right.

189
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,803
Jun-seo also mentioned

190
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,597
how it's become awkward with You-jin.

191
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,681
-Jun-seo?
-Yes.

192
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,682
-To Si-an.
-Right.

193
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,643
From what I can tell,

194
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,646
Jun-seo doesn't seem
to be the type who puts effort

195
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,731
into someone who confuses him.

196
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,399
-Right.
-He gets tired of it.

197
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,651
He likes honest people.

198
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,569
He likes people who are honest,

199
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,697
so he might not bother
and just give up on things.

200
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,032
Right.

201
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,911
I think it's because You-jin
is being ambiguous right now.

202
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,581
Are they out on a date now?

203
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,166
-Yeah.
-They are?

204
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,501
They must be.

205
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,962
She was all dressed up earlier.

206
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,675
-Goodness.
-Her mouth…

207
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,094
That's how you apply it?

208
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,806
If you could go on a date,

209
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,058
who would you…

210
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,726
I'd choose Jun-seo.

211
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,019
Really? Again?

212
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,396
-Jun-seo again?
-Yeah.

213
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,274
-Really?
-Of course, for now.

214
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,525
-Because…
-Right.

215
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,068
-It was that good?
-Yeah.

216
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,696
-But I don't know if he felt the same.
-Right.

217
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,322
I feel a bit strange.

218
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,951
Then, have you developed
feelings for him? Do you like him?

219
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,537
-So not a bad…
-It's like this.

220
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,454
So…

221
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,415
For example, during the game,

222
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,750
I stepped up for my turn.

223
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,794
-And he was right in front of me.
-Yeah.

224
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,213
I just felt…

225
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,008
really glad to see him.

226
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,718
-Really?
-Yeah, I was glad.

227
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,181
Kim Min-seol.
Please start when the whistle blows.

228
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,224
Get ready.

229
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,937
I was really glad to see him.

230
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,191
I don't even know why I'm like this.
He's not even my type.

231
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,069
-You're just attracted to him?
-He's a bit rough.

232
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,321
Right.

233
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,782
But he's not a rough person.
He just has a no-frills personality.

234
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,243
But I liked that.

235
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,037
Yeah.

236
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,334
We had a good connection,
but I'm not sure.

237
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,753
He seems to have
a masculine vibe and no frills.

238
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,712
Definitely.

239
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,130
Right? I thought so.

240
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,298
He's very manly.

241
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,800
I didn't know I could feel this way.

242
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:35,843
I know, right?

243
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,721
I guess Paradise must really be different.

244
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,600
She must've swooned.

245
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,061
Min-seol and Jun-seo make a great couple.

246
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,812
Yes, and Min-seol would keep chatting.

247
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,649
Right. She seems
like an honest person too.

248
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,942
She has a cute, puppy-like energy.

249
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,487
What did you talk about?

250
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,989
Us? Who we thought…

251
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,032
Was best so far?

252
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,660
Things like who we want to talk to
and who we like.

253
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,994
Let's share our thoughts.

254
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,954
You go first. We'll share too.

255
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:04,872
-Me?
-Yeah.

256
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,666
Who am I interested in the most?

257
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,711
I'm attracted to Dong-ho.

258
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,464
Right now, you're most drawn to Dong-ho?

259
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,928
I think Dong-ho is someone
I could develop an interest in.

260
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,180
-And…
-It'd be a good match.

261
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,598
-Who are you curious about?
-Yeah.

262
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,268
The person I'm curious about
is the one who tossed me today.

263
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,979
-Jun-seo.
-Jun-seo.

264
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,856
He always seems angry.

265
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,235
But everyone who went
to Paradise with him said he's different.

266
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,945
-So I'm curious.
-He's different.

267
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,655
Welcome back.

268
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,573
Where have you been?

269
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,867
I was over there the whole time.

270
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,664
I have a question.
You've talked to quite a few people now.

271
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,333
-Yes, I've talked to everyone.
-So…

272
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,794
Who are you most drawn to?
We're all sharing.

273
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,629
-Most drawn to?
-Yes.

274
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,133
I'm curious about You-jin.

275
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,552
There's someone I'm curious about.

276
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,680
-But another guy is constantly on my mind.
-You're drawn to him?

277
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,306
Constantly on your mind? Already?

278
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,433
-They're constantly…
-Who?

279
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,476
Tell us that first.
Who's constantly on your mind?

280
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,686
I'm so curious.

281
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,770
Isn't it Jun-seo?

282
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,397
Yes, it's Jun-seo.

283
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,065
Paradise really does make an impact.

284
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,733
Yeah, I guess it does.

285
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,403
Yeah, your first time in Paradise
is especially intense.

286
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,864
Right, I forgot about that.

287
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,574
She said she forgot.

288
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,869
She's like,
"I'd totally forgotten about that."

289
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,204
"That's right. I remember now."

290
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,915
Right, I forgot about that.

291
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,835
-Right.
-So we only spent the first day together.

292
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,964
Then, we were separated,
and I was left on Inferno.

293
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:40,509
So I only have
that one memory of Paradise.

294
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,886
-That's true.
-Of course.

295
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:46,307
And Jun-seo is the only one
I actually know anything about.

296
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,435
Then, who are you curious about?

297
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,061
I'm curious about…

298
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,606
As of now,

299
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:55,983
it's Dong-ho.

300
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,112
Because we were able
to talk a lot yesterday.

301
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,658
Who did everyone else say?

302
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,494
Again? We already went over it.

303
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,454
Come on, tell me.

304
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,331
Should we go around and quickly share?

305
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,666
For me, it's been Dong-ho up to now.

306
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,711
For me, it's been Jun-seo so far.

307
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,088
He's the one I've been to Paradise with.

308
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,673
I'm curious about Jun-seo.

309
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,178
There are two people I'm curious about.

310
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,471
One is Jun-seo.

311
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,057
The next is…

312
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,350
Theo was mentioned earlier.

313
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,727
Yeah, Theo.
I heard all the rumors about him.

314
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,771
So I became curious.

315
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,191
-Jun-seo's become the talk of the town.
-Yes.

316
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,817
That's why it's better to keep quiet.

317
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,571
You know how Jun-seo fell into the water?

318
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,367
After seeing him fall three times,
he became more…

319
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,202
-You felt sorry for him.
-Likeable…

320
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,163
I agree with what Da-hee said.

321
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,624
He appears strong
and seems good at everything.

322
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,417
But he was clumsy during the game.

323
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,795
-Right.
-He made three mistakes.

324
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,589
I thought that side of him
may be an unexpected charm.

325
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,258
They'd want to get to know him.

326
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,801
No one mentioned Te-hwan.

327
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,929
When Te-hwan was in that log game…

328
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,930
His posture…

329
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,889
It's a shame.

330
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,685
I wish Te-hwan would show
a bit of a fierce, masculine side.

331
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,728
It'd be good if he could.

332
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,403
What's that? A campfire?

333
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,364
-How romantic.
-That's pretty romantic.

334
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,285
-There are beers here.
-What?

335
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,786
This is going to be filling.

336
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,414
Is that a bunch of good food?

337
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,790
It is!

338
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,000
Amazing.

339
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,546
There are two tables on each side.

340
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,673
Is it one guy per table?

341
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,469
Should we sit in every other seat?

342
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,888
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

343
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,683
What? Do we have to choose?

344
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,767
What is this?

345
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,936
-Okay, make your choice.
-What?

346
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,354
-Come on.
-That's a bummer.

347
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,398
-We should've sat down first.
-Right.

348
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,816
Let's just sit.

349
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,277
We'll just sit down.

350
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,302
Si-an went back to Jeong-su.

351
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,017
-It's cold, right?
-Yeah.

352
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,523
Are you sitting here? Then, I'll sit here.

353
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,318
-Hello.
-Hello.

354
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,278
You're going to be cold.

355
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,571
It's freezing.

356
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,572
But it's warmer today.

357
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,532
One person will be left over.

358
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,451
We have an extra person.

359
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,578
We're one guy short.

360
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,040
There are two seats.

361
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,458
You're right. These two.

362
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,501
There are two here.

363
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,754
But aren't these tables set up for pairs?

364
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,130
-It's cold, right?
-Yeah.

365
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,844
It seems like Hye-jin
wants to talk to Jeong-su as well.

366
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,266
Does this mean I can eat from both?

367
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,187
I guess so.

368
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,064
I'll have some pizza.

369
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,942
And these too.

370
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,902
How did you know I eat well

371
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,529
and save this seat for me?

372
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,532
I was one of the last people to sit down.

373
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,867
That seat happened to be vacant,

374
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,538
so I was pretty happy
to sit there next to Jun-seo.

375
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,916
Yes, let's hash it out with Jun-seo here.

376
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,586
Should we toast?

377
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,587
Okay.

378
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,714
Cheers.

379
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,007
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

380
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,049
Cheers.

381
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,300
Nice to meet you all.

382
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,677
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

383
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,845
Cheers.

384
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,573
I haven't had alcohol in ages.

385
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,490
Me too.

386
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,784
Wait, I had some recently.

387
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,704
I drank yesterday.

388
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,791
Is it good?

389
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,918
It's really good with the dipping sauce.

390
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,919
Is it steak sauce?

391
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,213
It tastes like it. It's good.

392
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,050
Dip it in the sauce. It tastes way better.

393
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,969
This is great.

394
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,264
I'll cut it for you.

395
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,727
-What?
-I'll cut it up.

396
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,936
What is it though?

397
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,188
I don't know. Barbecue?

398
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,857
Cutting meat for her too?

399
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,110
-It's automatic for him.
-Really.

400
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,195
How persistent.

401
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,614
It's charcoal barbecue.

402
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,783
Here.

403
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,954
What did you do today?

404
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,207
We were together today.

405
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,918
-With everyone.
-What did you do yesterday?

406
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,711
I was in Paradise yesterday.

407
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,129
You were in Paradise too.

408
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,885
I knew you would go.

409
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,345
-What?
-I knew you would go.

410
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:17,930
Why?

411
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,348
I just had a feeling.

412
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,935
I thought you hadn't gone.

413
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:23,852
-Why not?
-What?

414
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,812
Why not?

415
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,439
No reason.

416
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,195
Do you know who I went with?

417
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,822
Yeah, I heard.

418
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,243
What was Paradise like with another woman?

419
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,494
Another woman?

420
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,916
And it was only a day later
even though I went as well.

421
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,045
It was fun.

422
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,757
Did you have fun?

423
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,800
Yeah.

424
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,427
It was fun.

425
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,848
We swam.

426
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,641
I know. I'm jealous.

427
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,642
Right?

428
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,893
-She's listening.
-What?

429
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,020
-She's next to them.
-She's listening in.

430
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,814
-The seating arrangement is…
-What is this?

431
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,108
They're sitting really close together.

432
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,527
We swam.

433
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,279
I know. I'm jealous.

434
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,280
Right?

435
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,326
But while swimming, I thought…

436
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,244
I had a foot bath.

437
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,037
But while swimming, I thought…

438
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,289
I had a foot bath.

439
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:27,916
In herbal tea.

440
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,670
-Foot bath.
-What?

441
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,046
-It must've been nice.
-So nice.

442
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,506
Wow, it must've been great.

443
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,507
It really was.

444
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,051
It was fun.

445
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,095
It sounds like it was.

446
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,057
It's a lovers' quarrel.

447
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,226
-What?
-They're making each other jealous.

448
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,478
-Exactly.
-They're all pros.

449
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,731
Everyone's a natural flirt.

450
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,815
They really are.

451
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,483
Two natural flirts have met.

452
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,568
They're so skilled.

453
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,736
I'm jealous of them.

454
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,990
We're more farther apart
than we thought, right?

455
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,911
I feel like it's with only
the people next to you…

456
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,371
-What?
-You can only interact with them.

457
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,456
So we should drink?

458
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,043
No, I… The look in your eyes scares me.

459
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,921
He's mixing drinks over here.

460
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,088
Ding.

461
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,632
-Ding. Thank you.
-Ding.

462
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,468
She seems to overuse sound effects.

463
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,221
-"Overuse"!
-From "vroom" to "ding."

464
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,890
-"Ding."
-She acts cute a little bit.

465
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:25,933
Ding.

466
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,601
-Ding. Thank you.
-Ding.

467
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,605
You talk in a unique way.

468
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,523
Why? What's it like?

469
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,108
"What's it like?"

470
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,195
-"What's it like?"
-That sounds like Doraemon.

471
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,446
Isn't that Nobi Nobita?

472
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,615
You seem to smile a lot.

473
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,451
Last time, you smiled
when all I said was "hello."

474
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,535
I did?

475
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,954
She smiles a lot.

476
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,580
Really?

477
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,457
-You're very bright.
-Really?

478
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,335
That must really help
when you're with people.

479
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,462
I'll try acting more aloof now.

480
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,798
I'll try being coy.

481
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,132
Show us.

482
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,635
Okay, I'll try.

483
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,844
Please show us.

484
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,638
A little bit coy.

485
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,599
Should we toast?

486
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,226
She's quite the comedian.

487
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,477
Should we toast?

488
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,813
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

489
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,772
Don't drink too fast.

490
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,984
It feels like I'm trying to stop you
from doing anything out of line.

491
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,569
-It's like, "Sit still."
-"Don't!"

492
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,824
"No, don't act out."

493
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,871
What's she doing with Jun-seo next to her?

494
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,581
Why does she keep talking to Theo?

495
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,002
It looks like You-jin
is trying to make Jun-seo jealous too.

496
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,462
But if that's her plan…

497
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,589
-Isn't that the wrong strategy?
-Very wrong.

498
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,758
Especially since Jun-seo isn't that type.

499
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,676
He hates that.

500
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,052
He's not going to like that.

501
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,762
-That's a negative.
-It's the wrong plan.

502
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,222
Yes, she made a mistake.

503
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,735
-Why are you so quiet?
-Me?

504
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,362
-My stomach doesn't feel great.
-Your stomach?

505
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,364
-What?
-Still?

506
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,492
I heard you weren't feeling well
this morning.

507
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,785
Oh no.

508
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,832
That scared me.

509
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,127
-What is it?
-What?

510
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,339
Singles.

511
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,967
Please bring your boxes
from the mailbox area.

512
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,927
-What?
-What? I guess something happened.

513
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,387
-They did something.
-Yeah.

514
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,390
1 HOUR AGO

515
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,606
You'll now choose the person
you are interested in.

516
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,276
Already?

517
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,278
Suddenly? Before dinner?

518
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,656
Please go to the mailboxes one by one

519
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,410
and deliver a chocolate
to the person you like.

520
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,579
Is it to only one person?

521
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,039
Yeah, don't you think so?

522
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,958
You may make multiple selections.

523
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,377
MULTIPLE SELECTIONS ARE ALLOWED

524
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,671
Oh, my god. This is so fun.

525
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,798
Have you decided?

526
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,092
I kind of have.

527
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,676
Can I give them to everyone?

528
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,263
-This guy…
-Seriously.

529
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,723
Jeong-su.

530
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,776
ALL SELECTIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED

531
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,446
I think Dong-ho will get a lot of votes.

532
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,657
I also think Dong-ho
and Jun-seo will have the most.

533
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,576
Yeah, I agree with that.

534
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,830
Among the women, don't you think
Si-an will receive the most?

535
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,581
-Si-an? Yeah.
-Yes, I think.

536
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,167
Si-an is involved
with three people right now.

537
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,919
Theo, Jeong-su, and Jun-seo.

538
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,255
He's coming.

539
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,261
Inside these boxes

540
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,348
are the chocolates you received
from those who have interest in you.

541
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,062
Can we open them?

542
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,189
Starting with Te-hwan,

543
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,608
please take turns opening your boxes.

544
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,027
We're revealing everything here?

545
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,320
Together?

546
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,031
Can't we just look at them alone?

547
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,450
This is quite brutal.

548
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,535
It is.

549
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,080
I bet at least Ji-yeon gave him one.

550
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,290
-I think so.
-Yeah.

551
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,916
-Because of the kimchi.
-True.

552
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,459
-You're right.
-She'd be thankful.

553
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,586
-That did happen.
-Right.

554
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,753
This is quite brutal.

555
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,671
It is.

556
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,301
When I opened the box,
there were two chocolates inside.

557
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,095
I thought it was not too bad.

558
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,515
I was expecting at least three.

559
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,728
But getting two wasn't bad,
so it was fine.

560
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,522
Why was he expecting three?

561
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,566
I don't understand.

562
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,276
Te-hwan is acting way too relaxed.

563
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,779
He's trying to act relaxed,
but he doesn't look like it at all.

564
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,698
I'm so curious.

565
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,287
I have one.

566
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,749
Sure, receiving more interest
would've been great.

567
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,794
But just getting even one
made me really happy.

568
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,505
And I think I know who it's from,
so it made me even happier.

569
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,720
I was a bit worried,

570
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,181
because I tend to be pretty shy.

571
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:21,019
And I didn't make eye contact or talk
with any of the other guys that night.

572
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,940
So I figured a lot of guys
wouldn't pick me.

573
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:27,901
What?

574
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,695
I have four.

575
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,365
You're a superstar.

576
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,991
-Superstar.
-Thank you.

577
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,620
Everyone except one person picked her.

578
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,121
-That's right.
-Right.

579
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,459
I didn't expect it at all.

580
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,920
Of course, I felt good.

581
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:50,173
But I was more curious
about the person who didn't pick me.

582
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,385
I have two.

583
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,597
KOOK DONG-HO: 2 VOTES

584
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,099
I'm guessing the chocolates

585
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,644
were probably from A-rin and You-jin.

586
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,025
I have one.

587
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:09,985
BAE JI-YEON: 1 VOTE

588
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,111
Ji-yeon got one vote.

589
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,946
-It's from Jin-young.
-Did he put it in?

590
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,907
I took a helicopter there
and slipped it in.

591
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,035
I have three.

592
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,037
JANG THEO: 3 VOTES

593
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,914
He's so confident.

594
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,668
I didn't try to guess who gave them to me.

595
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,503
I already have someone in mind.

596
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,839
What others think of me isn't my concern.

597
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,091
I'm not curious, and I'm not interested.

598
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,009
Really?

599
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,427
That's so cool.

600
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,388
-He's a man.
-Goodness.

601
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,310
I have two.

602
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,440
I had two chocolates in my box.

603
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,068
I went to Paradise with Jun-seo,

604
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,405
and I talked a lot
with Dong-ho the night before.

605
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:59,492
I figured one of the two
would've given me a chocolate,

606
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,454
so I had a feeling it wouldn't be empty.

607
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,461
I have four.

608
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,633
-You're rich.
-I'm so jealous.

609
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,969
-Is it that funny to see him get four?
-I mean…

610
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,512
-What was that reaction?
-Not sure.

611
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,889
It's when you lose your mind.

612
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,932
"Four" isn't a funny word.

613
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,643
Where's the joke here?

614
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,563
-You're rich.
-I'm so jealous.

615
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,773
This is so funny.

616
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,484
-You're right. He's rich.
-He's rich.

617
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,444
I knew it would be Jun-seo.

618
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,155
Wow, Jun-seo.

619
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,867
-He's rich.
-Wow, Jun-seo.

620
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,827
Two people received four.

621
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,373
YUK JUN-SEO: 4 VOTES

622
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,667
I have one.

623
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,794
KIM HYE-JIN: 1 VOTE

624
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,962
Why did I only receive one?

625
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,840
Unbelievable. Jeez.

626
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,344
Sure. I guess it's better than nothing.

627
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:03,890
I have two.

628
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,644
I was secretly hoping

629
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,312
for a bit more than just two.

630
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:15,777
I thought I received
less chocolates than the others.

631
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,238
So maybe I need to try a bit harder.

632
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,697
That's what I was thinking.

633
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,955
I have four.

634
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,081
LEE SI-AN: 4 VOTES

635
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,833
You're rich.

636
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,509
Four.

637
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,302
-As expected.
-She's popular.

638
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,222
Everyone but one person voted for her too.

639
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,515
Who's received four?

640
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,766
-Three people.
-Si-an.

641
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,476
Si-an, A-rin…

642
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,769
-Jun-seo.
-Jun-seo.

643
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,188
Honestly, I didn't expect
A-rin to get that many.

644
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,190
What attracts them to A-rin?

645
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,900
Does her cold exterior
make them curious?

646
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,569
They're curious about her.

647
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,028
I think it's definitely better

648
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,406
to keep your mouth shut and stay quiet.

649
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,782
-It's better.
-Yeah.

650
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,410
Or just be bold like Theo.

651
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,370
He received three.

652
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,913
-Yeah.
-Right.

653
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,707
But everyone has their own charm.

654
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,919
Si-an was able to talk
with a lot of different people.

655
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,005
-And that worked for her.
-Right.

656
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,715
-A-rin is the opposite.
-She is.

657
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,886
Jun-seo looks kind of scary and fierce…

658
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,721
-Right.
-But he's actually a bit clumsy.

659
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,639
-Right.
-He has a cute side.

660
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,807
Should we toast?

661
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,101
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

662
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,812
Cheers.

663
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,356
Isn't there something we can do
to get a little closer?

664
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,983
Yeah, we're too far apart.

665
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:37,901
Exactly.

666
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,319
Well…

667
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,987
Should we play Truth or Drink?

668
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,948
Should I make a strong drink then?

669
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,701
Gosh, I've already had
a lot to drink. I'm in trouble.

670
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,038
Wait, he can't even handle alcohol.

671
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,372
You're tired already?

672
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,832
Your eyes are barely open.

673
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,631
Should we take a glass
and mix soju and beer in it?

674
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,715
A glass to chug.

675
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,133
A glass to chug?

676
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,139
Pass me the beer and soju, please.

677
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,517
She's no joke.
She keeps forcing me to drink.

678
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:15,271
I never once forced you. Open this for me.

679
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,280
It's good.

680
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,699
-You're good at mixing drinks.
-Really?

681
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,078
This will taste good.

682
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,541
So we have to tell the truth,

683
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,292
and we drink if we don't want to?

684
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,378
Exactly. Please go ahead and start.

685
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:42,423
Can I eat some of this chocolate first?

686
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,053
Is he feeling drained?

687
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,513
Their energies don't match.

688
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,848
-They don't.
-He's tired.

689
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,225
Don't you think
You-jin is trying too hard?

690
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,852
Slightly.

691
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,062
She's not genuinely enjoying herself.

692
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,523
It's like she's conscious
Jun-seo's presence

693
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,733
and it's making her behave a little…

694
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,651
Unnatural.

695
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,653
-It feels forced.
-She's overdoing it.

696
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,908
-Hey.
-Excuse me.

697
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,077
-Let's start over there.
-What's with you?

698
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,495
-A-rin?
-Yes.

699
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,289
How many people did you vote for?

700
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,459
I voted for one person today.

701
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,880
That's so cool.

702
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,641
KOOK DONG-HO

703
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,477
KIM A-RIN SELECTED KOOK DONG-HO

704
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,104
Then,

705
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,106
who was your top choice?

706
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,236
Am I being too persistent?

707
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,571
Slightly.

708
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,199
I chose Dong-ho.

709
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,451
I chose Dong-ho.

710
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,747
We talked a lot.

711
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,548
Dong-ho has a poker face.

712
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,466
Seriously.

713
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,385
Is he sad? It looks like
he had a family tragedy.

714
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,345
-Right?
-He's shy.

715
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,888
-He's just shy.
-I mean, seriously…

716
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,057
-It'd be obvious if he smiled too much.
-Yes.

717
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,728
He tried to keep his cool
but ended up being more nervous.

718
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,065
Dong-ho.

719
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,442
If you could go to Paradise,

720
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,069
who would you want to go with?

721
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,445
That's a good one.

722
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,166
I'll just drink that…

723
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,001
Come on.

724
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,503
Come on.

725
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,215
I'll just take one drink.

726
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,383
Go ahead.

727
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,057
-I think A-rin's disappointed.
-It's upsetting.

728
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,433
Isn't that a rejection?

729
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,185
From her perspective, it is.

730
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,145
She could definitely see it that way.

731
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,160
A-rin, it's your turn to ask.

732
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,496
I've been wanting to ask Jun-seo.

733
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,499
-Why did you toss me?
-Sorry?

734
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,835
Why…

735
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,295
-Why did you toss me?
-Wait…

736
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,464
Do you mind if I ask a side question?

737
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,009
Do you really think I tossed you?

738
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,176
-Yes.
-I'm very sorry.

739
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,720
-It wasn't on purpose…
-I was tossed…

740
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,557
-He's so cute.
-I didn't toss you.

741
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,767
I was trying to do something.

742
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,311
-What were you trying to do?
-It just…

743
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,646
It didn't go as planned.

744
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,565
I tried to pass you onto Te-hwan.

745
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,319
He tried to pass her while falling.

746
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,072
I wanted to pass you on.

747
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,784
I sincerely apologize again
for what happened to all three of you.

748
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,202
It's been weighing on my mind.

749
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,871
Really, I'm sorry. I apologize.

750
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,122
Okay, I accept your apology.

751
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,167
-Let's give him a hand.
-I…

752
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,169
-I'm glad we cleared that up.
-Shake hands.

753
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,754
-Sure.
-Let's shake hands.

754
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,755
With Bluetooth.

755
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,758
You have to drink.

756
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,468
Min-seol.

757
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,594
-Me?
-Min-seol.

758
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:18,222
Do you really think I did that on purpose?

759
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,099
That was so random.

760
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,145
-Well…
-Yeah?

761
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,480
This is going off track.

762
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,900
When I got pushed,
I didn't think much of it.

763
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,028
But when the next girls were bumped off,

764
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,863
you fell in with them.

765
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,531
I was pushed in by myself.

766
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:39,285
So I felt a bit upset afterwards.

767
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,495
Really?

768
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,372
You should talk this out
with them over there.

769
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,375
I wanted to tell you it wasn't on purpose.

770
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,420
-We didn't get the chance to talk.
-I get it.

771
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,882
Okay, I'm done.

772
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,592
This is so funny.

773
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,761
Jeong-su.

774
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,720
Yes?

775
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,724
Did you give me one of your chocolates?

776
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,601
If not, you don't have to answer.

777
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,895
If you did, I wanted to ask why.

778
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:11,484
There are five guys, so I thought,
"Everyone except one person gave me one."

779
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,571
So I wanted to cross them off
one by one to find out.

780
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,332
I wanted to have a talk with you

781
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,168
since we've never spoken to each other.

782
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,086
I see.

783
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,179
Then, I'll ask each person. Jun-seo.

784
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,267
Did you choose me?
If not, you don't have to answer.

785
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,977
If you did, what was the reason?

786
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,855
If you picked her, what was the reason?

787
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,315
I didn't pick you.

788
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,650
Then, you don't have to answer.

789
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,776
I didn't pick you.

790
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,486
Then, you don't have to answer.

791
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,821
I wanted to ask everyone.

792
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,489
-That hurts.
-He didn't pick her.

793
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,032
It hurts me more.

794
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,327
No, it's okay. Seriously, I'm fine.

795
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,746
She found the one.

796
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,707
My gosh, Jun-seo.

797
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,251
We found him. "I didn't pick you."

798
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,627
What on earth?

799
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,630
That was great.

800
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,007
He's totally my type.

801
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,093
My heart. My goodness!

802
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,345
That's so hilarious.

803
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,306
That was amazing.

804
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,640
I'm sorry.

805
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,267
That was great.

806
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,773
Everything about Jun-seo
has been unexpected.

807
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,818
Drunk Jun-seo was very adorable.

808
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,530
He's so hilarious and honest.

809
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:43,826
I found that side of him charming.

810
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,746
This might be too focused on me,

811
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,372
but I thought,

812
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:54,128
"This person doesn't flirt
with just everyone."

813
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,007
Min-seol.

814
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,091
The chocolate…

815
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,762
Can you tell us one person you gave it to?

816
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,930
-Just one?
-Yeah.

817
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,975
Tell us just one person.

818
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,483
Should we give her a countdown?

819
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,735
-Three, two, one.
-Three, two…

820
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,278
I gave one to Jun-seo.

821
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,452
He's been pushing this sign.
Let's join him.

822
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,912
I've done it a lot already.

823
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,379
-Min-seol.
-Yes?

824
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,883
Would you rather go to Paradise
with someone you've already gone with

825
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,969
or with someone new?

826
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,229
I'd go with the same person again.

827
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,231
I'd go with the same person again.

828
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,825
She drove the point home.

829
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,118
She was straightforward.

830
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,995
You-jin's showing
an interesting expression.

831
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,997
She's not feeling too great.

832
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,962
The person I'm still interested in

833
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,255
is Jun-seo.

834
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,465
I'd like to go to Paradise with him again.

835
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,849
I'll go next.

836
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,560
-You-jin.
-Yes?

837
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,438
If you could go to Paradise again…

838
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,064
-Yes?
-Who do you want to go with?

839
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,275
My next Paradise date?

840
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,276
Yes.

841
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,403
Should I drink instead?

842
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,657
This is difficult.

843
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,702
My next Paradise date?

844
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,496
Can we really eat these though?

845
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,123
Did you intend to…

846
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,083
What are you rustling around for?

847
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,251
You want to eat that?

848
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,634
-Three, two…
-I'll drink instead.

849
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,386
I'm thirsty.

850
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,929
That's a lot.

851
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,522
It's good. Who mixed this?

852
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,691
You mixed it yourself.

853
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,318
It's good.

854
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,112
Honestly, I was going to answer,

855
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,698
"The person I want to go
to Paradise with next time

856
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,034
is Dong-ho."

857
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,203
But he wasn't paying attention,

858
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,748
and he was having a cheerful conversation
with A-rin the whole time.

859
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,458
At that moment,

860
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:42,254
I suddenly didn't want to say
I wanted to go to Paradise with him.

861
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,216
So I ended up choosing to drink instead.

862
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,847
-You-jin.
-Yes?

863
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,974
-Seriously.
-Yeah?

864
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,727
Let's say you get to go to Paradise.

865
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,686
-Okay.
-Right?

866
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,398
Would your first choice be Theo?

867
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,483
Is he your top pick?

868
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,693
Is Theo my top pick?

869
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,239
We both immediately knew the answer.

870
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,240
No.

871
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,037
I thought Theo would be your top pick.

872
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,455
-Really?
-Really?

873
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,582
We actually talked before you arrived.

874
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,668
-We both…
-So I already knew.

875
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:21,669
He was tricked.

876
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,421
Was it because we talked a lot?

877
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,714
That question really surprised me.

878
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,300
Theo? All of a sudden?

879
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:32,638
We're not too romantically interested
in each other,

880
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,766
so we talked a lot
while comfortably joking around.

881
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,643
I wasn't really sure what to think.

882
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,063
-I guess I'm not good at reading people.
-What?

883
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:41,981
What?

884
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:42,898
Nothing.

885
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,358
What did you say?

886
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,402
I think that was bothering him.

887
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,570
Exactly.

888
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,239
-It wasn't like that at all.
-Yeah, he totally misread it.

889
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,452
Jun-seo.

890
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,871
-I have a question for you.
-Okay.

891
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,541
Would you prefer to go to Paradise
with someone you've already gone with

892
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,750
or with someone new?

893
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,086
Do I have to pick one?

894
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,045
Yes.

895
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,719
It means, "Will you go with me?"

896
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,929
-Min-seol is so cool today.
-Yeah.

897
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:14,930
So bold.

898
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,307
Totally.

899
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,522
With someone new.

900
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,649
With someone new.

901
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,157
My goodness.

902
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,992
This also includes You-jin.

903
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,328
With someone new.

904
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,874
This is fun.

905
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,587
I'm bad at controlling
my facial expressions.

906
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,466
I don't even remember
what face I made then.

907
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,725
Te-hwan.

908
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,686
How many people
did you give chocolates to?

909
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,230
Three people.

910
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,983
I haven't heard
such a quick answer in a while.

911
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,194
It came right out.

912
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,199
Then, Te-hwan,

913
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,493
who's your second choice?

914
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,536
Second choice?

915
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,828
Second choice?

916
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,414
You're asking
about his second choice, not first?

917
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,712
Isn't it weird to answer this?

918
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,589
The person he picks won't feel great.

919
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,840
That's true.

920
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,759
Si-an.

921
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,177
Yes?

922
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,555
-Si-an is my second choice.
-Oh, it's me.

923
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,431
Please focus.

924
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,601
Is that a good thing? Okay, nice.

925
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:45,980
What?

926
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,774
-This is when you should take a drink.
-I know, right?

927
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,526
-Yeah, he should've taken a drink.
-Right.

928
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,569
Hearing that is…

929
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,113
He answered
and still drank alcohol anyway.

930
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,115
Why not drink the penalty drink then?

931
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,661
Te-hwan.

932
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,414
Choose someone to go to Paradise.

933
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,083
-Who he wants to go with?
-Who I want to go with?

934
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,210
I choose Ji-yeon.

935
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,253
I choose Ji-yeon.

936
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:18,846
Amazing.

937
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,021
Since I came to Inferno,
Ji-yeon was the only one

938
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,608
who made a good first impression on me.

939
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,194
So Ji-yeon, would you go
to Paradise with me if I asked you?

940
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,782
-Right away?
-What on earth?

941
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,783
Out of nowhere.

942
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,620
-It just got intense.
-He didn't back out.

943
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,623
So Ji-yeon, would you go
to Paradise with me if I asked you?

944
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,840
I'd go too.

945
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,891
-The kimchi connected them.
-Exactly.

946
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,394
Doesn't Te-hwan act like
an incorrectly programmed robot?

947
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,438
It's kind of cute.

948
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,440
-There is something cute about him.
-He's cute.

949
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,983
-He's a little awkward.
-Yeah.

950
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,993
Jeong-su, how many people did you choose?

951
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,161
I chose four people.

952
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,501
That's understandable.

953
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,349
I chose Si-an,

954
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,435
You-jin, Hye-jin, and A-rin.

955
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,646
I gave my chocolates to these four people.

956
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,149
KIM JEONG-SU SELECTED LEE SI-AN,
CHUNG YOU-JIN, KIM HYE-JIN, KIM A-RIN

957
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,990
Jeong-su.

958
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:05,661
Would you like to go to Paradise
with someone you've gone with before

959
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,496
or with someone new?

960
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,549
I'd like to try going with someone new.

961
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,100
On both sides…

962
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,602
-With both of us beside you…
-Right.

963
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,980
-All right.
-That's crazy.

964
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,775
Boo.

965
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,029
If you want to go with someone new,

966
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,449
tell us who you have in mind.

967
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,039
Three in a row?

968
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,374
He can't. It's too much.

969
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,918
Right now, he has to drink instead.

970
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,881
Just one person?

971
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,551
"Just one person?"

972
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:04,928
Name two if you want.

973
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,347
No, I'll choose one. I'll go with one.

974
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,687
I choose You-jin.

975
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,147
I choose You-jin.

976
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,823
He should've drunk.

977
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:25,991
Wow, Jeong-su.

978
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,576
He's reckless today.

979
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,703
-He's losing all that goodwill.
-Yeah.

980
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,580
He's losing all of it.

981
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,002
Si-an.

982
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,966
Please announce the name

983
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,886
of your top choice.

984
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:46,887
The name of what?

985
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,265
The name of Si-an's top choice.

986
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,652
Theo.

987
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,237
I pick Theo.

988
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:04,863
Theo.

989
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,865
I pick Theo.

990
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,204
Shouldn't you drink to that?

991
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,665
You're her top choice,
so you should be happy.

992
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:18,043
You're good at stirring things up.

993
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,169
No.

994
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,255
It would be romantic and nice.

995
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,931
-Is it just me or…
-Theo didn't do anything and still won.

996
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,392
Jeong-su's answers were the issue.

997
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,477
After all that…

998
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,396
-Si-an didn't look happy.
-Three-hit combo.

999
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,607
The same goes for Hye-jin.
Her expression wasn't great either.

1000
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,110
Can their feelings change that quickly?

1001
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,028
-Because of his answers?
-Of course.

1002
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,071
Completely.

1003
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,991
Of course. Jeong-su said
You-jin was his choice.

1004
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,742
So choosing Jeong-su now would be weird.

1005
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,868
-It's very weird.
-Exactly.

1006
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,664
Now, Jeong-su's only gained
You-jin's interest,

1007
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,416
but he's lost everyone else's.

1008
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,293
I don't think he won You-jin over either.

1009
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,587
Honestly, he didn't.

1010
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,171
Then, that's the worst.

1011
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,965
I keep thinking this campfire

1012
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,009
was a bit unnecessary.

1013
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,176
I know, right?

1014
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,306
It was supposed to be something casual,
but it changed everything.

1015
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,182
This hit them really hard.

1016
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:18,687
This campfire is going to have
a massive butterfly effect.

1017
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,147
I actually think this is good.

1018
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,233
Everything might be
flipped upside down after this campfire.

1019
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,693
-Like a reset?
-Yes.

1020
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,278
The landscape has changed.

1021
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,904
-That's what this game did.
-Yeah.

1022
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,240
Should we talk first?

1023
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,701
Sure. Okay.

1024
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,037
Okay. Do you want this?

1025
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,954
What?

1026
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,123
The beer?

1027
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,000
No, the dried squid.

1028
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:42,919
This is nice.

1029
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,088
Having fun?

1030
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,424
-Yes, it's great.
-Okay. I see.

1031
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,178
-Things aren't great at all right now.
-Nope.

1032
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,346
He's in trouble.

1033
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,940
I just wanted to talk.

1034
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:07,069
I haven't thought of
what to talk about yet.

1035
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,036
I guess you had fun in Paradise yesterday.

1036
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,455
Paradise? Yeah, it was fun.

1037
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,040
It was really…

1038
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,000
It felt somewhat new.

1039
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,797
How about you? How was Paradise yesterday?

1040
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,798
I had fun too.

1041
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:28,799
You did?

1042
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,426
Just fun? That's it?

1043
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,221
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1044
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,227
I think that's how it was for me.

1045
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,062
Yeah.

1046
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,232
So you want to go to Paradise
with someone new?

1047
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,443
But that was…

1048
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:55,075
I was just trying…

1049
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,535
not to make you uncomfortable.

1050
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,577
It was…

1051
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,164
It was my way of trying to be considerate.

1052
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,124
Really?

1053
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,458
Yeah.

1054
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,044
It's still early, so…

1055
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,382
You thought if you chose me
in front of everyone…

1056
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,175
-Right.
-That would make me uncomfortable.

1057
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,677
So you were being considerate?

1058
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,470
So…

1059
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,014
Yeah.

1060
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,474
I thought singling you out…

1061
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,645
would take away your chances too.

1062
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:30,235
Of course, there are people
I haven't really talked to yet either.

1063
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,028
So having conversations

1064
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,991
and going with your heart
is the right thing.

1065
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,284
If you lie about that…

1066
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,243
Right.

1067
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:42,330
That wouldn't be right.

1068
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,293
So that was why.

1069
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,463
Okay.

1070
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,884
Trying to explain this
almost feels like making excuses.

1071
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,596
The thing is

1072
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,725
it's only been a few days since we've met.

1073
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:02,642
-Right.
-So…

1074
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,603
I kind of want to check.

1075
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,938
To see if what I'm feeling…

1076
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,775
If it is genuine or…

1077
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,235
Or if it's just a passing feeling.

1078
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,323
I want to try and talk with others

1079
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,200
to figure things out.

1080
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,287
I don't want to put pressure on you.

1081
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,291
-But you're not.
-Right. Really?

1082
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,084
I don't feel any pressure.

1083
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,506
Right now, you're my top pick.

1084
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,217
Right now, you're my top pick.

1085
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,682
That's the worst.

1086
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,228
Exactly. Telling her
she's his top pick at the end

1087
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,771
probably did the most harm.

1088
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,523
Seriously, if you hear that,

1089
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:53,401
even if you're the top choice,
you just feel like part of some ranking.

1090
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,196
Jeong-su has broken down a bit
since the campfire.

1091
00:51:56,279 --> 00:52:00,158
He used to be so smooth.

1092
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,201
He's really broken.

1093
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,870
-Make one mistake, and you lose it.
-Right.

1094
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,081
He kept trying to fix things
and made it worse.

1095
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,166
Give me that blanket. No, sit here.

1096
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,709
I'll just move over.

1097
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,839
Where is everyone?

1098
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,715
-They all suddenly disappeared.
-Right.

1099
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,342
You two haven't talked, right?

1100
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,010
-Not once.
-This is the first time.

1101
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,887
-It's the very first time.
-Yeah.

1102
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,931
Earlier, when we were eating…

1103
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,642
-You remembered my name.
-Right.

1104
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:26,852
I was kind of touched.

1105
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,019
-Really?
-Yeah.

1106
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,145
EARLIER TODAY DURING LUNCH

1107
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,689
What's your name?

1108
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:31,690
It's Te-hwan.

1109
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,275
Te-hwan? Do you know my name?

1110
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,276
Min-seo.

1111
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,652
-It's Min-seol.
-Min-seol.

1112
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:36,695
How about my name?

1113
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,572
Bae Ji-yeon.

1114
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,074
That's right!

1115
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,534
What's your last name?

1116
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:45,620
Thanks.

1117
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,582
I think I should go.

1118
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,499
-No.
-No.

1119
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,792
-Stay.
-Wait until they come.

1120
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,669
I don't think anyone will be back.

1121
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,172
You two can go.

1122
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,842
Really? Aren't you going to be lonely?

1123
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,176
I'll go too when you leave.

1124
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,678
-Okay.
-Let's go.

1125
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,221
-Should we go and talk?
-Yeah.

1126
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,560
I'll lead the way.

1127
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,477
Okay.

1128
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,107
Ta-da. This is my bed.

1129
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,984
-Should we sit like this?
-Yeah.

1130
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,655
Talking like this all of a sudden
feels a bit awkward.

1131
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,575
Still, I wanted to chat with you.

1132
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,787
Earlier in the cafeteria,
things were kind of hectic.

1133
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,415
-Yeah, it was.
-Yeah.

1134
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,542
When you first came in,

1135
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:37,464
I was wondering
why you were left alone on Inferno.

1136
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,090
That crossed my mind.

1137
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,636
I asked you, and you said you were alone.

1138
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,012
It didn't make sense.

1139
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,055
But anyway,

1140
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:48,516
I hoped you'd sit next to me.

1141
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,435
But you sat one seat away.

1142
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,109
Did that bother you?

1143
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,444
-Yes, a little.
-A little?

1144
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,112
-For no reason?
-Yeah.

1145
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:06,534
Until now, there wasn't anyone
that made me want to try to talk to them.

1146
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,535
So…

1147
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,205
When I was thinking what to do…

1148
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,998
-Really?
-You showed up.

1149
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,042
-Did the world brighten up?
-Yeah.

1150
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,585
Really?

1151
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,920
-Really?
-Yeah.

1152
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,797
-So right now…
-That's nice of you.

1153
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,882
I'm pretty happy.

1154
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,884
How adorable.

1155
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,138
They're giving me butterflies.

1156
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,015
Goodness, these two.

1157
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,392
What's your type?

1158
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,185
-My type?
-Yeah.

1159
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,020
I like people who are affectionate.

1160
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,188
-I see.
-Yeah, affectionate.

1161
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:38,817
Rather than someone who's cold and stoic,

1162
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,194
I like people
who express their feelings a lot.

1163
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:42,153
What about looks?

1164
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,113
For looks…

1165
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:48,910
Someone who has
kind of a Siberian husky vibe?

1166
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,747
I think you give off that vibe a bit.

1167
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,957
-Really?
-Yeah.

1168
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,002
You have a bit of a fierce look.

1169
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,253
Yeah.

1170
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,172
You don't exactly have a gentle look.

1171
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,507
-Really? But…
-Yeah.

1172
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,968
A lot of people do say I look gentle.

1173
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,094
-Really?
-Yeah.

1174
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,345
-Really? Hold on.
-Yeah.

1175
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:08,888
Hold on.

1176
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,894
Wait.

1177
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,021
Because of your dimples…

1178
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,439
-Yeah?
-You look kinder. Smile.

1179
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,356
-Really?
-Yeah.

1180
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,316
You look so kind when you smile.

1181
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,403
-Do I look mean if I don't?
-If you don't, you look cold.

1182
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,780
Yeah, when you smile,

1183
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,283
your expression totally softens.

1184
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,244
Don't smile like that.

1185
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,162
Why not?

1186
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,413
Don't show that killer smile.

1187
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,539
Why not?

1188
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,416
Why are you showing off your killer smile?

1189
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,792
It's making me shy.

1190
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,466
I'm feeling embarrassed.

1191
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,717
My hair's all messy.

1192
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,843
I'm embarrassed.

1193
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,762
-But it looks nice.
-Really?

1194
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,099
My goodness.

1195
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,809
This is crazy.

1196
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,813
-How exciting.
-I hope they go to Paradise together.

1197
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,190
-Right?
-Yeah.

1198
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,941
It turns out Te-hwan's a capable guy.

1199
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,194
I guess there hadn't been
anyone he wanted to talk to.

1200
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,987
It was true when he said

1201
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,448
there wasn't anyone
he wanted to spend energy on.

1202
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:13,161
I thought Te-hwan was really awkward,
but he's actually so smooth.

1203
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,288
The words flowed naturally
since it's genuine.

1204
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,456
-Seriously.
-That's true.

1205
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,666
I didn't realize Ji-yeon was this cute.

1206
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,709
Yeah.

1207
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,377
I found myself being drawn too.

1208
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,588
-Ji-yeon is my top pick right now.
-Right?

1209
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,090
You'll have to line up behind me.

1210
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,591
I have to go back. I'm second.

1211
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,343
-Second and third.
-I'm second.

1212
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,178
I love this couple.

1213
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,221
I'm so curious.

1214
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,599
Wait, everyone's leaving.

1215
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,103
-Yes?
-You look good together.

1216
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,437
Does it? Do we look…

1217
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,648
You're so greedy.

1218
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,149
Seriously.

1219
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,609
-Quick.
-Both of us at once.

1220
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,445
Who's going to
take me away to chat? Hurry up.

1221
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,906
I've already had my turn.

1222
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:55,787
You're very unique.

1223
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,749
I thought you were the most ordinary,
but you seem the most unique.

1224
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,584
Why? What part of me?

1225
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,628
-We went to Paradise on the first day.
-Right.

1226
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,673
There's a lot more to her than I've seen.

1227
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,924
Really?

1228
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,177
I think it was
because it was the first day.

1229
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,138
Wait, is that a negative thing?

1230
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,597
I only saw your cool side.

1231
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,598
-Really?
-Yeah.

1232
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:19,853
Today, I started to like you more
after seeing your mischievous side.

1233
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:20,770
Really?

1234
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,981
You have a bit of a villain vibe.

1235
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,442
You seem to like playful troublemakers.

1236
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,818
I like teasing people.

1237
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,486
That's the opposite of me.

1238
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,323
But honestly, I didn't tease anyone today.

1239
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,783
-See?
-Is this the problem?

1240
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,077
-This is teasing too.
-That's true.

1241
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:40,665
As the days go by,
everyone's true colors start to show.

1242
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,625
That's true.

1243
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:47,297
My original plan was to act cool and coy.

1244
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,383
From day one, I wasn't…

1245
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,676
-I wasn't?
-What?

1246
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,137
You weren't cool and coy.
You laughed so much.

1247
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,096
Not at all.

1248
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,681
It's impossible.

1249
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,809
Where are the drinks?
Let's take the ones over here.

1250
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,439
There was one I wanted earlier.

1251
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,941
We're just grabbing some drinks.

1252
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,944
Bring the bottle opener too.

1253
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,571
Where are you going?

1254
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,452
We've split up like this.
Two guys here. Two girls there.

1255
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,998
-Are they going off to talk together?
-Do you two have to go then?

1256
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,875
I don't think so.

1257
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,877
They're just doing whatever they want.

1258
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,546
-I need to go to the restroom.
-Okay.

1259
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,631
With alcohol?

1260
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,633
I need to use the restroom.

1261
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,302
With alcohol?

1262
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,387
Is he okay?

1263
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,770
It's time to chat.

1264
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,439
While some are talking with two guys…

1265
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,442
-They will…
-Seriously.

1266
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,403
Excuse me. Mind if I join you?

1267
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,113
-Not at all.
-We don't.

1268
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,074
Did you excuse yourself for them?

1269
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:56,991
-What?
-You left?

1270
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,159
I had nothing to say.

1271
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,953
I was about to say we needed drinks.

1272
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,246
I just grabbed anything.

1273
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,163
Soju?

1274
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,040
What did I grab though?

1275
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,125
Incredible.

1276
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,627
Are you here to cheer us up?

1277
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,545
Right?

1278
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,799
Did we look lonely from behind just then?

1279
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,552
It was actually hard being there.

1280
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,888
Are those two just close friends?

1281
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,641
No, I think
they're feeling each other out.

1282
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:22,809
Goodness.

1283
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,019
They said before nothing was
going on between them.

1284
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,438
That'll change
now that I'm out of the picture.

1285
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:28,648
I see.

1286
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:32,318
-All right. I wish them luck.
-Everyone's so bold.

1287
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,945
I first went to Paradise with You-jin.

1288
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,321
-We know.
-Right.

1289
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,157
I went with her,
but I couldn't quite read her at first.

1290
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,075
Her personality?

1291
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,369
I wasn't sure
if it was an act or her real self.

1292
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:42,870
But after a few drinks…

1293
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,456
Yeah, I feel like
I saw a different side of her.

1294
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,211
After some drinks,
don't you think you seem closer

1295
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,213
to your true self?

1296
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,465
-True.
-Right.

1297
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,135
So my curiosity has faded a bit now.

1298
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,095
-It faded?
-Yeah.

1299
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,098
I see.

1300
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,476
When Jun-seo told us

1301
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,271
that he thinks he knows
everything about her now

1302
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,898
and he's not curious about her anymore,

1303
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,568
I thought he's certain about me.
I mean, not me.

1304
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,613
I thought he's certain about himself.

1305
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:18,573
We talked about that.

1306
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:22,118
You said you wanted to go to Paradise
with someone new. Who is it?

1307
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,704
You're asking that now?

1308
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,622
-Yeah.
-Why not?

1309
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,081
-Right.
-Earlier was a game.

1310
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,458
-Cheers.
-Now, it's time…

1311
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,877
-It's time for honesty.
-Let's take a drink.

1312
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,256
I have a few in mind.

1313
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,424
-I'd go with them.
-Who?

1314
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,176
-I'm genuinely curious.
-Right.

1315
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,636
-That's normal.
-I'm curious too.

1316
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,970
I'm curious about people too.

1317
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,013
-Right.
-We all are.

1318
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,557
I had such a fun
and relaxing time with you.

1319
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,142
-Yeah.
-I'd want to go again.

1320
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,769
I even gave you my chocolate.

1321
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,271
Are you suddenly being honest?

1322
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,481
Gosh, should I leave?

1323
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,107
No, don't go.

1324
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,359
-But…
-No, don't go.

1325
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,777
I wasn't finished yet.

1326
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,861
Okay.

1327
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,488
What else?

1328
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,822
-What?
-What else?

1329
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,200
-That's all.
-Really?

1330
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,285
That's all I'll say for now.

1331
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,703
-"All I'll say for now."
-Yes.

1332
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,455
It's no fun if I reveal too much.

1333
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,248
Okay.

1334
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,250
People say…

1335
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,960
when you don't know what's going on,

1336
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,630
that's what can drive you crazy.

1337
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,299
He really makes it hard on you.

1338
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:22,679
Gosh.

1339
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,347
That's adorable.

1340
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,682
-She fell for him.
-Definitely.

1341
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,725
She's so honest about her feelings.

1342
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,936
Who do you want to go with?

1343
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,356
I usually focus on just one person.

1344
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:34,649
-Really?
-Yeah.

1345
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,609
I put my energy into only one person.

1346
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,946
So you know I went with Jeong-su.

1347
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:40,905
Yeah.

1348
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:44,033
-And I liked it. It was good.
-Yeah.

1349
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,411
But after watching him…

1350
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,787
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1351
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,958
He has a way of making things confusing.

1352
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,543
-He's like that.
-Jeong-su?

1353
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:56,295
I'm not into people like that.

1354
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:01,926
I'm not into people who are nice
to everyone and make things unclear.

1355
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:02,844
I see.

1356
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:06,973
I don't like that, so I changed my mind.

1357
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,558
So you're over him?

1358
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:10,643
Yeah. Goodbye.

1359
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,354
I'm really…

1360
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,356
certain.

1361
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,108
-Really?
-Yeah.

1362
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,609
-I see.
-It's understandable.

1363
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,654
There's still plenty of time.

1364
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,702
The campfire was the worst for Jeong-su.

1365
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,746
I doubt he'll want to do it again.

1366
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,082
The linguist learns the alien language…

1367
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,083
Okay.

1368
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,670
And they start to think like them.

1369
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:41,340
They explore the unknown
in the macroscopic…

1370
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,385
-And microscopic worlds.
-Yeah, they're completely different.

1371
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:47,221
Right, the principles
for both worlds are different.

1372
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,139
Yeah.

1373
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:51,517
That's why the unknown is always…

1374
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,644
So, honestly…

1375
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,522
What were you two up to?

1376
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,982
Si-an, come chat with Theo.

1377
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,275
Come here.

1378
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,902
-I'll leave.
-Don't order me around.

1379
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,653
You two should talk.

1380
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:09,869
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1381
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:17,835
This is exhausting.

1382
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,839
I drank everything to not answer.
I didn't give…

1383
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,675
-What did you say?
-I didn't…

1384
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,219
I didn't give a clear answer.

1385
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,054
You didn't give an answer during the game?

1386
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,935
Is there anyone
you're still curious about?

1387
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:36,687
You met new people today.

1388
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,231
No one.

1389
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,907
I'm not interested in knowing
who gave me the chocolates.

1390
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,117
-Why not?
-I got three.

1391
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,662
What matters is who I'm interested in.

1392
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,792
I knew it. That is so like you.

1393
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,586
I think I get you now.

1394
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,046
-You understand me?
-Yeah.

1395
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,214
What am I like?

1396
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:06,050
If it's not your business, you don't care.

1397
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:07,677
I do care.

1398
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:11,180
But priorities are important.

1399
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,390
I see.

1400
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,391
Right?

1401
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,649
-What is it?
-What?

1402
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,903
-After coming back from Paradise…
-Right.

1403
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,071
What about it?

1404
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,365
It's just…

1405
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,367
There's a lot on your mind now?

1406
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,326
Yeah, a little.

1407
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,244
About what?

1408
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,913
I don't know. I have no idea.

1409
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,125
But after going to Paradise,

1410
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:42,336
something definitely feels different.

1411
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,050
I like people who are straightforward.

1412
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,093
Yeah.

1413
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:52,263
But everyone opens up at their own pace.

1414
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:53,180
Yeah.

1415
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,516
When I'm into someone,

1416
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,271
I always tend to open up completely
and show everything about myself.

1417
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,356
But…

1418
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,445
you might be more guarded,
and I opened up a lot more.

1419
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,821
Right.

1420
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,698
So it could've made you uncomfortable.

1421
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,702
I started to wonder
if I came on too strong.

1422
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,663
So I thought…

1423
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,876
maybe I got too ahead of myself?

1424
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,461
I was concerned about that.

1425
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:29,133
That's actually why I thought…

1426
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:35,306
"Is he really interested in me?"
And it made me confused.

1427
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,266
Because you kept joking.

1428
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:39,894
I was a bit…

1429
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:44,732
Since you kept joking around,

1430
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:49,153
I wondered at times
if you genuinely liked me or not.

1431
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:55,284
I may be all about doing things my way,
but I do follow a rule.

1432
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,244
Don't mess with people's feelings.

1433
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,497
I don't want to be hurt by others,

1434
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,708
so that's why I don't want to hurt others.

1435
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,754
Even someone as confident as me

1436
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:08,965
has their own worries.

1437
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,759
"If they get too comfortable,

1438
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:14,679
will they get bored
and take me for granted?"

1439
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,806
I always worry about that.

1440
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,601
If that's the case,
then it's beyond my control.

1441
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,562
I can just do my best.

1442
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,360
That's admirable.

1443
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:33,948
After only seeing Theo's mischievous side,

1444
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,742
we now see his serious side,
and it's pretty attractive.

1445
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,953
It's an unexpected charm.

1446
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:39,870
I'm learning too.

1447
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,205
-Totally.
-It's pretty cool.

1448
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,126
That long skirt suits you well.

1449
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,628
-I wore a long skirt.
-It suits your tall height.

1450
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,839
I wore this on my date with Jun-seo.

1451
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,048
-Who?
-Jun-seo.

1452
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,633
I see. Was it fun?

1453
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,511
-I'm so jealous.
-The dessert date.

1454
01:06:56,971 --> 01:07:00,182
I was a little nervous
when you left with Jun-seo.

1455
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,059
-You were?
-My Jun-seo.

1456
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:05,688
-Not "My Si-an"?
-My Jun-seo.

1457
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:07,982
"Don't steal him from me."

1458
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,401
Jun-seo's great though.

1459
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,404
But after talking with him,

1460
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,282
I realized he's really funny.

1461
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,658
-Right?
-Yeah.

1462
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,327
I wanted to have that date with him.

1463
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,462
I'm really happy right now.

1464
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:31,380
It looks that way.

1465
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:33,299
Because you're here.

1466
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,765
Whether I meant Jun-seo or you,
you can decide for yourself.

1467
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,808
Right.

1468
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,690
How should I put this?

1469
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:52,151
Let's say there's a room in my heart.

1470
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,528
Si-an walked in,

1471
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:57,198
but I locked the door
so no one else could get in.

1472
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:58,824
-That's great.
-Right.

1473
01:07:58,908 --> 01:07:59,742
Yeah.

1474
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,828
Hasn't our perception of Theo
totally changed since the beginning?

1475
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,663
Well, I think it's over.

1476
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,873
-Already?
-Yes.

1477
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:08,417
To me, Theo seemed like a healer.

1478
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:12,088
-Right.
-You could tell Si-an was being comforted.

1479
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:14,715
Aren't you cold?

1480
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,383
I don't think I'm cold anymore.

1481
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:18,677
Hey, cheers.

1482
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:20,304
Cheers.

1483
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,356
Do you know who voted for you?

1484
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,610
Well, I know one answer for sure.

1485
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:39,240
Were you frustrated
when you picked me but I didn't answer?

1486
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,075
-Yes.
-He brought it up.

1487
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:41,992
Very.

1488
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,160
-Very frustrated.
-Yes.

1489
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,453
It was upsetting.

1490
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,873
I figured there was a reason for it.

1491
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:53,379
It was kind of hard to answer
in front of the others.

1492
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,296
Why?

1493
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,759
It was too personal,
and I would've been too long-winded.

1494
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:02,012
But anyway, it wasn't your final decision.

1495
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,848
-It's just who you're interested in.
-Right.

1496
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,182
It's to get to know each other.

1497
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:07,935
-I thought I'd shown my interest.
-Right.

1498
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,271
But you just cut me off right away,

1499
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:11,689
so I was a little hurt.

1500
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:13,023
Right.

1501
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:16,026
In the first round,
I thought you weren't interested in me.

1502
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,319
You thought I didn't like you?

1503
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,989
Yes, so I gave up and cleared my mind.

1504
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,992
And I started to become curious
about someone else.

1505
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,076
You-jin?

1506
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:26,495
-Yes.
-You talked a lot with her.

1507
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,330
So you put in two chocolates today?

1508
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,166
Yes, I put in two.

1509
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,627
I kept dodging the question,

1510
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:38,924
because having feelings
for both of you made me flustered.

1511
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,593
-It was confusing.
-It's hard to handle.

1512
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,345
I needed to sort that out first.

1513
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,807
You want to talk a bit more
with You-jin tonight, right?

1514
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,101
Because you want to know more.

1515
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:52,396
No.

1516
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:54,106
-No, I…
-Be honest.

1517
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,774
Honestly, I'm okay.

1518
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,821
Starting from today,
I'd like to know more about you.

1519
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,908
After the campfire,

1520
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,702
my interest in You-jin faded a lot,

1521
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,913
and I'm more curious about A-rin now.

1522
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,420
I'll pass by quick to the bathroom.

1523
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:24,053
I feel bad for You-jin.

1524
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:27,014
All the guys who said they liked You-jin
have now backed off.

1525
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:28,224
They've all left.

1526
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,270
I'll get on in that direction.

1527
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:39,485
She's on the swing.

1528
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:41,654
What was that?

1529
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:42,863
What? Was that a head?

1530
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,907
-She's on the swing alone?
-What's happening?

1531
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,158
Seriously?

1532
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,701
-What's she doing?
-The swing?

1533
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,165
She's on the swing.

1534
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:00,673
Is she okay? Is she all right?

1535
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:01,590
What?

1536
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:02,967
Who is that?

1537
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,052
I can only see her back.

1538
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,765
This is so fun.

1539
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:16,897
This is so fun.

1540
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,233
She's swinging really well.

1541
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,361
-She's swinging alone.
-Oh no.

1542
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,445
It's kind of eerie.

1543
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:24,530
Right?

1544
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,157
I don't think she should be
doing that at this time.

1545
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,952
With all that hair flying around at night,
it's kind of scary.

1546
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:31,370
-No.
-Goodness.

1547
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:32,454
This is scary.

1548
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,622
Stop.

1549
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,167
This is so fun.

1550
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,461
She's swinging really well.

1551
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,197
I thought I needed to talk with Jun-seo

1552
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:10,367
to properly figure out my feelings.

1553
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,244
But I wasn't able to.

1554
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,080
It's not that I didn't want to.
I couldn't.

1555
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,957
I felt like

1556
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:21,670
Jun-seo didn't seem interested
in talking with me.

1557
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:24,381
It didn't feel right to go up to him

1558
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:29,720
and ask if he wanted to talk again.

1559
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:34,099
So if I get another chance
to go to Paradise,

1560
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:38,312
I think I'll go with Dong-ho right away.

1561
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:41,315
But he's no longer interested.

1562
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:44,360
The biggest victims of this campfire…

1563
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,778
-Two people.
-Jeong-su and…

1564
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,030
I don't think it's even Jeong-su.
It's just You-jin.

1565
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,074
You-jin seems to be the biggest loser.

1566
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:51,825
This is so…

1567
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:55,704
But don't you think she was on the swing
hoping someone would come up

1568
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,623
and ask her what she's doing there alone?

1569
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,833
Maybe one of the guys or whoever?

1570
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,795
She was trying to get people's attention.

1571
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,506
But Jun-seo hates that kind of behavior.

1572
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:06,423
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

1573
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:09,551
So this is kind of sad.

1574
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,761
Seriously, this is…

1575
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,472
It's beyond recovery.

1576
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,100
Wait, no. It's only the third day.

1577
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:18,352
-And someone new could join.
-Right.

1578
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:19,436
A new person?

1579
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,354
-Yeah.
-Yes.

1580
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:22,773
-That can change things.
-She has another chance.

1581
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:25,859
-And Dong-ho didn't see her on the swing.
-That's a relief.

1582
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,277
-He didn't?
-That's such a relief.

1583
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:30,072
-He didn't, so there's still hope.
-Okay.

1584
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:33,534
I think anyone who saw her
on that swing gave up on her.

1585
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:34,868
But a new day will come.

1586
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,495
Yes, it will be a new day.

1587
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,955
Let's go, You-jin.

1588
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,977
What could it be?

1589
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,438
What? Did everything get reset yesterday?

1590
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,397
It's just…

1591
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,233
I originally liked Jeong-su more.

1592
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:09,403
But something's changed.

1593
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:12,156
-Theo?
-Yeah, Theo.

1594
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,576
In these ambiguous circumstances,

1595
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:17,995
when someone gives you certainty,

1596
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,164
you tend to lean toward them.

1597
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,123
-Totally.
-Yeah.

1598
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:26,628
When everyone is being so vague…

1599
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,546
You're right.

1600
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:29,756
I don't know.

1601
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,801
You picked Jun-seo
and talked with him yesterday.

1602
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,761
Don't you want to go to Paradise with him?

1603
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:38,807
I do. To be honest,
I voted for Jun-seo too.

1604
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:40,350
I thought about it though.

1605
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,728
I'm not sure if it's because I like him…

1606
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:43,645
You're unsure.

1607
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:47,232
Or if I want to go to Paradise with him.

1608
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:50,944
-You have more feelings for Theo?
-That's right.

1609
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:55,199
How was it talking with Si-an yesterday?

1610
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:57,951
Talking with Si-an? She's very easygoing.

1611
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,537
It was surprising,

1612
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,332
because I thought she'd be
the complete opposite.

1613
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,167
-Complete opposite?
-Yes.

1614
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:09,880
But she was more easygoing than I thought.

1615
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:13,800
I want to talk to her more.

1616
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,055
-How about you?
-Si-an is charming.

1617
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:19,598
-Yes.
-I'm interested in her too.

1618
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,558
-You too?
-Yes.

1619
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:24,269
Si-an received four chocolates yesterday.

1620
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,230
-Right.
-She's popular.

1621
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,025
Two from us and…

1622
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:31,443
Wait, there's five of us.

1623
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,278
Except for one person,
we all gave her one.

1624
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,488
I see.

1625
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,373
I was going to wear my sunglasses.

1626
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:47,292
But they're in Jun-seo's bag.

1627
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,797
I should go and ask him
for them during breakfast, right?

1628
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,882
You've found an excuse to talk to him.

1629
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,885
It wasn't intentional.

1630
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:58,762
-You planned it.
-She did.

1631
01:15:58,845 --> 01:16:00,222
No, I didn't.

1632
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:03,517
My bag was so full
when we came back from Paradise.

1633
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,477
To be honest, it was intentional.

1634
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:09,022
I wanted to create an excuse to talk.

1635
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,276
How embarrassing.
I'll have to go talk to him now.

1636
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,820
You can use that as a reason
to talk to him more.

1637
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:18,031
Oh my.

1638
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:23,036
Ladies. Please head to Paradise now.

1639
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:23,954
-What?
-What?

1640
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:25,497
What?

1641
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:28,125
Please head to Paradise now.

1642
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:29,042
What?

1643
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,422
-What?
-Paradise?

1644
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,007
-All of them?
-Everyone?

1645
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,049
Why?

1646
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,385
Everyone?

1647
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,469
Paradise?

1648
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,013
What?

1649
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,474
They're truly turning this place
into an inferno.

1650
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:47,102
-Why?
-Hold on.

1651
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:48,353
I think someone new is there.

1652
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,439
There must be
a new person there by themselves.

1653
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,609
-Just one man?
-One man.

1654
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:54,943
This is giving me chills.

1655
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:59,114
That just gave me chills.

1656
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:03,910
I'm sure of it.
The game changer has arrived in Paradise.

1657
01:17:04,494 --> 01:17:07,080
A more tough and manly guy.

1658
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:09,166
I hope he's someone who's wild.

1659
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:12,002
I think it's going to be chaos now.

1660
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:16,757
You think the girls
won't be swayed, right?

1661
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,968
I totally think they will be.
It's not going to be me though.

1662
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:22,304
I won't waver no matter who comes.

1663
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:23,472
Absolutely not.

1664
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,267
That's so cute!

1665
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,895
"It's not going to be me."

1666
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:31,438
-Min-seol.
-Goodness.

1667
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:34,483
Min-seol doesn't even have to try.
She's just cute.

1668
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:36,109
-She is.
-She's naturally cute.

1669
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,069
-Yeah.
-Seriously.

1670
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,655
Wow, Paradise.

1671
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,075
You must be excited.

1672
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,743
Yeah, my first helicopter ride.

1673
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:47,454
I need sunscreen. I feel like I'll tan.

1674
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:49,665
-Want me to massage your hands?
-What?

1675
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,793
It's taking off!

1676
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:54,086
-It's taking off.
-It is.

1677
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:01,343
They must be thrilled.

1678
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:03,428
-Imagine how excited they are.
-Right. Gosh.

1679
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:06,223
What if they get there
and it's just the six of them?

1680
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:08,975
-It's like a bridal shower.
-No one's there.

1681
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,200
-It really does feel like…
-What?

1682
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,160
-It feels like paradise.
-What is it?

1683
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:30,330
The view is amazing.

1684
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:31,998
It's beautiful.

1685
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:33,875
Unbelievable.

1686
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:41,133
What's going on?

1687
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:42,134
What's happening?

1688
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:43,218
I wonder what it is.

1689
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:48,056
But there's one more chair here.

1690
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,770
So we're all expecting a man to arrive.

1691
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:55,480
-Yeah.
-Right?

1692
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,523
Yes.

1693
01:18:57,691 --> 01:19:01,820
I'm curious
about what kind of person he'll be.

1694
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,071
When will he arrive?

1695
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:05,741
-I'm curious.
-Really.

1696
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,535
Didn't Min-seol say she wasn't interested?

1697
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,064
-Hello.
-Hello.

1698
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:40,233
Hello.

1699
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:42,569
Hello.

1700
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:46,031
-Hello.
-Hello.

1701
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:52,496
Hello, my name is Hong Seong-bo.

1702
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:57,042
Based on first impressions,
people often say I look fierce.

1703
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,335
But once you talk with me,

1704
01:19:58,418 --> 01:20:01,171
you'll quickly realize
how fun and pleasant I am.

1705
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,717
I usually don't hesitate with my feelings.

1706
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,886
I naturally grow on people,

1707
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:11,097
and before you know it, we'll be dating.

1708
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:16,061
He has nice confidence.

1709
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,687
-He's cute.
-Yes.

1710
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:21,733
-Have you already fallen for him?
-Sorry.

1711
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:25,403
-Hello.
-Hello.

1712
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:28,198
What's your name?

1713
01:20:28,281 --> 01:20:30,200
I'm Hong Seong-bo.

1714
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:31,993
Hong Seong-bo?

1715
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,036
Hong Seong-bo.

1716
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,919
You have a dimple here.

1717
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,839
-Yeah, right here.
-It's a deep one.

1718
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:49,803
We've never been in your spot before.

1719
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:52,013
But everyone's eyes must be focused there.

1720
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:53,932
-The sun's already so bright.
-Right.

1721
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,559
The stares feel intense too.

1722
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,269
I could tell once I saw.

1723
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,895
Yes, it's a little embarrassing.

1724
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:02,983
Did you all eat?

1725
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:03,900
We caught fish.

1726
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,360
-Bulgogi rice bowl?
-Yes.

1727
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:06,611
"Bulgogi rice bowl"!

1728
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:09,823
-Bulgogi rice bowl?
-Yes.

1729
01:21:09,906 --> 01:21:11,157
No, we caught fish.

1730
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:12,450
You caught fish?

1731
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,618
Yes.

1732
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,288
Did you bring swimming goggles?

1733
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,539
We need those too?

1734
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:19,875
Yes, you need them to catch the fish.

1735
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:20,792
What?

1736
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,921
What?

1737
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:26,131
What is it?

1738
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,935
There's one more person?

1739
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:43,773
-There's more.
-More?

1740
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:46,234
-Look. I told you.
-There's another guy?

1741
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,319
Hello.

1742
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,948
Hello.

1743
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:54,826
-Hello.
-Hello.

1744
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,328
Hello.

1745
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:00,290
They're so different
from the people on Inferno.

1746
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:01,207
Right.

1747
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,125
Two of them?

1748
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:11,051
Hello, my name is An Jong-hoon.

1749
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,053
People say although I'm a bit curt,

1750
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:18,183
I have a bright and thoughtful side too.

1751
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:22,145
My wide shoulders
give off a trustworthy feel.

1752
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:25,607
Wow, this is…

1753
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,567
-Everyone would say he's handsome.
-Right.

1754
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:32,781
My wide shoulders
give off a trustworthy feel.

1755
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:37,953
I think my kind eyes are charming too.

1756
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:43,083
What's going on?

1757
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,253
It feels awkward, right?

1758
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:49,673
-Is it less awkward now though?
-Right.

1759
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:51,633
I'm feeling a little better.

1760
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:53,927
-I feel a little relaxed.
-It looks that way.

1761
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,930
-They're mild flavor and spicy flavor.
-Right.

1762
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:59,474
Are you both athletic?

1763
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:02,227
You'll have to play games there.

1764
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,853
-I see.
-Do you feel confident?

1765
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,230
I'll give it my all.

1766
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,481
I'm pretty confident.

1767
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:07,899
-Really?
-Yes.

1768
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:11,444
Did you play any games?

1769
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:12,570
-Yesterday.
-Yes.

1770
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:13,822
-What kind?
-What?

1771
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:14,823
What?

1772
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:17,158
-What?
-What?

1773
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,536
-What?
-What?

1774
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:21,246
-Hello.
-What's happening?

1775
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,836
-There's another guy?
-This is incredible.

1776
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:28,837
What's happening?

1777
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,131
This guy looks tough too.

1778
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:35,552
Hello.

1779
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,389
Hello. Goodness.

1780
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:40,515
What?

1781
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:42,642
Why are there so many?

1782
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:44,728
They just keep coming.

1783
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,732
-Hello.
-Hello.

1784
01:23:49,315 --> 01:23:51,276
-Hello.
-Hello.

1785
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:57,824
-What a surprise.
-There's no space now.

1786
01:23:57,907 --> 01:24:00,785
They're all so big.
It must be uncomfortable.

1787
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:05,582
Hello, my name is Kwon Ki-ha.

1788
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:08,877
In relationships, I often hear I'm caring.

1789
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:13,214
I'd say one of my strengths
is how well I take care of myself.

1790
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,593
-He's strong.
-He looks good.

1791
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:19,095
He has a cute face,
but nothing's cute about his body.

1792
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:22,015
I prefer older women.

1793
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:25,810
I find their maturity more attractive.

1794
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:28,271
But it's no fun to make her feel older.

1795
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:31,608
The charm of a younger man
is when he speaks informally.

1796
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:38,990
I find this situation so funny.

1797
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,742
What's going on?

1798
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:44,037
I seriously can't predict anything.

1799
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,956
I feel bad for the guys on Inferno now.

1800
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:53,046
-This time, it's just one Inferno…
-Gosh.

1801
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,009
I swear, this sound is driving me crazy.

1802
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:03,264
We will now begin
one-on-one conversations.

1803
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:09,395
The women will speak with each
of the three men for ten minutes.

1804
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:22,117
1 HOUR LATER

1805
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,786
1 HOUR LATER

1806
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:32,961
All of the one-on-one conversations
have ended.

1807
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:40,343
Out of these three men,

1808
01:25:40,426 --> 01:25:42,220
only one…

1809
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:48,601
will join Single's Inferno.

1810
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,061
What?

1811
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,437
What?

1812
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:53,356
-This is crazy.
-My gosh.

1813
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:55,066
-Really?
-That's crazy!

1814
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,442
This is so cruel.

1815
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:58,194
It's suddenly an audition now?

1816
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:00,613
-What?
-This is too cruel.

1817
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:05,034
The two men who are not chosen…

1818
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,663
will be eliminated immediately.

1819
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:09,581
Eliminated?

1820
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:12,041
And they will return home.

1821
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:15,295
My gosh. Oh no.

1822
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:20,341
The chosen man will be revealed.

1823
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:23,428
NEXT EPISODE

1824
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:24,721
That's amazing.

1825
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:26,014
-They're here.
-They're here.

1826
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,933
With the game changer here,

1827
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:30,685
I'm going to lose my mind.

1828
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:34,647
With the woman game changer here…

1829
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:36,441
The vibe completely changed.

1830
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,610
That's totally my type. How about you?

1831
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:40,236
You're so straightforward.

1832
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,113
I can't control myself.

1833
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,616
You need to lose someone
you like to snap out of it.

1834
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,409
Hello.

1835
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:49,329
We were curious too
about what you've been up to.

1836
01:26:49,412 --> 01:26:51,664
Come on, tell us too.

1837
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:52,999
Girls.

1838
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:54,834
I'm getting pissed.

1839
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,087
-What?
-That was so cool.

1840
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:02,217
She crushed it!

1841
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,377
