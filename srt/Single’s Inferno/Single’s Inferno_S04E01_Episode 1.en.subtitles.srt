1
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,053
Love is a cruel game of survival.

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,433
Are you confident you can win?

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,059
Are you kidding me right now?

4
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,067
I'll give it my all.

5
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,569
I'll try to get the chance to go.

6
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,028
If I do, will you come with me?

7
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,282
I'm talking right now. That's rude.

8
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,408
Come back in five minutes.

9
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,118
Or you want to come with me now?

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,870
Seriously, that was so annoying.

11
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,457
Love is an intense rush of dopamine.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,710
Hold on. Aren't you moving too fast?

13
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,086
Want me to bite you?

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,254
I just imagined it.

15
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,881
Wait.

16
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,799
I can't think straight.

17
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,845
I was still thinking
about that massage today.

18
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,181
Sorry. We forgot to bring
our wedding invitations.

19
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,016
Do I fall in love too easily?

20
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,268
I hope this doesn't make you
feel pressured.

21
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,978
But I do want you to care.

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,521
I'm a pretty piece of trash.

23
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,400
Love is about perfect timing.

24
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,779
If we'd talked sooner,
things might've been different.

25
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,572
Why are things such a mess for me?

26
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,324
There's an uninvited guest.

27
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,785
Is the game about to change?

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,454
I guess you had fun in Paradise yesterday.

29
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,164
I was waiting for you.

30
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,749
If you're curious, stay.

31
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,334
-I am curious.
-Then stay.

32
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,963
A place where you can experience
everything about love.

33
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,300
My feelings have grown,
so it's really confusing.

34
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,344
I gave you too many mixed signals.

35
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,971
It felt like I messed with one's feelings.

36
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,848
You were shutting me out earlier.

37
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,225
She is pushing me away a little.

38
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,268
Seriously, within ten days,

39
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,605
I honestly never imagined it.

40
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,528
This is the hottest inferno in the world.

41
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,321
Single's Inferno.

42
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,406
SINGLE'S INFERNO

43
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,909
HANHAE, KIM JIN-YOUNG,
HONG JIN-KYUNG, LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

44
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,035
Just as we'd anticipated.

45
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,662
My heart is racing.

46
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,414
You know, every time we do this,

47
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,958
my heart starts to race.

48
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,875
Right?

49
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,502
There's something about it…

50
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,255
Last year, Single's Inferno
was the most talked about show.

51
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,172
Right.

52
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,509
I looked into what could be
the talk of this season.

53
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:18,596
Apparently, the nights in Paradise
were hotter than any other season.

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,141
That scene of the bedroom
is bothering me a bit.

55
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,392
Weren't they in the same bed?

56
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,393
-They were.
-Yeah.

57
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,312
It's time for our country
to progress to some extent too.

58
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,814
Of course.

59
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,315
It's time for the next step.

60
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,817
But is that really progress?

61
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,361
And do we have to be the ones to do it?

62
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,321
Still, since we're at it.

63
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,657
We got a little preview earlier.

64
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,325
But when it comes to emotions,

65
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,327
they express everything so honestly.

66
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,163
They don't hide anything

67
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,582
and just show their raw emotions.

68
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,959
So I can't wait to see
how the other person

69
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,587
receives and responds to them.

70
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,144
PROFESSIONS AND AGES CANNOT BE REVEALED

71
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,708
Why are we the ones leaning forward?

72
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,460
-It's instinct.
-To look.

73
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,420
Because we need to check carefully.

74
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,306
She's so…

75
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,807
-She's beautiful.
-Beautiful.

76
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,564
Hello, my name is Lee Si-an.

77
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,400
I've constantly been in relationships.

78
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,654
But right now, I'm single,
which is a rare occasion.

79
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,239
So I applied,

80
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,200
because I wanted to experience
a fiery, passionate romance.

81
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,327
I want a whirlwind romance.

82
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,162
A really emotional one.

83
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,541
My attractive qualities
are my cat-like eyes,

84
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,252
kissable lips,

85
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,797
and my figure.

86
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,760
Up until the sixth grade,

87
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,262
I was a competitive swimmer.

88
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,889
And I still enjoy it as a hobby.

89
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,475
I think I'm a natural athlete.

90
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:33,147
Whenever I find someone attractive,
I usually approach them first.

91
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,442
I don't think I've ever failed
to get into a relationship.

92
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,487
The kind of person I want to
meet on Single's Inferno

93
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,240
is someone with a strong inner self.

94
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,118
Because he'll have to
dive into a whirlwind romance

95
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,035
with me.

96
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,815
Hello, my name is Chung You-jin.

97
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,276
I think I get asked out often.

98
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,570
At a friend's wedding,

99
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:25,241
six guys showed interest in me
all at once.

100
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,370
I've been told that I'm adorable, lovable,

101
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,790
cute, and a little quirky.

102
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,459
Someone once said

103
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,838
it was as if there were
hearts floating around me.

104
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,174
As a hobby, I enjoy freediving.

105
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:46,220
When I begin to move freely
in that silence underwater,

106
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,473
I feel like a mermaid, and I love it.

107
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,809
When I'm in front
of someone I'm attracted to,

108
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,854
I subconsciously keep sweeping my hair

109
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,024
to the side like this.

110
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,026
I'd ask, "Have you eaten?"

111
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,532
-Hello.
-Hello.

112
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,794
-Can I sit anywhere?
-Yes, you can.

113
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,551
Did you notice
how they scanned each other?

114
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,636
They can't help it.

115
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,639
Both are beautiful,
but they have different vibes.

116
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,682
-So different.
-Gosh, her cuteness.

117
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,279
My name is Kim Min-seol.

118
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,740
I have a puppy-like face.

119
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,952
So when I get close to someone,

120
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,913
I tend to show my puppy-like energy.

121
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,040
I often hear that I'm like a Maltese

122
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,085
and that I'm lovable and full of cuteness.

123
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,963
I'm definitely going to win all the games.

124
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,714
I'm quite competitive.

125
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,678
So if I need to
win the love of a guy I like,

126
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,305
I'd go after them
with fierce determination.

127
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,891
I'll dive right in without hesitation.

128
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,059
Woof, woof!

129
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,985
Hello.

130
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,822
We naturally left seats open next to us.

131
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,739
You're right.

132
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,955
Where will the guys sit when they come?

133
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,707
Right. It's something to watch out for.

134
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,624
True.

135
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,426
It's another woman.

136
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,721
-What?
-It's a woman?

137
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,014
It's a woman.

138
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,098
Another woman?

139
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,810
My name is Bae Ji-yeon.

140
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,606
I usually work out a lot,

141
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,399
so I'm confident about my figure.

142
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,986
My hobby is horseback riding.

143
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,365
The feeling of cutting through the wind
is so refreshing and enjoyable.

144
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,494
My ideal type is someone with a fit body.

145
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,788
I especially tend to look
at their shoulders.

146
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,044
I don't want to go out with anyone
who seems too calculating.

147
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,468
But why aren't the guys…

148
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,178
I know, right?

149
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,016
-There are only two seats left.
-You're right.

150
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,229
Someone's coming.

151
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,280
No way.

152
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,665
-Look at her expression.
-Her expression.

153
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,417
I love it!

154
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,253
It's so good.

155
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,299
My name is Kim Hye-jin.

156
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,593
I get asked out quite often.

157
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,347
I usually have this many messages
piled up in my inbox.

158
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,394
People say I do a lot of silly things.

159
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:25,147
Even in the street, I start dancing
if I become really excited.

160
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,026
I often hear that I'm unpredictable.

161
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,654
When I like someone,

162
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,032
I tend to stare at them intently
without realizing it.

163
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,951
They all end up
falling for me when I do that.

164
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,666
There aren't any guys here.

165
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,001
You're right.

166
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,268
Hello, my name is Kim A-rin.

167
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,104
I joined Single's Inferno,

168
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,607
because I thought I could meet

169
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,110
people who are attractive
on the inside and outside like me.

170
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,155
I think I have a surprising charm.

171
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,868
People often say I seem cold and aloof.

172
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,412
But I'm actually an easygoing person.

173
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,458
Since I was young,
I often heard I was pretty.

174
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,085
Guys frequently tell me

175
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,881
that I'm the most beautiful woman
they've ever seen.

176
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:37,345
Wow, this generation says
things like that so casually.

177
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,263
Now, this is Single's Inferno.

178
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,724
-Hello.
-Hello.

179
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,476
-Hello.
-Hello.

180
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,563
Only the farthest seat is left.

181
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:53,861
Hello.

182
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,954
The mood's not good right now.

183
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,457
Just look.

184
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,209
This is the best we've ever seen.

185
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,126
I think

186
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:14,632
all the women who have appeared
are flawlessly beautiful, so…

187
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,759
How were they able to find these people?

188
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,345
I feel like 90% of men

189
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,598
would be instantly interested
in Si-an when they first see her.

190
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,643
I also think Si-an is quite dazzling,

191
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,397
but when you look closely,
she also has very cute features

192
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,315
that make her incredibly charming.

193
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,026
But she mentioned
she would like a whirlwind romance.

194
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,985
Right.

195
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,529
I'm already feeling scared.

196
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,532
I think she'll go back and forth a lot.

197
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,699
I agree.

198
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,160
Personally, I think Si-an

199
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,162
-and Min-seol will be really popular.
-Right.

200
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:50,584
With Min-seol, her smile was so beautiful
that it really stuck with me.

201
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,670
On top of that, she has that cute charm.

202
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,587
"Woof, woof"?

203
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,591
That kind of cuteness comes off
as an endearing kind of charm.

204
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,553
Or how about You-jin?
She seems like a bright person.

205
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,388
She looks cheerful and kind.

206
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,306
People are naturally drawn to that.

207
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,018
So is it just the women on the show today?

208
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,061
Maybe.

209
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,896
-It's tough to say.
-Exactly.

210
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,982
Are they going to compete
to reach Paradise?

211
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,449
Isn't it over?

212
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,494
-In the end, it was just us women.
-Right.

213
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:27,872
What's going on?

214
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,332
I wonder what's happening.

215
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,962
It feels like we've been just left here.

216
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,549
What?

217
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,509
Someone's coming.

218
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,685
They're coming.

219
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,902
Look at those veins.

220
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,866
Her expression's so different
than it was before.

221
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,244
But there aren't any chairs.

222
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,579
There are no chairs here.

223
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,665
You're right. What's going on?

224
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,378
-Do we say hello?
-Hello.

225
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,963
Hello.

226
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,356
That startled me.

227
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,150
Greetings, singles.

228
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,697
Ladies, please stand up.

229
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,974
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

230
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,058
Right now?

231
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,644
…match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

232
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,562
Right now?

233
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,439
-From the start?
-Right away?

234
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,649
Incredible.

235
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,234
Isn't that a bit too fast?

236
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,443
All the guys aren't here.

237
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,445
-They haven't seen the others.
-I know.

238
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,281
Right now?

239
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,452
I got chills.
Seriously, I got goosebumps up to my ears.

240
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,082
I thought, "Already?
It's only been ten seconds since we met."

241
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,793
The man who came in first place,

242
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,171
please choose the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

243
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:42,923
My gosh.

244
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,843
…please choose the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

245
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,303
-First place?
-My gosh.

246
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,054
-What? First?
-First?

247
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,432
-I guess someone already won.
-I guess so.

248
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,350
Is that why his arm muscles are pumped up?

249
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,311
-He just finished his battle.
-Yeah.

250
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,938
What did he come in first in?

251
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,148
Did they play a game?

252
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,316
This is unbelievable.

253
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,284
WOMEN'S INFERNO

254
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,621
-"One hour ago"?
-They arrived an hour ago?

255
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,205
MEN'S INFERNO

256
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,540
There's a Men's Inferno too.

257
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,042
They're separated.

258
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,210
This place looks bleak already.

259
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,086
Hello, my name is Kim Te-hwan.

260
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,507
I'm full of self-love,
and I have unshakable self-confidence.

261
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,802
I've known I was handsome
ever since I was born.

262
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,345
Even in arguments,

263
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,556
people would often calm down
after just looking at my face.

264
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,683
Jeez…

265
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,103
-He's not that handsome.
-Seriously.

266
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,312
Isn't that a bit of a reach?

267
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,023
Whenever I look in the mirror,

268
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,151
I sometimes feel
like I could get lost in my own eyes.

269
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,863
I've given up
countless career opportunities

270
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,492
and prioritized love
over work throughout my life.

271
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,704
So I don't think anyone
is more serious about love than I am.

272
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,498
So he's saying he neglected his work.

273
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,378
He basically neglected work
and was busy dating instead.

274
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,630
It just shows
how sincere he is about love.

275
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,602
Hello, my name is Kook Dong-ho.

276
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,356
The parts of my appearance
I'm most confident about

277
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,609
are my tall height and camel-like eyes.

278
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,949
For first impressions,
people often say I seem a bit cold.

279
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,327
But I'm actually warm-hearted and gentle.

280
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,914
Warm-hearted and very expressive…

281
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,624
Right, two seconds later.

282
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,169
Very expressive and warm-hearted.

283
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,131
I forgot to say "I am."

284
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,135
-He's cute.
-There are people like him.

285
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,428
-He's likeable.
-Yeah.

286
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,929
-I agree.
-Kook Dong-ho.

287
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,973
-He left a lasting impression.
-He did.

288
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,893
I'll actively approach
the person I'm interested in

289
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,978
and win her over for sure.

290
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,454
My name is Jang Theo.

291
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,040
If I were to describe
my personality in one sentence,

292
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,459
it would be, "I'm like a bulldozer."

293
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,920
I'm bold and straightforward.

294
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,506
I don't worry about what others think.

295
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,842
I'm not calculating,
and I don't play hard to get.

296
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,887
When it comes to my looks,
I know I'm not everyone's type.

297
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,516
I'm very popular among those
who go for the bad boy type.

298
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,810
But I tend to get rejected by women

299
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,146
who prefer guys with a more gentle
and puppy-like appearance.

300
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,115
What?

301
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,868
What do you think about that greeting?

302
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,537
It's the worst way to start.

303
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,081
It's fallen out of favor
in the hip-hop scene too.

304
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,415
Really?

305
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,961
It's illegal
to greet someone like that now.

306
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,463
I didn't expect to hear that here.

307
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,138
-Hello.
-Hello.

308
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:00,848
Hello.

309
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,560
I'm Jang Theo.

310
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,103
-Jang Theo?
-Jang Theo.

311
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,062
-Jang Theo?
-Yes.

312
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,397
-I'm Kim Te-hwan.
-Kim Te-hwan.

313
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,606
I'm Kook Dong-ho.

314
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,941
Nice to meet you.

315
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,735
You're so full of energy.

316
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,907
I wanted to give
a strong, assertive first impression.

317
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,161
I expected to see tough-looking people
with good physiques,

318
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,371
so I wanted to say, "Yo, what's up?"

319
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,039
But the moment I said that,

320
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:31,295
they greeted me so warmly
and that totally caught me off guard.

321
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,630
I guess three ladies will arrive now.

322
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,548
-Yes.
-Right?

323
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,604
My name is Kim Jeong-su.

324
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,982
I think what makes me attractive

325
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,068
is my deep, reassuring voice.

326
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,780
It's not something you can obtain
just out of sheer effort.

327
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,366
That's why I think it's my biggest weapon.

328
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,244
When it comes to the person I like,

329
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,539
I tend to act like a golden retriever.

330
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,626
I think I strive for a playful
and affectionate relationship.

331
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,295
What if two more men end up coming?

332
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,881
I thought there would be
at least one woman here.

333
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,507
I was a bit flustered.

334
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,470
Someone's coming.

335
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,182
I just saw someone's head pass by.

336
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,065
What?

337
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,150
-It seems to be a woman.
-Yes.

338
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,754
What?

339
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,381
Wait.

340
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,007
A tough-looking guy is coming.

341
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,138
-What?
-Wait.

342
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,057
Yuk?

343
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,308
It's Yuk!

344
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,310
-Isn't he famous?
-He is.

345
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,147
Hello, my name is Yuk Jun-seo.

346
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:19,069
I applied because I could have
new experiences absent in daily life,

347
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,696
and I was curious

348
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:25,284
about the kinds of relationships
I could develop by meeting new people.

349
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,537
In terms of physical strength,
I work out regularly.

350
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,290
And as a former UDT soldier,
I'm definitely confident.

351
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,127
Everyone assumes that I'm popular.

352
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,088
But in reality,
that's not the case at all.

353
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,007
Contrary to my appearance,

354
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,551
I think people have said

355
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,761
that I look cute.

356
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:49,474
I think I've often heard
that I was kind of cute.

357
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,935
People might expect me to be rigid,

358
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,688
but I'm nothing
like the typical image of a soldier.

359
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:59,359
I'm just an ordinary guy,
like those my age.

360
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,486
I can be pretty clumsy and carefree.

361
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,156
So when people see
that side of me in a positive light,

362
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,783
they say that I'm cute.

363
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,744
-Wow.
-That's right.

364
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,747
If he's a former UDT soldier,
do you know him personally?

365
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,791
I don't know him personally.
We were in different units.

366
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,793
But we served at the same time.

367
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,794
I see.

368
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,339
And he was already
a sensation on another show.

369
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,090
-That's right.
-On The Iron Squad.

370
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,133
I see.

371
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,890
Greetings, singles.

372
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,769
This isolated place you are in

373
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,188
is Men's Inferno.

374
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:38,982
We were right.

375
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:43,278
The women are isolated
in another place called Women's Inferno.

376
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,156
That's disappointing.

377
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,534
I know, right?
I was hoping for some excitement.

378
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:56,374
You are not allowed to reveal
your age or occupation in Inferno.

379
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,876
INFERNO RULES
PROFESSIONS AND AGES CANNOT BE REVEALED

380
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,378
If you successfully become a couple,

381
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,131
you can escape Inferno
and spend a night in Paradise.

382
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,592
Now,

383
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,263
the men will play a game
to win a date in Paradise.

384
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,641
-We're doing it right away.
-Already?

385
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,936
Everyone, please gather at the pool.

386
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,730
Damn.

387
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,112
I thought we'd make
our first impressions and go to Paradise,

388
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,823
so I was a bit disappointed.

389
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:33,036
Based on first impressions,
I thought I would've obviously gone first.

390
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,833
It seems Te-hwan tends to make
baseless thoughts on his own.

391
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,209
What I'm really curious about is

392
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,795
did any male participants
leave a strong impression on you?

393
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:45,549
For me, it was Dong-ho,
Theo, and Jeong-su.

394
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,926
These guys left a strong impression.

395
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,638
Dong-ho and Theo have
completely different appealing qualities.

396
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,306
-Yes.
-Dong-ho is very gentle.

397
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,224
You're right.

398
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,101
-Theo looks pretty fierce.
-He does.

399
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,644
I think he has a unique personality.

400
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,230
And Jeong-su is actually my type.

401
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,732
-So…
-What about him makes him your type?

402
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,359
-His looks?
-Various things.

403
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:06,236
-I think we'd click.
-He has a nice voice.

404
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,863
-Yes, he does.
-You're right.

405
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,949
I think as long as Te-hwan
just doesn't talk,

406
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,410
he could get picked.

407
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,578
How can you not talk?

408
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,037
No, no talking.

409
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,289
-With just his looks…
-Right.

410
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,957
He could attract plenty of interest.

411
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,293
But if he talks too much,
he'll turn them off.

412
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,712
But I think Te-hwan has the best physique.

413
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,713
You're right.

414
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,426
When I first saw Theo,
I thought he was a braggart.

415
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,261
But then, the way he walks
with that swagger

416
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,305
made me think that could look cute too.

417
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,599
-He has a bit of playfulness.
-Yes.

418
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,058
Yuk Jun-seo…

419
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,644
I think he'd do well
on one-on-one dates.

420
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,562
-Yeah.
-I agree.

421
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,688
He doesn't like to impose.

422
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,606
-True.
-Right.

423
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,941
It's like he's straight out
of a romance comic book.

424
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,651
-Yeah.
-With his long hair.

425
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,528
He's like a sickly prince.

426
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,155
-"Sickly"!
-In what way?

427
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,489
Sick but beautiful.

428
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,283
But he takes off his shirt
and his body…

429
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,826
-It's unexpected.
-That's right.

430
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,914
BACK TO ONE HOUR LATER

431
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,958
WOMEN'S INFERNO

432
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,550
What?

433
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,388
It's Jun-seo.

434
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,152
He has a long reach.

435
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,407
Goodness.

436
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,410
This is a battle
between reach and strength.

437
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,623
Damn it!

438
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,505
He's like a black stallion.

439
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,423
-Really.
-He doesn't smile at all.

440
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,008
-A wild horse.
-Exactly.

441
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,226
Wow, look at his body.

442
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,484
That was intense.

443
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,819
UDT is a different level.

444
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,373
-Hello.
-Hello.

445
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,749
-Hello.
-Hello.

446
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,834
Hello.

447
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:29,838
What?

448
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,312
He's just standing there.

449
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,564
This is a bit scary.

450
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,066
I'm so scared.

451
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,194
"Scary"!

452
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,407
Come on, smile a bit.

453
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,909
Right?
It's like he's picking his opponent.

454
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,164
The man who came in first place,

455
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,126
please choose the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

456
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,378
This is fun.

457
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,671
Who will he choose?

458
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,611
Sorry, I have to look.

459
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,201
If she smiles like that,
it's hard not to look.

460
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,494
You'd fall for that.

461
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,205
You-jin did that intentionally.

462
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,123
It's because of the sunlight…

463
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,208
I see.

464
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,544
Her hair…

465
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,129
She said before she swipes it.

466
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,215
-She swept it.
-Yes, she mentioned it earlier.

467
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,132
It's true.

468
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,226
He's fallen for her!

469
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,269
-He did?
-Yeah, he did.

470
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,531
This person on the left.

471
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,617
I'll go with her.

472
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,994
-Who?
-On the left?

473
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,913
-Who?
-Who's on the left?

474
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:27,997
Is it Si-an?

475
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,833
This person on the left.

476
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,210
This person on the left.

477
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,504
This person on the left.

478
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,382
I'll go with her.

479
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,092
Thank you.

480
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,723
-It's You-jin.
-I see.

481
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,516
-Yeah, you can't deny it.
-I see.

482
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,642
You need to smile a lot.

483
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,352
I guess so. It creates a connection.

484
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,020
She just keeps smiling.

485
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,856
The man who came in first place,

486
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,985
please take the hand of the person
you've chosen and leave for Paradise.

487
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,611
Let's go.

488
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,742
-They say we need to hold hands.
-Yes, it's okay.

489
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,831
They're leaving right from the start.

490
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,802
The side where I was
blinded you the most, right?

491
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,053
I guess so.

492
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,640
-I'm sorry.
-The sun was right behind me.

493
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,142
You were glowing.

494
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,523
-He's acting awkward.
-I know.

495
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,442
-It's cute.
-I see why people say he's cute.

496
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,695
All I remember was his intense gaze.

497
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,282
It was so scary that it stuck in my mind.

498
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,243
But after he smiled once,

499
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:51,289
he seemed to have a gentle side.

500
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,874
I have a question.

501
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,377
You-jin kept smiling
as soon as he arrived.

502
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,754
Was that a tactic?

503
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,963
It was.

504
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,548
-Tactic?
-What's there to smile about?

505
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,384
What was funny about that situation?
Nothing at all.

506
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,471
Yet…

507
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,390
She continued to smile. It was a tactic.

508
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,350
A tactic.

509
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,267
You-jin's tactic.

510
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,312
People like her get really mad
at their moms at home.

511
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,274
-Wait. We're not sure about that.
-It's a tactic.

512
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,026
Yes, I can't tell for sure.

513
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,444
I get mad at my mom a lot.

514
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,446
-It was about herself.
-Mom, I'm sorry.

515
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,869
Is the guy who came
in second coming too?

516
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,580
How many of them
do you think will show up?

517
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,165
-Two more?
-Maybe three total?

518
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,209
-So top three?
-Yes, I think so.

519
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,798
Someone's coming.

520
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,596
-What?
-He's very tall.

521
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,098
-Is it Dong-ho?
-Hold on.

522
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,516
-Is it Jeong-su?
-Jeong-su?

523
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,226
Jeong-su? Isn't it Te-hwan?

524
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,903
Hello.

525
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,656
-It's Jeong-su.
-Jeong-su.

526
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,741
As expected, his physique is…

527
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,493
Hello.

528
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,622
-Hello.
-Hello.

529
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,543
-Hello.
-Hello.

530
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,884
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

531
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,681
The man who came in second place,

532
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,810
please choose the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

533
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,660
-Look at these tactics.
-Ji-yeon!

534
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,829
-You have to try eagerly.
-They're desperate now.

535
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,080
-Yeah.
-Yes.

536
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,468
Hye-jin is dropping a lot of hints.

537
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,386
-What?
-Si-an too.

538
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,641
I think it'll be Hye-jin or Si-an.
Look at Si-an.

539
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,851
There she goes. Si-an and Hye-jin!

540
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,645
Her smile's different from before.

541
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,067
I'll choose the second person.

542
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,153
I'll choose the second person.

543
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,867
The second person.

544
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,162
The man who came in second,

545
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:40,416
please take the hand of the person
you've chosen and leave for Paradise.

546
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,253
Let's go.

547
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,714
Goodness.

548
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,426
Gosh.

549
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,974
Did the guys play a game
before we got here?

550
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,559
Yes, we had to get into a pool.

551
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,103
-You had to swim?
-Yes.

552
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,900
Second place is still impressive.

553
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,860
Honestly, I'm really disappointed.

554
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,070
I'll win the next one.

555
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,113
Really?

556
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,074
This feels strange.

557
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,662
I kept smiling the whole time.

558
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:24,794
It's because he's my ideal type,
and I wanted to go with him.

559
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,839
I dropped some hints to say "Let's go."

560
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,300
And when he chose me,
I was honestly really happy.

561
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:37,473
Today's Paradise-bound
couple matching is over.

562
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,993
LEE SI-AN

563
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,995
CHUNG YOU-JIN

564
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,997
KIM MIN-SEOL

565
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,999
BAE JI-YEON

566
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,001
KIM HYE-JIN

567
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,003
KIM A-RIN

568
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,005
KIM TE-HWAN

569
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,007
KOOK DONG-HO

570
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,009
JANG THEO

571
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,011
KIM JEONG-SU

572
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,013
YUK JUN-SEO

573
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,604
SINGLE'S INFERNO

574
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,482
We started off
by dividing the participants

575
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,858
into Men's and Women's Infernos.

576
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,320
How do you think the participants
felt about this situation?

577
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,113
Well, to start off this way,

578
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,408
-I don't think they'd feel good.
-I agree.

579
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,787
And they had to choose
someone they liked fast.

580
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,038
It was only based on looks.

581
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,122
Exactly.

582
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,458
But in a way, this might be a good thing.

583
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,126
If they'd been close,

584
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,420
they might've felt bad
about going to Paradise.

585
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,130
-Right.
-But they aren't close at all.

586
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,048
You're right.

587
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,925
-They won't feel bad at all.
-Right.

588
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,101
It's not going in?

589
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,650
Thank you.

590
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:56,404
PARADISE
YUK JUN-SEO & CHUNG YOU-JIN

591
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,406
Gosh, thank you.

592
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,494
Thank you.

593
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,043
These seats are reclined way back.

594
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:11,961
I know, right?

595
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,964
You must be exhausted,
so just lie down for the ride.

596
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,966
Is your seatbelt on?

597
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:17,967
Yes.

598
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,636
-I'll start the engine now.
-Okay.

599
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,346
How do you start this?

600
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,697
Let's go.

601
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,885
It feels like I'm dreaming.

602
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,970
-Me too.
-It doesn't feel…

603
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,805
It doesn't feel real.

604
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,723
It's a bit…

605
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,017
It really doesn't…

606
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,686
-Right.
-It doesn't feel real right now.

607
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,067
This car is fun to drive.

608
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,402
It's nice. Is it not?

609
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,529
Vroom. Let's go.

610
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,697
Let's go.

611
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,407
-"Vroom."
-She's very expressive.

612
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,409
-Like "woof" or "vroom."
-Yes.

613
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,371
"Vroom. Let's go"?
I didn't like that expression.

614
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,249
You can start using it too.

615
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,709
-You can say it too.
-"Vroom."

616
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:51,477
-The view's no joke.
-The view is so amazing.

617
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,355
You can see the N Seoul Tower.

618
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,401
I love it.

619
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,236
Look at the rose petals
they lined it with.

620
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,321
This is insane.

621
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,453
Wow, the view is so nice.

622
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,292
-We're definitely in Paradise.
-You're right.

623
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,377
-It's paradise.
-It truly is.

624
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,384
It's nice.

625
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:27,138
-Tonight, we can sleep comfortably.
-Yes.

626
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,598
All that hard work paid off.

627
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,684
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

628
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,729
-Thank you for bringing me here.
-I'm the thankful one.

629
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,410
Finally, dinner's here.

630
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,704
It looks so delicious.

631
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,625
-Thank you for the meal.
-Yes, thank you as well.

632
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,837
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

633
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,006
Is this duck?

634
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,426
-Maybe not? Is it steak?
-It's just filet mignon.

635
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,511
I rarely get to eat food like this.

636
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,726
-Here I am, saying it's duck.
-Wait.

637
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,479
-You seem…
-Yes?

638
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,981
really different
from my first impression of you.

639
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,025
Gosh, it was the sun making me scowl.

640
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,318
Is that so?

641
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,363
I was also feeling a bit embarrassed.

642
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,281
-I was there alone.
-That's right.

643
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,658
The heat, the sunlight
and a bit of confusion?

644
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,119
I think that's what it was.

645
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,371
But earlier,

646
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,956
we did keep making eye contact.

647
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,292
-That's true.
-Right?

648
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,503
Every time our eyes met, you smiled at me.

649
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,922
That left a really strong impression.

650
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,799
-Really?
-Yes.

651
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,727
I think I made the right choice.

652
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,645
-Really?
-Yes.

653
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,896
Thank you.

654
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,611
So how old are you?

655
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:06,695
-My age?
-Yes.

656
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,947
I'm 28 years old.

657
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,991
You're 28?

658
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,160
What about me?
How old do you think I am?

659
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,620
You're probably younger.

660
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,748
-How old do I look?
-Around 25?

661
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,751
I'm 28.

662
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,420
-I see.
-I'm 28 years old.

663
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,712
I was sure I'd be older.

664
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:28,300
I thought you'd be older than me too.

665
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,302
But you're not.

666
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,304
We're the same age.

667
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,683
I was imagining saying,
"So can I talk casually now?"

668
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,017
-Same.
-I'd thought about it.

669
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,811
-You're very…
-Yes?

670
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,896
You're very calm.

671
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,856
Right.

672
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,401
-That's why I thought you were older.
-Right.

673
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:48,195
Since we're friends,
we should speak casually.

674
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,030
-Should we?
-Wouldn't that be better?

675
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,157
-Right?
-Sounds good.

676
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,116
Great.

677
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,952
-Thank you.
-It changes the vibe too.

678
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,162
Yeah.

679
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,585
What do you do?

680
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,919
Do what?

681
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,672
-Like for a living.
-For a living?

682
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,257
-Your job.
-Right.

683
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,468
I draw.

684
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,635
I see.

685
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,396
I currently am an artist.

686
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,900
I got a studio,
and I've been making art on my own.

687
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,779
I'm thinking about how to present
my artwork to people.

688
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,823
And I'm considering additional aspects

689
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,618
to prepare an exhibition
I can hold in a unique way.

690
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,078
There are many forms of art,

691
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,290
like three-dimensional art,
installations, and sculptures.

692
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,626
But I focus mainly on drawing.

693
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,629
I didn't formally study art,

694
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,339
so I just draw how I want to.

695
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,637
YUK JUN-SEO, AGE 28
ARTIST

696
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,139
I can totally see it.

697
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,558
-I'm doing my best.
-I see.

698
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,894
-You're Yuk Jun-seo the artist.
-That's right.

699
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,521
What do you do for a living?

700
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,481
-Me? Take a guess.
-May I ask?

701
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,275
Why do you want me to guess everything?

702
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,445
Well, it's because you saw me
and knew nothing about me,

703
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,073
so I'm curious to see
what people think I do.

704
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,074
I see.

705
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,492
-Honestly…
-If you're not sure…

706
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,993
You seem like an actress.

707
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,703
-An actress?
-Yeah.

708
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,914
With your looks, you should be an actress.

709
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,457
-Really? That's praise.
-Yeah.

710
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,625
-Of course.
-Thanks.

711
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,834
Well,

712
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,753
I dance.

713
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,963
-Dance?
-Yeah.

714
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,717
I graduated from Ewha Womans University's
Department of Dance.

715
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,136
Currently, I'm pursuing
a master's in dance

716
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,222
at my alma mater's graduate school.

717
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,100
I majored in Korean dance.

718
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:45,604
And it's divided into two fields,
traditional and contemporary.

719
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,357
I perform in both fields.

720
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,696
Also, I currently teach dance
as part of a dance company.

721
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,575
I teach various types of dance,

722
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:02,538
ranging from ballet classes for children
to different types of dance for adults.

723
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:07,543
CHUNG YOU-JIN, AGE 28
DANCER

724
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,545
Wow, I didn't expect that.

725
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,046
-Really? You didn't?
-Nope.

726
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,716
We're both in the arts.

727
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,134
Right? I'm so glad we met.

728
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,302
-Seriously.
-Yeah.

729
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,596
I have nothing to say
when I meet business people.

730
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,557
I really respect them.

731
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,726
-But we have nothing in common.
-Right.

732
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,522
-So…
-Yeah?

733
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,526
At first,
I thought you wouldn't talk much.

734
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,237
-I thought you'd be like, "Oh, yes."
-Really?

735
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,825
I thought you'd be quiet
and not talkative,

736
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,661
but you're really funny,

737
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,705
and you have a bit of a cute side.

738
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,873
Not at all.

739
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,000
It's a completely unexpected charm.

740
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,253
You look so innocent when you smile.

741
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,130
Sure, we'll say that.

742
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,298
What?

743
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,718
Do you have any hobbies?

744
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,136
-Hobbies?
-Yeah.

745
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,055
Looking at photos of my niece.

746
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,390
-Really?
-It's my only joy in life.

747
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,435
It's such a one-sided love.

748
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,437
-Already?
-She pushes me away.

749
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,230
-She is pushing me away a little.
-Really?

750
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,650
Do all girls like it
when you play hard to get?

751
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,319
How do you even do that?

752
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,945
How do you play hard to get?

753
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,948
I'm totally clueless.

754
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,576
You're not the type who plays hard to get?

755
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,828
I just don't understand it.

756
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,205
You don't understand it?

757
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,457
At all? That's so funny.

758
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,875
Where do I go to learn that?

759
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,003
What kind of guy do you…

760
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,715
I feel like you're straightforward.

761
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,425
-You seem like it.
-Really?

762
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,721
So what's your type?

763
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,972
Me?

764
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,057
I like…

765
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,684
-Yes?
-I like straightforward guys.

766
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,227
-Really?
-Yeah.

767
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,104
I'll keep at it then.

768
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,153
So cute.

769
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:04,159
Jun-seo has such a gentle vibe
that's so different from his looks.

770
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,369
-He's charming.
-He is.

771
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,787
-An unexpected charm.
-Seriously.

772
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,580
-Definitely.
-Yes.

773
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,499
He asks a question and becomes so shy.

774
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,543
He can't even look her in the eye.

775
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,044
He can't speak properly either.

776
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:18,215
I initially thought
he'd be quiet and not very talkative.

777
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,843
-But he's really good at talking.
-Yeah.

778
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:24,096
I'm not sure if it's because
they have some kind of connection.

779
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,598
You-jin seems good
at leading the conversation.

780
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,642
-Right.
-She brings up topics well.

781
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,979
-It strangely feels like she's leading.
-You're right.

782
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,231
She's creating the overall atmosphere.

783
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,692
PARADISE
KIM JEONG-SU & LEE SI-AN

784
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,818
Let's go.

785
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:45,659
I'm hungry.

786
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,619
Let's hurry and eat.

787
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,831
-It looks so good.
-Yeah, it does.

788
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:54,042
Wait, should we eat first?

789
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,128
First…

790
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,047
-Do you want some pasta?
-Yes.

791
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,717
Should we have the salad first?

792
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,552
-No, the pasta first.
-The pasta?

793
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,894
-I'll give you some more.
-No.

794
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,062
-Do you want more?
-Yes, please.

795
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,189
Okay.

796
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:18,609
All right.

797
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:20,694
My hands are full.

798
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,448
-Enjoy!
-Enjoy.

799
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,049
Here you go.

800
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,597
-I guess we were exhausted.
-Yeah.

801
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,974
How old are you?

802
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,559
-Me?
-Yes.

803
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,353
-I'm 33.
-Really?

804
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:55,812
How old are you?

805
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,814
You look young for your age.

806
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,025
-You look young.
-I don't.

807
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,571
My age? How old do I look?

808
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,703
Well…

809
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,541
You seem mature,
but I feel like you're really young.

810
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,501
Oh, I like that.

811
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,963
Twenty-five?

812
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,048
You're good at guessing.

813
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:28,971
Thank you.

814
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,015
You can speak casually.

815
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,186
Should we do that then?

816
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:37,646
-Yeah.
-Should we?

817
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,609
What do you do for work?

818
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,278
Take a guess.

819
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,988
-I think…
-Yeah?

820
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,448
You seem like you'd be a news anchor.

821
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,660
-No?
-A news anchor?

822
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,744
I'm not.

823
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,497
Model?

824
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,540
-Yes.
-A model?

825
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,624
Yeah.

826
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,795
I am a model.

827
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:07,050
I'm currently working
as a model for an athleisure brand.

828
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:13,765
I also model for beauty brands,
lookbooks, and commercials.

829
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:18,353
LEE SI-AN, AGE 25
MODEL

830
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,272
It suits you.

831
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,899
What about you?

832
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,653
Why are you suddenly so formal?

833
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:33,410
I run an F&B business.

834
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,289
It's related to coffee shops and bakeries.

835
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,542
I run a coffee shop.

836
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:46,298
Currently, I run five shops,
including locations in Seongsu and Hannam.

837
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:53,555
We take our coffee seriously,
using beans we roast ourselves.

838
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,184
I'm also involved in operations
like staff management,

839
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,978
facility maintenance,
and menu development.

840
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,774
KIM JEONG-SU, AGE 33
BAKERY AND COFFEE SHOP OWNER

841
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:07,486
So you're the boss?

842
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,072
-That's so cool.
-Not at all.

843
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,662
How did you feel when I picked you?

844
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,956
I was so happy.

845
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,124
-Really?
-Yeah.

846
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,046
When I saw you coming…

847
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,048
My ideal type is someone

848
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,344
with a gentle, puppy-like face.

849
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,263
-Really?
-But you were very…

850
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,974
You were smiling a lot
and looked really nice.

851
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,352
I thought I didn't have
any expression at all.

852
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,436
That's not true.

853
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,854
-You looked really nice.
-Really?

854
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,231
Yeah, a good first impression.

855
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:50,654
I mean, you saw the other girls.

856
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,409
So… They didn't interest you?

857
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,536
Well…

858
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,622
There was just someone in white

859
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,374
smiling really beautifully.

860
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,596
-That's all.
-Really?

861
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,514
But…

862
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,517
-Honestly, I barely looked.
-Really?

863
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,479
I just decided to trust my gut
in that moment.

864
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,653
I feel embarrassed.

865
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,415
With these two,

866
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,293
their conversation flows so naturally.

867
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,794
They're not forcing it.

868
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,337
Yeah, it doesn't feel forced.

869
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,758
Since Jeong-su's bangs were in the way,

870
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,718
I couldn't get a good look at him.

871
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,387
From my brief glances, he's good-looking.

872
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,932
-But you thought that from the start.
-I did?

873
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,309
-He was in your top three.
-Yeah.

874
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,353
-I was more drawn to his voice then.
-To his voice?

875
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,438
Now, his looks too?

876
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,857
He has a face you wouldn't get tired of.

877
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:15,363
Jeong-su is so natural and experienced.

878
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,824
I think women might feel
comfortable around him.

879
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,119
I got the feeling
that Si-an was really into him.

880
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:25,791
Her question asking what he thought
about the other women proves that.

881
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:26,708
-Right.
-Yeah.

882
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,669
Women don't ask such things
if they're uninterested, right?

883
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,587
That's right.

884
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,048
-Like, "What about the other girls?"
-Right.

885
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,674
I think that was important.

886
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,218
-She's into him.
-She is.

887
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:39,054
Jeong-su seems pretty relaxed and at ease.

888
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:43,517
PARADISE
YUK JUN-SEO & CHUNG YOU-JIN

889
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,064
It's a private swimming pool.

890
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,565
Yeah, you're right.

891
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:54,194
It's warm.

892
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,780
-Right?
-Not bad.

893
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,076
I like it.

894
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,415
I like that it's warmer than I expected.

895
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,376
You went underwater?

896
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,337
Hold on. You went under right away?

897
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,673
Things were pretty physical earlier.

898
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:15,966
-Right.
-So…

899
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,093
-I had to go underwater.
-Right.

900
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,847
But I couldn't see anything.

901
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,974
-I couldn't see.
-That's hilarious.

902
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,978
-Really?
-Yeah.

903
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,663
You really are Aquaman.

904
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,583
You really do look similar.

905
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,669
-You want to do a lap?
-Yeah, come on.

906
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:57,215
He's like a sophisticated
and handsome brute.

907
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,303
I don't know why people like us
are so unrefined.

908
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,306
-"People like us."
-Why are we so unrefined?

909
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,641
This is so nice.

910
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:11,563
-I wonder what we'll do tomorrow.
-Right? Tomorrow…

911
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,232
-It's hard not to think about it, right?
-Tomorrow…

912
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,986
Go back to Inferno and play another game?

913
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,656
Then, someone else will go
to Paradise or something like that.

914
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,574
Yeah, probably.

915
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,035
I wonder what game we'll play.

916
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,871
It'll be my battle now.

917
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,625
-A fight between the women.
-The women?

918
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,834
The women.

919
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,670
Do well and let me
come back one more time.

920
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,755
-Okay?
-All right.

921
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,340
Don't forget, okay?

922
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,469
The way you talk is so funny.

923
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,554
I'm counting on you.

924
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,223
-I got it.
-I'm kidding.

925
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:50,769
This is fun.

926
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,859
-So the leaves were falling from there.
-Yeah.

927
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,987
I was wondering
where they were coming from.

928
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,530
It was right above us.

929
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,325
This is pretty romantic.

930
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,119
It's how the leaves are falling.

931
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,497
This is like sugar water for me.

932
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,374
-"Sugar water"!
-It's so sweet.

933
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,668
-It's sweet.
-It is?

934
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,712
-It's sweet?
-Yes, the water is so sweet.

935
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,965
-You're so funny.
-Isn't it great?

936
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,092
Let's come back.

937
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,260
Let's come back here.

938
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:26,930
Next time.

939
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,146
PARADISE
KIM JEONG-SU & LEE SI-AN

940
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,815
-Want some champagne?
-Sure.

941
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,526
Thank you.

942
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,612
-Should I open this first?
-Sounds good.

943
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,573
You have to open it without the pop.

944
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,118
I'm a little scared.

945
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:50,996
-Is it loud?
-What?

946
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,497
-Is it loud?
-No.

947
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,379
I think he'll be good at that.

948
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,173
-A hiss means it worked.
-Really?

949
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:06,678
How was that?

950
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,637
It worked?

951
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,639
-I did well, right?
-You did.

952
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,683
-Goodness.
-It worked.

953
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,935
It did. He's so skilled.

954
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,271
-He's opened a few before.
-How many has he done?

955
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,106
-It's not an easy thing.
-He's experienced.

956
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,442
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

957
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,943
-To what?
-I don't know.

958
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,029
I'm not sure.

959
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,072
Cheers to our first time in Paradise.

960
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,199
-Did you drink it?
-No, not yet.

961
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,493
-Cheers to…
-Our first time in Paradise.

962
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,541
I love it.

963
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,044
-Is it good?
-It is.

964
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:43,298
Don't you think
we're more relaxed now than before?

965
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,632
-I agree.
-Right?

966
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:45,884
We've grown closer.

967
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,469
You're right.

968
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,304
But then, when we go back tomorrow…

969
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,264
"Who are you?"

970
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,101
-We greet each other awkwardly.
-I think…

971
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,937
I think it'll be really interesting.

972
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,024
Among all those people,
if I see you again…

973
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,233
Right.

974
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,819
I'd want you to win every game.

975
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,073
-And be the best at whatever you do.
-The best.

976
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,909
Now, there's weight on my shoulders.

977
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,411
I was already struggling
with heavy bags earlier.

978
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,122
That's how I feel.

979
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:21,961
I'll try my best.

980
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,673
When you first walked up,

981
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,051
you looked really cool.

982
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:44,734
You looked pretty too.

983
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,073
I have something in my throat.

984
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,201
I'll just have some fries.

985
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,339
This is fun.

986
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,768
-Want to put on some sheet masks?
-Sure.

987
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,311
-Did you bring some?
-Yeah.

988
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,690
Put it on for me.

989
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,233
-You want me to do it for you?
-Yeah.

990
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,110
Sure, give it to me.

991
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:34,784
Put your face here.

992
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,122
It fits perfectly.

993
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,748
It's nice.

994
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,671
I think I did a bad job.

995
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,006
Really?

996
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,885
Shoot.

997
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,803
-You did it on purpose, right?
-No.

998
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,054
To mess with me?

999
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,684
Done.

1000
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,187
-Good?
-Yes.

1001
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,104
Hold on.

1002
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,690
-Good night.
-Good night.

1003
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,569
Perfect.

1004
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,363
-It's so cold, right?
-What?

1005
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,491
-I'll raise the temperature.
-Okay.

1006
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,498
My legs are sticking out, but it's okay.

1007
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,667
-Just sleep here.
-It's okay.

1008
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:27,879
-It might be more comfortable.
-No, I like it here.

1009
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,353
-Isn't it uncomfortable?
-What?

1010
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,854
What if you fall?

1011
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:45,897
It's perfect.

1012
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,066
But…

1013
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,860
This bed is so big.

1014
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,114
And your legs are sticking out.

1015
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,663
-Are you asleep?
-No.

1016
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,545
It's our first night.

1017
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,756
First time in Paradise.

1018
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,716
Thank you so much.

1019
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,468
Seriously.

1020
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,226
The tone and pace in which way they speak

1021
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,061
and everything about them…

1022
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,021
-It's flawless.
-It's so relaxed.

1023
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,147
Seriously.

1024
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,941
There aren't any signs of being flustered.

1025
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,110
I'm sure they must feel awkward.

1026
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,612
Si-an is completely into Jeong-su.

1027
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,530
Yes.

1028
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:39,325
She doesn't want to, but she's been
charmed by how smooth he is.

1029
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,243
You're right.

1030
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,870
But when someone is that smooth,

1031
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,915
it makes me think
you'd become a bit uneasy.

1032
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,625
-That's not it.
-Too experienced?

1033
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,504
He doesn't make it seem
like he's being smooth.

1034
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,173
From an outsider's point of view,
he seems smooth.

1035
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,760
But when you're actually there,
it actually seems genuine.

1036
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,972
I'm starting to become curious
about Jeong-su.

1037
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:05,351
They're having smooth conversations,
and it feels natural.

1038
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,812
But I didn't feel any excitement
while watching.

1039
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,355
-Right.
-Like…

1040
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,773
I see it in Si-an.

1041
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:15,528
But I wonder if Jeong-su is always
like that with someone he likes

1042
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,280
or if he's interested in someone,

1043
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,282
does he become a bit awkward?

1044
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,326
And would that make him more charming?

1045
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,077
But so far,

1046
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:27,790
it feels like his emotional state
didn't change at all.

1047
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,461
I can't tell if he actually
has feelings for her or…

1048
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:34,172
This is how men
in their thirties are these days.

1049
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,424
-What?
-This is what they're like.

1050
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,467
What are they like?

1051
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,053
No matter how beautiful someone may be,

1052
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,723
they don't immediately
fall head over heels for someone.

1053
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:47,518
Even if she's stunning, they want to
know more about her personality first.

1054
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,270
-Right.
-So maybe…

1055
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:52,315
he's a guy who starts calm
and gradually becomes passionate?

1056
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,816
That's what I think.

1057
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:59,572
MEN'S INFERNO

1058
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,700
It really looks like a meal made by guys.

1059
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,329
Wow, this meal really is plain.

1060
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,085
It's just the guys?

1061
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,086
I guess so.

1062
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,756
This isn't what I expected.

1063
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,550
We're spending the night together.

1064
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:30,520
What?

1065
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:31,813
-A woman?
-They're here?

1066
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,106
Who is it?

1067
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,033
-Who is it?
-Who's coming?

1068
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,284
A sudden raid at night?

1069
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,411
Is it Min-seol?

1070
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,826
