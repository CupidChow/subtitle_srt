SONG JI-A, SHIN JI-YEON

11
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,429
Are there three?

12
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,139
-Three?
-Three postcards?

13
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,515
-Three?
-Three postcards?

14
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,851
This means one of them got zero.

15
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,352
-Yes.
-Right?

16
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,732
She got three.

17
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,025
She got three?

18
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,071
I expected this, but…

19
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,364
This means Ji-yeon didn't get any.

20
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,177
"This is only our first day here,
so let's talk more during our stay."

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,055
"Let's make good memories together.
You did a good job today."

22
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,018
"When you smile,
you look like a different person."

23
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,021
-"I want to get to know you."
-They're curious.

24
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,485
"Hopefully, we can talk more tomorrow."

25
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,029
"Today, I was so nervous
I couldn't even look at your eyes."

26
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,115
Oh, my.

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,658
I knew it.

28
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,081
SONG JI-A: 3 POSTCARDS

29
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,507
I was really surprised.

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,926
Because, honestly,
I thought I wouldn't get any.

31
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,471
I was really confident before I got here,

32
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,892
but here on the island,
the guys didn't seem interested in me.

33
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,436
So I thought, "Well, this is odd."

34
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,313
But then…

35
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,149
I got three postcards.

36
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,611
-Hang on.
-I feel bad for Ji-yeon.

37
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,156
-This can't be true.
-Ji-yeon didn't get any.

38
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,325
It's empty.

39
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,119
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

40
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,078
It's empty.

41
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,371
It's empty.

42
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,467
SHIN JI-YEON: 0 POSTCARDS

43
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,636
This has probably never happened before.

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,014
-I'm sure it hasn't.
-Obviously.

45
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,140
So cold.

46
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,350
It's so cold out there.

47
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,103
-Are you tired?
-Yes, I'm tired.

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,192
It's so cold outside.

49
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,278
-It's really cold, right?
-It's really cold.

50
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,614
-If it's cold, why are you doing this?
-It's cold.

51
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,490
That's the opposite.

52
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,160
I'm so out of it.

53
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,998
Well, it was only the first day,

54
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:32,045
so things will change.
That's what I thought.

55
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,171
We never know, though.

56
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,923
SHIN JI-YEON

57
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,428
I can't believe she got none.

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,772
INFERNO

59
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,816
It's the second day.

60
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,527
My goodness.

61
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,987
That's just beautiful.

62
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,781
Oh, dear. Look at the hair.

63
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,659
-They have equipment there.
-I can't believe what I just saw.

64
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,994
-What is this?
-Who's the one with the chest hair?

65
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,622
It almost looks like a boot camp.

66
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,874
Seriously.

67
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,421
It'd be funny if some of them
weren't working out.

68
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,342
-What?
-Who's that?

69
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,933
I'm sure you didn't expect

70
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,770
that I'd choose So-yeon on the first day.

71
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,356
It's not like
I suddenly lost interest in Ji-yeon

72
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,359
or my first impression of her changed.
That's not the reason why.

73
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,695
I saw So-yeon working hard

74
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,240
and being proactive,
and I had a good feeling about that.

75
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,618
It was just a momentary feeling though.

76
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,954
It was a momentary feeling.

77
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,416
I don't think I'll feel the same today.

78
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,503
I wrote to Si-hun yesterday.

79
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,171
I was on the same team as Si-hun,

80
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,215
so we got to talk a lot.

81
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,509
I think that's why I chose him.

82
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,971
He was the only person
I got to know yesterday.

83
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,764
I wrote to Ji-a.

84
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,185
I was really torn but I chose Ji-a because

85
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,772
Although Ji-yeon is
the type that I usually like,

86
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,319
Ji-a gave me such
a strong first impression.

87
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,154
I think my hands are in the way.

88
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,326
She makes me so shy
that I can't even look at her,

89
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,329
and I thought it meant
that I was attracted to her more.

90
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,538
That's why I chose her.

91
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:34,042
I chose Hyeon-joong because

92
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,626
I like men

93
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,755
who are tall and fit.

94
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,548
Manly men.

95
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,884
And I think Hyeon-joong was the closest.

96
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,094
I'm curious about Si-hun too, though.

97
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,846
But I really don't know.

98
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,849
I chose Ji-a.

99
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,143
She's just gorgeous.

100
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,271
I like women who look like her.

101
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,940
I just followed my heart.

102
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,694
I wrote to Ji-a yesterday,

103
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,990
and I still want to get to know her today.

104
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,243
When she smiles,
she seems like a totally different person.

105
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,953
She intrigues me.

106
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,791
I chose Jun-sik yesterday.

107
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,085
He seemed very sporty.

108
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,797
I also liked his dark skin.

109
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,798
So I chose him.

110
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,551
I wrote the postcard to So-yeon.

111
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,846
She's the one I talked with the most

112
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,891
and she's also the closest

113
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,685
to my ideal type.

114
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,229
That's why I chose her.

115
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,273
I wrote to Se-hoon yesterday.

116
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:43,820
He was very active
when he helped me with the cooking.

117
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,448
He also gave me an apron,
which I thought was sweet.

118
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,741
That's why I chose him.

119
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,622
We'll have to see how it goes today.

120
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,625
But I think I might change my mind.

121
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,002
-All right.
-So we have two couples now

122
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,046
-who chose each other.
-We have two couples.

123
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,131
-Two couples.
-Right?

124
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,550
One is Ji-a and Hyeon-joong.

125
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,551
-Right.
-Right.

126
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,427
And the other is So-yeon and Se-hoon.

127
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,637
They chose each other.

128
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,723
-I'm surprised by Se-hoon's choice.
-Right.

129
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,559
Because he flirted with Ji-yeon more.

130
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,185
-Shin Ji-yeon.
-Right.

131
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,354
But in the end, he chose So-yeon.

132
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,150
I think he was attracted to her
when he saw her working hard.

133
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,485
There must've been a spark
while cooking together.

134
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,945
-Right.
-I think so too.

135
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:30,741
Anyhow, the biggest
and the most shocking twist

136
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,827
was that Ji-yeon got zero postcards.

137
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,744
Right.

138
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,079
Right. That was shocking.

139
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,790
I feel like Ji-yeon will be
incredibly popular starting today.

140
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,417
-Because…
-Right?

141
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,835
-she's heartbroken.
-I look forward to it.

142
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,170
It's time for her to show claws.

143
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,505
Our participants are
finally escaping Inferno

144
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,507
-and going to Paradise today.
-Right.

145
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,551
In Paradise, you can have fantastic dates

146
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,470
at a luxurious hotel.

147
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,722
But you have to be a couple

148
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,599
-to enter Paradise.
-That's right.

149
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:59,145
In Paradise, they can ask
each other's ages and professions.

150
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,397
-Which will be a secret.
-Just between the two.

151
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,774
Are those going to Paradise leaving now?

152
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,109
-No.
-Are they coming back?

153
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,611
-They should come back.
-I see.

154
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,070
They're staying for nine days.

155
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,530
Oh, I see. I get it now.

156
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,327
-Shouldn't we eat something?
-Let's go.

157
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,872
-We have a lot of food here.
-We do?

158
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:18,789
Yes.

159
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,543
We have juice and bread.

160
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,213
Again, no protein.

161
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,174
Looks like we should go
to Paradise to get some.

162
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,551
For survival.

163
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,304
-Sweet!
-I'll peel some apples.

164
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,556
-This is better than yesterday.
-This looks great.

165
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,350
-And milk.
-Somebody prepared this.

166
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,561
Hey. Where are the others?

167
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,568
Cool.

168
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,279
You're a wild man.

169
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,536
Is that butter?

170
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,745
Sugar.

171
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,914
Are the others not eating?

172
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,916
I think they will.

173
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,011
-Si-hun seems to be going somewhere.
-He's leaving.

174
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,599
Is he looking for Ji-a?

175
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,226
Oh, my.

176
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,613
-Did you all check your mailboxes?
-Yes.

177
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,656
-Yes.
-Yes.

178
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,783
How was it?

179
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,785
-What?
-How was it?

180
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,748
It was an interesting experience.

181
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,709
It felt like we were doing Secret Santa.

182
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,960
-Right.
-You're right.

183
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,420
Secret Santa? You must be old.

184
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,337
You're right.

185
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,922
Okay. So you're over 30.

186
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,216
We guessed your ages yesterday.

187
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,136
Who do you think
is the youngest female participant?

188
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,054
The youngest?

189
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,018
-Ji-yeon.
-Ji-yeon.

190
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,352
-I see.
-I see.

191
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,562
I think Ji-a is.

192
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,105
I think So-yeon is.

193
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,690
Now, that's a lie.

194
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,234
-Why?
-He's obviously flirting with you.

195
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,778
Why? It's just my opinion.

196
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,238
Well, that was offensive.

197
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,281
Why?

198
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,325
-I know you're just saying that.
-No.

199
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,784
I think you look the youngest.

200
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,329
This is fun.

201
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,456
You can do it, Jin-taek.

202
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,875
It seems like Jin-taek is
more of a straightforward type.

203
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,627
-Right.
-I find it cute.

204
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,588
Let's all talk casually to each other now.

205
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,048
So we can talk comfortably.

206
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,759
-Let's do that.
-Shall we, ladies and gentlemen?

207
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,093
-Shall we?
-Let's do that.

208
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,511
-Okay.
-Okay.

209
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,847
Where are the others?

210
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,224
I haven't seen them. Maybe they're eating.

211
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,601
They're not in the restroom.

212
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,977
-Really?
-Yes.

213
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,812
I thought they were taking a shower.

214
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,583
I was waiting
so we could eat together.

215
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,627
Did you sleep well?

216
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,879
I slept well, thanks.

217
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,797
How's your hand?

218
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,382
-Right. How is it?
-It's fine.

219
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,634
I want to have some coffee.

220
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,677
Me too. I really want some coffee now.

221
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,223
Hey.

222
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,726
You guys look gorgeous.

223
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,436
I'll prepare breakfast for you.

224
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,896
Are you an idol group?

225
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,689
They're a trio.

226
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,526
Hi.

227
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,278
Your hair looks amazing.

228
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,530
What's this?

229
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,533
We have cereal, apples, and some bread.

230
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,413
-Grab as much cereal as you want.
-The two of us are too dressed up.

231
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,998
When should we go freshen up?

232
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,166
Should we?

233
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,422
The girls suddenly want
to go freshen up after seeing Ji-a.

234
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,757
Yea-won and So-yeon are
feeling anxious now.

235
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,758
Right.

236
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,011
We don't have milk, do we?

237
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,560
Do you want cereal?

238
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,019
-I do.
-You do?

239
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,396
Yes.

240
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,897
This is the only milk we have.

241
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,109
-Did you all have some?
-Is there no more?

242
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,735
We all had one bowl each.

243
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,866
-Do you want to go have some iced water?
-Should we?

244
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,908
-Iced water?
-Iced water?

245
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,618
-Over there?
-On the hill.

246
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,000
-This place is really beautiful.
-The gentle breeze is really nice.

247
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,252
-This is really nice.
-It's so beautiful.

248
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,379
I'd like to bring a hammock and lie down.

249
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,755
That'd be so nice.

250
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,883
-It'd be nice to read too.
-I brought some books.

251
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,092
-Me too.
-That's amazing.

252
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,553
-I brought two.
-Gosh.

253
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,846
-What books?
-Pardon?

254
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,890
-What did you bring?
-I like reading essays.

255
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,266
-Essays?
-I see.

256
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,436
I enjoy reading good passages.

257
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,062
I like poetry too.

258
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,190
Could you recite a poem?
It's such a nice day.

259
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,525
Is there a poem you know by heart?

260
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,403
Not necessarily,
but something just crossed my mind.

261
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,614
-Cool.
-Let's close our eyes while he recites.

262
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,073
Let's close our eyes.

263
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,203
If we try to beat someone,

264
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,829
Yes?

265
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,539
we'll be with a loser.

266
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,792
But if we try to love someone,

267
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,878
we'll be with someone who is loved.

268
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,546
I hope we love each other

269
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,632
-and make good memories here.
-Let's do that.

270
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,799
Okay.

271
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,926
Cheers.

272
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,845
I like poetry.

273
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,724
But not many people say
that they like poetry.

274
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,810
So I liked that about him.

275
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,272
I think he might actually be
much nicer than I thought.

276
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,443
I like the color of your shirt.

277
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,444
-This color?
-Yes.

278
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,695
-Really?
-I like that color.

279
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,989
-Do you like pink?
-Yes, I like pink.

280
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,574
-Really?
-All my things are pink.

281
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,535
I should only wear pink.
I have a button-up too.

282
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,744
-Really?
-Yes.

283
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,164
-I love your dress.
-You do?

284
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,958
-Yes.
-Thank you.

285
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,292
It really suits this place.

286
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,421
But you didn't write a postcard to her.

287
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,632
But this is the second day.

288
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,093
I can see Se-hoon is
being really nice to Ji-yeon.

289
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,511
-Right.
-Yes.

290
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,555
Although he didn't write
a postcard to her.

291
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,599
Is there anything you don't like to eat?

292
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,977
-She said she's a picky eater.
-Right.

293
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,770
-She doesn't like seafood.
-You remembered.

294
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:15,688
Yes.

295
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,565
-I'm a picky eater.
-But cheonggukjang…

296
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,567
-Really?
-Yes, I like cheonggukjang.

297
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,694
-Cheonggukjang?
-Yes, I'm very…

298
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,112
Right. You said you liked

299
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,156
-doenjang soup yesterday.
-Yes. I like dishes like that.

300
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,826
Do you drink?

301
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,952
-Drink?
-Yes.

302
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,496
I like drinking,

303
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,708
-but I can't drink much.
-Is that so?

304
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,502
-How much can you drink?
-Four glasses of wine.

305
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,837
-Four glasses of wine?
-Yes.

306
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,297
I think I asked you this already.

307
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,174
-I did tell you about it. I did.
-You told me already.

308
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,886
-I said I like rice wine too.
-Right.

309
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,388
We talked about this
because we were on the same team.

310
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,806
I see.

311
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,393
This is my first vacation in a year.

312
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,604
Me too.
I haven't had any free time like this.

313
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,315
I was sitting over there yesterday.

314
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,275
-Really?
-Late at night.

315
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,028
-I should've come out too.
-You should come out too.

316
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,571
I'll come out tonight.

317
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,448
Come out and say, "Hyeon-joong!"

318
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,159
Then I'll come out like this.

319
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,454
-People say I'm like a dog.
-You're a puppy?

320
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,623
-Yes. My nickname is Golden Retriever.
-I see.

321
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,917
My first impression
of you was the opposite.

322
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,126
Is that so?

323
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,252
You looked a bit cold.

324
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,379
That's because I'm shy.

325
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,672
I see.

326
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,967
Talking to women is really hard for me.

327
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,385
Is your blood type A?

328
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,303
Yes, it is.

329
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,554
-A?
-Yes.

330
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,973
-Is yours AB?
-Me?

331
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,850
-Yes. Isn't your blood type AB?
-No.

332
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,727
-What is it then?
-I'm a doll type.

333
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,187
I knew that already.

334
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,146
-It's O.
-O.

335
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,315
-Don't I seem like an O-type?
-Participants.

336
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,860
Please come to the beach.

337
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,082
I wonder what we'll be doing.

338
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,793
Maybe we have to run and get those things.

339
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,835
No way.

340
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,836
Is it a race?

341
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,339
Look. They're all…

342
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,638
Goodness.

343
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,598
Jin-taek is spectacular.

344
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,225
-Is that really hair?
-Yes.

345
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,102
I was right.

346
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,395
-Is that hair?
-It is.

347
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,397
-It is?
-It kind of looks like

348
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,940
a part of the necklace.

349
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,066
I can't stop looking.

350
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,442
It suits him.

351
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,402
Yes, it suits him.

352
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,196
There are exactly five of them.

353
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,161
Starting today,
you'll play a simple game each day

354
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,163
and the winner will get a chance
to choose two people

355
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,375
to have a special meal with.

356
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,668
-Two?
-Two people?

357
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,420
-Awesome.
-Today's special meal is

358
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,964
a brunch platter and iced Americano.

359
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,632
-Iced Americano!
-Iced Americano!

360
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,050
-Coffee! Finally!
-Coffee!

361
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,846
And today, only the men will be
playing the game.

362
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,389
-I see.
-I see.

363
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,686
Run as fast as you can toward the flags.

364
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,313
The one to pull out the last flag

365
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,691
will be the final winner.

366
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,985
-Those who fail to grab one
-It's a survival game.

367
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,112
-will be eliminated.
-It's a survival game.

368
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,535
I need to take these off.

369
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,914
-Could you hold on to this?
-Sure.

370
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,874
Thank you.

371
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,127
-He asked So-yeon.
-I knew it.

372
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,170
He's a one-woman man.

373
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,343
Who do you think will be the winner?

374
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,261
Well…

375
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,305
Hyeon-joong seemed very confident.

376
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,432
-I think he'll be good.
-I think so too.

377
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,851
-And Jun-sik…
-Oh, right.

378
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,269
He seems quite competitive.

379
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,354
-He was competitive when he was cooking.
-Right.

380
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,816
My gosh. Their pride is on the line.

381
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,860
"I don't have to be the best,
but I can't be the worst."

382
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,737
-That's probably how they feel.
-Right.

383
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,200
There are four flags for five contestants.

384
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,251
I'm so nervous.

385
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,094
-What?
-Oh, my goodness.

386
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,096
-What?
-Oh, my goodness.

387
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,056
-What?
-Oh, my goodness.

388
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:19,973
Oh, my gosh.

389
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,100
My gosh!

390
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:22,851
Oh, my gosh.

391
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,311
My gosh!

392
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,604
What happened to his shoe?

393
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,399
-Who won?
-Se-hoon.

394
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,484
It's Se-hoon!

395
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,861
Oh, no.

396
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,071
Si-hun…

397
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,323
Si-hun.

398
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,407
I couldn't run.

399
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,828
Round One is over.
Si-hun has been eliminated.

400
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,246
-He's so fast.
-I know.

401
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,497
-He surprised me.
-Seriously.

402
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,541
-I thought he didn't work out.
-Right?

403
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,294
-We should be friends with Se-hoon.
-Seriously.

404
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,921
For the meal?

405
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,340
Winning like that
makes him look really manly.

406
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,800
-It does.
-Right?

407
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,094
-Let's do this.
-Let's have a fair game.

408
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,138
There are only two flags.

409
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,515
-Only two?
-Gosh.

410
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,808
Only two this round?

411
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,852
-This is intense.
-The real game starts now.

412
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,855
They must be nervous.

413
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,948
My gosh.

414
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,534
My gosh.

415
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,878
-Se-hoon is really fast.
-He is.

416
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,212
Right?

417
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,301
Hyeon-joong and Jun-sik
have been eliminated in Round Two.

418
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,095
We have one round left.

419
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,056
-They did a good job too. What a shame.
-It's a shame.

420
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,225
-What a shame.
-I almost fell.

421
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,852
I thought I would win.

422
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,897
Now that I think about it,
it would've been easier without shoes.

423
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,982
There's only one now.

424
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,651
Oh, no. There's only one.

425
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,618
-We're on the winner's side.
-Right.

426
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,411
-I think Se-hoon will win.
-Right?

427
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,038
Se-hoon is fast.

428
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,249
-Maybe he was a pro runner.
-Maybe.

429
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,424
-Jin-taek has to get that flag.
-He needs to put everything on the line.

430
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,601
He's so fast.

431
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,062
He's so fast.

432
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,855
He's so fast.

433
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,067
He's so much faster.

434
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,693
He's really fast.

435
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,820
-He's really fast.
-How did he do that?

436
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,371
-Se-hoon has been good at everything.
-Right.

437
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,206
-He's even a good cook.
-Right.

438
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,999
How can he be so fast?

439
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,587
-Great job.
-The winner of the first game on Day Two

440
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,506
is Moon Se-hoon. Congratulations.

441
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,132
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

442
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,092
Congratulations.

443
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:04,221
Se-hoon just gave Ji-yeon a high five.

444
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,975
Well, Se-hoon has always
found her attractive from the beginning.

445
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,810
-But he didn't…
-So what? He didn't write

446
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,395
-the postcard to her.
-That's…

447
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,688
-Don't be so mad at him.
-Why?

448
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,814
It was the first day.

449
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,065
-The first day.
-Right.

450
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,317
Let's see who he chooses this time.

451
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,403
Then we'll know what he's thinking.

452
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,197
-He'll definitely choose Ji-yeon.
-He will.

453
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,950
-I feel like he'll choose So-yeon too.
-I think so too.

454
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,250
-Sausages.
-It looks delicious.

455
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,558
-What?
-What?

456
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,143
-That's Ji-a.
-It's JI-a.

457
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,270
Se-hoon, please choose
two female participants

458
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,439
you want to have the special meal with.

459
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,691
I choose Ji-yeon…

460
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,068
and…

461
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,529
Ji-a.

462
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,532
Ji-yeon and Ji-a will have

463
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,868
the brunch platter and iced Americano

464
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,495
-together with Se-hoon. Congratulations.
-Lucky.

465
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,580
Iced Americano.

466
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,749
He changed his mind.

467
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,460
I get why he chose Ji-yeon,

468
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,836
but why Ji-a?

469
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,713
-He had to choose two.
-That's the rule.

470
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,550
But he could've chosen So-yeon.
He wrote the postcard to her.

471
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,261
This game made it clear

472
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,015
that Se-hoon is interested

473
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,933
in Ji-a or Ji-yeon.

474
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,479
I liked him when I first met him,

475
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,066
but we didn't really get
to bond with each other today.

476
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,276
So I'm not sure.

477
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,279
Am I being too serious now?

478
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,907
-We understand.
-Seriously. I can understand.

479
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,867
They even exchanged postcards.

480
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,119
-I understand. Yes.
-I can totally understand her.

481
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,830
-Isn't it nice here?
-It looks really nice.

482
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,084
Looks like you decorated the place.

483
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,293
I helped a little bit.

484
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,296
-Please have a seat.
-Look at all the food.

485
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,714
It looks fake.

486
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,549
-I missed coffee so much.
-So pretty.

487
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,384
Please. Sit wherever you like.

488
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,179
Have some coffee.

489
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,180
My gosh.

490
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,933
-Finally, Iced Americano.
-Seriously. Finally.

491
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,226
Have some coffee.

492
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,352
-Thank you.
-No problem.

493
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,270
Have some coffee, Ji-a.

494
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,230
Thanks.

495
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,357
Oh, no. I dropped the knife.

496
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,824
-It's good, right?
-This is like heaven.

497
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,242
I already had more than half.

498
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,788
-What more could I ask for?
-It's all thanks to you.

499
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,166
Canned chicken breast and sweet potatoes?

500
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,418
CAFETERIA

501
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,884
You all seem a bit tired after that game.

502
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,261
They're all worn out.

503
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,763
-And Jin-taek is sitting next to So-yeon.
-Beside her.

504
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,141
-Right?
-He's so cute.

505
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,144
Jin-taek is interested only in So-yeon.

506
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,521
-I had no idea he'd be so loyal.
-I know, right?

507
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,691
-I had no idea he'd be like that.
-He's so innocent.

508
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,736
-Hyeon-joong seemed really driven.
-Right.

509
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,156
He's really competitive.
Did you see his eyes?

510
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,699
-Yes.
-His eyes were glaring.

511
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,702
So I wanted to ask him about it.

512
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,996
You'd better leave him alone.
He's really upset…

513
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,291
-I think he went into the dorm
-He's upset.

514
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,917
-because he lost the game.
-Really?

515
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,169
He's so competitive.

516
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,171
-Were you a runner?
-You surprised us.

517
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,882
-I love running.
-I see.

518
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,967
-You had no rival.
-Right.

519
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,594
Really?

520
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,679
-Are you usually competitive?
-I am.

521
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,680
I see.

522
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,764
I hate losing.

523
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,975
Me too. When I play games,

524
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,310
-Really?
-I get competitive.

525
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,769
-Really?
-I do.

526
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,730
You are too, aren't you?

527
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,648
-Yes, I am.
-You hate losing.

528
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,066
-You hate losing?
-Yes.

529
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,068
You obviously look competitive.

530
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,614
And I think you're secretly competitive.

531
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,407
I really hate losing.

532
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,744
At first, I thought you'd be

533
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,788
more of a quiet type.

534
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,290
-Really?
-Yes, but after talking

535
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,125
-I see.
-I think I was wrong.

536
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,877
Am I different from when you first saw me?

537
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,671
You seem quite different
from your first impression.

538
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,381
I see.

539
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:12,093
I'm discovering new sides of you.

540
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,220
I see.

541
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,307
For the first time,

542
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,602
Ji-a looks so excluded to me.

543
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,937
-Right.
-Right?

544
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,273
It looks like Se-hoon can't see
anything else but Ji-yeon.

545
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,526
I saw you walking around
without makeup earlier.

546
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,028
-You saw us?
-I was sitting there

547
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,738
-enjoying the waves.
-From where?

548
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,782
-Then when I turned around…
-You saw us.

549
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,867
We couldn't see
because we weren't wearing contacts.

550
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:36,910
We couldn't see anything.

551
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,119
Do you have poor eyesight?

552
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,788
-Usually, I wear glasses.
-Me too.

553
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,373
How do you look with glasses on?

554
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,291
-She's cute.
-Can you try these on?

555
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,918
-These?
-Try them on.

556
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,628
Glasses actually suit my face.

557
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,171
They do?

558
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,130
What do you think?

559
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,548
Not bad, right?

560
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,008
-You're totally different.
-Totally?

561
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,551
-Yes.
-You look really different.

562
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,970
-You look totally different.
-Really?

563
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,013
-Do I look that different?
-You do.

564
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,307
With the glasses on, you look like

565
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,476
a hard-working office worker.

566
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,020
Se-hoon is…

567
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:08,483
like a racing horse
running toward Ji-yeon.

568
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,568
-Right. I'm sure she felt it too.
-Right?

569
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,613
I could just see it. It was obvious.

570
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,824
His eyes were fixed on her

571
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,576
and he kept taking care of her.

572
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,330
What kind of woman do you like?

573
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,750
I like those who have a strong viewpoint.

574
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,751
-I see.
-I see.

575
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,046
Those who don't express themselves
or say what they have in mind

576
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,757
-aren't very attractive to me.
-I see.

577
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,925
-I see.
-I see.

578
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,512
-Shy types.
-Yes. I never really liked them.

579
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:42,434
How about you?
What are your ideal types like?

580
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,520
I know my ideal type.
I like sexy and sweet men.

581
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,231
Sexy and sweet?

582
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,068
What about you?

583
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:56,573
I like those who are trustworthy,
manly, and have their own opinions.

584
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,366
We're all similar.

585
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,909
-Right.
-Our ideal types.

586
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,620
Right. We all like
people who have their own opinions.

587
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,792
How was it when you checked
the mailboxes yesterday?

588
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,546
I was really nervous
on my way to the postbox.

589
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,797
I was really nervous too.

590
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,259
We were all nervous,
but it seemed to me that everyone thought

591
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,719
it wasn't the real game yet.

592
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,347
-We thought the same.
-Right. We did.

593
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,182
Because…

594
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,309
Can I say this?

595
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,268
What is it?

596
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:29,647
Right now,
I'm not interested in the person

597
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,318
who I wrote to yesterday.

598
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,821
He was being indirect,

599
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,198
but he basically confessed.

600
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,575
-"I didn't choose Ji-yeon yesterday."
-Right.

601
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,577
-"But I changed my mind today."
-Right.

602
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,454
"I'm interested in you."
That's what he's saying.

603
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,499
"Don't be upset about yesterday.
I like you."

604
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,209
-"So don't worry."
-Right.

605
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,544
-That's what he's saying.
-He confessed.

606
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,755
And Ji-a must find that funny.

607
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,550
-"What are they doing now?"
-"Am I invisible to them?"

608
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,845
It's getting hot, right?

609
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,931
You should put the hat on.

610
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,059
Could you try that hat on?

611
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,395
This hat?
I usually don't wear this kind of hat.

612
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,355
-You look really cute.
-Really?

613
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,440
You look really cute with the hat on.

614
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,152
You look really pretty.
The hat matches with this place.

615
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,695
Shall we take some photos?

616
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,864
Sounds good.
We can use the instant camera.

617
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,617
Stand over there.

618
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,661
You look great.

619
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,079
-Really?
-I'm sure you do.

620
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,497
You look amazing.

621
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,126
Don't shake it.
And don't let it get any sunlight.

622
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,044
-Okay.
-You're like an expert.

623
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,796
I have a photo now.

624
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,964
-It's nice.
-Oh, my.

625
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,215
Oh, my gosh.

626
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,634
-Can you see it already?
-The colors match well.

627
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,225
Guys, I took a photo of you two.

628
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,435
Really?

629
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,853
-Check this out.
-Secretly.

630
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,815
It's really nice
to have a good photographer.

631
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,400
It is. He's really good.

632
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,320
-They're back.
-We're back.

633
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,406
-Did you enjoy the food?
-What did you eat?

634
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,242
-Iced Americano and sausages.
-Sausages.

635
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,286
-That sounds amazing.
-We had meat.

636
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,705
-That's a really nice photo.
-It really is.

637
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,914
What's this in the back?

638
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,167
Se-hoon, you're such a good photographer.

639
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,626
-Let's take a photo.
-A group photo.

640
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,462
Let's do that, because we're all here.

641
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,297
Scoot over, everyone.

642
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,966
So we can all be in the photo.

643
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,968
One, two, three.

644
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,972
-That's a charming move.
-Yes.

645
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,807
It's a little secret between them.

646
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,478
Finally.

647
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,937
-Done.
-Finally.

648
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:53,792
WOMEN'S LODGING

649
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,336
So-yeon.

650
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,046
Yes?

651
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,672
Can I have a word with you?

652
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,216
-With me?
-Yes.

653
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,884
-What is it?
-What were you doing?

654
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,887
-Oh, can I come in?
-Sure. Please come in.

655
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,723
-I'm not sure where you can sit.
-What are you reading?

656
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,350
It's a prayer book.

657
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,435
-Oh, you're religious.
-Yes.

658
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,895
-Are you a Christian?
-Yes. Have a seat.

659
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,063
I see.

660
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,439
It's getting cooler now.

661
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,857
Right, a little.

662
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,275
It was warm earlier.

663
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,527
Isn't it a bit too sunny?

664
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,820
It should get cooler soon.

665
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,071
-You think?
-Yes.

666
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,325
-You're feeling awkward, aren't you?
-Pardon?

667
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,244
-Are you feeling awkward?
-Yes, I am.

668
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,453
Right.

669
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,248
Seeing you up close,
I realize you have beautiful eyes.

670
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,332
-I do?
-Yes.

671
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,375
I have brown eyes.

672
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,418
You have big brown eyes.

673
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,795
Right.

674
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:39,796
I have brown eyes.

675
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,881
-I see.
-You're beautiful too.

676
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,049
Thank you.

677
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,386
You have a natural charm.

678
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:50,598
-You have natural beauty.
-Natural beauty?

679
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,891
-It's a compliment.
-Is it?

680
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,017
Yes.

681
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,271
I should put more effort
but I just like looking natural.

682
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,731
How about you, So-yeon? How do you feel?

683
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,692
Are you interested in anyone?

684
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,737
-Well, we haven't had much time.
-Right.

685
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,491
I didn't really get to talk to anyone.

686
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,784
I see.

687
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:14,122
I thought the same on the first day,
but then I realized I should do something.

688
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,417
-I see.
-Our time here is limited, so…

689
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,919
So are you trying to talk
to all of us, one by one?

690
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,546
No, I'm talking to you only.

691
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,550
Jin-taek.

692
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,221
No, I'm talking to you only.

693
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,558
-I want to get to know you.
-I see.

694
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:37,312
I thought, if I didn't talk to you now,
I'd regret later.

695
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,316
-I see.
-That's why I came by now.

696
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,027
Actually, I was torn between two options

697
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,030
when I was choosing the outfit
for the first day.

698
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:47,989
I see.

699
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,909
My original choice wasn't the white suit.

700
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,744
-I see.
-It was a different color.

701
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,706
But I'm glad I chose
to wear the white suit.

702
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,295
You look like you're wearing
matching clothes.

703
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,130
-Is that so?
-Yes, at least to me.

704
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,217
Looks like our fashion
is very important here.

705
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,844
-Looks like it.
-Yes.

706
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,931
I just wanted to say that.

707
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,603
-Are you trying to seduce me?
-What?

708
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,189
I'm glad you think so.

709
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,692
-Thanks.
-No problem.

710
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,402
It's not easy
to express feelings like this.

711
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,445
He's so pure-hearted.

712
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,822
I can feel from the way he talks
that he's sincere.

713
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,699
-Right.
-He means what he says.

714
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,825
You know, sometimes,

715
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,244
when someone who you weren't
so interested in

716
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,330
shows interest in you,

717
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,831
you become interested in them.

718
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,958
-Yes.
-Right. It happens.

719
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,084
-It happens.
-Yes.

720
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,710
Plus, Jin-taek is actually

721
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,880
a pretty good-looking guy.

722
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,632
Though some might not like his hair.

723
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:51,177
But he can always shave his hair
if he has to.

724
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,930
It's actually nicer
that he's a delicate type.

725
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,683
If he was more of an aggressive type,
it would've been too much.

726
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,144
I agree. I also think those sides
of him make him more likable.

727
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,270
Right.

728
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,983
INFERNO

729
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,950
-Now,
-Finally.

730
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,327
we're going to match the couples

731
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,371
who will go on a date in Paradise.

732
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,331
I'm so nervous.
I didn't know it'd be like this.

733
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,627
The female participants have chosen
the male participants they like.

734
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,175
Has this always been here?

735
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,720
"Paradise" is written on it.

736
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,221
Heaven.

737
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:53,740
Male participants,
come out to the campfire one by one

738
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:58,828
and say the name of the woman
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

739
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,123
My gosh. They have to say our names.

740
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:06,627
If the person you call out chose you back,

741
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,255
you can escape to Paradise together

742
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,340
and have a fantastic date.

743
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,595
So we don't know who chooses whom.

744
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,889
But if you're not invited to Paradise,

745
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,349
you'll know that
the person you chose didn't choose you.

746
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,851
We'll know that at least.

747
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:25,188
-You're right. That's mean too.
-That's mean too.

748
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,148
We have no idea how this will go.

749
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,609
So who goes to Paradise again?

750
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,569
Am I the only one who doesn't understand?

751
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,030
-Kyuhyun, can you explain it to me?
-I'll explain.

752
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:38,242
The female participants chose
the male participant they'd like

753
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,869
to go to Paradise with.

754
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,913
-Okay.
-And they already made their choices.

755
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:46,125
Now, it's the male participants' turn
to choose the women they like.

756
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,921
If the person they choose isn't
the one who chose them,

757
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:53,007
-no matter how many votes they got,
-Okay.

758
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,634
-they can't go to Paradise.
-Right.

759
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,011
Only those who chose each other
can go to Paradise.

760
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:03,476
MATCHING THE COUPLES
TO GO TO PARADISE

761
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,104
We'll start with Hyeon-joong.

762
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,399
Good luck.

763
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,360
Finally, the first voter.

764
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,197
Could you tell us who you're choosing?
I'm so curious.

765
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,700
-He's taking his stuff.
-He is?

766
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,536
Gosh.

767
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,329
Well, in case he goes to Paradise.

768
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:27,792
KIM HYEON-JOONG

769
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,794
I'm nervous.

770
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,133
I want to go to Paradise with…

771
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,136
I'm so nervous.

772
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,269
Ji-a, I assume.

773
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,770
-As expected?
-Will he choose Ji-a

774
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,606
-I think he'll choose Ji-a.
-or will he change his mind?

775
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,610
I want to go to Paradise

776
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,029
with Ji-a.

777
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,616
Just as we expected.

778
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,827
If Ji-a comes out,

779
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,245
-They chose each other.
-she chose him.

780
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,705
-Then they're going together.
-Yes.

781
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,856
-She's coming out!
-She's coming out!

782
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,027
-They chose each other.
-They felt the same.

783
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,945
So this is how they go.

784
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,129
He's going to carry her suitcase.

785
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,964
His ears are red.

786
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,594
Gosh.

787
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,641
-It's heavy.
-That's okay.

788
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,690
Can you carry both of them?

789
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,487
There are those veins again.

790
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,156
-Is this why you chose me?
-Yes.

791
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,282
I see.

792
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,203
I wonder who's going with Ji-a.

793
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,163
-I'm curious.
-Let's take guesses.

794
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,081
Hyeon-joong.

795
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,415
Si-hun?

796
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,542
I don't think it's Si-hun.

797
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,585
Really?

798
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,795
This is really hard.

799
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,130
You need to choose each other to go.

800
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,134
Ji-a went out,
but the rest of the female participants

801
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,594
don't know who she went with.

802
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,471
-Right. They don't seem to know.
-Right?

803
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,932
She might have gone
with the person they chose.

804
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:53,980
KIM JUN-SIK

805
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,856
I have no idea who Jun-sik has in mind.

806
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:03,030
I want to go to Paradise with…

807
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,951
-I have no idea who Jun-sik will choose.
-Right.

808
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,161
-Jun-sik is…
-He's too nice to everyone.

809
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,371
No clue.

810
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:16,168
I want to go to Paradise…

811
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,214
with Ji-a.

812
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,390
But Ji-a is gone.

813
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,642
The guys don't know either.

814
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,978
They don't know who went with whom.

815
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,398
If they know who others went with,

816
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,608
-they might change their mind.
-That's right.

817
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:47,450
Ji-a did not choose you.

818
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,661
-What?
-What happened?

819
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,163
-I'm back.
-What?

820
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,331
You came back?

821
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,624
What happened?

822
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,461
-Who did you choose?
-Why?

823
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,254
-I…
-Please don't tell them right now.

824
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,674
I knew this would happen.

825
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,679
This is so cruel.

826
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,848
-This is just cruel.
-Seriously.

827
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,352
This really makes me think.

828
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:24,111
CHOI SI-HUN

829
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,281
Wait. Si-hun likes Ji-a too.

830
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,411
I want to go to Paradise…

831
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,082
with Ji-yeon.

832
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,333
What?

833
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,668
Ji-yeon?

834
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,170
-Ji-yeon?
-What?

835
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,548
Actually, his first choice was Ji-yeon,
based on the first impression.

836
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,758
Right. He did.

837
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,842
-Did he?
-At first.

838
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,177
At first.

839
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,804
…with Ji-yeon.

840
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,731
MOON SE-HOON

841
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:05,111
I want to go on a date in Paradise…

842
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,115
with Ji-yeon.

843
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,327
I wonder who Ji-yeon chose.

844
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,874
Today, she's chosen by two men.

845
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,584
-Yesterday, no one chose her.
-Yes.

846
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,257
Yesterday, Ji-yeon wrote
the postcard to Si-hun.

847
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,550
Right.

848
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,886
-She's coming out.
-There she is.

849
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,606
-Who did she choose?
-Let's see.

850
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,733
-Wait.
-Wait.

851
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,945
-I see a smile on his face.
-Wait. Hang on.

852
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,244
Who's her date?

853
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,037
-Oh, come on.
-Si-hun is smiling.

854
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,873
-It's Si-hun.
-Who is it?

855
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,419
-Hi.
-Hi.

856
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,171
-Let me carry it.
-You don't need to.

857
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,338
It's okay. Let me help.

858
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,135
Really?

859
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,887
But Se-hoon was so nice to her.

860
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,722
Gosh, I didn't see that coming.

861
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,515
Ji-yeon is one scary woman.

862
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,311
I didn't expect this.

863
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,729
-You didn't expect this?
-No.

864
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,856
That I would choose you?

865
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:24,857
Well, yes.

866
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,836
He came back.

867
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,430
Hey. Welcome back.

868
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,642
-Let's have a nice dinner together.
-Okay.

869
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,689
Gosh.

870
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,691
This actually hurts.

871
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:28,462
Now, Se-hoon knows for sure
that Ji-yeon is not interested in him.

872
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,132
-And it looks like it shocked him.
-Yes.

873
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,926
-He seems shocked.
-He's shocked.

874
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,804
-I think he thought she'd choose him.
-Right.

875
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:43,894
OH JIN-TAEK

876
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,650
I want to go to Paradise…

877
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,237
with So-yeon.

878
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,324
-But we don't know…
-I'm not sure how she feels.

879
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,409
Me neither.

880
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,672
-Of course.
-Here she comes.

881
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,549
They look great together.

882
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,889
He's smiling.

883
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:26,228
-This is sweet.
-I wish they never break up.

884
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,027
Let me carry it for you.
Could you take my hat?

885
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,862
Did you bring a hat?

886
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,864
-It's for you and me.
-Really?

887
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,365
I should put it on.

888
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,660
Looks like we're going.

889
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,786
Right.

890
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,456
Thank you.

891
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,750
Oh, come on. I should thank you.

892
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,670
It's nice to see
things worked out for Jin-taek.

893
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,796
Right?

894
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,714
WOMEN'S LODGING

895
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,467
But since yesterday, Yea-won is…

896
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,885
This makes me feel bad.

897
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,013
Right. Since yesterday…

898
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,681
But Yea-won is so charming too.

899
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,643
Who did she choose?

900
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,438
Who is it?

901
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,233
-I wonder who she's interested in.
-Who is it?

902
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,777
-It's Jun-sik.
-Jun-sik?

903
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,654
She's a one-man woman too.

904
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,238
KIM JUN-SIK

905
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,699
I think they left.

906
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,452
-Jin-taek?
-Yes.

907
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,206
You must feel more crushed than me.

908
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,124
Well…

909
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,009
Now, I'm thinking about

910
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,222
every little thing I said earlier…

911
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,439
Interesting.

912
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,442
This is really interesting.

913
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,319
Seriously. Gosh.

914
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,196
Yes.

915
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,114
This is…

916
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,241
very interesting.

917
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,661
I'm so happy.

918
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,955
Well, these guys seem very happy.

919
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,207
-I guess we're going to ride that.
-I know.

920
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,376
-A helicopter.
-Have you been on one before?

921
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,585
Never.

922
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,754
-A helicopter?
-They're riding a helicopter?

923
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,922
Are they visual effects?

924
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,215
-Seriously?
-A helicopter?

925
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,467
Our crew must have spent a lot of money.

926
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,429
-A helicopter.
-Have you been on one before?

927
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,596
Never.

928
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,350
-We're literally escaping the island.
-I know.

929
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,894
-My gosh.
-This is crazy.

930
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,982
-My gosh.
-It's a helicopter!

931
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,984
-Goodness.
-This is amazing.

932
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,735
-Seriously.
-This is crazy.

933
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,654
We're taking off.

934
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,114
Here we go.

935
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,038
They'll get so much closer at Paradise.

936
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,540
Right.

937
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,669
Bye, deserted island.

938
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,512
They're taking a helicopter?

939
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,515
That's crazy.

940
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,110
Don't cry.

941
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,822
You know what? I'm okay,

942
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:28,494
but thinking about the girl I like

943
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:33,749
chatting with the guy
who was lying right next to me…

944
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,585
They're having a party.

945
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,631
This is like the pirate ship ride.

946
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,140
Oh, my. Look at the sweet gaze.

947
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,727
Now that I think about it,
after breakfast,

948
00:46:53,810 --> 00:47:00,108
Si-hun remembered and talked about
the things Ji-yeon liked when they talked.

949
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,319
When Se-hoon asked questions
about Ji-yeon,

950
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,279
Si-hun answered him.

951
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,365
Is there anything you don't like to eat?

952
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,825
-She said she's a picky eater.
-Right.

953
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,245
-She doesn't like seafood.
-You remembered.

954
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,829
-I remember that now.
-I remember that.

955
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,122
Oh, you're right.

956
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,792
He also waited for her
in front of the makeup room.

957
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,252
Then I see why she chose him.

958
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:22,005
-And as for Jin-taek and So-yeon…
-Well, Jin-taek has been very loyal.

959
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,924
But I'm worried.

960
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,885
We know that Jin-taek
won't change his mind,

961
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,845
-but So-yeon…
-Right.

962
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,889
I'm worried she might've just been hot.

963
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,100
You know what I mean.

964
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,476
-She just wanted to escape?
-"It's so hot here."

965
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,936
"I might as well go to the hotel."

966
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,896
-What if that's why?
-That might be true.

967
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,273
Maybe she just wanted some fresh air

968
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,316
and she's playing with Jin-taek's heart.

969
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,152
-This is what I'm worried about.
-Because Jin-taek is a safe bet.

970
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,988
I hope that wasn't the case.

971
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,073
I just wish she doesn't break his heart.

972
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,283
-Me too.
-I'm worried.

973
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,910
I also wonder what Se-hoon will do now.

974
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,163
I mean, he literally panicked.

975
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,584
He also said earlier
that he's very competitive.

976
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,585
Right.

977
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,962
I mean, he won the flag game
three times in a row.

978
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,339
That shows how competitive he is.

979
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,174
So this must be humiliating to him.

980
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,511
-I still remember
-How would he…

981
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,680
when he laughed alone
in the dorm and said,

982
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,598
"Interesting."

983
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,724
-It was sincere.
-Right.

984
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,434
I'm scared to see what will happen.

985
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,353
PARADISE

986
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,771
So this is the place.

987
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:21,982
Goodness.

988
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,911
-This place is huge.
-It really is.

989
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,248
A suite room?

990
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,212
-It's so pretty in here.
-This room is huge.

991
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,758
I think this is
the biggest hotel room I've ever been in.

992
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,310
-This place is huge.
-It's really big.

993
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,394
There's even a piano.

994
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,273
It's so nice.

995
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:04,983
DINING ROOM

996
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,443
I'd love to chill here.

997
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,195
So this is where we eat.

998
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,571
Is it not?

999
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,741
If we eat here, we'll be sitting
too far from each other.

1000
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,868
It'll be like a blind date.

1001
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,247
Paradise is completely different
from Inferno.

1002
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,750
This must be the bedroom.

1003
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,460
Is this the only bedroom here?

1004
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,253
Do we really have only one bedroom?

1005
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,800
I want to sleep.

1006
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,930
-Let's see if there's another one.
-Okay.

1007
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,184
What is this place? This place is just…

1008
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,061
My gosh. It's really huge in here.

1009
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,271
BATHROOM

1010
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,606
We should use this.

1011
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,607
Right.

1012
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,609
We shouldn't waste the opportunity.

1013
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,778
I think we can even eat here.

1014
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,072
Eat in a bathtub?

1015
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,533
There's one more bedroom here.

1016
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,910
BEDROOM 2

1017
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,620
There are two beds.

1018
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,748
You can use the other room.

1019
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,916
-I'll…
-Really?

1020
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,626
That room seems bigger and nicer.

1021
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,837
-Thanks.
-I'll use this room.

1022
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,380
-You won't regret it?
-I won't.

1023
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,844
That's a huge door.

1024
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,515
What?

1025
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:20,767
-The ceiling…
-What?

1026
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,936
The ceiling is so high.

1027
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,522
-This place is beautiful.
-Isn't it nice here?

1028
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,606
It is.

1029
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,858
I feel refreshed already.

1030
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,569
This relieves all my stress.

1031
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,612
Jin-taek's room really suits him.

1032
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,531
-It's like his home.
-I know.

1033
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,617
Jin-taek probably lives
in a house like that.

1034
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,873
SWIMMING POOL

1035
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,833
Gosh, I love the view.

1036
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,543
There's a swimming pool.

1037
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,588
I want to jump right in.

1038
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,216
-Why don't we order food and go swimming?
-It's so spacious.

1039
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,676
Sounds good.

1040
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,471
All right.

1041
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,932
You look good in pink, by the way.

1042
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,267
-Me?
-Yes.

1043
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:06,855
I put on a pink one on purpose.

1044
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,774
-On purpose?
-Yes.

1045
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,318
-Why?
-No reason.

1046
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,487
-I see.
-Because you said you liked pink.

1047
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,447
-Really?
-Yes.

1048
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,324
I like the color of your shirt.

1049
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,659
-Do you like pink?
-Yes, I like pink.

1050
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,453
-All my things are pink.
-Really?

1051
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,371
I should only wear pink.
I have a button-up too.

1052
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,081
-Really?
-Yes.

1053
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,125
He was listening.

1054
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,961
Si-hun seems to be good
at catching details like that.

1055
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,005
I love pink.

1056
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,799
Pink looks good on you.

1057
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,635
-I'm so hungry.
-Me too.

1058
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,678
I'm going to order everything here.

1059
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,473
I'm so hungry.

1060
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:45,519
Truffle mushroom soup,
seafood spaghetti with cream sauce,

1061
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,729
tenderloin steak, and sirloin steak.

1062
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,025
Coming from a deserted island,

1063
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:54,194
-I want to eat everything.
-This feels strange.

1064
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,237
INFERNO

1065
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,655
This isn't Inferno. It's Paradise.

1066
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,281
-Tell me about it.
-Right.

1067
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,866
-Let's eat outside today.
-Okay.

1068
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,826
Right?

1069
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,330
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

1070
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,249
-Good work. Enjoy.
-It looks delicious.

1071
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,710
Goodness.

1072
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,878
It's amazing, right?

1073
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,173
-Hang on. How did you make this?
-Amazing, right?

1074
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,299
Could you tell me the recipe?

1075
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,468
There's no recipe.
It's my natural cooking skill.

1076
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,178
It's my natural cooking skill.

1077
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,096
This is awesome.

1078
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:22,848
I'd pay to eat this.

1079
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,894
I love kimchi stew.
I'm glad I didn't go to Paradise.

1080
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,149
But seriously,
with the sounds of the ocean

1081
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,776
and the sunset…

1082
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,364
It tastes so good.
Seriously, the stew tastes so good.

1083
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,907
-It's really good.
-Yes.

1084
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,743
Do you know what we talked about?

1085
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,079
You were the only one
who didn't work out in the morning.

1086
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,331
-Right.
-The girls said…

1087
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,793
that you were clever.
You saved your energy.

1088
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,794
That makes sense.

1089
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,546
Is that true?

1090
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,590
Hey, what's the point of being clever

1091
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,885
when those girls who had
the coffee and brunch with me…

1092
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,220
-They went to Paradise with other dudes.
-Exactly.

1093
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,017
Maybe you were really bad
at turning on the charm.

1094
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,059
I think so.

1095
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,103
Maybe I have no charm.

1096
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,691
But you're such a great cook.
Why wouldn't they choose you?

1097
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,818
Unbelievable.

1098
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,531
-Every now and then,
-Oh, no.

1099
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:25,493
he seems to feel empty.

1100
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,413
Gosh, it smells amazing.

1101
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,206
-I'm drooling now.
-Me too.

1102
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,043
I bet no one ordered more than us.

1103
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,630
Shall we begin?

1104
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,261
How does it taste?

1105
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,643
-Does it taste good?
-Yes.

1106
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,270
May I ask how old you are?

1107
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,648
We can ask those questions now.

1108
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:56,858
What do you think?

1109
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,821
-What do I think?
-Yes.

1110
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,198
Are you 25?

1111
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,576
Am I right?

1112
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,245
-Let me guess your age too.
-Was I right?

1113
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,414
Really?

1114
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,541
-But you looked…
-Do I look that age?

1115
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,710
-I thought you were younger than me.
-I see.

1116
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,796
-I thought you were older than me.
-I see.

1117
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,422
I'm 28.

1118
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,634
How about we talk casually now?

1119
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:25,929
-Okay.
-Okay.

1120
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:26,888
Okay.

1121
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,892
So what do you do for a living?

1122
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,436
Something related to cameras.

1123
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,772
Are you a model? A celebrity?

1124
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,066
An idol singer?

1125
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,528
-I'm a beauty content creator.
-I see.

1126
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,613
-Are you a YouTuber?
-Yes.

1127
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,325
-I've been doing it for a year and a half.
-Okay.

1128
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,161
How many subscribers do you have?

1129
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,455
Five hundred thousand.

1130
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,666
Oh, so you're a famous person.

1131
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,293
I don't care.

1132
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,841
Hi.

1133
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,926
Hi, guys.

1134
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,762
I'm a YouTuber.

1135
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,764
Hi, guys.

1136
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,726
I spent four million won
on a foreign online shopping mall.

1137
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,438
This would look so nice.

1138
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,565
What do you think?
Does it look too formal?

1139
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,068
I majored in Korean traditional dance.

1140
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,946
And I graduated from Hanyang University.

1141
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:31,786
SONG JI-A, 25
BEAUTY CONTENT CREATOR

1142
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,622
I have multiple professions.

1143
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,084
Are you a fitness trainer?

1144
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:39,753
Yes.

1145
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,505
Are you a model?

1146
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,506
Also correct.

1147
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,223
I've been working as
a trainer for five years now.

1148
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:56,895
I'm also modeling
for fashion and sports brands

1149
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,397
and doing fitness photoshoots.

1150
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,984
KIM HYEON-JOONG, 28,
MODEL, FITNESS TRAINER

1151
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:04,861
I knew it.

1152
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,196
I knew it too.

1153
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,198
I knew you'd do some shooting job.

1154
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,491
Okay.

1155
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,533
I could just feel it.

1156
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,827
I guess I can't hide it.

1157
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,370
You can't hide your charms?

1158
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:15,747
Right.

1159
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,709
Why did you choose me today?

1160
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,503
You tell me first.

1161
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,879
-Me?
-Yes.

1162
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,883
Well, to me, you gave
the strongest first impression.

1163
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,804
I wanted to talk to you.

1164
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:35,975
As for the first impression,
you're the one I liked the most.

1165
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,353
But you were somehow hard to approach.

1166
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,563
So I hesitated a bit,

1167
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,816
but remember when we went to get water?

1168
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,152
We talked a bit then and you seemed nice.

1169
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,195
I see.

1170
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,823
-So I wanted to talk to you.
-Didn't we talk

1171
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,533
when I was preparing too much rice?

1172
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,951
Remember that? Yesterday?

1173
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,745
How much rice is one serving?

1174
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,747
Ten cups should be enough.

1175
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,958
-Are you from Busan?
-That's too much.

1176
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,042
It's too much.

1177
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,421
You seemed cold yesterday.

1178
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,341
You wouldn't even make eye contact.

1179
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,469
-I seemed cold?
-Yes. Totally.

1180
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,179
But I was trying to talk to you.

1181
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,722
I wanted to talk to you too,

1182
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,391
but your response was so cold.

1183
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,767
-Really?
-Yes.

1184
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:21,312
-I thought you wouldn't choose me.
-Why not?

1185
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,941
All the guys think
you're hard to approach.

1186
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,025
I see.

1187
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,027
I did too.

1188
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,530
But I'm not.

1189
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:31,906
Me neither.

1190
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,704
So why did you choose me?

1191
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:39,956
Because I like you.

1192
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,959
Oh, that's why.

1193
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,753
There's no reason?

1194
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,089
I just like you the most.

1195
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,340
I see.

1196
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,553
Weren't you confused at all?

1197
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,990
When I saw you come out earlier,

1198
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,075
I was like this.

1199
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,410
Well…

1200
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,163
I thought we might have a chance.

1201
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:21,998
-You and me?
-Yes.

1202
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:22,916
Why though?

1203
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,544
I don't know.
I didn't get to talk to you much,

1204
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,255
so it was just a gut feeling.

1205
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,215
I'm the same.

1206
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,508
-I also had that.
-Yes.

1207
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,092
So we both felt the chemistry.

1208
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,304
But seriously, I felt something.

1209
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:40,016
You said this afternoon
that you'd hang out with me.

1210
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,226
Right.

1211
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,644
That made me happy.

1212
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,312
-Were you touched?
-Yes.

1213
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:47,565
And I find men's veins

1214
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,151
really sexy.

1215
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,653
So manly.

1216
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,904
My veins are too big.

1217
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,614
I know. I saw them yesterday.

1218
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,536
-I even dated a guy because of his veins.
-Really?

1219
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,871
That's how much I like it.

1220
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,460
Right. Are you religious?

1221
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,463
-No, I'm an atheist.
-I see.

1222
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,839
-What about you?
-Me too.

1223
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,299
-I believe in myself.
-I believe in myself.

1224
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,677
-What was that?
-Hey, I just got goosebumps.

1225
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,762
I believe in myself too.

1226
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,224
It seems like we're really similar.

1227
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:22,934
How interesting.

1228
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,897
Cheers.

1229
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,989
This feels like an escape.

1230
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,324
Right. This doesn't taste like alcohol.

1231
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,659
-Right?
-Yes.

1232
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,078
-I can't believe all this is happening.
-Right.

1233
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,621
It almost feels like a dream.

1234
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:47,959
What's going to happen tomorrow?

1235
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,128
I want to come back here tomorrow.

1236
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,422
This will be hard to forget.

1237
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,507
Don't forget it.

1238
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,844
You too.

1239
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,184
This place is so different
from the deserted island.

1240
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,667
This is why they call this place Paradise.

1241
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,341
Let's celebrate our escape.

1242
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:37,717
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1243
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,222
It's so good.

1244
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,268
Try this.

1245
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,358
Is it how we thought it would be?

1246
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:54,859
Yes.

1247
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,864
Tell me your age first.

1248
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:00,907
My age?

1249
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,034
How old do I look?

1250
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:04,994
Thirty-two.

1251
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,287
Thirty-two?

1252
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,665
I'm 30.

1253
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,251
Why?

1254
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,795
-How old?
-He's 30?

1255
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,004
He's younger than me?

1256
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,798
-He's not older than me?
-Jin-taek.

1257
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,049
Thirty?

1258
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,801
Why?

1259
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,261
What's wrong?

1260
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,847
-Why are you so surprised?
-You're so young.

1261
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,808
-What?
-You're so young.

1262
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,017
I'm young?

1263
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,352
This is shocking.

1264
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,020
Really?

1265
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,232
Age doesn't matter, does it?

1266
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,610
Gosh, my face is getting too red.

1267
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,153
Is it that shocking?

1268
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:43,116
-I thought you'd be much older than me.
-Oh, I see.

1269
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,450
I'm 34.

1270
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,160
-I see.
-"I see."

1271
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,578
-Why?
-What?

1272
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,331
-It doesn't matter, does it?
-Right.

1273
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,041
Did you think I was older than you?

1274
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,713
-I did.
-Really? I see.

1275
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,716
I've never been attracted to men
who are younger than me first.

1276
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,719
But there had been some young guys
who flirted with me.

1277
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:03,678
Is that so?

1278
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:04,846
Yes. Recently.

1279
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:08,850
And I came to Single's Inferno
because I didn't want to date young guys.

1280
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,643
-Really?
-And you're younger than me.

1281
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,146
Why do you not want
to date guys who are younger?

1282
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,648
To me, communication is very important,

1283
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,944
and I don't think
I have ever connected with guys

1284
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,904
-who were younger than me.
-Statistically?

1285
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,322
Yes. But…

1286
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,117
I didn't feel that way with you.

1287
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,245
-I even thought you were older than me.
-Right.

1288
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,621
It's actually fascinating.

1289
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,417
-I can be an older man,
-Yes?

1290
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,836
a younger man,

1291
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,089
or a man of your age.

1292
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,091
Anyhow, this is a date.

1293
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,468
-Right.
-Yes.

1294
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,138
-She's older than him.
-Four years older,

1295
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:50,266
but as he said, he can be older,
younger, or a man of her age.

1296
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:54,353
-Even a man of his age. How sweet.
-He's a poet.

1297
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,440
I don't know what he actually thinks,

1298
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:01,652
-but it didn't seem to matter to him.
-Jin-taek is so sensitive.

1299
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,946
Jin-taek seems to be a very…

1300
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,282
A very sensitive man.

1301
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,910
What do you do for a living?

1302
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,954
Me? I'm…

1303
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,415
running a tailor shop.

1304
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,959
That's shocking.

1305
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,127
Why?

1306
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,505
-So you're running a store?
-Yes.

1307
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,589
You're the CEO?

1308
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:22,548
Yes.

1309
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,803
I run a tailor shop.

1310
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,890
He's running a tailor shop
at 30 years of age? That means…

1311
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,433
Good morning.

1312
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,858
And I've been running
this shop for eight years now.

1313
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:47,114
As the CEO of the store,
I'm in charge of management, marketing,

1314
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:52,286
and the styling of my clients of
various different professions and tastes.

1315
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:53,746
OH JIN-TAEK, 30
TAILOR SHOP CEO

1316
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,164
-That's so cool.
-That's really cool.

1317
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,582
That's a perfect job for him.

1318
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:01,879
I started my career at an early age.

1319
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:02,964
When?

1320
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,423
When I was 23.

1321
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,426
Did you study design then?

1322
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,012
Not really. I studied business management.

1323
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,098
I see. And?

1324
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,600
And I'm running a brand now.

1325
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,562
What do you do for a living?

1326
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,147
I run…

1327
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,735
a boxing gym.

1328
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,863
-Really?
-Yes.

1329
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,531
Are you a pro boxer?

1330
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,824
It's a boxing gym.

1331
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:30,867
My little sister is.

1332
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,703
-Oh, you have a little sister.
-Yes.

1333
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,663
-So you're running a boxing gym.
-Yes.

1334
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:44,171
I'm running a boxing gym in Daechi-dong.

1335
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:50,553
I'm the owner of the gym
and also a boxing judge.

1336
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,221
I like…

1337
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,099
jujitsu, free diving,

1338
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:58,936
tennis, golf, basketball…

1339
01:04:59,020 --> 01:04:59,979
There are so many.

1340
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,480
KANG SO-YEON, 34,
OWNER OF A BOXING GYM

1341
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,774
-That's so cool.
-She's so cool.

1342
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,234
-That's really cool.
-Right.

1343
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,653
I had no idea.

1344
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:08,988
-Looks like
-That's cool.

1345
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,907
this is more shocking to you than my age.

1346
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,408
Yes, it's more shocking to me.

1347
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,367
Is that so?

1348
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,703
This is fun.
We can talk about these things alone.

1349
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,121
And the others don't know.

1350
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:21,792
To be honest, my first impression of you
was really nice.

1351
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,920
-Really?
-Yes.

1352
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,671
I like tall women.

1353
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:26,756
I see.

1354
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:28,174
Yes.

1355
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,217
And there aren't many tall participants.

1356
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,510
-There aren't?
-No.

1357
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,887
Ji-yeon and me.

1358
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:34,138
That and…

1359
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,264
Yes.

1360
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:38,184
You have a healthy vibe.

1361
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,144
-Healthy vibe?
-Yes.

1362
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:42,313
And I liked your positive energy.

1363
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:43,397
I see.

1364
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,982
I really did.

1365
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:51,739
Cheers.

1366
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:54,951
Are you going to come here
with another girl?

1367
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,786
You're the only one
I want to come here with.

1368
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:00,998
Oh, my.

1369
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,875
You're the only one
I want to come here with.

1370
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,962
I'm sorry. I'm too old for you.

1371
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,547
I said I'm coming here only with you.

1372
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,386
So-yeon, you can't go to Paradise today.

1373
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,472
IN THE NEXT EPISODE

1374
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,890
Shall we?

1375
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,433
It hit me really hard.

1376
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,105
When I was with you,
I felt a bit uncomfortable.

1377
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:27,024
I want to be with someone
who is considerate of me.

1378
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,067
It didn't feel good.

1379
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,861
I made it clear.

1380
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:34,657
When we're together, there's no chemistry.

1381
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,451
Maybe I shouldn't have talked with her.

1382
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:41,163
I felt like something was swirling
inside my mind.

1383
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,083
The game will be changing soon.

1384
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,045
The end.

1385
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,755
That's the end of this game. The end.

1386
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:22,580
