SINGLE'S INFERNO

13
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,592
All of the one-on-one conversations
have ended.

14
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,807
Out of these three men,

15
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,768
only one…

16
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,774
will join Single's Inferno.

17
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,691
What?

18
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,151
What?

19
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,945
-This is crazy.
-My gosh.

20
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,655
-Really?
-That's crazy!

21
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,615
This is so cruel.

22
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,784
It's suddenly an audition now?

23
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,286
-What?
-This is too cruel.

24
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,915
This is insane.

25
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,250
Seriously, this is insane.

26
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,586
My gosh. Oh no.

27
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,258
I thought if I could make it out,

28
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,552
it'd have more impact.

29
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,971
I actually saw this as an opportunity.

30
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,226
A 33% chance is worth a shot, right?

31
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,393
I think it'll be fun.

32
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,606
If no one likes you,
going to Inferno would be pointless.

33
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:50,443
Of course, if there's someone
more attractive than me,

34
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,196
it makes sense for them to join instead.

35
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,241
But I wonder
if there will be someone like that.

36
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,118
They were aware.

37
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,661
Really?

38
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,204
Wow, I have goosebumps.

39
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,332
So this might surprise the viewers,

40
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,875
but we made it clear in advance

41
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,378
this would be done
in an elimination format.

42
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,922
-They all agreed to it too.
-Yes.

43
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,050
The three of them
actually found that appealing.

44
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,051
I see.

45
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,219
It means they're confident.

46
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,137
-Right.
-Exactly.

47
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,598
These three would be considered
incredibly handsome anywhere you go.

48
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,350
It makes sense they're confident.

49
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,018
They're certain they'll advance.

50
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:24,936
What's amazing is

51
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,939
the women didn't realize
there would be eliminations

52
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,816
until after the one-on-one conversations.

53
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,067
The women didn't know?

54
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,486
They assumed it was just time
to get to know them.

55
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,447
But now, they have the huge responsibility
of choosing one of them.

56
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,908
Who do you think will make it?

57
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,994
I think it'll be the second person.

58
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,745
-Because of those broad shoulders.
-Right.

59
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,038
-Yes.
-I agree.

60
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,248
I just have a feeling.

61
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,375
Seong-bo was smiling with his eyes.

62
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,502
-And his dimple.
-Yes, he has his dimple.

63
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,796
Plus, he's tall and handsome.

64
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,590
-That dimple of his…
-Seong-bo is cute.

65
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,674
-Yes.
-A cute look.

66
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,676
-He probably scored some points.
-Yes.

67
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,636
His dimple was so cute.

68
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,221
Ki-ha left a strong impression.

69
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,267
-He has a cute face and a fit body.
-Right.

70
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,268
The third person.

71
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,645
I think the women would really like him.

72
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,189
I think it'll be Ki-ha.

73
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,107
Me too.

74
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,400
-He'll join Inferno.
-Really?

75
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,651
He's suited for it.

76
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,904
I think he's suited for Single's Inferno.

77
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:16,821
He is.

78
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,698
-I agree.
-Ki-ha.

79
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:23,620
This decision will probably depend
on the preferences of the women.

80
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,458
1 HOUR AGO

81
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,253
We will now begin
one-on-one conversations.

82
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,130
KWON KI-HA & BAE JI-YEON

83
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,466
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

84
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,092
Have you been to Paradise before?

85
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,719
-Not yet.
-Not yet?

86
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,971
No, I've been on Inferno.

87
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,766
I thought you would've gone
a few times based on first impression.

88
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,267
-Really?
-Yes.

89
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,270
Is there anything you're curious about?

90
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,272
What are you usually like
in a relationship?

91
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,523
-For me…
-Yes?

92
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,277
I like it when there's good banter
in a relationship.

93
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,071
-It's important.
-Yeah.

94
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,824
I'm actually pretty playful.

95
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,828
I'm also the type
who likes to joke around a lot.

96
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,289
I enjoy playful teasing.

97
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,583
Do you express your feelings openly?

98
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,794
I'm very expressive.

99
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:17,298
So if I like someone,
I give them that certainty.

100
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,716
Yeah.

101
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,884
I see.

102
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,387
When I talked with Ki-ha,

103
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,348
I felt like our energies matched well.

104
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,101
We talked a lot about little things.

105
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,644
It was just fun.

106
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:31,729
KWON KI-HA & CHUNG YOU-JIN

107
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,691
-What are you like in a relationship?
-Me? In a relationship?

108
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:39,612
I think it's about making each other
feel comfortable and being considerate.

109
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,572
-Something like that?
-I like that.

110
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,199
-That's how I am.
-I see.

111
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,285
I tend to talk a lot.

112
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:50,456
So I'm drawn to people
who are good listeners.

113
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,874
-Wait, your hair…
-Yes?

114
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,876
-It's poking your eye.
-Can you fix it?

115
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,836
Yes.

116
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,421
How did you know? Did you see it?

117
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,506
Yes, I saw it poking right in.

118
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,841
-Thank you.
-Hold on.

119
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,217
I'll just do this.

120
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,302
Is it okay?

121
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,344
Yes, it's done now.

122
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,305
-Thank you.
-Sure.

123
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,682
Just from this short conversation,

124
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,767
I can see you make good eye contact.

125
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,685
Yeah.

126
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,354
-Right.
-And you seem to put people at ease.

127
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,439
-Really?
-Yes.

128
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,690
Thank you.

129
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,317
I think we'd have good conversations.

130
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,485
-Really?
-I feel like we'd click.

131
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,448
My first impression of Ki-ha was…

132
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,451
He reminded me of a shiny black stone.

133
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,538
"Shiny."

134
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,499
At first, he seemed rough
and rugged like a stone.

135
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,003
But he actually has
a very delicate approach.

136
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,087
KWON KI-HA & KIM HYE-JIN

137
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,630
What's your ideal type?

138
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,091
-I like fun guys.
-Fun guys.

139
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,343
-Someone who clicks with me?
-I see.

140
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,971
I like people
with the same sense of humor.

141
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,891
And I like people with unexpected charm.

142
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,227
Like they look tough
but have a soft, puppy-like personality?

143
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,899
Yes, exactly.

144
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,942
I'm like that too.

145
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,028
People often tell me
I look intimidating at first,

146
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,322
but my personality isn't like that.

147
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:09,744
Ki-ha has a sweet, gentle face,

148
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:14,082
but he has the sexiest body.

149
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,879
He has this charm
that puts people at ease.

150
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,631
Those ten minutes flew by.

151
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:26,135
Honestly, I feel like I need to
talk to him a bit more.

152
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,845
How is it?

153
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,763
HONG SEONG-BO & KIM A-RIN

154
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,723
Are you more nervous than expected?

155
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,809
Yes, more than I expected.

156
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,105
I'm usually not the shy type.

157
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,732
-Really? It's the complete opposite.
-I'm not, but here…

158
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,318
I still can't fully relax.

159
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,529
I understand. I've been there myself.

160
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,197
But you'll adjust quickly.

161
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,907
The guys here are super friendly

162
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,910
and will make you feel comfortable.

163
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,540
We've just met, so I'm not sure
if it's okay to say this,

164
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,625
but you enunciate really well.

165
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,543
-Really?
-Yes.

166
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,295
The way you speak is so clear and precise.

167
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,213
-Really?
-Yes.

168
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,506
Thank you.

169
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,634
-How is your pronunciation so good?
-Really?

170
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,594
No one's ever told me that before.

171
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,435
Hong Seong-bo stood out to me the most.

172
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,813
The main reason was
his fashion style was my type.

173
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,733
Talking to Seong-bo
was surprisingly not awkward.

174
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,152
I felt pretty comfortable.

175
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:25,987
HONG SEONG-BO & CHUNG YOU-JIN

176
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,321
Has it been fun?

177
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,073
Well, it's been fun at times.

178
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,909
But I've also had a lot on my mind.

179
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,120
What's been on your mind so much?

180
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,205
It's just…

181
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,460
You see people go or get left behind
right in front of you,

182
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,337
so it makes you think
about a lot of things.

183
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,215
What?

184
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,717
-It's just…
-Yes?

185
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,804
I just wondered
if you teach kids or something.

186
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,182
Did it feel like I was telling a story?

187
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,017
It was as if you were teaching a child.

188
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,977
-You explained things really well.
-Really?

189
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,398
The same goes for how you smile.

190
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,651
You smile a lot. It's nice.

191
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,986
I see. Thank you.

192
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,155
-You have a lovely smile.
-Thank you.

193
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,621
When he first walked in alone
and sat on the sofa,

194
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:21,125
he didn't seem to give off
that warm of a vibe.

195
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,668
That's what I felt.

196
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,672
But during our one-on-one conversation,
he smiled and engaged a lot.

197
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,466
So it was a nice surprise.

198
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,594
HONG SEONG-BO & KIM MIN-SEOL

199
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,972
You often hear
that you have a nice smile, right?

200
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,057
-Me?
-Yes.

201
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,977
People who see me in a positive light
mention it sometimes.

202
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,812
Yes, you have a nice relaxed smile.

203
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:43,898
Really?

204
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,316
-I'm the same.
-You do too.

205
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,442
-Yes.
-Yes.

206
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,277
People with nice smiles
can spot each other.

207
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,029
Right.

208
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,572
That's nice.

209
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,991
You're not having champagne,
so should we toast with water?

210
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:54,909
Thank you.

211
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,500
This is random,
but what's your ideal type?

212
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,668
-Me?
-Yes.

213
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,586
As I mentioned earlier,

214
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,257
-I like guys with nice smiles.
-Why…

215
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,175
-Why did you hesitate?
-Yes?

216
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,136
No, it's just that I said
you have a nice smile,

217
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,597
and now I'm saying
I like guys with nice smiles.

218
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,890
-It's embarrassing.
-What else?

219
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,100
-In terms of looks.
-Looks?

220
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,435
I like natural and subtle eyes,

221
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,145
not bold and defined eyes.

222
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,230
So, eyes like mine?

223
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,398
Yeah.

224
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,191
Kind of like yours.

225
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,236
What's your type?

226
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,864
To be honest, I like someone who's fun.

227
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,991
A fun person.

228
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,910
-I like people I have a good banter with.
-Exactly.

229
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,079
Someone who's calm and feminine…

230
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,706
The time for one-on-one conversations…

231
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,957
I wanted to say something.

232
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,083
-…has ended.
-Hurry.

233
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,585
I wanted to tease you.

234
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,795
-Wait for me.
-Okay.

235
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:49,880
I'll get going.

236
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,133
He said, "Wait for me."

237
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,139
I swooned.

238
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,894
Now that's all I can think about.

239
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,356
-What?
-You said you wouldn't be swayed!

240
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,608
What was that?

241
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,192
-Jeez.
-It can happen.

242
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,902
-I knew this would happen.
-Seriously.

243
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,487
I knew Min-seol would do this.

244
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,156
AN JONG-HOON & KIM HYE-JIN

245
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,490
-It was Hye-jin, right?
-Yes.

246
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,408
-Right?
-Yes.

247
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,368
You have a good memory.

248
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,495
-I couldn't remember everyone's names.
-Right.

249
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,748
But I remembered yours.

250
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,751
I heard you've been to Paradise.

251
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,835
Yes.

252
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,503
I see.

253
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,133
I guess there's someone
on the island you've been interested in?

254
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,510
Yes, there was.

255
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,304
"There was" means…

256
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,598
You went with him, but…

257
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,225
I think things might change.

258
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,102
-Things might change?
-Yes.

259
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,438
-Tell me your first impression of me.
-First impression?

260
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,900
You reminded me of a Barbie doll.

261
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:55,404
It was as if a doll had come to life.

262
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,949
Jong-hoon is good at this.

263
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,578
It was as if a doll had come to life.

264
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,579
Really?

265
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,997
Yeah, so…

266
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,502
You're the first person
out of the six to come over

267
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,545
and make me feel comfortable.

268
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,381
So I'm having fun.

269
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,466
-Really? Are you sure?
-Yes.

270
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,138
Jong-hoon seems like
a warm and caring person.

271
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,393
Appearance-wise,
I think he has the best physique.

272
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,395
He's the closest to my ideal type.

273
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,189
Do you enjoy drinking?

274
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,148
AN JONG-HOON & CHUNG YOU-JIN

275
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,902
When pairing it with food
that goes well with it,

276
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,861
I enjoy it sometimes.

277
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,614
-Does the food we have here pair well?
-Here?

278
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,117
Since I came from Inferno,
everything here tastes good.

279
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,870
It's going to disappear soon.

280
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,205
-I see.
-Yes.

281
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,665
You seem to smile a lot.

282
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,668
-I didn't realize I smiled so much.
-Right.

283
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,378
But people keep mentioning it.

284
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,712
Yes. Even before…

285
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,256
when we were over there,

286
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,299
you were sitting at the very end.

287
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,635
-Right.
-And you were smiling the whole time.

288
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,761
Yeah.

289
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,389
-I guess I smile a lot.
-That's why.

290
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,765
You seem like you'd be popular.

291
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,100
-Really?
-Yes.

292
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,603
So, what's your ideal type?

293
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,022
Someone who acts respectably.

294
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,107
Acts respectably?

295
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,570
What I mean by that is
their attitude towards life.

296
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:21,532
Someone who meets
my standards of being respectable.

297
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,826
I like polite people too.

298
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,580
When I asked about his ideal type,

299
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,500
he said he likes someone
who's polite and smiles a lot.

300
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,254
So I thought we might have similar tastes.

301
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,717
I think that might be
something we connect over.

302
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,429
You have a very gentle way of speaking.
How's your personality?

303
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,182
I'm different at work
than when I'm with friends.

304
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,267
What about when you are
with your girlfriend?

305
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,810
-With my girlfriend?
-Yes.

306
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,980
I think I'm pretty caring.

307
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,106
A thoughtful personality?

308
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,691
I try to be attentive.

309
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,862
You seem really different
up close than from afar.

310
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,280
How so?

311
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,823
From a distance,

312
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,201
you looked fierce
and kind of intimidating.

313
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,745
But up close, you're actually very cute.

314
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,413
-Really?
-Yes.

315
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,540
Cute and kind-hearted?

316
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,000
I feel happy. Is it a good thing?

317
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,460
Of course.

318
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,423
When I walked in
and saw you from a distance…

319
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,341
Yes?

320
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,718
I smiled after looking at you.

321
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,220
-Why?
-You were smiling.

322
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,554
-Really?
-Yeah.

323
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,182
-It honestly made me feel good.
-Why?

324
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:32,895
-I don't usually put much weight on looks.
-Okay.

325
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,482
But I realized I might care more
about looks than I thought.

326
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,399
Really?

327
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,236
-Is that so?
-That's why.

328
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,239
You seem to have an expressive face.

329
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,156
Thank you.

330
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,037
I could tell
he was flirting with me a bit.

331
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,582
Those little things kind of stuck with me.

332
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,294
-You can see everyone has their own charm.
-Definitely.

333
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:02,049
From the beginning,
I thought Seong-bo was cute and charming.

334
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,509
And after hearing him talk…

335
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,387
-I felt it even more so.
-Exactly.

336
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,014
-Min-seol seems to be into Seong-bo.
-Right.

337
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,057
-Yes.
-Yeah.

338
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,600
I think she'll pick Seong-bo.

339
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,269
They look great together too.

340
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,355
As for Ki-ha, it was a bit of a shame.

341
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,149
-Right.
-He seemed tense during the conversations.

342
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,736
I don't think the women
could sense his charm.

343
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,823
I'd say Seong-bo was the best
during the conversations.

344
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,575
-Yeah.
-Right, he was the most relaxed.

345
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,784
Yeah.

346
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,828
I didn't expect Jong-hoon
to be so well-spoken.

347
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,205
But he was so good it caught me off guard.

348
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,208
It was as if he put everything out there.

349
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,794
-He seemed to put in so much effort.
-That's right.

350
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,672
He seems fierce,
but he's gentle when talking.

351
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,590
Right.

352
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,174
He softens up when he smiles.

353
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,760
Yes, and he's good at giving compliments.

354
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,058
All of the one-on-one conversations
have ended.

355
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,103
Out of these three men,

356
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,855
only one…

357
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,191
will join Single's Inferno.

358
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,777
What?

359
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,863
-This is crazy.
-My gosh.

360
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,782
This is insane.

361
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,868
Seriously, this is insane.

362
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:17,207
The women will choose
that person themselves.

363
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,710
I just got chills.

364
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,671
Making us choose is so cruel.

365
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,468
The two men who are not chosen…

366
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,096
will be eliminated immediately.

367
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,014
Eliminated?

368
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,892
And they will return home.

369
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,020
It was an elimination game.

370
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,897
-This is crazy.
-I'm going to lose my mind.

371
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,981
Oh no.

372
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:46,111
Seriously, I thought it was so brutal.

373
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,739
I never even imagined it.

374
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:54,370
The thought that my choice
might send two people home

375
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,413
is a lot of pressure.

376
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,414
Seriously.

377
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,294
I had someone in mind
to go to Paradise with.

378
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,673
But now, there will be eliminations,
so I'm suddenly unsure.

379
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,341
-Yeah.
-Right?

380
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,760
Have you decided?

381
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,681
My head hurts.

382
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,933
"The person I'm interested in

383
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,852
might not be able to go
to Inferno with me."

384
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,479
That's what I was thinking.

385
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,416
Min-seol will choose Seong-bo.

386
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,501
-Right.
-Don't pretend to be conflicted.

387
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,628
Seriously.

388
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,518
We will reveal the results.

389
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,231
My goodness.

390
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,566
My goodness.

391
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,319
After receiving your votes,
the chosen man…

392
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,406
will be revealed.

393
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,784
-What?
-Is he walking in through that door?

394
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,785
My gosh.

395
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,328
Who is it going to be?

396
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,044
I voted for Kwon Ki-ha.

397
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,214
My conversation with him
was the most memorable.

398
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,299
BAE JI-YEON SELECTED KWON KI-HA

399
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,177
I voted for Hong Seong-bo.

400
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,055
My conversation with him
was the most fun and exciting.

401
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:36,972
KIM MIN-SEOL SELECTED HONG SEONG-BO

402
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,183
See? I knew that would happen.

403
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,434
They were both transparent.

404
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,560
-Yes, they were.
-Yes.

405
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:47,733
I chose Jong-hoon,
because he's closer to my ideal type.

406
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,903
KIM HYE-JIN SELECTED AN JONG-HOON

407
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,197
-The votes are being split.
-She picked Jong-hoon.

408
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,782
-It's one vote for each.
-Okay.

409
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,034
They must be nervous again.

410
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,457
I decided to vote for the person
I'd regret not connecting with more,

411
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,209
so I chose Jong-hoon.

412
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,628
LEE SI-AN SELECTED AN JONG-HOON

413
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,048
Since he felt a bit more genuine,

414
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,966
I voted for Hong Seong-bo.

415
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,968
KIM A-RIN SELECTED HONG SEONG-BO

416
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,934
I thought if I spent time
with him on Inferno,

417
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,561
my feelings could change.

418
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,438
So that's why I made my choice.

419
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,648
It all depends on this vote.

420
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,151
You-jin's unpredictable,
because we've seen her in all the talks.

421
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,152
-For all three.
-Yeah.

422
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,655
I think Jong-hoon will be chosen.

423
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,990
I think it could be Seong-bo too.

424
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,033
It'll be Jong-hoon.

425
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,701
-I think it'll be him.
-I agree.

426
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,333
The door's opening.

427
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,256
Who is it?

428
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,027
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

429
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,868
It's Jong-hoon.

430
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,996
He got half the votes.

431
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,627
You must be happy.

432
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,004
Yes, I am.

433
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,548
Thank you.

434
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,343
What a relief.

435
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,303
Yeah.

436
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,679
That's amazing.

437
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,269
-He's handsome when he smiles.
-Right.

438
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,146
He's like a tough guy with a soft side.

439
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,315
He does have unexpected charm
when he smiles.

440
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,608
It's cute.

441
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:02,284
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

442
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,165
Oh no, the tables have turned now.

443
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,792
-I'm curious who he'll choose.
-Yeah.

444
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,127
An Jong-hoon.

445
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,714
Please choose two people

446
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,758
you'd like to go
on a date with in Paradise.

447
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,675
-Two?
-What?

448
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,093
-Two people…
-Sounds fun.

449
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,846
I bet it'll be You-jin and Si-an.

450
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,890
Si-an will definitely go.

451
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,892
It'll come down to You-jin or Hye-jin.

452
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,687
He did compliment You-jin a lot,
saying she has a beautiful smile.

453
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,980
He also told Hye-jin

454
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,192
she's like a Barbie doll
that came to life.

455
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,777
The two people

456
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,198
I'd like to go on a date
in Paradise with are…

457
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,920
Kim Hye-jin.

458
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,256
Kim Hye-jin.

459
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,716
And Lee Si-an.

460
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,301
I choose them.

461
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,808
Yes, that's right.

462
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,893
But poor You-jin.

463
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,355
-Her smile didn't work this time.
-It didn't.

464
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,858
Then, why say all those things
about her smile being pretty?

465
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,903
INFERNO

466
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,363
Is it already dinnertime?

467
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,790
-Let's eat here to stay out of the sun.
-Yeah.

468
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,542
The shade's over here.

469
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,584
Should we sit in a row?

470
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,253
-Yes, let's do that.
-Okay.

471
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,006
What is this dinner?
This is driving me crazy.

472
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,173
Enjoy your meal.

473
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,466
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

474
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,801
Thank you.

475
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,887
Why do I feel so lifeless?

476
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,307
-Me too.
-I have no energy.

477
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,935
What do you think
the new guy will be like?

478
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,896
Maybe someone physically fit?

479
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,440
-And athletic?
-And he's 190 cm tall.

480
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,482
If he's 190 cm tall…

481
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,402
Are we getting someone
who's the whole package?

482
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,241
I'm curious.

483
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,536
-Who could it be?
-Right?

484
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,039
Why is everyone so…

485
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,458
-Why are they so down?
-They're so gloomy.

486
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,043
Because there are no women around.

487
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,259
-Someone's here.
-She's here.

488
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,177
She's here.

489
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,511
Someone came here too.

490
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,764
-She's here?
-Yes, as she should.

491
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,892
She needs to come
and light a fire under them.

492
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,907
I actually think
a lively person will show up.

493
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,577
Whoever it is, I have a feeling
he'll be really unique.

494
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,080
-They have no idea.
-No idea.

495
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,248
-They're talking about the new guy.
-Yeah.

496
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,709
-Out of nowhere.
-The vibe is about to change.

497
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,057
Who is that?

498
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:16,853
Hello.

499
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,105
-Have a seat.
-Hello.

500
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,022
Goodness.

501
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,358
-Come in. Have a seat.
-Hello.

502
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,447
Who is it?

503
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,867
I thought someone
had returned from Paradise.

504
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,410
But as she got closer,

505
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,496
she was a beautiful stranger,
so I was surprised.

506
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,289
Hello.

507
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,294
Hello, my name is Park Hae-lin.

508
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,547
-She's really pretty.
-Wow, she's pretty.

509
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,800
If I had to describe
my personality in one word,

510
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,969
I'd say I'm cool
and quick to acknowledge things.

511
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,555
But I'm also very cute and sweet.

512
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,686
My attractive features
are my tall height and great figure.

513
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,939
I'm very outgoing,

514
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,067
so I may seem
like a bulldozer on the outside.

515
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,361
But when I'm around someone I really like,

516
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:11,366
I get nervous and a little bit awkward.

517
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,201
When I flirt

518
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:18,665
and make the person blush from shyness,

519
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,333
it makes my heart race.

520
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,796
-Hello.
-Can I sit here?

521
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,174
-Have a seat here.
-Okay.

522
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,842
Have a seat here.

523
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,137
She had exotic features
and looked incredibly beautiful.

524
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,182
Perhaps she's the most beautiful one here?

525
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,935
Her looks left a very strong impression.

526
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,687
She had very big and pretty eyes.

527
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,149
I think the vibes on Inferno
will definitely change a lot.

528
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,405
What's your name?

529
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,199
I'm Park Hae-lin.

530
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,534
And it's "Hae," not "Hye."

531
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,452
Yes.

532
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,038
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

533
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,334
The vibe completely changed.
We were all sitting back like this.

534
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,295
-She smiles a lot.
-She does.

535
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,174
It's hot.

536
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,846
Did you have dinner?

537
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,140
I only had lunch before coming.

538
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,809
Maybe you should have this.

539
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,519
In that case…

540
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,146
Would you like something to eat?

541
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,275
Just a glass of water, please. Thank you.

542
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,031
He's quick.

543
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,785
Since when did you
move that quickly, Te-hwan?

544
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,870
Why is he being so active?

545
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,460
-We were all very bored.
-Okay.

546
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,754
Now that you're here, we're all smiling.

547
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,674
-We thought a new guy was coming.
-Right.

548
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,677
-We were so certain.
-We were totally convinced.

549
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,844
Why?

550
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,848
Because currently, there are
five men and six women.

551
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,268
Then, that side might add two men…

552
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,352
It's possible.

553
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,145
What do you mean by "that side"?

554
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,483
All of the women here
left for Paradise together.

555
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,113
Just the women?

556
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,114
All of them.

557
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,824
Really?

558
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,784
Then, it's just us today?

559
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:18,868
Who knows?

560
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:19,869
More could arrive.

561
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:20,912
We can't tell.

562
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,622
I guess we really can't tell.

563
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,624
Our predictions have all been off.

564
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,668
What other predictions did you make?

565
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,254
"A 188 cm-tall, brawny guy will arrive."

566
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,589
-At least 188 cm tall.
-Right.

567
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,049
-At least 190 cm.
-And muscular.

568
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,884
Honestly, I was so happy.

569
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,638
Only the guys are here right now.

570
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,599
I thought, "Maybe I'll stand out more."

571
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,144
I just wanted one-on-one time
as soon as possible.

572
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,231
One fits my ideal personality type,
and the other is my type appearance-wise.

573
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,775
I want to get to know those two better.

574
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,778
What do you think of her?

575
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,115
Her first impression seemed to be
the best out of everyone so far.

576
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,159
-Right.
-I think…

577
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,665
She'll be great as the game changer.

578
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,126
Right? She's so bright too.

579
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,255
-She has a lot of the traits guys like.
-Yeah.

580
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,548
She does.

581
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,260
Her personality
and the way she responds is great.

582
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,598
She seems to take initiative too.

583
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,976
And appearance-wise? What about her looks?

584
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,645
In terms of appearance,

585
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,148
she's close to my ideal type.

586
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,525
Yeah, she seems like your type.

587
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,446
She has a sexy yet cute vibe.

588
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,573
-That kind of vibe?
-Yeah. That's why.

589
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:43,244
In terms of looks,
she's the closest to my ideal type.

590
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,373
She's super charming.

591
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,667
Earlier, when we took that polaroid photo…

592
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,962
Is there a reason
why you're staying in a line?

593
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:53,880
No, there isn't.

594
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:54,881
What should we do?

595
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,841
-Should we gather?
-Tell us what you want…

596
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,426
Should I take the photo from here?

597
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,928
I'll go to the back.

598
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,389
Is that good?

599
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,849
Two, three.

600
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,189
She looked like a celebrity
doing a photoshoot.

601
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,066
Yeah, I thought she was a celebrity too.

602
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,025
It's amazing.

603
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,528
-She's different.
-She's cool and has good style too.

604
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,322
The girls don't know about this.

605
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,532
Yeah. It's a bit…

606
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,201
-This will make them nervous. Right?
-She's pretty strong.

607
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,744
That's what I think.

608
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,997
None of the women have this vibe.

609
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:32,293
Jeong-su doesn't fall
for people that easily or quickly,

610
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,379
but he said she was his ideal type.

611
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,090
And instead of having an aloof vibe,

612
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,592
she's sociable
and gets along well with others.

613
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,678
-So it makes her more attractive.
-Right.

614
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,895
-Hello.
-I saw you only took beer with you.

615
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,939
-Amazing.
-It's just…

616
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,316
It seemed you couldn't eat
while we were all talking.

617
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,234
Incredible.

618
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,360
-Later…
-Yeah?

619
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,488
You might get really hungry.

620
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,782
This could be your last supper.

621
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,617
What do you think?

622
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,246
A little different from what you expected?

623
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,748
Yes.

624
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,542
-Why are you speaking formally?
-Yeah.

625
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,377
1 HOUR AGO

626
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,005
-Everyone's still speaking formally?
-Yes.

627
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,132
We don't know
each other's ages or anything yet.

628
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,050
Let's speak casually.

629
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:21,968
Really?

630
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,095
But…

631
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,930
Are you sure about that?

632
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,348
Go ahead.

633
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,727
-I kind of…
-Yeah.

634
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,688
I needed time like this.

635
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,064
Right.

636
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,651
It's warm here.

637
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,654
-It's fine as long as there's no wind.
-Exactly.

638
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,033
-It's dark now, so we can't see the view.
-Right.

639
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,076
It's beautiful during the day.

640
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,121
-There's not much to see though.
-Yeah.

641
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,456
But my view isn't bad.

642
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,958
-The view.
-This view.

643
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,585
-My gosh.
-What?

644
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,295
-I'm so touched.
-Wait.

645
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,880
-I like that.
-Move over a bit.

646
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,590
-I want to see the view there.
-Okay.

647
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,474
How was Paradise?

648
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,309
Paradise?

649
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,019
It was nice.

650
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,063
Was it nice?

651
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,148
How did you end up there?

652
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,819
I just ended up going
due to circumstances.

653
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,488
-Circumstances?
-Well, I guess not due to circumstances.

654
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,656
I did choose to go.

655
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,245
Seriously? "Circumstances"?

656
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,373
Jeong-su has a tendency
to avoid giving straight answers.

657
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,541
Why are you mad, Da-hee?

658
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,334
-It's not that.
-Why are you upset?

659
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,461
-He wants to make a good impression.
-Right.

660
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,089
-But that excuse was a weak move.
-Yeah.

661
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:45,218
That's why he corrected himself
after saying that.

662
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,804
That's how much he likes Hae-lin.

663
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,723
Who you go with definitely matters though.

664
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,559
After going there twice…

665
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,435
-Was it totally different?
-Yeah.

666
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,062
-It felt completely different.
-Right.

667
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,940
With one person,
we came back as close friends.

668
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,401
-Close friends?
-We'd punch each other's shoulders.

669
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,444
-Like this.
-And with the other person?

670
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,197
I talked a lot with her.

671
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,574
I see.

672
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,075
What's she like?

673
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,913
She has a different vibe from you.

674
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,164
She's gentle?

675
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,292
-A little.
-Pure and innocent?

676
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:18,918
Is that her vibe?

677
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,545
Is your vibe different from that?

678
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,629
I…

679
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,632
wouldn't call myself innocent.

680
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,550
Right.

681
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,385
Am I asking too many questions?

682
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,386
Not at all.

683
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,055
I'm just a curious person.

684
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,266
The wind's blowing your hair.
Are you okay?

685
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,895
The wind's blowing your hair.
Are you okay?

686
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,273
There's not much to fix though.

687
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,653
-Can you keep an eye on my hair?
-Okay.

688
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,238
I'll keep checking on it.

689
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,324
Nice.

690
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,410
So there's no one
you're interested in yet?

691
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,162
Well…

692
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,206
We're still getting to know each other.

693
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,501
-Right.
-Honestly, I just came back from Paradise.

694
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,503
Yesterday was my first night on Inferno.

695
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,341
I met some for the first time yesterday,
and some I haven't even talked to yet.

696
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,385
-So…
-Okay.

697
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,600
The person I'm interested in…

698
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,517
Yeah.

699
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,272
How about you?

700
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,234
Me too. Actually…

701
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,988
I feel like…

702
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,114
Jeong-su…

703
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,867
I feel like you'd be older than me.

704
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,869
I just assumed. I'm sorry.

705
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,540
Appearance-wise,
you're closest to my ideal type.

706
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,458
-Really?
-Yeah.

707
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:46,965
When you smile, you have dimples or…

708
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,216
What do you call these?

709
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,094
-Smile lines?
-Dimples?

710
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,805
Yeah, I like not only the dimples
but that kind of face too.

711
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,014
Thank you.

712
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,141
So, there you go.

713
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,771
I'm flustered.

714
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,147
-Really?
-What?

715
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,693
Really? Did I come on too strong?

716
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,278
-But honestly…
-Yeah?

717
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,366
Out of everyone I've met here,

718
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,327
you're my ideal type
when it comes to looks.

719
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,912
-Really?
-Yeah.

720
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,081
What's your ideal type in terms of looks?

721
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,793
I don't know.

722
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,878
-I just thought you were pretty.
-Really?

723
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,714
-I just thought you were pretty.
-Really?

724
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,631
Nice.

725
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,549
Right?

726
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,802
That's why…

727
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,971
I guess we should talk more.

728
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,055
Right, we should.

729
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,224
-We need to get to know each other.
-Yeah.

730
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,601
Am I moving too fast?

731
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,936
No, we have to move fast.

732
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,106
You would need to act fast.

733
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,817
Yeah.

734
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,278
I think I have to be.

735
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,906
I thought so. That's why I told you.

736
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,324
I mustered up the courage.

737
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,080
You need to fight for love.

738
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,459
Isn't that what I'm doing?

739
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,460
You are.

740
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,423
Right.

741
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,675
What?

742
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,933
Things are picking up speed, aren't they?

743
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,018
Seriously.

744
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:26,981
As a guy, if someone like Hae-lin
was being adorable like that around me,

745
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,858
-I'd be captivated.
-Exactly.

746
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:33,529
Since they both are beautiful people,

747
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,406
they must have
a lot of experience in this.

748
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,993
That's why they seem
so natural and experienced.

749
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,622
There's no awkwardness or shyness at all.

750
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,791
Yeah, since they are so beautiful,

751
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,251
they're open about their feelings
instead of hiding them.

752
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,252
-But…
-I think…

753
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,421
We don't know
her ideal personality type yet.

754
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,464
Yeah, we have to see.

755
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,381
-Right.
-Yes.

756
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,634
Right now,
the vibes are great between them.

757
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,427
Hello.

758
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,595
What were you up to?

759
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,138
I was just patiently waiting.

760
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,476
So how has it been here?

761
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,980
Is there anyone you'd like to get to know
who seems like a good match?

762
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,275
If I'm being honest…

763
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,863
So Dong-ho… What should I call you?

764
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,989
Just Dong-ho?

765
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,825
Whatever's comfortable.
You can be informal.

766
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,742
Mr. Dong-ho.

767
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,578
That's way too formal.
You might as well bow.

768
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,039
Personality-wise,
you left a good impression.

769
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,415
The best out of everyone.

770
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,084
So…

771
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,337
I was just thinking…

772
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,465
These conversations went on
longer than I expected.

773
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:40,054
So I was wondering if I should talk
to everyone first and speak to you last.

774
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,430
As your main dish?

775
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,349
Or as your amuse-bouche?

776
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,517
What are you talking about?

777
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,977
I'm just kidding.

778
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,061
That was funny.

779
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,606
So I considered it, but I decided
to see you as fast as I could.

780
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,609
It was fascinating though,

781
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,946
because the guys
were already close to each other,

782
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,739
but you weren't awkward about it.

783
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:04,996
I found that aspect
both fascinating and attractive.

784
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,123
That's how I've felt from the start.

785
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,881
-How would you describe your personality?
-Me?

786
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,591
Yeah, be honest.

787
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,760
-What do you think?
-I've been genuine this whole time.

788
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,513
I mean, we all subconsciously
want to make a good impression.

789
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,514
That's how I am.

790
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,684
I won't deny doing that too.

791
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,312
Normally, I'd just sit like this.

792
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,147
But I looked this up online.

793
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,441
-Normally…
-Why would you look that up?

794
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,861
I looked up "cool guy poses,"
and it suggested this one.

795
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,197
-What is that?
-Sit up straight.

796
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,448
-Like this?
-Yeah.

797
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,158
It told me to sit like this, so I did.

798
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,910
-He even looked that up?
-Really?

799
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,203
I see.

800
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,120
Like this?

801
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,540
Anyway…

802
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,793
My personality…

803
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,670
I think…

804
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:59,675
I'm a perfectionist
when it comes to things I care about.

805
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,221
That goes for both work and relationships.

806
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,849
Once I'm hooked on a certain thing,
that's all I tend to focus on.

807
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,894
What about you? What do you think
your personality is like?

808
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:14,523
I'm the opposite,
but I think that makes things even better.

809
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,152
That's right.

810
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,905
When it comes to work,

811
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,366
I always have
a ton of things I want to do.

812
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:27,828
Having someone by me to keep me grounded

813
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,706
is something I've always needed.

814
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,333
-That's so interesting.
-Yeah.

815
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:37,380
Seeing how you have fun
and talk comfortably with men,

816
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,091
I feel like you'd get along well
with the other women too.

817
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,968
No one's caught your interest yet?

818
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:47,431
Well, it's more about how
someone you're interested in

819
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,058
won't always be a perfect match.

820
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,394
True, and it's only been a short time.

821
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,939
I tend to get caught up
in things unnecessarily.

822
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,191
And I've had
some emotional highs and lows.

823
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,069
I've asked others for advice too.

824
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,698
But they usually approached things
in an easygoing way.

825
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,702
I'd worry about them alone
and think I had to see things through.

826
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,954
-So I'd wait for them. And then…
-So who is it?

827
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,415
-I used to do that.
-Who is it?

828
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,958
I used to.

829
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,042
-And then…
-So who is it?

830
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,336
-I used to do that.
-Who is it?

831
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,796
I used to.

832
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,799
-On the fourth day…
-I'm kidding.

833
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,259
You're making me flustered.

834
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,595
You caught me off guard.

835
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,806
Dong-ho is so cute.

836
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,683
He's falling apart.

837
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,519
Yeah, Dong-ho has this type of cute charm.

838
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,398
It must've been tough.

839
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,442
-It's not tough.
-The past three days. Be honest.

840
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,320
I mean, it's Inferno.

841
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,281
And now?

842
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,077
Right now, it's…

843
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,580
Did I catch you off guard again?

844
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:02,131
Hae-lin's date with Dong-ho
has a different type of charm.

845
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,467
I found this date more enjoyable.

846
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,303
And the probable reason for that is

847
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,056
Dong-ho's always had a poker face
no matter who he spoke with.

848
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,099
-That's right.
-He always kept it together.

849
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,227
He lost his composure
for the first time in front of Hae-lin.

850
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,228
He was flustered.

851
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,065
His face lightened up,
and he started smiling.

852
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,816
-Right.
-And his eyes softened.

853
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,401
This is…

854
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,945
I think he's forgotten about A-rin.

855
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:25,946
He's erased her.

856
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,990
His eyes are practically
filled with hearts.

857
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,826
PARADISE
AN JONG-HOON & LEE SI-AN

858
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,078
It looks delicious.

859
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,288
-Enjoy your meal.
-You too.

860
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,498
You must be hungry.

861
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,832
Yes, I'm very hungry.

862
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,917
It looks delicious.

863
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,217
So, how old are you?

864
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,803
-Thirty…
-Thirty-two.

865
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,262
-I see.
-Yes.

866
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,558
What do you do for work?

867
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,228
I own a restaurant.

868
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,899
I'm the owner
of a restaurant in Apgujeong.

869
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,111
Currently, I'm running two restaurants.

870
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,906
On the first floor, we have a pub
with Hong Kong fusion cuisine.

871
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:13,411
In the basement, we have a pub
inspired by Japanese restaurants.

872
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:17,581
AN JONG-HOON, AGE 32
RESTAURATEUR

873
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,545
Was there a reason why you chose me?

874
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,883
During those ten minutes,

875
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,262
time flew by the quickest with you.

876
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:36,767
It really went by in an instant.

877
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,185
-Really?
-Yes.

878
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,395
The fastest out of all six.

879
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,231
It was such a shame.

880
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,067
I wanted to talk with you more.

881
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,402
We were the last ones, right?

882
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,361
Yes.

883
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,118
-What was your first impression of me?
-First impression?

884
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,162
Yours was the best.

885
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,747
-Really?
-Yeah, you were smiling brightly.

886
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:03,085
You were in the center.

887
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:08,841
I saw someone in a white outfit
smiling so brightly at me.

888
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,843
That was you, Si-an.

889
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,848
That's why I thought this could be fun.

890
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,766
I wanted to go to Inferno with you.

891
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:23,022
-Should we…
-Should we talk casually?

892
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,149
-Sure.
-Let's do it.

893
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,066
Okay.

894
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,821
Earlier,

895
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:35,951
when the six of you were taking turns,
I just couldn't wait to talk to you.

896
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:39,788
-Really?
-Yeah.

897
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,044
Yeah, I couldn't wait.

898
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,462
-You're so honest.
-Yeah.

899
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:49,965
I see.

900
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:55,930
My date with Si-an
was a bit awkward at first,

901
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,599
but once we revealed our jobs
and spoke casually,

902
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,601
it felt really comfortable and fun.

903
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:05,898
PARADISE
AN JONG-HOON & KIM HYE-JIN

904
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,983
-Do you like tomatoes?
-I love them.

905
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,068
Really?

906
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,614
I'll cut them up for you.

907
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,199
Thank you.

908
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,035
Would you like me to cut these too?

909
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,550
Why did you choose me?

910
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,054
I usually don't focus on looks,

911
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:41,392
but you were the most beautiful to me.

912
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,518
-Really?
-Yeah.

913
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,689
So…

914
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,316
Should we talk casually with each other?

915
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,276
Sure.

916
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:56,073
I thought talking casually
would help us get closer faster.

917
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,658
I totally agree.

918
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,076
-Yeah.
-Definitely.

919
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:03,914
I'm sure we'll gradually
get to know each other as we talk more.

920
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,041
But from my first impression of you,
I thought,

921
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,544
"It might be hard to approach her."

922
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,754
That's what I thought.

923
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,756
You…

924
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,466
To be honest…

925
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,677
You know those bar snacks we had earlier?

926
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,137
-The desserts?
-Yeah.

927
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,305
"Bar snacks."

928
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,807
It's what I call them at work.
So we had those desserts.

929
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:26,145
No one else took a bite of them
except for you.

930
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,771
-Really?
-Yeah.

931
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,065
They were there for us to eat.

932
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,776
-Yeah, exactly.
-I wanted to eat them so bad.

933
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,364
Yeah, and when I watched you eat,
I thought it was really cute.

934
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,657
I thought it was really cute.

935
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,075
-Really?
-Yeah.

936
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,787
How has it been on Inferno?

937
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,581
Inferno?

938
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,166
You can eat first.

939
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,376
-Okay.
-Have some water too.

940
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:57,009
You looked like someone
who would be aloof.

941
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:02,348
It looked like you'd be
that kind of person,

942
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,268
but you didn't hesitate to try
and make me feel comfortable.

943
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,355
That left a great impression on me.

944
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,442
I'm excited about Inferno too.

945
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:16,737
It must be romantic
with the view of the ocean.

946
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,865
-It's fun.
-Is it?

947
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,992
-Yeah, it's going to be fun.
-I also…

948
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,328
Yeah, I'm so excited.

949
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:30,793
On my date with Hye-jin,
it felt comfortable from the start.

950
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:34,838
She was a great listener
and easy to talk to.

951
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,341
We had a fun time.

952
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,929
Jong-hoon has such a unique charm.

953
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,473
Depending on the angle, his face looks…

954
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,474
-Different?
-Yeah.

955
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,433
You're right.

956
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,935
He has a variety of looks.

957
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,896
He looks totally different
with and without glasses too.

958
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,816
And he reminds me a bit of ASMR videos.

959
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,652
-He speaks slowly and quietly.
-It makes you focus.

960
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,363
He talks slowly, so that makes you focus.

961
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,364
It's so laid-back.

962
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:04,618
Jong-hoon went on a date
with both Si-an and Hye-jin.

963
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,620
Who do you think he likes more?

964
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:11,166
He doesn't seem to be
leaning either way, so I'm not sure yet.

965
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,503
Exactly.
I feel like he likes them equally.

966
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:19,508
I think he's keeping his options open
with both Si-an and Hye-jin.

967
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,385
-Are you copying Jong-hoon?
-Yes.

968
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,430
Let's speak softly too.

969
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,806
So people can focus.

970
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,141
It really works.

971
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:35,607
INFERNO

972
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,403
I don't have the energy
to peel this sweet potato.

973
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:52,291
I was waiting for Si-an and Min-seol.

974
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:57,504
I assumed the ladies
who left for Paradise would return today.

975
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,845
I was waiting for Si-an,
but she wasn't coming.

976
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,479
We were so happy being in Paradise, right?

977
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,689
-It was so nice.
-So nice.

978
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,317
Hi, Inferno.

979
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,902
-Hi.
-We're back.

980
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,404
They're back.

981
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,323
They're coming.

982
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,825
There's only three of them though.

983
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,784
Why?

984
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,369
Why?

985
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,580
What's happening here?

986
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,374
-Hi.
-Hi.

987
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,918
How have you been?

988
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,587
-Where's everyone else?
-What's going on?

989
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,756
-Why are there only three of you?
-And the others?

990
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,174
We have a lot to tell you.

991
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,383
-What is it?
-Come on in.

992
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,676
Did something happen?

993
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,136
We have a lot to tell you too.

994
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,554
Something happened.

995
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,848
-Have a seat.
-What's going on?

996
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,350
-Hold on.
-Have you eaten?

997
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,852
No, we're really hungry.

998
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,438
That looks delicious.

999
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,032
We're seeing each other a lot.

1000
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,242
You're right. We are.

1001
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,660
A lot.

1002
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,704
As soon as I returned,
Jun-seo seemed really happy to see me.

1003
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,373
Maybe because it had been a while?

1004
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,417
He seemed
just a tad more enthusiastic than usual.

1005
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,961
At least that's how I felt.

1006
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,464
Can you explain what happened?

1007
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,382
Yeah.

1008
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,510
Well, after leaving…

1009
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,553
-You mean us?
-Yeah.

1010
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,929
After you left…

1011
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,347
-A new girl…
-A girl…

1012
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,474
-A new girl…
-A girl…

1013
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,560
-She suddenly came.
-One woman.

1014
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,563
Seriously? You're not lying?

1015
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:43,610
Then, did she go to Paradise
with the other two guys who were here?

1016
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,280
Yeah, she took two of the five guys here.

1017
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,031
Dong-ho and Jeong-su left.

1018
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,368
-Dong-ho and Jeong-su.
-They left in the morning.

1019
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,328
-Morning?
-Right.

1020
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,415
EARLIER THIS MORNING

1021
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,457
Finally.

1022
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,293
We're going.

1023
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,210
We are.

1024
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:05,132
How does it feel
to have two men by your side?

1025
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,216
It feels great.

1026
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,637
-Let's go.
-Finally, let's go.

1027
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,347
-Let's go.
-I'm so excited.

1028
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,981
-Today?
-This morning.

1029
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,691
-This morning?
-Just moments ago.

1030
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,862
I was sure Dong-ho
would be here when I returned.

1031
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:30,115
I came back hoping to talk with him more.

1032
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,533
But it was such a letdown.

1033
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:36,955
I'm interested in Te-hwan,
so since he was still here,

1034
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,708
I felt relieved.

1035
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,463
-You must be nervous.
-Seriously.

1036
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,381
I'm a little nervous now that I'm here.

1037
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,343
"Professions and ages cannot be revealed."

1038
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,471
INFERNO RULES
PROFESSIONS AND AGES CANNOT BE REVEALED

1039
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,306
Wait, what?

1040
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,519
-They're here.
-They're here.

1041
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,105
Hello.

1042
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,607
Hello.

1043
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,776
They're here.

1044
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:06,693
They're back.

1045
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,862
They look really friendly.

1046
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,449
-Hello.
-Hello.

1047
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,409
-I thought it was Jeong-su.
-Right?

1048
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,745
I'm Jang Theo. Nice to meet you.

1049
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,914
-Hello, I'm An Jong-hoon.
-Jong-hoon.

1050
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,708
-Nice to meet you. I'm Yuk Jun-seo.
-Hello.

1051
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,959
-Hello.
-Hello.

1052
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,711
I'm Kim Te-hwan.

1053
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,589
-I'm An Jong-hoon.
-Jong-hoon? Nice to meet you.

1054
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,591
Nice to meet you. Where should I sit?

1055
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,095
Is this seat taken?

1056
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,472
There's an empty seat. You can sit here.

1057
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,688
Should I move over there?

1058
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,608
Thank you.

1059
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,613
He has a great physique.

1060
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,990
If I have to face off against him,
I'd probably lose,

1061
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,325
so I have to be cautious.

1062
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,163
Is he here to fight?

1063
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,373
-My gosh!
-Is that it?

1064
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,125
Why is he only thinking about fighting?

1065
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,377
-He's so hilarious.
-Seriously.

1066
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,754
He's on the verge of battle.

1067
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,047
He's ready to fight.

1068
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,926
Jong-hoon has newly arrived,
but I'm not wary or worried.

1069
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,886
We have totally different
attractive qualities.

1070
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,180
So I doubt our likes will overlap.

1071
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,765
As soon as Jong-hoon arrived,

1072
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,727
I introduced myself to him
while looking at Si-an.

1073
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,769
The end.

1074
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,314
-What did you do?
-Think about you.

1075
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,232
Seriously.

1076
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:28,984
So annoying.

1077
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,319
Where are the other guys?

1078
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,238
Everyone, listen.

1079
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,866
-They said a female game changer is here.
-Right.

1080
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,117
A female game changer's here.

1081
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,285
What?

1082
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,163
And she left with two guys.

1083
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,416
-Who?
-Jeong-su and Dong-ho.

1084
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,667
I see.

1085
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,128
-Dong-ho and Jeong-su.
-I see.

1086
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,463
When did they go?

1087
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,131
-This morning.
-This morning.

1088
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,674
They were gone when we woke up.

1089
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:53,967
-They were gone?
-Yeah.

1090
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,929
-I'm sure they'll come back tomorrow.
-I see.

1091
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,390
Since they left today,
they'll be back tomorrow.

1092
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,978
She's still thinking about Jeong-su?

1093
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,980
-She must have feelings for him.
-She does.

1094
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,315
Seriously? Still?

1095
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,400
Jeong-su…

1096
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,820
I tried to play it cool.

1097
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,363
He has good manners,

1098
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,824
and he has a way
of making women feel special.

1099
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,785
So it bothered me a little.

1100
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,286
Asking her to put
sheet masks on him

1101
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:24,831
or massaging her hands
when she's nauseous on the helicopter…

1102
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,750
I'd like him to not do those things.

1103
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,463
Really?

1104
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,256
Her feelings have become stronger.

1105
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,677
I think she tried to move on,
but she wasn't able to.

1106
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,514
That first experience
left an intense impression.

1107
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,484
-You have napkins?
-Yeah.

1108
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,152
-Are you all done, Jun-seo?
-What?

1109
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,570
-Are you done?
-Yeah, I'm done.

1110
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,617
Hold on.

1111
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,452
-Did you get something on you?
-Thank you.

1112
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,704
-Did you get something on you?
-Thank you.

1113
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,565
What?

1114
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,316
-What is this, a drama?
-He looks so pure.

1115
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:34,776
He looks so wistful.

1116
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:39,656
It seems Si-an already has
strong feelings for Jeong-su though.

1117
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,994
So unless Jun-seo picks up the pace,
it might be hard for him to win her back.

1118
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,204
By the way,
Theo is also only committed to her.

1119
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,123
Right. Si-an is so popular.

1120
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,124
Yeah.

1121
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,876
Four guys are interested in her.

1122
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,377
What's Theo going to do?

1123
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,046
He's so relentless. "What did you do?"
"Think about you."

1124
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,090
Yeah, that was a bit much.

1125
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:01,094
If he's not careful, that could come off
sounding like a robot…

1126
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,804
Or it could sound too unserious.

1127
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,222
Exactly.

1128
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,808
Theo is in a rush too.

1129
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,602
-He's being genuine though.
-Yeah.

1130
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,448
Let's make up for the fun
we couldn't have yesterday, Te-hwan.

1131
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,075
This water gun packs a punch.

1132
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,328
So this is how you shoot.

1133
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,829
This is how you do it, Te-hwan.

1134
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,089
You're brave.

1135
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,342
-You looking for trouble?
-It's no big deal.

1136
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,761
How courageous. You came right in.

1137
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:43,678
Well…

1138
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:47,641
-Nice to see you.
-What's the big deal?

1139
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,269
They seem to love the water
like a bunch of seals.

1140
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,479
I want to get on this.

1141
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,730
Let's do it.

1142
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,065
One, two, three.

1143
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,692
-Oh no.
-You flipped it, didn't you?

1144
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,569
You flipped it.

1145
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,364
Okay.

1146
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,117
Min-seol.

1147
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,787
She's thinking, "Having fun?"

1148
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,789
This one's better. It won't tip over.

1149
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,209
Get on it like a mermaid.

1150
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,878
-How?
-Climb up.

1151
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:17,879
That's it.

1152
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,635
-Nice.
-That hurts.

1153
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,095
Hey, you scraped yourself.

1154
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,262
-Yeah.
-Are you okay?

1155
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,430
No, not really.

1156
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,766
Are you going to be okay?

1157
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,601
Yeah. Hold on.

1158
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:36,398
Hold on. Let me sit nicely.

1159
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,565
Hold on.

1160
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:42,612
When Jun-seo was loitering around Si-an…

1161
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,115
"Loitering around"!

1162
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,744
"Loitering around." That's so hilarious.

1163
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:53,206
When Jun-seo was loitering around Si-an,

1164
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,333
I thought, "Sure, go and get to know her."

1165
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,919
"You won't find anyone more fun than me."

1166
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,340
That really is perfect.

1167
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,634
What are you doing?

1168
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,220
Hey.

1169
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,973
How can you grab my hair?

1170
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,516
-Wait.
-It's already thinning a lot.

1171
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,643
Hold on.

1172
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,062
Watch out. I'm guarding with my feet.

1173
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,192
-What are you doing?
-I don't know.

1174
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,821
Hey, don't look so jealous.

1175
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,322
-What?
-I couldn't put on sunblock.

1176
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,532
What did you say?

1177
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,700
Aren't those mine?

1178
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:29,909
These are yours?

1179
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:30,827
What are you doing?

1180
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,996
I mean, they all look the same.

1181
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,205
I'm going to borrow these.

1182
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,540
-Go ahead.
-Those are Jun-seo's?

1183
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,042
-I guess so.
-Put these on too.

1184
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,836
You want me to hold onto them?

1185
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:44,215
I realized I laugh the most
when I'm with this person.

1186
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,426
I laugh without thinking about it.

1187
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,387
I'm so frustrated right now.

1188
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,433
She's so lovable.

1189
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,976
-She really is adorable.
-So cute.

1190
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,148
Here, we have fruit…

1191
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,399
-Are you okay?
-What?

1192
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,068
Was the water okay? You're not cold?

1193
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,652
-I'm freezing.
-You are?

1194
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,738
Let's get a solo shot of you.

1195
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,697
-A solo shot?
-Yeah.

1196
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,158
-I'm shy. I like taking pictures.
-Camera?

1197
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,493
Want me to take one for you?

1198
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,786
Yeah.

1199
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:15,955
That was too quick.

1200
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,082
No, it'll come out great.

1201
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,125
It was a good angle. An aerial shot.

1202
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:22,837
Hye-jin, look at me.

1203
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,632
That made me swoon.

1204
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,549
Me too.

1205
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,635
-Right?
-"Hye-jin, look at me."

1206
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,053
Hye-jin, look at me.

1207
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,855
That's what a boyfriend would do.

1208
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,857
Yeah, they're totally like a couple.

1209
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,859
"Hye-jin, look at me."

1210
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,695
Let's go eat.

1211
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,697
-What's for dinner tonight?
-Let's open it.

1212
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,659
What is it? Budae-jjigae?

1213
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,495
-Budae-jjigae.
-Yes! It's something spicy.

1214
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,081
Thank you.

1215
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,588
What do I use to scoop the rice?

1216
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,756
-What do I use?
-It's there.

1217
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,216
It's in there.

1218
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,134
The rice paddle.

1219
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,052
It wasn't there.

1220
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,429
-I didn't see it.
-Aren't the utensils there?

1221
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,389
You're right.

1222
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,808
Do you have tunnel vision?

1223
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,518
It's right here.

1224
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,191
-All set?
-Yeah.

1225
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:26,818
Take one more.

1226
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,865
-Rice first?
-Do you eat a lot of rice?

1227
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,616
Yeah.

1228
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,201
-Do you want a lot?
-Yeah.

1229
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,329
-More?
-No.

1230
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,748
Eat up. You went swimming too.

1231
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,675
How much do you want?

1232
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,601
-A little.
-A little?

1233
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,227
-Yeah.
-How little?

1234
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,562
-Up to here.
-Half a bowl?

1235
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,148
Do you want more rice?

1236
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,694
He's like a puppy.

1237
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,238
Theo is so solely committed to her.

1238
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,951
Do you like ham?

1239
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:17,952
Yeah, I do.

1240
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,954
I'll scoop your bowl.

1241
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,516
How much ham are you eating?

1242
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,395
I'm a carnivore. Here you go.

1243
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,317
I'm so hungry.

1244
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,741
I have so little.

1245
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,660
-It's so little.
-Right?

1246
00:58:58,743 --> 00:58:59,786
-This is…
-Give it to me.

1247
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,703
Give it to me.

1248
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,957
-Someone said you weren't eating much.
-This is so unfair.

1249
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,000
You have a bunch of rice.

1250
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:07,418
Right?

1251
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,838
Who served Jun-seo's soup?

1252
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:11,923
Who scooped my bowl?

1253
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,676
Careful.

1254
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:20,348
-Why did I even come?
-Right? Thanks.

1255
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,183
Ridiculous.

1256
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,653
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy!

1257
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,364
Wow, someone served me a pile of rice.

1258
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,576
Eat up.

1259
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,461
-You're really enjoying it.
-What?

1260
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,755
It's good.

1261
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,302
-You want some?
-There were quail eggs?

1262
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,761
-Yeah. Want some?
-I'll take one.

1263
00:59:58,845 --> 00:59:59,804
They're really good.

1264
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,017
Thank you. I'll get you some more later.

1265
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,060
-I'll find them all.
-They're really good.

1266
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,937
I'll scrape the bottom for every last one.

1267
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,858
Are we always out of side dishes?

1268
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:12,942
-There's kimchi.
-Kimchi.

1269
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,444
-Kimchi?
-Unbelievable.

1270
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,070
I'll grab some kimchi.

1271
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,782
-Jun-seo is being so active.
-He's so active.

1272
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,960
This kimchi tastes so good.

1273
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,045
Eat up.

1274
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,512
-Te-hwan, could you give me some napkins?
-Sure.

1275
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,807
-I'll give you a bunch.
-Yeah, that's good enough.

1276
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,559
Thanks.

1277
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:04,786
But why only for me and Hye-jin?

1278
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:05,828
What?

1279
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:09,082
You're the only ones within my reach.

1280
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,634
What was that?

1281
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,553
Did you see that last part?

1282
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,888
-The cup.
-So subtly.

1283
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,139
He moved her cup a bit.

1284
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,308
-"I did something too."
-"I can help too."

1285
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,309
I missed it.

1286
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:31,688
-He was worried the cup was in her way.
-Yeah.

1287
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:32,855
-That was cute.
-Look.

1288
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,530
He moved it a centimeter.

1289
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,408
-"Yes, I did something for her."
-Seriously.

1290
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,451
Why are they all so adorable?

1291
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,411
This is crazy.

1292
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,912
-That's hilarious.
-I love it.

1293
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,998
When you like someone,
I guess you start acting cute.

1294
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,418
It's sad how we can see those moments,

1295
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,962
but the person they're meant for
doesn't see them.

1296
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,380
-I bet Si-an didn't know.
-Right.

1297
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,090
-No, she didn't.
-She didn't.

1298
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:03,970
I don't think Si-an
is into either Jun-seo or Theo.

1299
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,596
-Si-an?
-Yeah.

1300
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,016
But with Jun-seo,
she went to give him extra food.

1301
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,352
-That's more of a friendly gesture.
-Really?

1302
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:14,439
I think her heart's set on Jeong-su.

1303
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,733
She doesn't have feelings for Jun-seo?

1304
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,276
I think she does.

1305
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,277
Not at all.

1306
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,361
-Not even a bit?
-Really?

1307
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,279
Not at all.

1308
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,822
-Zero feelings.
-It's friendship.

1309
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:23,781
They're just friends?

1310
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,742
There's no romantic spark between them.

1311
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:26,701
-Really?
-None.

1312
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,244
Absolutely zero.

1313
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:31,247
But then, there's Theo
who has his eyes on Si-an…

1314
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,249
-Jun-seo has his eyes on Si-an.
-And Jun-seo.

1315
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,585
-And Min-seol has her eyes on Jun-seo.
-Right.

1316
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,962
Everything's so entangled.

1317
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,256
It's so complicated.

1318
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,552
What is it?

1319
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,387
What snacks do we have?

1320
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:48,806
Amazing.

1321
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:50,933
Sweet potatoes!

1322
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,978
They're good.
They're a bit soggy but still good.

1323
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,104
You're enjoying it a lot.

1324
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,189
You're not full?

1325
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:57,815
Do you want anything?

1326
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,317
Just a little bit of this.

1327
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,530
I want to talk too.

1328
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,990
-What?
-I want to talk too.

1329
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,700
-Then, hurry up and go.
-What?

1330
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,579
Be a man and say, "Hey, let's go."

1331
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:12,830
No, that's not it.

1332
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,874
What are you talking about?

1333
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,626
He wants to talk to her, right?

1334
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,753
Si-an is pretty busy.

1335
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,046
What are you talking about?

1336
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,633
-It's fine.
-Come here.

1337
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:25,259
Okay.

1338
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,096
What place isn't windy?

1339
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,723
A place just for us.

1340
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,060
It's been a while.

1341
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,270
-I missed it a bit.
-You missed me, right?

1342
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,480
A little bit.

1343
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,899
I didn't say a word yesterday
since you weren't here.

1344
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:40,900
Yesterday?

1345
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:41,984
Yesterday was…

1346
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,278
They asked why I was suddenly being quiet.

1347
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,615
They said I perked up after you showed up.

1348
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,158
-They pointed it out.
-Really?

1349
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,127
I was looking at that yesterday.
Beautiful, right?

1350
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:02,880
It's so beautiful.

1351
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:03,798
Yeah.

1352
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,842
Should we just go to the train?

1353
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,802
-What?
-Should we watch the sunset from there?

1354
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:08,845
Sounds good.

1355
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,597
It's so beautiful.

1356
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,520
-I'm cold.
-You are? That's why I brought two.

1357
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,564
Really? What are they?

1358
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,399
-My hoodies.
-Why two of them?

1359
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:24,402
It would be better
to drape this over you, right?

1360
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:25,987
-Right? To keep warm?
-Yeah.

1361
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,071
Go ahead.

1362
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,951
You can wear it like a cape.

1363
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:33,744
Like this.

1364
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,080
My neck's a bit…

1365
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:37,748
It looks good on you.

1366
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,292
-Thanks.
-It's totally my style.

1367
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,835
Yeah, thanks.

1368
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,046
-Do whatever feels comfortable.
-Like this.

1369
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,050
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1370
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,022
-What?
-Why are you looking at me?

1371
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:03,608
I was watching the sunset,
and you were just there.

1372
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,360
-Right. I'm looking at the sunset too.
-Yeah.

1373
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,072
It's so beautiful.

1374
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,282
-Right?
-Yeah.

1375
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,038
So beautiful.

1376
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,041
I said, "So beautiful."

1377
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,042
What?

1378
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,045
Thank you.

1379
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,339
-I was talking about the sunset.
-Right?

1380
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,009
It's nice to hear that after so long.

1381
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,427
-It's been a while.
-Right?

1382
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:37,099
It feels like you're finally letting out
everything you'd been holding back.

1383
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:43,689
If I was like this in front of the others,
it could've made you uncomfortable.

1384
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,650
So I kept quiet.

1385
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,238
-Don't you agree?
-Yeah, you did well.

1386
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,827
I didn't even get to say bye yesterday.

1387
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,829
-I bet you missed me.
-Right.

1388
01:05:58,913 --> 01:05:59,789
Yeah.

1389
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,291
You're right.

1390
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,211
-I left without even seeing you yesterday.
-That's right.

1391
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,296
How did you feel? Were you nervous?

1392
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,298
No. Why would I be nervous?

1393
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,426
Why not? The game changer arrived.

1394
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,972
Do I seem like I'd be nervous?

1395
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,598
Jeez, you're annoying.

1396
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,353
Did you eat well in Paradise?

1397
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:24,647
-In Paradise? Yes, very well.
-Yeah.

1398
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,025
-Was it different from when we went?
-Completely different.

1399
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,735
But…

1400
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,406
the food we ate tasted better.

1401
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,491
How cute.

1402
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:46,460
I'm feeling embarrassed.

1403
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,005
-Really? I like that.
-Yeah.

1404
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,673
No, not in that way.

1405
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,508
-You're so…
-I got it.

1406
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,847
After washing up yesterday,
I was so bored.

1407
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:58,764
Right.

1408
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,976
But the flowers were so pretty.

1409
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,188
So I thought of picking one for you.

1410
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:12,862
But they were stuck on too tight,
so I couldn't pick them.

1411
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:14,947
The flowers here?

1412
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,657
Yeah, ones like these.

1413
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,868
But I managed to pick one.

1414
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,661
-Why?
-To give it to you.

1415
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:24,874
Your ring.

1416
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,751
Let me see your ring.

1417
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,170
And here's your flower ring.

1418
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:30,671
Isn't it pretty?

1419
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:39,513
I knew you'd react like this.
That's why I made this yesterday.

1420
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:40,598
Really?

1421
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:42,516
What is this?

1422
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:54,195
Wear it and throw it away later, okay?

1423
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:56,447
Throw it away before we head back.
They might laugh.

1424
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,656
-I'm not going to.
-No?

1425
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,784
No. I'm going to wear it.

1426
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,707
When did you even make this?

1427
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,626
Last night.

1428
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:10,711
-You came here?
-I was walking around here alone.

1429
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,674
LAST NIGHT

1430
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,586
I used nail clippers
to smooth out the sharp edges.

1431
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,340
-That's some real dedication.
-It really is.

1432
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:57,716
That is so touching.

1433
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,634
-Yeah.
-Right.

1434
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,721
Seriously. My goodness.

1435
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,394
It's cute.

1436
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,896
I wasn't sure if this was okay to do.

1437
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,025
But you mentioned
you wanted a romantic and happy life.

1438
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,612
What's your goal? What's your dream?

1439
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,114
DAY 2 - DINNERTIME IN PARADISE

1440
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:22,408
I want to live a romantic and happy life.

1441
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,160
I like that.

1442
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,163
-Good job.
-Right?

1443
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:30,040
I remembered that, so I thought
it was okay to make this for you.

1444
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,459
Good job. Seriously.

1445
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,718
I do admit this is a bit annoying.

1446
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,678
Yeah.

1447
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,847
-Good job.
-Right?

1448
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,141
Yeah. I'm touched.

1449
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,771
-Wow, a flower ring.
-Wow, a flower ring.

1450
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,282
The sky's turned red.

1451
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:05,451
-It's so pretty.
-Right?

1452
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:06,368
It is.

1453
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:10,664
Should we take a selfie?

1454
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,624
Sure.

1455
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,753
One, two, three.

1456
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:21,800
Let's take one more.

1457
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,760
-No.
-Why not?

1458
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,220
I'm going to keep this one.

1459
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:25,638
I'll keep it just for myself.

1460
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,806
-I'll give it to you later.
-Okay.

1461
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:35,773
That's so romantic.

1462
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,359
-Yeah, it is.
-He's so cool.

1463
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,194
This is true love.

1464
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:43,197
I think Si-an does have feelings for him.
But she doesn't?

1465
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,742
Did you see Si-an's expression
as she slowly became mesmerized?

1466
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,452
She was genuinely touched.

1467
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:52,206
To me, this feels a bit
like the calm before the storm.

1468
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,124
Theo is so cool though.

1469
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,502
This is what I think about Si-an.

1470
01:10:56,585 --> 01:11:01,507
She likes and appreciates
how Theo actively expresses his feelings.

1471
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,551
But it seems she wants to
get to know others more.

1472
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:05,970
She's curious about Jeong-su.

1473
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:11,433
I got the sense
that she has a lot on her mind.

1474
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,602
Theo is so cool though.

1475
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:16,981
I'm slowly getting tipsy.

1476
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:19,191
Really? Slow down.

1477
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,068
Am I really red?

1478
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:22,486
-You're not that red.
-Really?

1479
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,738
Why do I feel like I'm super red?

1480
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:25,656
Really?

1481
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,161
-Are you cold?
-No, I'm fine.

1482
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,705
You're okay? Want my jacket?

1483
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,164
I'm not cold right now.

1484
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,417
Really? I'll let you know if I get cold.

1485
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,002
Let me check.

1486
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:40,671
Let me check.

1487
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,339
You really aren't that cold.

1488
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:43,882
-I'm still fine.
-No goosebumps yet.

1489
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,009
I'm still okay.

1490
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:47,678
Tell me if you get cold.
I'm totally fine right now.

1491
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:54,226
What's the longest relationship
you've ever had?

1492
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,728
The longest I've had was two years.

1493
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:56,687
-I see.
-Yeah.

1494
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:00,149
And after that, two recent ones
each lasted a year.

1495
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,066
I see.

1496
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,277
-We've followed a similar pattern.
-Really?

1497
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,947
When I'm in a relationship,
that's all I focus on.

1498
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:12,286
I've always been too devoted
and passionate in relationships.

1499
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,370
Me too.

1500
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,043
I'm curious about how devoted you become.

1501
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,003
When I fall for someone, I fall hard.

1502
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,254
-Really?
-Yeah.

1503
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,341
But the same goes for the other person.

1504
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,717
-Really?
-They fall hard too.

1505
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,926
Yeah? You're that charming?

1506
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,553
-You're confident?
-Of course.

1507
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,432
I've only shown 10% of my true self here.

1508
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,350
Really?

1509
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,602
-Show me a little more then.
-Okay.

1510
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,437
-Take it out and show me.
-Yeah.

1511
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,606
My heart.

1512
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,985
No? Let me cancel that.

1513
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,406
-So cute.
-The quick cancel was a good one.

1514
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,743
I just thought of something.

1515
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:55,162
-Do you usually wear glasses?
-Yeah.

1516
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:56,372
-Really?
-When I drive.

1517
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:59,041
-I bet you look great in them.
-Really?

1518
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,835
I'll show up to breakfast tomorrow
with my glasses on.

1519
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,003
-Really?
-Yeah.

1520
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:05,756
I bet they'll suit you.

1521
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:09,093
Wear whatever you think looks best on you.

1522
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:10,427
-Got it.
-I'm so curious.

1523
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:11,553
You've worn contacts…

1524
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,555
-I wear contacts.
-For eight years, right?

1525
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,682
How long have you had contacts? Ten…

1526
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:18,018
-I've never mentioned that.
-Really?

1527
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,061
What?

1528
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,773
My goodness.

1529
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:24,400
I've never mentioned that.

1530
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,609
Really? No, you--

1531
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:28,070
Which other girl
are you confusing me with?

1532
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:30,364
No, when we talked last night
in your room, you…

1533
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,825
I never said anything about eight years.

1534
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,661
Someone knock him out already.

1535
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:39,123
Did I even mention wearing contacts?
I don't think so.

1536
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,501
Who are you confusing me with?

1537
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,253
-I'm sorry.
-And right to my face too?

1538
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,170
I'm sorry.

1539
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,591
I think I just made a guess.

1540
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:50,509
-Really?
-Yeah.

1541
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,553
-I didn't confuse you with anyone.
-Really? Okay.

1542
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,597
Since I feel sorry, I'll drink.

1543
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,141
-Is it a penalty drink?
-Yeah.

1544
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,725
Let's drink together. Cheers.

1545
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,856
Who did he hear that from though?

1546
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:07,359
He was just trying to prove
he remembered something about her.

1547
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,154
So he pulled out some random thing
he heard somewhere.

1548
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:12,072
He said a mistake.

1549
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,158
He tried to prove himself
and kind of messed up.

1550
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:16,452
-Te-hwan seems like the younger one.
-He totally does.

1551
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,829
-He keeps wanting to prove himself.
-Right.

1552
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:21,665
It's pretty obvious.
He's trying to show how cool he is.

1553
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:23,417
He wants to appear manly.

1554
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:27,337
-As long as Ji-yeon likes him, it's fine.
-Yeah, what matters is them.

1555
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,007
-Gosh.
-Did you drink a lot?

1556
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,967
-I've just been drinking this one can.
-Really?

1557
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,052
-Are you going to finish it?
-Of course.

1558
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,429
"Of course."

1559
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:37,431
Real men don't back down.

1560
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,434
Don't back down and keep drinking then.

1561
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:41,435
Okay.

1562
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:46,106
Still, we went to Paradise
and had such a blast, right?

1563
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,566
-It was really fun.
-I enjoyed it.

1564
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:50,402
That's why I kept thinking
about you a bit.

1565
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,862
-Really?
-I thought…

1566
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:54,031
"Maybe she's in a bad mood today."

1567
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:55,240
-Really?
-Yeah.

1568
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,868
You were so quiet during lunch.

1569
01:14:58,785 --> 01:14:59,786
You sat there like this.

1570
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,622
I talked a lot with everyone
except for you.

1571
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:02,539
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

1572
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:03,665
Why didn't you talk to me?

1573
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,000
I thought you were avoiding me.

1574
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:08,670
Really? I kept my attention on you
and asked if you were okay.

1575
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,964
-When?
-You didn't notice?

1576
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,257
"Are you okay?"

1577
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,885
"Eat up."

1578
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:17,513
Really? I had no idea.

1579
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,556
You know how I mumble to myself.

1580
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,682
"Min-seol, eat up."

1581
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,684
Exactly. How would I know if you do that?

1582
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:23,685
Right?

1583
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,230
We went to Paradise together

1584
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,148
and didn't even know
you told me to eat up.

1585
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,274
Exactly.

1586
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,026
I was keeping an eye on you.

1587
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:34,071
I'll be watching now
with all of my senses on alert,

1588
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:35,656
so you better keep it up.

1589
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:37,115
Got it?

1590
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,744
Yeah.

1591
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:42,371
That is so funny.

1592
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,165
-But…
-Yeah.

1593
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:47,167
-Want to hear something funny?
-What?

1594
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:50,379
When we went to Paradise,
I was basically the only one talking.

1595
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:52,881
-Yeah.
-But now, you're the only one talking.

1596
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:53,924
It's because I'm drunk.

1597
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:55,259
You were drunk then too.

1598
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:56,343
-I was?
-Yeah.

1599
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,221
-"I was?"
-"I was?"

1600
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:00,138
"I was?"

1601
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:01,723
"So I can't?"

1602
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:05,060
-Are you really drunk?
-Can't you do more of the talking?

1603
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:06,270
-Me?
-Yeah.

1604
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:09,398
-That's easier, right?
-You're charming when you talk a lot.

1605
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,360
It's not that you just talk a lot.

1606
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:14,528
You make it fun to listen.

1607
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,780
-It depends on who…
-People need to see that side more.

1608
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:17,698
-Really?
-Yeah.

1609
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:20,701
In my opinion,

1610
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,119
after seeing you all day today…

1611
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:24,621
-You look the most relaxed right now.
-Really?

1612
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,290
I'm the most at ease with you.

1613
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:27,541
-Me too.
-Yeah.

1614
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:31,587
Mentally, I feel really comfortable
and not worried about anything.

1615
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,380
Exactly.

1616
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:36,258
When I'm with you,
it feels like an actual getaway.

1617
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,261
-Should I be happy about that?
-And you're really…

1618
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,221
You know what I really liked about you?

1619
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,764
-What?
-Well…

1620
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,433
I wasn't going to mention it.

1621
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:46,476
But for a woman, by my standards…

1622
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,772
you get ready so quickly.

1623
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,233
Just bam, bam, and you're done.

1624
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:54,651
-With what?
-Getting ready.

1625
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,486
-Like doing my makeup?
-Yeah.

1626
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,405
I love that.

1627
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:01,742
Is she supposed to feel good about that?

1628
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,328
That's an interesting expression
on her face.

1629
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:06,830
Is that a good thing?

1630
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:08,373
It's the best thing, kid.

1631
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,833
It's one of your strengths.

1632
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:10,792
"Kid"?

1633
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,629
Are you going to start swearing at me now?

1634
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,256
-You might start swearing soon.
-Hey, Min-seol.

1635
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,508
It's a good thing.

1636
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:19,676
-Really?
-Yeah.

1637
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,387
Is there anyone else you want to talk to?

1638
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,142
Anyone you want to chat with
before you leave?

1639
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:28,352
Well…

1640
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:29,686
Si-an.

1641
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,937
-Si-an?
-Yeah.

1642
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,272
You should go talk to her then.

1643
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,398
I know.

1644
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,733
I'll go talk to Theo too.

1645
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,151
With Theo? Should we switch then?

1646
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:37,402
Yeah, you want to?

1647
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,570
Where are they now?

1648
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,113
-Over there.
-They are? Let's go.

1649
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:41,573
Let's talk a bit more and go.

1650
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,116
You said you wanted to go.

1651
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,242
When did I say that?

1652
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,536
-I asked who you wanted to talk to.
-Really?

1653
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,211
It seems Min-seol has realized something.

1654
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,463
-It's his tone and calling her "kid."
-He said "kid."

1655
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:58,256
I can't believe how transparent he is.

1656
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,135
-You can tell from what he says.
-Right.

1657
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,471
But I like that about him.

1658
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:08,225
He could've tried hanging onto Min-seol,

1659
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:10,477
but he doesn't flirt with her.

1660
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,770
-Yeah.
-Right.

1661
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,563
-It shows he's…
-He honestly likes Si-an.

1662
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:14,940
He's honest.

1663
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:20,779
What do you think?
You've had the most dates so far.

1664
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,156
-I'm so curious about how you feel.
-Me?

1665
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,034
-Why aren't you saying anything?
-First off…

1666
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,495
I didn't even have time to talk.

1667
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:31,081
-Too busy being dragged around everywhere?
-It's so…

1668
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:33,792
Is it still Theo?

1669
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:38,922
Theo was the only one
I chose to go to Paradise with.

1670
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:39,840
That's true.

1671
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,260
But he never confuses me.

1672
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:44,177
Yeah.

1673
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:46,555
But…

1674
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:50,851
A part of me still likes Jeong-su…

1675
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,061
-When you're about to forget, he pops up.
-His impact…

1676
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:56,732
My first date in Paradise
left such a big impact.

1677
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,610
In any case, you've leaned towards Theo.

1678
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:04,865
Yeah, that's right. My feelings
are leaning towards Theo right now.

1679
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:07,826
Seriously,
Theo doesn't pressure me at all.

1680
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:08,744
I thought so.

1681
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:12,372
He doesn't ask how my other dates were

1682
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,208
or who I might be interested in.

1683
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,753
"I like you. What about you?"
There's nothing like that.

1684
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:20,255
-If you hear things like that…
-It could put pressure on you.

1685
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:21,506
-It can be a lot.
-Yeah.

1686
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,842
It could feel uncomfortable.
But he doesn't do that.

1687
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,844
He just expresses his feelings.

1688
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:28,513
He's like, "I like you and only you."

1689
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,182
-That's it.
-That's all he says.

1690
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,685
It's cool.
That's what I find cool about him.

1691
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,439
He's basically implying
he doesn't care who you like.

1692
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:38,940
Because he just likes you.

1693
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:43,028
He just always tries to keep me at ease.

1694
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:47,699
Those kind of things are pretty touching.

1695
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,535
It feels genuine to me.

1696
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,746
-So that opens up my heart.
-Right.

1697
01:19:54,664 --> 01:19:58,126
There's no one else here
you need to talk to then, right?

1698
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:59,377
-Right.
-It's just Theo.

1699
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,295
Yeah.

1700
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:02,255
Theo and… Well, no one here.

1701
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,175
-"No one here."
-She said, "No one here."

1702
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:07,260
Jun-seo isn't even on her radar.

1703
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:10,138
I guess not. That's surprising.

1704
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:13,308
-It's a little…
-I said let go!

1705
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,268
What on earth?

1706
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,145
-Si-an, where were you?
-I saw that.

1707
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,939
Where were you? We were looking for you.

1708
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:20,857
-Stop lying!
-Hey, tell her.

1709
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,818
He wants to talk. That's why we came.

1710
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:23,944
Really? I was here.

1711
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:25,362
We found her so easily though.

1712
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:27,197
-That's no fun.
-Right?

1713
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,532
You were looking for her?

1714
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:29,533
Want more drinks?

1715
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:30,450
Sure, whatever.

1716
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:32,244
"Sure, whatever."

1717
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,788
That's how Jun-seo talks to Min-seol.

1718
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:35,747
-Yeah.
-That's right.

1719
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,290
-"Sure, whatever."
-That tone.

1720
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:38,917
What kind of couple talks like that?

1721
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,255
You…

1722
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,256
It doesn't matter.

1723
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,341
Sorry for the informal tone.

1724
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:48,677
Go ahead.
We've been talking casually since before.

1725
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,975
The breeze feels cool and nice.

1726
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:59,813
-You let your hair down.
-That's right.

1727
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:02,566
Before I came, I was debating
whether to cut my hair or not.

1728
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,359
I ended up not cutting it.

1729
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:06,319
But now, it's out of control.

1730
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,321
The thing is
I want to try and straighten it.

1731
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:09,823
-Right?
-Totally.

1732
01:21:09,906 --> 01:21:12,200
I've tried using a straightener.
It didn't work.

1733
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,118
-It didn't?
-Nope.

1734
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,536
I'll straighten it for you later.

1735
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:17,539
-Seriously, you should come over.
-I want to make it totally straight.

1736
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:18,456
-You do?
-Yeah.

1737
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,457
What about tomorrow?

1738
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,375
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah.

1739
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,168
-Sure.
-Come over tomorrow morning.

1740
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:23,670
You come over.

1741
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:24,838
-I have to come?
-Of course.

1742
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:27,090
Right, I should go
since I'm the one who needs it.

1743
01:21:27,173 --> 01:21:28,133
That's right.

1744
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,260
Right, I could go too.

1745
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:34,097
-Yeah, just come over.
-I'll go.

1746
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,807
-With a little volume?
-A little.

1747
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,309
-You definitely need some.
-Right.

1748
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:38,518
I'll add some for you.

1749
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,400
How are things?

1750
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:47,235
Have you narrowed down who you like?

1751
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,034
Who is it? Can I ask?

01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,862
