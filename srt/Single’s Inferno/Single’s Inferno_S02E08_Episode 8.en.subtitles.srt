The person I would like
to go to Paradise with is…

15
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:12,489
The person I would like
to go to Paradise with is Han-bin.

16
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,950
HANHAE, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

17
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,077
What?

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,039
She gave up.

19
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,252
The person So-e has chosen is…

20
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,713
Han-bin.

21
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,008
Han-bin.

22
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,886
Han-bin.

23
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,013
Han-bin, please come outside.

24
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,598
-She wants to have fun.
-Meet So-e.

25
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,266
-Bye.
-And leave for Paradise.

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,353
I hope you remember how to make rice
with the cauldron.

27
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,938
Gosh, we have a problem now.

28
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,653
So-e's choice is quite…

29
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,490
unexpected. Very unexpected.

30
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,579
Hi.

31
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,957
Let's have some fun.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,083
Okay.

33
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,044
-You going to carry it?
-Of course.

34
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,421
-Let's go.
-This small bag seems jam-packed.

35
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,298
-Yes, it's heavy.
-Let's go.

36
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,804
-Hey, we're wearing the same colors.
-We are.

37
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,847
What a coincidence.

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,433
-Let's have fun.
-Good.

39
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,227
We'll swim and eat lots of good food.

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,147
I can't believe I got this chance
because I won first place.

41
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,275
If you came in third,
I wouldn't be going with you right now.

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,070
-Let's have a good time.
-Sounds great.

43
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,493
-They're not going as a couple.
-Right.

44
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,288
Isn't this a lie…

45
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,040
She's just fooling herself.

46
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,002
I mean, this was really unexpected,

47
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,420
-but this is…
-No.

48
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,797
-…a very good choice.
-Me too. I feel better now.

49
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,842
-I can relax and watch.
-No, this is So-e lying to herself.

50
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,886
-I don't think this is right.
-I mean…

51
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,515
Yoong-jae made it clear how he feels,
so why should So-e cling to him?

52
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,600
But just now,

53
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:09,272
she was about to say "Jo," as in
Jo Yoong-jae, but then went with Han-bin.

54
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,065
That was the only choice for her.

55
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,984
Maybe she didn't want to pressure him.

56
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,613
Maybe she didn't
want to appear clingy anymore.

57
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,740
But I think this is a sadder situation.

58
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,699
I agree.

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,787
Next is second-place winner, Min-su.

60
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:30,710
Min-su, please name the person
you would like to go to Paradise with.

61
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,175
I was in third place.

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,511
I do have three choices in mind.

63
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:45,266
But to be honest, I'm not interested
in either of my second and third choices.

64
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,854
If I had come in first place,
I would've chosen Jin-young.

65
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,314
I'm just curious…

66
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,693
about everything regarding Jin-young.

67
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,924
I'm so anxious.
I think it's going to be Jin-young.

68
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,219
I think she's going
to choose someone else.

69
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,521
The person I want
to be in Paradise with is

70
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,107
Jin-young.

71
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,693
Jin-young.

72
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:45,576
The person Min-su has chosen is Jin-young.

73
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,036
-Please come out
-Really?

74
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,999
-and leave for Paradise with Min-su.
-This can't be happening.

75
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,126
This is crazy.

76
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,544
Jin-young.

77
00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:00,174
Jin-young, please come out
and leave for Paradise with Min-su.

78
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,759
You can choose the same person again.

79
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:06,055
That means she likes him enough
to go with him two days in a row.

80
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,473
She only has eyes for him.

81
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,936
She likes him that much?

82
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,789
Let's go.

83
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,762
-Let's drink today.
-Okay.

84
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,014
Let's drink
and have an honest conversation.

85
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,307
-I'd like that.
-You would?

86
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,224
Yes.

87
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,022
Jin-young kind of beat around the bush
when he expressed what he wanted.

88
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,649
-But Min-su still chose him.
-She seems determined.

89
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,443
-She goes head-on.
-Right.

90
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,111
Min-su's doing her best

91
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,739
-to get the person she likes.
-I agree.

92
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,533
-Right. And Min-su is being honest.
-Yes.

93
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,246
I did think they'd get along
in terms of personality.

94
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,123
-True.
-Really?

95
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,793
They joke around a lot.

96
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,046
Really? Both of them
must be really playful, then.

97
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,300
They have good chemistry.
After joking, they always share a laugh.

98
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,810
Lastly, the third-place winner is Nadine.

99
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:39,941
Nadine, please name the person
you would like to go to Paradise with.

100
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,200
-Poor Nadine.
-Oh, dear.

101
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,326
What's she going to do?

102
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,745
Who is Nadine going to go with?

103
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,123
I don't know who she should call.

104
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,459
Nadine will choose Se-jun or…

105
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,212
-I don't think she'll choose Se-jun.
-Not Se-jun.

106
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,548
-No, it's either Jong-woo or Dong-woo.
-Right.

107
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,674
I don't know.

108
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,592
No, not Jong-woo.

109
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,261
Please don't. I have a bad feeling.

110
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,097
-Why would you say that, Seul-ki?
-Please.

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,850
Nadine's choice is the most unpredictable.

112
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,893
What if she goes with Jong-woo?

113
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,687
-Never.
-It's most likely you.

114
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,105
-You're the most likely.
-Never.

115
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,190
-Wait.
-Jong-woo's hoping it's anyone but him.

116
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,358
Right.

117
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,943
Nadine, don't choose Jong-woo.

118
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:35,288
The person I want
to go to Paradise with is

119
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,540
Yoong-jae.

120
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,921
Yoong-jae?

121
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,092
The person that Nadine has chosen is

122
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,011
Yoong-jae.

123
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:55,558
Yoong-jae, please come out
and leave for Paradise with Nadine.

124
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,726
Have fun.

125
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,314
You two haven't talked that much.

126
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,524
Yoong-jae.

127
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:09,363
Yoong-jae, please come out
and leave for Paradise with Nadine.

128
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,302
-Shall I carry it for you? Is it heavy?
-No, I got it.

129
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,678
You were shocked, right?

130
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,306
I mean, I was a little surprised, but…

131
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,060
-Give it to me. I'll carry it.
-I'm fine.

132
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,479
-This is heavy.
-It's fine. Let's go.

133
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,235
You took a very long time.

134
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,904
-I was really…
-It was hard to decide?

135
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,865
-And we never really talked.
-Right.

136
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:53,866
It was just…

137
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,038
Everything got so complicated.

138
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:04,126
I think these two will probably develop
some chemistry once they start talking.

139
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,044
But, I--

140
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,923
And Nadine knows that Jong-woo
already has feelings toward Seul-ki.

141
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:09,840
Right.

142
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,676
She wanted Jin-young, but he left.

143
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,262
-Yes.
-That just left Se-jun and Yoong-jae.

144
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:18,224
-Right.
-But Se-jun is still a bit shy.

145
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,394
-So I guess there was no other choice.
-Yes.

146
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,062
What's for sure is

147
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:27,608
these three couples will be
drinking a lot in Paradise today.

148
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,449
This concludes
the couple matching to Paradise.

149
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,830
Shall we just sleep?

150
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,749
Shall we just go to sleep?
The weather is gloomy anyway.

151
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,251
This is fun.

152
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,423
I don't even feel
like eating anything today.

153
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,382
Right.

154
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,845
It's going to be fun today, though.
We'll make delicious food.

155
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,269
You smell like Yoong-jae.

156
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,688
-Is that Yoong-jae's?
-Yes.

157
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,109
Let's change into comfy clothes.

158
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,780
-Comfy.
-Comfy. Just comfy.

159
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,706
Let's have something to eat.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,544
Hey, why is the weather so gloomy today?

161
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,212
-Right.
-It's so gloomy.

162
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,089
-Why am I so sad?
-What's wrong with us?

163
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,091
But I like it when it rains.

164
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,428
He would like everything.
Even if there was a typhoon.

165
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,763
Why is Jong-woo so funny?

166
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,266
-I wonder what the ingredients are today.
-Me too.

167
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,934
Hey! It's pork belly.

168
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,019
-What? No way.
-What?

169
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,729
-What?
-This is amazing.

170
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,606
Is this for real?

171
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,441
-What?
-Wait.

172
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,400
Really?

173
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,654
Dinner's going to be amazing.

174
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,865
How about we do this?

175
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,534
One plain pork belly dish,
one gochujang pork belly.

176
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,495
Who wants to cut up the pork?

177
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,663
-I'll do it.
-Let me try.

178
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,622
Okay.

179
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,375
This is a small knife.

180
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,501
Be careful.

181
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,961
Where are the latex gloves?

182
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,423
Wait. Watch your hand.

183
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,552
How do I cut this? Like this?

184
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,054
Hey, you're good at this.

185
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,225
Here. You might cut your hand, so…

186
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,727
And the smell of meat
will linger on your hands.

187
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,312
-Okay.
-I should wear them too.

188
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,898
Seul-ki, are you good with knives?

189
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,525
I think I do okay.

190
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,989
Your hand is wet,
so it won't fit in the glove.

191
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:39,949
Let me see.

192
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,201
-Put it on. I'll help.
-Oh, so…

193
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,953
We need thinner slices than this.

194
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,875
Wiggle your fingers.

195
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,758
That's hot.

196
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,344
Watch your hands.

197
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,806
I can cut it into cubes, right?

198
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,308
Yes. I think that's good.

199
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,103
He's so sweet.

200
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,439
Jong-woo only has eyes for Seul-ki.

201
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,860
At times like this, I miss our chef.

202
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,820
Right, but we can totally do this.

203
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,071
-We can do this.
-We can.

204
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,408
-Han-bin.
-I heard Jin-young is a good cook.

205
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,202
-Really?
-He was supposed to show me, but…

206
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,414
-He's never here.
-He's not, but he said he would.

207
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,041
-But he's not here.
-Maybe he's all talk?

208
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,006
-Is that gochujang pork belly?
-Yes, it is.

209
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,217
-It won't be too spicy, right?
-It's a little spicy.

210
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,095
I feel like eating something spicy today.

211
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,264
Nice and spicy.

212
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,436
-People crave spicy food when they're mad.
-No, no. I just want to feel good.

213
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,813
Does that mean
you don't feel good right now?

214
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,197
It smells so good, though.

215
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,157
I haven't had meat in ages.

216
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,950
-Enjoy your meal!
-Enjoy your meal!

217
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,076
Enjoy your meal.

218
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,411
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy.

219
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,370
Thank you.

220
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,080
-It's so good.
-It is.

221
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,291
This is good.
Jong-woo, you did a great job.

222
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,334
-Really?
-Yes.

223
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,461
-It's good even without rice.
-Right?

224
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,545
-Right.
-I'm full.

225
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,839
Are those pictures of us?

226
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,050
-It's Seul-ki and me.
-Friendship pictures.

227
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,384
They're so pretty.

228
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,886
Let's take some today.

229
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,970
How about right now?

230
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,848
We have to get closer.

231
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,520
Three, two, one.

232
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,356
Did it work?

233
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,025
Gosh, I can't wait to see.

234
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,409
I wasn't looking at the camera.

235
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,577
I had my eyes closed.

236
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,038
Let's say we did that on purpose.

237
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,873
Let's take one together.

238
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,333
-How?
-Selfie-mode.

239
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,758
Jong-woo is in heaven right now.

240
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,468
No need to go elsewhere.

241
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,761
-Yes.
-Really.

242
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,471
Three, two, one.

243
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,223
You two look good together.

244
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,977
-You two look good.
-Shouldn't we take this vertically?

245
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,145
We're taking another one?

246
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,147
Just you two? Got it.

247
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,109
You're using up all the film.

248
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,236
It went off when I was looking at her.

249
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,238
-That's when it looks pretty.
-Natural.

250
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,281
It looks natural.

251
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,323
That's funny.

252
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,243
-The vertical one's prettier.
-Yes.

253
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,078
I like this picture.

254
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,121
-Me too.
-Right.

255
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,006
PARADISE
SO-E AND HAN-BIN

256
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,842
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

257
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,051
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

258
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,430
I knew it would be good.

259
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,973
-Here's some sauce.
-Okay.

260
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:01,025
I've been thinking about this on Inferno,

261
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,152
I think you're well-mannered and polite.

262
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,362
-Really?
-Yes. I've felt that a lot.

263
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,577
At first, I thought you were
like that only towards Seo-eun

264
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,246
because you like her.

265
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,126
-But I think you're like that to everyone.
-That's good to hear.

266
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,753
I just wanted to tell you that.

267
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,463
That's good.

268
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,758
-Do you know why I chose you?
-No. Why?

269
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,885
You wanted to have fun, right?

270
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,304
-That too, yes.
-I see.

271
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,681
I thought I would have
the most fun with you.

272
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:41,273
After thinking about it,
I knew if I came with Yoong-jae,

273
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,610
-it would turn out as expected…
-Both of you would…

274
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,781
Maybe be uncomfortable.
Of course, I'd try not to feel that way.

275
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,575
But what's the best way
to describe how I'd feel?

276
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,702
-I think it would've been weird.
-Right.

277
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,205
I think you would have gotten hurt.

278
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,961
When you went to Paradise
with Se-jun yesterday,

279
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,963
all the men were clapping.

280
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,589
-Really?
-"So-e's going!"

281
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,801
We clapped, but I was still worried.

282
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,760
Why?

283
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:15,891
I thought that it might not be
the Paradise date you wanted the most?

284
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,103
Everyone was saying,
"So-e must be thrilled."

285
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,563
"So-e's finally going there."

286
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,443
But I thought maybe
it wouldn't be all that great for you.

287
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,904
So I said that I was
actually worried about you.

288
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,785
Right. You don't have to come
to Paradise for things to be good.

289
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,744
Right.

290
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,540
I experienced how much harder it was
after coming back from Paradise.

291
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,958
-Anyway…
-Right.

292
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,337
-I was here with Se-jun, right?
-Right.

293
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:51,385
I thought that
I'd keep thinking about Yoong-jae,

294
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,054
or maybe feel disappointed.

295
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,601
I thought I'd feel that way,
but it didn't happen.

296
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,978
-I see.
-It's just…

297
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,399
I don't know if I have
a lot of lingering feelings left.

298
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,276
-But it was a short period of time.
-Yes.

299
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,282
So for my own sake, I think
I tried to quickly dust myself off.

300
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,241
I see.

301
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,911
What about you?

302
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,080
It was hard for me too.

303
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,583
-Right. I know.
-Yes.

304
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,961
I'm not sure where things went wrong.

305
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,505
And I'm not even sure
if anything went wrong.

306
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,134
-It's hard.
-Yes, it's hard.

307
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,178
PARADISE
NADINE AND YOONG-JAE

308
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,429
Is champagne all right?

309
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,722
Yes. Anything is fine.

310
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,818
I just…

311
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,113
Wait, is it weird if I say this?

312
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,159
-Just say it.
-It's about Jin-young.

313
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:04,541
You're not interested
in me like that anyway,

314
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,169
and we came here
to talk like this as friends, so…

315
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,672
What are you going to do about Jin-young?

316
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,799
I don't know.

317
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,885
You don't? But are you
still going to approach him?

318
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,554
I don't know.

319
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,889
Gosh, you don't know?

320
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,225
I really don't know.

321
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,228
-Really?
-But I'm curious about him.

322
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,106
It's fun just talking to him.

323
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,360
There's this unexpected
and appealing side to him.

324
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,404
I think that's his biggest charm.

325
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,573
-So comfortable to be around him.
-Right.

326
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,117
And he makes me curious.

327
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,328
I think it would be fun
to come to Paradise with him.

328
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,539
-Then what are you going to do?
-What?

329
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,333
What am I going to do?
I really have no clue.

330
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,129
I seriously don't know.

331
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,216
I guess I'm just here.

332
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,929
-That's why I'm here with you in Paradise.
-Okay.

333
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,225
Yes.

334
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,687
Now that I think about it,
you must've been really flustered.

335
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,022
So when I was standing there…

336
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,485
I mean, I kind of thought
that Min-su would choose Jin-young.

337
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,906
So have you ever wished
you could've gotten second place?

338
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,033
-Second place?
-Because you placed third.

339
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,536
Of course. I wish I had placed first.

340
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,537
-First?
-Yes.

341
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,456
If you had placed first,
would you have still chosen Jin-young?

342
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,958
-Yes.
-I see.

343
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,754
Let's put our heads together
and figure something out.

344
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,714
Okay.

345
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,716
-I'm very good at that.
-Okay.

346
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,093
I'm good at strategizing
and things like that.

347
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,097
-It's like an open counseling session.
-Right.

348
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,267
I think Han-bin and So-e can join them
and have a group talk.

349
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,311
-They have enough chairs for that.
-Yes.

350
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,857
PARADISE
MIN-SU AND JIN-YOUNG

351
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,235
-Thank you for today.
-Thank you.

352
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,627
From Inferno to here,
today went by really fast.

353
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,088
Right. It'll continue
at this pace from now on.

354
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,632
-From now on?
-Yes.

355
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,426
Jin-young, when you first saw me,

356
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,430
what was your first impression?

357
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,684
-Maybe you were a bit prim and proper?
-I see.

358
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,314
-And that we might not get along.
-Right?

359
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,399
But when we talked, I felt comfortable.

360
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,653
It was comfortable talking to you.

361
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,406
-You seemed rather candid.
-Really?

362
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,951
-Yes. We had comfortable conversations.
-Right.

363
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:48,247
What really surprised me
was how quickly time passed with you.

364
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,794
-So I kept thinking about those things.
-Right.

365
00:20:55,921 --> 00:21:00,092
As far as the kind of relationship I want,

366
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,221
I think I'd rather start off feeling
a little uncomfortable…

367
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,017
than completely comfortable and relaxed.

368
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,273
I'm the type of person

369
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:20,487
who tends to take comfort
in being in uncomfortable situations.

370
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,031
But I'm too comfortable with you.

371
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,491
That…

372
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:34,042
So that made it difficult for me
to see you in a more romantic way.

373
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,920
To be honest, it wasn't like that
from the beginning.

374
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,716
I don't like being comfortable
when I'm in a relationship.

375
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,427
But this was the first time
I felt comfortable.

376
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,388
In a blink of an eye,
three hours just flew by.

377
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,391
Things like that.

378
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,813
So I thought,
"Maybe feeling comfortable is okay too."

379
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,816
-Right.
-I've been having all these thoughts.

380
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:09,870
And I wondered if things
would eventually get a little ambiguous?

381
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,749
-I see.
-I mean, it's nice now, but…

382
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,252
So I thought I'd take this opportunity

383
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,130
to tell you honestly

384
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,967
-about how I feel.
-I see.

385
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,011
-Because we don't have time now.
-Right.

386
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,932
So when the two of us
were talking earlier,

387
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,769
I said that I wanted to talk
to different people

388
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:39,274
-to give you a bit of a hint.
-I see.

389
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,820
But you chose me again,
for which I'm grateful.

390
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,156
Anyway, I think that's when I knew.

391
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,199
That I should

392
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,035
tell you today how I feel.

393
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:54,372
I had already decided that,
so I was feeling sad.

394
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,958
But I didn't want to ruin your whole day.

395
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,214
So that's why I wanted to talk to you now

396
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,217
since it'll be our last time here.

397
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,136
I wanted to protect your feelings
until we had this talk.

398
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,099
I think that's it.

399
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,226
Okay. I understand.

400
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:23,527
When I first joined, I had hoped for
and envisioned a happy ending.

401
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,198
But as of right now, I think

402
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,910
not regretting any decisions
I make while I'm here

403
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:38,083
and creating meaningful memories
have become my goals.

404
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,626
So…

405
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,381
If I'd chosen someone else
because I thought you weren't interested,

406
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:48,093
then that would've
felt less like Paradise.

407
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,805
And that's not who I am.

408
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,517
That's not who I want
or expect myself to be.

409
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,646
So…

410
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:06,903
I don't regret how things turned out
either yesterday or today.

411
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,370
Thank you for thinking that way.

412
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,918
I'd like to thank you too,
for coming out and having fun with me.

413
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,421
-I really did have fun.
-Right.

414
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,674
-Time flies by when we talk.
-Right.

415
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,700
-They're being honest.
-They really are.

416
00:24:54,618 --> 00:25:00,123
Min-su said she always follows her heart
and has no regrets.

417
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,336
But it feels like she's going
to keep choosing Jin-young.

418
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:09,382
I think we can see Jin-young's appeal
through conversations like this.

419
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:14,346
He seems very blunt,
but he's quite considerate and sensitive.

420
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,308
And he talks in a way
that doesn't make you feel uncomfortable.

421
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:22,479
I think Min-su took it well
and was able to be honest with him too.

422
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:27,609
So I don't think
either one of them will regret this date.

423
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,946
Then does Jin-young
have feelings for Seul-ki?

424
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,826
It could be Seul-ki, but he said
he wanted to talk to different people too.

425
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,748
But until now, he has
only been truly open with Seul-ki.

426
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,292
-You're right.
-It's only been Seul-ki, so…

427
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,045
Seul-ki wants to pursue things.

428
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,214
-They keep missing each other.
-Right.

429
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,299
-'Cause he's too popular.
-He's popular.

430
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:56,096
If you think about it, he used up
two out of nine days with Min-su.

431
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,474
-But this was Min-su's best choice.
-You're right.

432
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:05,397
Min-su just wanted to spend time
with someone she liked with no regrets.

433
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,152
-Fireworks in front of the lodge?
-It's been so long since I've done this.

434
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,532
-Scary.
-Hurry, come here.

435
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,574
This is scary.

436
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,619
Did I set them too close to each other?

437
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,246
Gosh!

438
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,499
-Oh, my God!
-What was that?

439
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,668
-Hey!
-Which one blew up?

440
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,795
That'll go off later--

441
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,255
-What was that?
-Gosh!

442
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,341
-That'll go off later--
-Gosh, what was that?

443
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,345
-What was that?
-Gosh.

444
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,056
It's so pretty!

445
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,684
-What was that?
-What is it?

446
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,853
Why did you scaredy cats want to do this?

447
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,604
You should've just stayed in bed.

448
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,609
It's so pretty.

449
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,527
We're good now.

450
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,945
-Let's draw a heart.
-Okay.

451
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,239
-We'll go this way. You that way.
-Okay.

452
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,615
Three, two, one.

453
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,200
-What's this?
-What are we doing?

454
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,661
-Seul-ki.
-Guys, two circles at a time.

455
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,662
My gosh.

456
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,456
This is really pretty.

457
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,833
-Hand me yours for a second.
-Okay.

458
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,127
I'll light one more.

459
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,720
-It's going out now.
-That was fun.

460
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,221
It was fun.

461
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,643
-I'm curious about something.
-Yes?

462
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,772
Is the person you like right now
the same as the one

463
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,774
who left a good first impression?

464
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,733
Yes.

465
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:34,986
-Who is it?
-Tell us.

466
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,529
-Who is it?
-So-e.

467
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,281
So-e?

468
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,532
-So-e?
-So-e?

469
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,492
Yes.

470
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,620
She's so small that I can't help but care.

471
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,662
She's on your mind.

472
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,664
Sounds like a line.

473
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,125
"For someone so small,
you're on my mind a lot."

474
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,544
Or an anime show.
"Jeez, can't get her out of my mind."

475
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,047
I don't know. I can't help but notice her.

476
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,715
Okay, then, Se-jun.

477
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,387
How do you feel about So-e
going with someone else today?

478
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,388
I think it's good.

479
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,181
Be honest.

480
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,809
-You want her to be happy.
-You want her to be happy.

481
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:09,354
She asked me something before.

482
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,190
Seemed like
she had thought about it a lot.

483
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,526
I told her to do what
she felt comfortable doing.

484
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,277
And if she did, that's good.

485
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,654
Right.

486
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,988
Were you disappointed?

487
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,324
-Not even a bit?
-Didn't you tell her how you feel?

488
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,660
I just liked that she was doing
what felt right to her.

489
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,121
I have a question.

490
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,039
Do you want to go to Paradise

491
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,000
with someone other than
whom you've already gone with?

492
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,462
-Yes.
-Yes. Thank you for your answer.

493
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,426
-Jong-woo is so happy.
-Look at Jong-woo smiling.

494
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,386
He's definitely happy.

495
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,972
Did you make up your mind?

496
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,477
Looks like you haven't. Okay!

497
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,062
-I still have a question.
-Really?

498
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,439
-Dong-woo?
-He hasn't asked?

499
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,024
Share one characteristic
about the person you like.

500
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,152
But…

501
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,946
-I'm going to pass.
-He has nostrils.

502
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,951
You asked me to spill names,
but now you avoid answering?

503
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,370
What's wrong with you? That's not fair.

504
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,665
I'll do whatever I want.

505
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:15,420
Fight!

506
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,380
These two are masters at doing skits.

507
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,134
Those two are definitely…

508
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,261
There's definitely nothing between them.

509
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,348
I wonder if they're all
doing well in Paradise.

510
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:32,061
Out of all of us,
I really can't tell how Seul-ki feels.

511
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,021
Did you choose?

512
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,690
I think it'll depend on tomorrow.

513
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,733
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

514
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,737
-I'll know for sure after tomorrow.
-The result?

515
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,696
Yes.

516
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,783
-Be honest. How many do you have in mind?
-It's two, right?

517
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,075
-No.
-No?

518
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,494
Hey, just tell us.

519
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,870
We'll keep it between us.

520
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,789
Right now, it's two.

521
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,126
-Is it those two?
-Are they who we think they are?

522
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,213
-But it's a bit…
-Two people.

523
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,174
-Both names start with "J."
-Start with "J."

524
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,469
I don't know about that.

525
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,137
Of course, you know.

526
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,601
But I really wonder
how tomorrow will play out…

527
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:18,316
He's in Paradise right now
with the same person again.

528
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,778
Min-su chose him.

529
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,531
She seems really direct and determined.

530
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,157
I think she's really into him.

531
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,619
But it looks like
they had a lot of fun together.

532
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,041
Seul-ki, you weren't with us then,
but we were all talking earlier.

533
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:41,256
And we asked him how his date
with Min-su went and if they had fun.

534
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:45,343
And he said it was
very impactful in a different way.

535
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,345
So everyone was surprised.

536
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,473
So I'm thinking maybe

537
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,519
Seul-ki will base her decision
on that person's attitude towards her.

538
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:58,565
-How sincere he is.
-Like, how far will he go for me?

539
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,076
When did you guys have talks like that?

540
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,912
-Whenever there was time?
-I'm not sure.

541
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,913
I…

542
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:20,336
I've hardly seen Jin-young at all
since we came back from Paradise.

543
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,590
-Not even seen his face.
-Why?

544
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,676
I think the timing
was off this whole time.

545
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:31,723
-Because you keep talking to Jong-woo.
-But today…

546
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,099
We were all together.

547
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,143
But today, I haven't seen him once.

548
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,519
-Really?
-Yes.

549
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:42,025
He's all over the place.
And he's really popular.

550
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,571
So some people kept asking him
to come out and talk to them separately.

551
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,032
-Really?
-The guys were asking?

552
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,576
No. The girls were.

553
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,494
It happened earlier too.

554
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:02,295
Seul-ki is experiencing heartache
because of Jin-young right now.

555
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,341
Seul-ki definitely has two people
in her heart right now.

556
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:11,137
"A man who makes my heart beat
and a man who does everything for me."

557
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,055
Right.

558
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:17,268
I think the reason why Seul-ki said
she'll know for sure tomorrow

559
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,437
is 'cause Jin-young will be back by then.

560
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,776
If Jin-young says something to Seul-ki
that makes her feel secure,

561
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,362
I think she'll go with Jin-young.

562
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,032
Wouldn't Jin-young be more honest too,
after coming back from Paradise?

563
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,451
-I think so.
-He was with the same person for two days.

564
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,411
That's why I feel bad for Jong-woo.

565
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,165
So Seul-ki is saying she'll know for sure

566
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:43,628
after tomorrow because she can talk to him
and find out how he really feels.

567
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,214
It sounds like if Jin-young
doesn't do anything,

568
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,342
then she'll choose Jong-woo.

569
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:53,054
If that's the case, this will be
the last time we see Jong-woo smile.

570
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,348
-Don't say sad things like that.
-Okay.

571
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,642
-She always keeps a cool head.
-No, that's…

572
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,269
She always thinks of the worst scenario.

573
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,771
-This is a pivotal moment.
-Yes.

574
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,231
-When he comes back.
-Right.

575
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,039
This is so nice.

576
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,957
It really is.

577
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,584
Imagine being in California.

578
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,014
We're back.

579
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,307
We're back now.

580
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,061
Where is everyone?

581
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,273
They're all dressed for the beach.

582
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,738
Get some rest.

583
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,656
-Okay. See you later.
-Okay.

584
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:40,119
-Thanks for everything. Get some rest.
-Okay.

585
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,544
Did you have fun?

586
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:52,006
Jin-young, there were
lots of fun incidents yesterday.

587
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,635
-What kind of things?
-Here? There were a lot.

588
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,347
Right now, Paradise could become Inferno.

589
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,515
-Really?
-Yes.

590
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,892
How was it, Jin-young?

591
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,936
Well, I just…

592
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:10,316
I don't think my story is that important.
I'm just curious about what happened here.

593
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,567
Tell us what you did.

594
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,985
Yesterday?

595
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,071
I had soju yesterday.

596
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,282
Must've had an honest talk, then.

597
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,575
I really did have that.

598
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,454
Well, anyway, we talked.

599
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:28,835
Okay. Jong-woo, that's it for now.
Shall we listen to what you have to share?

600
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,380
Yesterday, we all got together
and played games

601
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,298
and talked about our inner feelings.

602
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,553
-Inner feelings…
-Right. Because time has passed.

603
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:43,349
We thought it was time to be honest,
so we asked some direct questions.

604
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,937
I bet Seul-ki got a lot of questions.

605
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,896
She really did.

606
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,607
-The questions were focused on her, right?
-Yes, they were.

607
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,151
-Right.
-Like carpet bombing.

608
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,443
I see. Okay.

609
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,155
-Right.
-Jong-woo, you look pretty happy.

610
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,364
Yes.

611
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,532
What do you mean?

612
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,826
You look the happiest
since you arrived here.

613
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,327
-You look really good.
-Really?

614
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,541
So yesterday,
you guys had some serious conversations?

615
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,127
So what did Seul-ki say?

616
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,128
Seul-ki…

617
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,592
She said that she's definitely
interested in somebody.

618
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:23,806
So we asked her if her mind
was made up, but she wouldn't answer.

619
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,851
Right, she didn't answer that.

620
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,811
Was the weather nice yesterday?

621
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,064
-There was a lot of fog last night.
-I see.

622
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,316
We lit some fireworks.

623
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,653
And we took
a lot of pictures in the cafeteria.

624
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,530
They should still be there.
There are a lot.

625
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,200
-I'm curious now.
-Shall we go see them?

626
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,118
-Let's go right now.
-Wait.

627
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,537
We'll just go take a look.

628
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,957
Seul-ki and Jong-woo
took a lot of pictures yesterday.

629
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,376
-They'll find out.
-Paradise will be jealous of Inferno.

630
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,336
Right.

631
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,463
I'm pretty curious.

632
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,763
There's a lot more pictures now.

633
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,015
I'm not in any of them.

634
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,351
Guess which pictures were taken.

635
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,268
Hey, Seul-ki!

636
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,770
-Hi!
-Hi!

637
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,272
Did you have fun?

638
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,523
-Yes.
-It was fun.

639
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,026
You look well-rested.

640
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,029
You look well-rested too, Seul-ki.

641
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,032
Are you going tanning?

642
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,618
-Tanning?
-Actually, maybe you don't have to.

643
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,872
Seul-ki, you're very pink today.

644
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,292
I wanted to look pretty today.

645
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,088
-Your outfit matches the weather.
-I can tell you tried to look nice.

646
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,714
Yes, I tried.

647
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,472
-What is this?
-How do I watch this?

648
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,682
The battle has begun.

649
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,478
Inferno must have been fun yesterday.

650
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,022
-Did you have fun, Seul-ki?
-It was heavenly.

651
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,357
-Did you have fun?
-Yes.

652
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,277
-What was the most fun bit?
-Everything.

653
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,528
-Everything?
-Any regrets?

654
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,572
Regrets? I'm not sure.

655
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,784
-I see.
-I'm not sure.

656
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,244
-"Not sure"?
-"Not sure."

657
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,537
"Not sure" is too vague.

658
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,039
But I did realize

659
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,877
that depending on who I'm with,
this place could be either heaven or hell.

660
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,882
-Does that mean yesterday was heaven?
-Yesterday…

661
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:22,842
It seems like it.

662
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,802
I liked it here yesterday.

663
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,767
-Okay.
-Have you made up your mind yet?

664
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,315
No, but I think I'll decide today.

665
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,357
-Today?
-Yes.

666
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,411
-Should we go for a walk?
-Okay.

667
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,330
-Go for a walk?
-See you later.

668
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,998
You mean, the two of you? Okay.

669
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,548
I can see what people are thinking now.

670
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,844
Every single word is just…

671
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,473
I think I can read everyone's minds now.

672
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,688
Come on, don't be nervous.

673
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,067
Okay.

674
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,031
I can't find a way
to get between those two.

675
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,367
-What?
-Those two people.

676
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,497
Unless I force myself between them,
I think it's hard to get a word in.

677
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,166
So Jong-woo…

678
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,836
has been the same since the start.

679
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,962
Right.

680
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,298
But if there's still nothing going on,

681
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,842
she might not have feelings for him.

682
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:52,139
That's why it could be
a more unstable relationship.

683
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,018
-Let's not get too anxious.
-Okay.

684
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,982
There are only three days left now.

685
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,277
Time just flew by here.

686
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:09,824
I want to get to know you even more,
and my feelings have gotten stronger.

687
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,785
I'm going to try even harder

688
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,539
to show you how I feel
during the time we have left here.

689
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:22,169
There are just
too many people who like you.

690
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,674
Because you're so charming.

691
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:34,473
Since you've received
so much attention from everyone,

692
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,600
you must feel a lot of pressure.

693
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,271
I hope you can enjoy the rest of the time
without feeling uncomfortable.

694
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:48,154
While we've been talking, I felt that
you've been really considerate towards me.

695
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:54,368
And I can tell that you say these things
because you really care about me.

696
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,204
-Is it hard?
-If I were you…

697
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,666
I don't think I could do that.

698
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,001
-Really?
-Yes.

699
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,962
You're awesome.

700
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:09,216
Thank you so much for saying that.

701
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,644
There could be someone else
who you want to talk to,

702
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,690
so I think I'll head in
and give you some time.

703
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,903
-You can stay and keep talking.
-No, it's okay.

704
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,948
-We can all talk together.
-You need time to talk too.

705
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,867
No, it's okay. Join us.

706
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,874
Well, if you're going to be
so considerate, I won't refuse.

707
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,001
-I can tell you to be alone.
-I see.

708
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,674
It's been a while.

709
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,971
The weather's really nice today.

710
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,931
It is.

711
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:13,113
You talk to Jong-woo so much.
What is there to talk about?

712
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,282
Not a word when you're with me.

713
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,826
When you're with me,
it's always silent like this.

714
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,997
How come you talk so much with Jong-woo?

715
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,499
That's discrimination.

716
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,756
Given a chance, I bet you and Jong-woo
could talk for four days straight.

717
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,053
That's cute. He's jealous.

718
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,686
I should have stayed on Inferno, right?

719
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,274
What?

720
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,067
So did you have fun?

721
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,577
You just…

722
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,037
That came out of nowhere.

723
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,959
What did you do yesterday?
What did you eat?

724
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,043
Yesterday?

725
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,296
-Did you eat anything delicious?
-Delicious?

726
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,423
-I did eat some good food.
-Did you eat meat?

727
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,507
Of course.

728
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,593
I had some too.

729
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,345
-I heard. Pork belly?
-Yes.

730
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,847
Well…

731
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,308
I had soju yesterday.

732
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,685
Yesterday was a day for soju.

733
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,271
Yesterday wasn't a day for champagne.

734
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,774
So I got a bit drunk.

735
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,735
-Really?
-Yeah.

736
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,662
Gosh. I want to see more.

737
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,750
It was a very short conversation
with Jin-young.

738
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:51,545
Seul-ki seems very curious
when it comes to Jin-young.

739
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,257
When she talks to Jong-woo,
they have deep conversations.

740
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,261
But when she talks to Jin-young,
the topics are much lighter,

741
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,014
yet they're more exciting to watch.

742
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,140
-Right.
-It's like…

743
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:06,352
And when Seul-ki is with Jin-young,
she really looks like

744
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:11,690
a woman who has just fallen in love
and is delighted about it.

745
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,816
It totally shows.

746
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,693
-A woman in love.
-Right.

747
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:19,239
I don't think Jong-woo
stands a chance against Jin-young.

748
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:25,704
The way I see it, I think Seul-ki
really has feelings for Jin-young.

749
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:30,042
But I think Seul-ki
is pretty confused herself.

750
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:33,045
-Right.
-About who she's more drawn to.

751
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,591
-You weigh 80kgs, Jin-young?
-Jong-woo, you really want to win, right?

752
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,967
-Yes.
-It's 77kgs of lean muscle.

753
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,302
-Seventy-seven?
-Seventy-seven.

754
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,597
-Then if one of us ends up going…
-That's not much of a difference.

755
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,432
…before leaving for Paradise,

756
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,477
why don't we give the person staying

757
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,188
-a chance to talk to Seul-ki?
-That sounds great.

758
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,525
-Sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
-That's okay.

759
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,278
I see. Okay.

760
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,948
-My gosh.
-Did you hear him?

761
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,074
It has begun.

762
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,493
-Looking out for himself now.
-Yes.

763
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,499
-I can't stay here. It's getting scary.
-Okay.

764
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,419
Leaving me no choice
but to go to the women's lodge.

765
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,506
Se-jun is so funny.

766
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,509
You're leaving me no choice
but to go to the women's lodge.

767
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,680
Okay, seriously, that was just so…

768
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,473
That was intense.

769
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,227
We should've done it yesterday.

770
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:35,441
Everyone's exhausted
from being so tense all the time.

771
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,235
It stressed me out
every time I had to watch.

772
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,821
Why? Because you don't want to lose?

773
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,614
I don't want to lose.

774
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,954
-Is it just because you hate losing?
-No.

775
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,540
Well, I mean…

776
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,417
Does it have to do with a woman?

777
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,463
Yes. Otherwise, it wouldn't matter
whether I lose or not.

778
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,339
I would just go to sleep right now.

779
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,760
If it's an opportunity to go
to Paradise like yesterday,

780
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,930
then I'll make sure to win.

781
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,149
The hottest inferno in the world,
Single's Inferno.

782
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:21,945
Today, you will play another game
to win an opportunity to go to Paradise.

783
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,533
Participants, please come to the beach.

784
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,993
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

785
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,245
Let's go.

786
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,288
We got this.

787
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,798
Look over there.

788
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,635
-I'm already nervous…
-Gosh.

789
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,721
-…about watching the match.
-I know, right?

790
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,516
I wonder what'll happen in there.

791
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,976
-It'll be really intense.
-Yes.

792
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,312
They're coming.

793
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,856
-They're going to have scary faces.
-I know.

794
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:11,703
You got this.

795
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,746
You got this.

796
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,289
-You got this.
-You got this.

797
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,004
Let's go.

798
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,925
-Why am I getting nervous?
-I know, right?

799
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,635
I'm nervous because I'm scared.

800
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:43,110
We will now begin the men's game
for the opportunity to go to Paradise.

801
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:49,908
Like yesterday, only the top three winners

802
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:54,204
can choose a female participant
they would like to go to Paradise with.

803
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,252
I will now explain today's game.

804
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:03,505
First, enter the pit.

805
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:08,635
Then at the sound of the whistle,
push the other people out of the pit.

806
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:14,308
If both legs are outside the pit,
that person will be eliminated.

807
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:18,478
The last one to remain
will win first place.

808
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,647
Okay, let's do this.

809
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,484
Gosh, I can't watch.

810
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,280
-This will be intense.
-Right.

811
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:32,159
-We'll be seeing blood today.
-You can't win just because you want to.

812
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,410
-Yes.
-You need luck too.

813
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,786
-And strategy.
-Strategy.

814
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:39,458
Male participants,
please step inside the pit.

815
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,378
-Step inside.
-Okay.

816
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,424
-I'm nervous for them.
-I'm so nervous.

817
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,484
Look at them lowering into position.

818
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,361
-My gosh.
-Oh, my God.

819
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,702
This is so nerve-wracking.

820
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,120
Look at their faces.

821
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,302
Gosh.

822
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,388
They're really rough.

823
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,765
It's because we're halfway
through the show.

824
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,725
Right.

825
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:23,895
Gosh, wait a second.

826
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,828
-Gosh!
-Wait…

827
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,123
Oh, my God.

828
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,251
I can't watch this.

829
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,295
I can't watch. I don't know.

830
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,006
It's hard because he's sitting down.

831
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,376
-You almost got pushed out. Be careful.
-Be careful.

832
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,925
-He went for it, but he slipped.
-He slipped.

833
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,969
-You almost got pushed out. Be careful.
-Watch out.

834
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,056
Come on.

835
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,641
Come on.

836
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,565
Oh, my gosh.

837
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,616
-Dong-woo's…
-He's going after Jong-woo.

838
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,702
-Right?
-Because they both want Seul-ki.

839
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,457
Let's go.

840
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,793
I really don't want to do this.

841
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,586
I really don't want to do this.

842
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,639
He got his leg.

843
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,432
He's got his leg.

844
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:36,987
Whatever. I give up.

845
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,283
He's so funny.

846
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,119
Se-jun…

847
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,382
Se-jun has been eliminated.

848
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:03,305
-I like you, Se-jun.
-He went out in such an uncool way.

849
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,682
-No, no.
-He was thrown out. Said "I give up."

850
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,017
I like Se-jun.

851
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,061
-I like Se-jun.
-Gosh, Se-jun.

852
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,536
This is fun.

853
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,957
Look, his body's turned red.

854
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,251
-It's red.
-His skin's gotten red.

855
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,345
If you attack too soon,
it drains your strength.

856
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,103
Why are you coming after me?

857
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,499
Get his legs!

858
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,086
Let go of me.

859
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,426
Dong-woo has been eliminated.

860
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,558
Jin-young seems pretty strong.

861
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,353
-I'm scared.
-I'm scared too.

862
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,358
This is hard.

863
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,738
One more person and then it's all over.

864
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,739
You're right.

865
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,672
-Gosh, Han-bin.
-Han-bin.

866
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,965
-Han-bin.
-Han-bin.

867
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,552
Go, Han-bin!

868
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,637
Go, Han-bin!

869
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,781
Han-bin has been eliminated.

870
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,637
-These three are set.
-Right.

871
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:53,099
These three are the ones
who want to go the most.

872
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,061
But Yoong-jae doesn't overlap with anyone.

873
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:59,647
So it's a decisive battle
between Jin-young and Jong-woo.

874
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,863
I really can't watch.

875
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,411
They're moving.

876
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,550
Those two… Be careful.

877
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,232
-This is hard.
-Yes.

878
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,989
-Yoong-jae is just kind of watching.
-Right? So now…

879
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,995
I'm scared.

880
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,832
Let's go.

881
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:07,924
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

882
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,995
-My gosh.
-I don't see an end to this.

883
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,288
Gosh.

884
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,290
Seriously.

885
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,920
Let's team up.

886
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,966
-He was going to leave it to them.
-That's right.

887
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,010
-But now he's joining to end things.
-Right.

888
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:55,472
There's no telling what'll happen.
It depends on who they lift up.

889
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,699
Is it Jong-woo? Oh, dear.

890
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,326
Gosh, it's Jong-woo?

891
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,456
No, don't.

892
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,750
No, don't.

893
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,793
No. My gosh.

894
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,008
Please.

895
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,094
Please.

896
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:39,098
-Hold out. Shake them off.
-Let's go.

897
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,684
-Hold out just this once.
-He's holding out.

898
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,729
-Shake them off.
-Let's go.

899
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,817
He held on!

900
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,488
If you twist your body, you can hold on.

901
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,499
Again?

902
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:33,945
-Come on. Just this once. Please.
-I think I'm going to cry.

903
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:47,584
Let's go.

904
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,795
-What?
-My gosh!

905
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,589
-What?
-My gosh!

906
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,507
Let's go.

907
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,843
-What?
-My gosh!

908
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,351
Jong-woo and Jin-young
have been eliminated.

909
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,610
-What happened?
-We need instant replay.

910
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,194
-Right.
-He went over while flipping.

911
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,446
Jin-young went over first?

912
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,364
-We don't know yet.
-This is crazy.

913
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,784
I have no idea how this will turn out.

914
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,872
What on earth happened?

915
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:30,168
It looks to me that Jin-young's legs
got out of the pit first.

916
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,252
What was the rule again?

917
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:35,006
Both legs have to be outside of the pit
for someone to get eliminated.

918
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,174
-Not one, but both.
-Then…

919
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,675
-Then that's Jin-young.
-Yes.

920
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,220
I think his rear end
touched the ground first.

921
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,557
-Like, the back of his thigh.
-What are the results of the replay?

922
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,769
-Is this the Olympics? It's so intense.
-Is it playing? Just show us.

923
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,687
-Right, what is this?
-Just…

924
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,732
-Look.
-Wait.

925
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,777
-Right, he went out first…
-No, Jin-young's legs were inside.

926
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,153
-I think it's Jong-woo.
-Really?

927
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,072
-Jin-young's legs were inside.
-Wait.

928
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,158
Both of his legs came out first.

929
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,369
-Jong-woo's leg is on the side!
-There!

930
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,787
-Over there!
-Right there.

931
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,829
It's right on the line!

932
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,706
-Right under Yoong-jae's rear.
-Yes!

933
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,792
-Isn't that his leg?
-It's barely there.

934
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:14,045
-Seriously, is this the Olympics?
-Under the light green shorts.

935
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:16,297
-This is amazing.
-It is amazing!

936
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,384
-The gods have finally answered his wish.
-Right?

937
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:22,428
-They answered him.
-"Ask and you shall receive."

938
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,267
Here are the final results.

939
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:33,439
This is the men's game final ranking
for an opportunity to go to Paradise.

940
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,858
First place goes to Yoong-jae.

941
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,152
Thank you.

942
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:42,824
Second place.

943
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:54,919
Jong-woo.

944
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,839
-Good job.
-Gosh.

945
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,886
And third place goes to Jin-young.

946
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,851
Great job, everyone.
