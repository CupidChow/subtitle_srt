SINGLE'S INFERNO

13
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,635
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

14
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,479
Kim Min-seol.

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,899
Kim Min-seol.

16
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,530
What?

17
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,365
Really?

18
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,700
-It was the goats?
-"The goats"!

19
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,703
Yeah, the two of them got along well.

20
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,292
-Jin-young.
-He has to leave due to his remarks.

21
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,629
Just stay seated for now, okay?

22
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,306
YUK JUN-SEO SELECTED KIM MIN-SEOL

23
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,442
Paradise-bound couple matching is over.

24
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,201
Inferno is really living up to its name.

25
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,956
Yes, it really does feel unforgiving here.

26
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,417
Ji-yeon!

27
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,044
Is she alone?

28
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,504
She's alone on that island?

29
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,257
Has anyone ever been alone
on an island before?

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,050
You're right. No one's been alone.

31
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,885
She's completely alone?

32
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,095
Want to go there, Jin-young?

33
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,346
I'll go right now.

34
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,767
From the start,
Jun-seo clearly explained his reason.

35
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:27,355
He said he chose the person who showed
her truest and least polished self.

36
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,607
-She wasn't being flirty.
-Yes, exactly.

37
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,610
He was drawn to someone
he could talk ordinary things with.

38
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,028
With Jeong-su and Hye-jin,

39
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,866
they chose each other because they were
drawn to how different they were, right?

40
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,243
Jeong-su seemed much more comfortable.

41
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,452
More than with Si-an?

42
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,788
With Hye-jin, he was more playful

43
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,291
and seemed to try to get closer first.

44
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,003
I thought Jeong-su might like her more.

45
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,673
PARADISE
KIM MIN-SEOL & YUK JUN-SEO

46
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,222
It's really beautiful.

47
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,891
The vibe here is great.

48
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,439
This feels like a new world
compared to yesterday.

49
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,523
-Yes.
-It's so different.

50
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,441
Right?

51
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,234
Now, we're suddenly in a city…

52
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,152
Right.

53
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,738
I bet it'll heighten our emotions.

54
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,655
Totally.

55
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,079
If you haven't matched with anyone today,

56
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,290
you would've spent the night on Inferno.

57
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,666
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

58
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,920
But I felt like things
would eventually work out.

59
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,004
-Really?
-Yes.

60
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,464
-Really?
-I had a feeling.

61
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,381
-With me?
-Yes.

62
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,091
Why? I mean…

63
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,552
-We had the best conversations.
-I see.

64
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,595
I thought so too.

65
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,596
-Really?
-Yes.

66
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,223
The nice thing was

67
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,309
it felt like you didn't put up a facade.

68
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,770
You weren't trying too hard
to be polished,

69
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,979
and I could feel that.

70
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,981
But you said
I looked intimidating at first.

71
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,983
I guess you just touched up your face.

72
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,320
Your personality and the way you spoke

73
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,864
seemed so easygoing, so I liked that.

74
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,952
I also felt the most comfortable
talking with you.

75
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:04,911
Right.

76
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,995
I thought to myself,

77
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,791
"Maybe it'll work out, but I'm not sure."

78
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,085
There were only two of us to pick from.

79
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,002
-Right.
-Yes.

80
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,421
I was just lucky in many ways.

81
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,881
Yeah, you've been so lucky.

82
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,341
-Two days in a row.
-Right?

83
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,135
-You've used up all of it now.
-What? Excuse me?

84
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,096
Unbelievable.

85
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,765
My goodness.
Be careful what you wish for.

86
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,563
Do you want to talk now or after we eat?

87
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,856
-Let's talk first.
-Yeah?

88
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,774
Yes.

89
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,401
-Then…
-Yeah. How old are you?

90
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,027
-Let's guess each other's age.
-Okay.

91
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,155
Twenty-eight?

92
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,118
-What? Am I right?
-Yes.

93
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,245
-I guessed right.
-Yes.

94
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,997
You peeked at my ID earlier, right?

95
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,498
-I didn't.
-I think you did.

96
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,250
-You were behind me.
-I didn't.

97
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,710
It just felt like you were 28.

98
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,086
-Based on my looks?
-Yes.

99
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,963
Couldn't you say I looked a bit younger?

100
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,339
Isn't 28 young enough?

101
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,632
-Really?
-Yes.

102
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,677
Is it my turn now?

103
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,594
Take a guess.

104
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,595
Twenty-four?

105
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,100
-Twenty-three.
-I'm 23.

106
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,685
I haven't had my birthday yet.

107
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,562
Goodness, this young brat.

108
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,941
You're really young though.

109
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,901
You might be the youngest, right?

110
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,403
Among all the female participants?

111
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,363
-Really?
-It feels like it.

112
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,284
-Should I feel good about that?
-It's a good thing.

113
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,161
I'll talk to you casually then.

114
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,454
I'll talk casually too.

115
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,663
-You can't.
-Why not?

116
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,457
You can't. I'm older.

117
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,541
How is that fair?

118
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,792
-Okay.
-It's very fair.

119
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,880
-I'm kidding. You can.
-Okay.

120
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,257
-Let's talk casually.
-Okay.

121
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,219
Jun-seo seems more relaxed today
than yesterday.

122
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,013
He's starting to loosen up now.

123
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,056
-Right.
-Yeah.

124
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,350
Right. I forgot to ask.

125
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,561
What do you do for work?

126
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,771
Yeah.

127
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,606
Can I guess?

128
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,775
-Then, instead of guessing…
-Yeah?

129
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,360
Tell me which job would suit me.

130
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,239
I was actually thinking about this,
but it was tough.

131
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,450
-Right.
-I couldn't figure it out.

132
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,494
You're definitely young.

133
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,662
Since your voice is so full of energy…

134
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,580
Yeah.

135
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,457
I was thinking

136
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,251
it could be
something unexpected like sales.

137
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,879
It was just a thought.

138
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,632
-"Sales."
-Sales?

139
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,175
We're bad at guessing things.

140
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,680
I'm…

141
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,183
a sportscaster.

142
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,267
-Really?
-Yeah.

143
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,394
-Wow, I didn't expect that.
-What?

144
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,604
-Really?
-Yeah, I didn't.

145
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,191
I'm a freelance anchor.

146
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:44,195
These days, I'm mainly working
as a sportscaster.

147
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,114
Before each game,

148
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,908
I study the teams and their players.

149
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,618
I also spend time thinking

150
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,913
about what kind of energy
I can bring to the day's game.

151
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:58,042
Then, I write up my script
and go to do my reporting.

152
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,337
They remain undefeated this year
with 14 straight wins.

153
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,216
KIM MIN-SEOL, AGE 23
SPORTSCASTER

154
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,302
-Do you usually report at the game?
-Yeah.

155
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,220
-And you?
-What?

156
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,097
-What do you do?
-Me?

157
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,849
I draw.

158
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,600
-You draw?
-Yeah.

159
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,394
-Like a cartoonist?
-No.

160
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,146
-Like on a canvas…
-An artist?

161
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,984
I draw on flat surfaces
and hold exhibitions.

162
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,111
-That's the work I do.
-That's so unexpected.

163
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,195
-Really?
-Yeah.

164
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,115
It doesn't really match my image.

165
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,618
You're telling me an artist won
the physical challenge yesterday?

166
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,703
Isn't it weird?

167
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,121
It doesn't make sense.

168
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,581
That's amazing.

169
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,124
Really?

170
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,711
Yeah, I draw things.
And I hold exhibitions.

171
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,632
We both surprised each other.

172
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,384
Yeah, we were totally off about our jobs.

173
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,510
Yeah.

174
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,137
I'm curious about your drawings.

175
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,221
-Right?
-Yeah.

176
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,599
-When I hold my exhibition…
-Invite me.

177
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,808
I'm holding one this year.

178
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,726
-Really?
-Yeah.

179
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,353
-When?
-Maybe around November?

180
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,271
-November?
-Yeah.

181
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,440
-That's my birth month.
-Maybe November.

182
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,026
-When is it?
-What?

183
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,611
Are you going to give me a drawing?

184
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,738
You owe me one since I'll be there.

185
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,281
-Right?
-They're kind of big.

186
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,075
-How big?
-They're about seven meters tall.

187
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,244
-How big is that?
-That's about…

188
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,330
-Well…
-This big?

189
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,207
Same size as this table?

190
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,751
Wait, you think seven meters
is the size of this table?

191
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,963
-Min-seol, what are you talking about?
-She has no clue.

192
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,089
Min-seol?

193
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,633
She might be unfamiliar with meters.

194
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,800
Is that possible?

195
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,970
-Is she mistaken?
-You think that's possible?

196
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:33,888
-Well…
-This big?

197
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,765
Same size as this table?

198
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,184
Wait, you think seven meters
is the size of this table?

199
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,228
This is…

200
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,939
-How far did you get in school?
-Is this a meter?

201
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:43,856
Is this a meter?

202
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,149
-Elementary school?
-No!

203
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:50,029
-It's from that end to over there.
-Come on. What are you talking about?

204
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:50,947
What?

205
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,491
How would you draw then?
You'd need a ladder.

206
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,702
That's why I bought
a mobile lift to draw.

207
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,579
-Seriously?
-It has wheels.

208
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,624
-That's how I was able to draw.
-Really?

209
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,337
Then, I'll just buy 2.5 meters
of your seven-meter drawing.

210
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,970
Jun-seo looks a lot more relaxed

211
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,098
than when he was on his date
with You-jin yesterday.

212
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,600
Yesterday, he had
heart eyes the whole time,

213
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,686
but it doesn't seem like that today.

214
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,688
-That's why he's more relaxed.
-True.

215
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,940
-He seemed uncomfortable then.
-He was awkward.

216
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,318
-Right.
-But since Min-seol's being cute and open,

217
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,946
Jun-seo became more relaxed.

218
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,907
And since Min-seol's showing
a clumsy side of herself…

219
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,244
Min-seol is naturally talkative.

220
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,704
-She's a bright person.
-Exactly.

221
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,540
That's why things are flowing naturally.

222
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,250
A lot of people are into that.

223
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,543
-Yeah.
-Right.

224
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:50,256
PARADISE
KIM HYE-JIN & KIM JEONG-SU

225
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,758
It's beautiful.

226
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,926
It really is.

227
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,599
It's like we're in space.

228
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,312
I didn't know there was a place like this.

229
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,314
But why are we suddenly talking casually?

230
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,358
It just came out naturally.

231
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,235
-Let's speak casually.
-Sounds good.

232
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,450
This place is amazing. Gosh.

233
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,535
After being stuck on Inferno yesterday…

234
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,203
-Now that I'm here…
-How does it feel?

235
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,913
This really does feel like paradise.

236
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,335
Since you've been to Paradise before…

237
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,503
-It's my first time here.
-It must not be exciting.

238
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,755
It's not like that at all.

239
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,758
-You're good at giving people a hard time.
-No.

240
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,802
I like teasing people a little bit.

241
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,095
I'm like that too.

242
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,388
-Really?
-Yeah.

243
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,849
You want to go the distance?

244
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,810
Yeah? I won't lose no matter what.

245
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,063
When I look at you,

246
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:52,652
I think you'd have fun reactions
if you were teased.

247
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,195
I hear that a lot.

248
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,279
-Right?
-Yeah.

249
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,615
-Yeah.
-People say they want to keep teasing me.

250
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,699
-Yeah.
-Why is that?

251
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,828
You seem like the type who's fun to tease.

252
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,955
-I see.
-It's probably because you take it well.

253
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,920
My gosh. This looks delicious.

254
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,257
It looks amazing.

255
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,258
Unbelievable.

256
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,428
What do you want to start with?

257
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,890
I'll…

258
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,974
I'll have this one.

259
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,769
Okay. This one.

260
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,563
-Give it.
-Not this one?

261
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,482
-Isn't this edible?
-I'll eat it.

262
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,983
I misunderstood.

263
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,404
Thank you.

264
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,531
I'll give you a mushroom too.

265
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,241
-Thank you.
-It's a garnish.

266
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,078
I thought decoration
was important to pretty women.

267
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,247
I'm pretty?

268
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,542
-Of course.
-Okay.

269
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:52,920
You know pretty well.

270
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,174
You know you're pretty, don't you?

271
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,976
Why do I keep wanting to tease you?

272
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,521
-I don't know.
-You don't?

273
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,443
My nostrils are flaring.

274
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,574
I think this could fit in there.

275
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,950
-Try it.
-That's how big…

276
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,870
Honestly, I don't usually allow it but…

277
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,834
You have a great personality.
You even played along with that.

278
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,088
So…

279
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,257
And so?

280
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,341
What is it?

281
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,010
You should take a guess now.

282
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,264
-What do you think I do?
-Who in the world are you?

283
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,311
Guess my identity.

284
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,439
-Maybe a model or…
-Yeah.

285
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,983
-Am I right?
-You're right.

286
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,235
I see. You're a model.

287
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,572
I am a model.

288
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,617
I'm 25 years old.

289
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,912
I've been modeling for an eyewear brand

290
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,039
for two years now.

291
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:14,084
I've also been shooting
a lot of beauty and fashion ads.

292
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,632
KIM HYE-JIN, AGE 25
MODEL

293
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,633
Do you want more?

294
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,302
-Want to try this?
-Let's try this.

295
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,637
Okay.

296
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,847
Thank you.

297
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,986
Didn't she say
she tends to stare intently?

298
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,987
That's right.

299
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,155
She just used that tactic.

300
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,406
-Ever so slightly.
-Yes.

301
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,703
The reflection of the lights
looks like stars in the sky.

302
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,788
Right?

303
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,582
You have a way with words.

304
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,880
I wish things would end here
on a happy note.

305
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,091
-But going back to Inferno…
-You're right.

306
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,926
I totally forgot about it.

307
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,095
Right? We'd momentarily escaped.

308
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,889
When we go back, I'm a bit worried…

309
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,391
-Worried?
-Well…

310
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,103
I'm feeling half excited and half worried.

311
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,396
It's no big deal.

312
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,106
-Yeah, let's not worry.
-I'm not worried.

313
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,857
-Let's enjoy the moment.
-Yeah.

314
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,906
I'm very surprised by Jeong-su.

315
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,117
-He changed so drastically.
-Right?

316
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,952
One thing he said that stood out was

317
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,454
he wished things
would end here on a happy note.

318
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,831
That stood out to me.

319
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,835
Yesterday, he seemed curious
about going back to Inferno.

320
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,921
Today, the person
in front of him is all he needs.

321
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,090
I think he's just saying that though.

322
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,342
-He's just in the moment?
-Don't you think so?

323
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,928
In my opinion,
I don't think Jeong-su

324
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:52,766
is attracted to the typical act
of trying to make a good impression.

325
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,561
Remember when he called
Hye-jin a "weirdo" before?

326
00:14:55,644 --> 00:15:00,024
From what I've seen,
I think he's curious and attracted to

327
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,191
those kind of traits.

328
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,735
I don't know about Jeong-su.

329
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,945
I've been observing him,
but I'm not sure.

330
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,032
I wish Jeong-su would just get drunk.

331
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,992
He said he was a lightweight.

332
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,744
-Then, his true nature…
-We'd go there.

333
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,162
We'd get him drunk and leave.

334
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,204
-That's right.
-Yes.

335
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,416
PARADISE
KIM MIN-SEOL & YUK JUN-SEO

336
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,172
This place is spacious.

337
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,131
Right?

338
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,930
The view is amazing too.

339
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,139
-It's perfect.
-What?

340
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,307
It's really nice.

341
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,144
Her swimsuit is the most conservative one
we've seen so far.

342
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,231
I've never seen
a swimsuit with a jacket before.

343
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,319
It's warm.

344
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,657
-I started on Inferno.
-Right.

345
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,699
So I'm loving this.

346
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,034
-Really?
-Yeah.

347
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,793
I was curious. What is this?

348
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,710
-This?
-Yeah.

349
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,128
It's just a bracelet.

350
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,713
-Really?
-My wrist felt bare.

351
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,714
It's pretty.

352
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,676
-It's nice.
-Yeah.

353
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,512
It says "Min-seol" right here.

354
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,642
Who did you think I was going to choose?

355
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,768
1 HOUR AGO

356
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,395
-Hye-jin.
-Hye-jin?

357
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,437
Who's that?

358
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,316
Are you being genuine
or are you pretending?

359
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,026
-Is it the person we came with?
-Yeah.

360
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,027
I see.

361
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,613
What's the name of the person
that was next to her?

362
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,864
-Ji-yeon.
-Ji-yeon?

363
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,283
-Yeah.
-Why are all the names so similar?

364
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,661
Right, you'd written my name here!

365
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,789
Min-seol, your name
is the only one that sounds different.

366
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,708
At least your name is unique.

367
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,628
Okay, let me see.
You still have that written down?

368
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,422
You should erase it now.

369
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,716
What's your last name?

370
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,427
Take a guess.

371
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,887
-It's Kim.
-That's right.

372
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,723
Why act like you don't know?

373
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,558
I wrote it down.
You think I wouldn't know?

374
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,767
Seriously.

375
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,352
You must feel at ease with me.

376
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,520
-Why?
-Right?

377
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,647
-Do you talk this way to others?
-What way?

378
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,982
"Hey, you coming or not?"

379
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:05,983
Like this.

380
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:06,942
You don't, right?

381
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,902
-Should I fix it?
-What?

382
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,613
-"You done?"
-Do you talk to your girlfriend like that?

383
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,531
-Yeah.
-"You done?"

384
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,490
-Really?
-Yeah.

385
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,784
Should I fix it?

386
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,203
Isn't that a weird question?
"Should I fix it?"

387
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,788
Try "Are you done?"

388
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,999
-Are you done?
-Are you done?

389
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,043
-Do you have to make that face?
-Are you done?

390
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,297
-It's not working.
-It's weird.

391
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,799
-I don't think it works.
-I know myself well.

392
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,259
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

393
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,345
I think if you try
to change how you speak,

394
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,308
it'll make you feel more awkward
and uncomfortable when talking.

395
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,476
Exactly.

396
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,894
Does it bother you though?

397
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,229
It doesn't bother me.

398
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,023
I'm fine with it.

399
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,609
But for others…

400
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,819
-They might be put off by it.
-I see.

401
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,781
-I'm fine with it.
-Good.

402
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,659
But when we go back to Inferno tomorrow,

403
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,829
I think you'll be popular.

404
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,706
-Why?
-What?

405
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,583
Isn't that just what you think?

406
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,168
It's because of your personality.

407
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,086
Really?

408
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,088
From what I've seen,
no one's like you.

409
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,798
Gosh, I'm in trouble now.

410
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,050
-I'm glad we're here.
-I'll be coming here every day.

411
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,677
-That would be great.
-Yeah.

412
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,056
-Everyone is so charming though.
-Yeah.

413
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,933
You might be the only one thinking that.

414
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,601
Right, I might be the only one.

415
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,564
Then, we should come back here together.

416
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,982
If that happens…

417
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,110
It's possible.

418
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,444
Look how nice this is.

419
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,238
I'm so happy right now.

420
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,700
I like it too.

421
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,785
-Right?
-Yeah.

422
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,625
This is the vibe I'm getting.

423
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,546
It feels like she's hanging out
with a close friend at the bathhouse.

424
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:57,344
Unlike when he was with You-jin,
who was similar in age,

425
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:02,641
it feels like he tries to act like
an older brother when he's with Min-seol.

426
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,268
He treats her like a younger sibling.

427
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,687
To me, what I thought was

428
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,814
this feels like a Gen Z relationship.

429
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,693
What that means is there's not much
flirtatious energy between them,

430
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:18,198
but it seems they're sharing
their own special vibe and connection.

431
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,992
-I sense that from Min-seol.
-Yeah.

432
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,493
She seems so excited.

433
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,455
I think it's a bit different
from just being comfortable.

434
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,457
Do you generally speak with that tone?

435
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,417
"You done?"

436
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,504
That tone really annoys me.

437
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,006
Like, "You done?"

438
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,257
-That tone is…
-Right.

439
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,300
"You going to eat?"

440
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,553
It's not even "Did you eat?"

441
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,848
-Guys talk like that with each other.
-Yes. Like "What did you do?"

442
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,766
It seems to be coming from that.

443
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,143
I can guarantee

444
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:50,272
there's not a single woman
in South Korea

445
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,024
who likes that way of speaking.

446
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,526
-They hate that tone.
-How about "What did you do, dear?"

447
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,820
-"Have you eaten, dear?"
-That's how older people talk.

448
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,572
-Then what?
-"Have you eaten, dear?"

449
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,532
I'd rather hear the elderly tone.

450
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,950
-"You eat?"
-"Did you eat?"

451
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,869
No matter how cute you say it…

452
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,455
-"Did you eat?"
-"Have you eaten, dear?"

453
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,875
MEN'S INFERNO

454
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,211
-Let's go.
-So that's where you get the water.

455
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,421
Yes, I've never been there at night.

456
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,131
My gosh. Look at the moon.

457
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,842
It's completely red.

458
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,927
You're right.

459
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,607
-Your eyelashes are really thick and long.
-Me?

460
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,318
Since we're under the lights right now,

461
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,946
they stand out even more.

462
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,822
People ask if I got extensions.

463
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,865
Seriously.

464
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,492
-Totally.
-They're my brooms.

465
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,788
My eyelashes are a bit…

466
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,414
-I'm jealous.
-You're jealous?

467
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,832
-You are?
-I am.

468
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,833
I see.

469
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,801
The left and right sides
of your face seem very different.

470
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,386
-Really?
-Yes.

471
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:06,306
This side seems a bit more masculine,

472
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,976
and the other side seems a bit more fair.

473
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,894
-Really?
-Yes.

474
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:15,107
You touched on it, but I do have
a bit of an asymmetrical face.

475
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,609
I'm amazed at how you noticed that.

476
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,568
-Really?
-Yes.

477
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,196
Rather than seeing it as asymmetrical…

478
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,531
The sides just look different?

479
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,075
They give off different vibes.

480
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,910
You pay close attention to details.

481
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,079
-I think so.
-And you're observant.

482
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:33,583
I think I have
a sensitive feel for things.

483
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,169
Do you prefer one side over the other?

484
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:42,467
It's not about one side
looking better or worse,

485
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,469
so I don't think it matters.

486
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,888
Then, depending on your mood,
I'll turn from side to side.

487
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,266
Yes, you should take turns
showing each side.

488
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,726
I'll go back and forth.

489
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,977
All right.

490
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,857
In conversations, you know how to make it
comfortable and fun for the other person.

491
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,275
Really?

492
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,113
Did it mistake me for light?

493
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,823
Because I'm glowing?

494
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,828
Saying that kind of comment
about themselves

495
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,331
must be how Gen Z are these days.

496
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:16,168
For Gen X folks like us,
we'd be scolded if we said that.

497
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,879
Did it mistake me for light?

498
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,130
Because I'm glowing?

499
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,382
"Because I'm glowing."

500
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,509
-Right.
-You should've said that for me.

501
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,969
I was about to.

502
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,472
I was looking for the right words.

503
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,266
No, I noticed you gasped.

504
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,435
-No, I'm usually more expressive.
-Right.

505
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,979
But you swooped right in.

506
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:40,108
I felt embarrassed, so I couldn't wait.

507
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,069
-I'll call the moth back later.
-Okay.

508
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,820
Let's try again.

509
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,448
Should we go now?

510
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,532
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

511
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,120
Now that I'm looking at you,
you're really tall.

512
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,121
-My height?
-Yes.

513
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,956
That's my one advantage. My height.

514
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,417
-Can I check our height difference?
-Sure.

515
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,753
-I'll take these off.
-Okay.

516
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,088
-What?
-What's happening?

517
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,215
I can't see. What are they doing?

518
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,257
What's going on?

519
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,634
Go somewhere with light.

520
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,803
Suddenly checking heights
with their shoes off?

521
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,763
-I'll take these off.
-Okay.

522
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,431
-All right.
-My slipper soles are thick.

523
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,891
I'll take mine off too.

524
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,392
Just one foot?

525
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,603
-Yes.
-You're so tall.

526
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,230
How… Hold on.

527
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,524
-I think…
-I feel like I'm looking way up at you.

528
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,110
I'm about 166 to 167 cm tall.

529
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,946
So 20 cm?

530
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,739
That's a big difference.

531
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,994
It's the first time
I've measured my height here.

532
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,413
-Really? I was curious.
-I doubt it'll happen again.

533
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:39,209
I wanted to see the difference
in height between us.

534
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,546
She seemed to have a bright personality,

535
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,256
so I was attracted to that.

536
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,008
It was fun when she asked
to compare our heights.

537
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,469
I think that's when I noticed her charm.

538
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,846
She took initiative.

539
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,640
You-jin's the type

540
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,560
who makes the other person
feel very comfortable.

541
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,353
-She's good at that.
-That's right.

542
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:09,114
PARADISE
JANG THEO & LEE SI-AN

543
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,491
I'm so hungry.

544
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,789
-Did you sleep well?
-What?

545
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,832
Did you sleep well?

546
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,669
How could I sleep well
with you right in front of me?

547
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,383
Now that you've had
a night's sleep, you're back.

548
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,012
-My babbling's back?
-You were sluggish last night.

549
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,103
You choose your outfits so well.
Yesterday's was nice too.

550
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,771
Your clothes are so pretty.

551
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,692
Don't dress like this
if you come here with someone else.

552
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,905
Don't shower,
and don't brush your teeth either.

553
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,990
Jeez.

554
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,367
It's early, but there you go again.

555
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,661
Unbelievable.

556
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,082
I'll have to do my best

557
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,376
to survive on Inferno.

558
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,338
Today's going to be…

559
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,839
Goodness.

560
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,843
This is the hottest inferno in the world.
Single's Inferno.

561
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:16,264
Starting from today,
the two Infernos will merge into one.

562
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,183
It's starting from today.

563
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,062
-Okay.
-Let's go.

564
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,648
-Finally, the war has begun.
-Yeah.

565
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,359
Aren't you excited?

566
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,446
I hope things turn into chaos.

567
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,250
What?

568
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,918
Why are you laughing?

569
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,426
At that moment,
I think I did wonder a little bit.

570
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,222
YESTERDAY MORNING

571
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,648
"Did Jeong-su go to Paradise?"

572
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,317
That's what I was most curious about.

573
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,570
But I think he did.

574
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,204
I just don't get women.

575
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,414
I thought it was over.

576
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,333
But on the ride back,
she's thinking about the previous guy.

577
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,043
What if this is the case?

578
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,337
Theo has slowly grown on Si-an.

579
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,255
Right.

580
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,799
But on her way back,
maybe it's withering away.

581
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,011
-So…
-Aren't those feelings disappearing?

582
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,764
Theo and Jeong-su's charms
are very different.

583
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,682
They are.

584
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:45,395
But I think Si-an seems
like someone whose heart is open.

585
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,397
-Yeah.
-Right.

586
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,445
Also, all the participants this season
seem to have a similar attitude.

587
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,698
From what I can tell,
she's just been exploring so far.

588
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,451
I think things will kick into gear.

589
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,202
-She'll start for real now.
-Utter chaos.

590
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,163
Things will get messy.

591
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,721
-She's coming from Women's Inferno.
-Yeah, you're right.

592
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,598
A woman they haven't met.

593
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,692
Hello.

594
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,196
-Hello.
-Hello.

595
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,406
Hello.

596
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,409
-Hello.
-Hello.

597
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,122
-Hello.
-Hello.

598
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,545
You're on a new island.

599
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,963
I know, right?

600
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,887
-What's your name?
-My name's Bae Ji-yeon.

601
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,013
I'm Kim Te-hwan.

602
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,556
Hello.

603
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,891
I'm Kook Dong-ho.

604
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,018
-Kook Dong-ho. Hello.
-Hello.

605
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,940
What did you do yesterday on Inferno?

606
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,691
-Yesterday?
-Or were you in Paradise?

607
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,859
I was on Inferno.

608
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,194
You were?

609
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,445
On Inferno,

610
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,864
I ate dinner by myself.

611
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,785
YESTERDAY EVENING

612
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,456
I can't eat anymore.

613
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,667
Seriously.

614
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,960
-She really ate alone.
-No way.

615
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,255
How does someone as beautiful as her
end up eating alone?

616
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,631
-Exactly.
-Right?

617
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,341
By yourself?

618
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,513
Yes.

619
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,058
It was the four of us here on Inferno.

620
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,309
Really?

621
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,770
-Still, it must've been fun.
-Yes.

622
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,402
Ji-yeon had a bright smile and kind eyes.

623
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,321
It made me want to talk with her.

624
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,452
Are they coming back with duffle bags?

625
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,369
Yeah.

626
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,708
He must be hot.

627
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,252
Hello.

628
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,504
-Hello.
-Hello.

629
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,216
Sorry. We forgot to bring
our wedding invitations.

630
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,718
Jeez.

631
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,304
The overly talkative guy.

632
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,431
Why does he always
act like that on Inferno?

633
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,975
It's so unusual.

634
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,937
Sorry. We forgot to bring
our wedding invitations.

635
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,189
Jeez.

636
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,982
We forgot to bring
our wedding invitations.

637
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,358
Jeez.

638
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,778
Unbelievable.

639
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,073
Where should I put the bags?

640
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,451
-I'll put them here.
-At the front is fine.

641
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,954
-Hello.
-Hello.

642
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,755
I was wondering if Jun-seo
would walk in with a girl or alone.

643
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,217
I was thinking about that while waiting.

644
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,225
We're here.

645
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,393
We've come back home.

646
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,853
-Really?
-Yeah.

647
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,397
-There are swings too.
-We came here first.

648
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,315
Amazing.

649
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,734
The swings weren't there before.

650
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,152
This is so heavy.

651
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,822
-It's so heavy.
-You're carrying everything.

652
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,949
I'm the only one carrying this!

653
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,033
Why are you so weak?

654
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,327
Your arms are almost
as big as your thighs.

655
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,081
Isn't Jun-seo a former UDT soldier?

656
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,375
It looks like he's on a march.

657
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,669
But the two of them look cute together.

658
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,754
-I'm dying.
-This is as light as a feather.

659
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,674
It's so heavy!

660
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,300
He's carrying hers with ease.

661
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,177
Why do I have to carry this with you?

662
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,345
This is so heavy.

663
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,513
Make them slow down a bit.

664
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,597
Seriously.

665
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,141
Is that Jeong-su?

666
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,396
-I think it's the guy who came in second.
-Yes.

667
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,899
They're all coming.

668
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,612
Incredible.

669
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:08,992
Hello.

670
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,952
-How have you been?
-Hello.

671
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,997
-How have you been?
-Hello.

672
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,138
At first, Si-an and I made eye contact.

673
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,181
Then, she smiled.

674
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,183
So I guess…

675
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,352
I felt a bit sorry.

676
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:40,356
That's how I felt a little bit.
I was also glad to see her again.

677
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,400
I had a lot of mixed emotions.

678
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:47,196
So I think I was a bit flustered at first.

679
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,501
Where do we go?

680
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,128
-Hello.
-Hello.

681
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,631
Wait, why do they look so good together?

682
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,341
They both have curly hair.

683
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,513
-Hello.
-Hello.

684
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,598
Hello.

685
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,143
-Everyone's finally here.
-You're right.

686
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,187
Finally. It's all of us.

687
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:29,072
After seeing Jun-seo come back
from Paradise again with a woman,

688
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:33,576
it didn't make me feel great.

689
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,420
Gosh.

690
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,631
-Finally, everyone's come together.
-Right.

691
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:52,637
You can tell Si-an is leaning heavily
towards Jeong-su rather than Theo.

692
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,805
Her head.

693
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,182
-Right.
-It's pointing in his direction.

694
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,393
And her smile earlier…

695
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,019
It looked a bit wistful.

696
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,021
But the two Infernos have merged now.

697
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,148
-Yes.
-Some are meeting for the first time.

698
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:08,361
I think Te-hwan sent Ji-yeon some signals.

699
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,030
After he heard Ji-yeon had been alone…

700
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,115
Right.

701
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,075
Don't you think Te-hwan is so funny?

702
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,828
He acted too relaxed.

703
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,080
-Exactly.
-Did anyone notice that?

704
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,500
He seemed relaxed,
but he's kind of like a robot.

705
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,586
-Right? And he's so pale.
-You're right.

706
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,841
I'm eager to see his true personality.

707
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,886
I have so many questions right now.

708
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,681
-Too many.
-Well, the two of you went first.

709
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,266
I've been dying to know.

710
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,059
-Yeah, I'm curious too.
-How was it?

711
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,148
Well, for me…

712
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,151
We talked a lot.

713
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:52,030
So it was fun, and we had a good time.

714
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,949
-It was great.
-It must've been fun.

715
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,703
It was just…

716
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,913
"We talked a lot."

717
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,916
It seemed like it was just that.

718
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,337
I'm curious about your date, Min-seol.

719
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,255
-Me?
-Yes.

720
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,715
You went with the same guy.

721
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,758
That's right.

722
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,677
-I…
-Face each other.

723
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,346
Honestly, I didn't think I'd go.

724
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,515
I really didn't expect it.

725
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,268
I think it was similar.

726
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:26,189
When I think back on it,
we just talked a lot.

727
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,857
And we ate good food.

728
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,359
You just reminded me of something.

729
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:34,322
He's totally different
from the first impression he gave.

730
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,240
-Jun-seo?
-Yes.

731
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,160
He's like a completely different person.

732
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:45,374
So I told him the other girls
might be scared of him.

733
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,709
I still think he's scary.

734
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,421
When you two walked in earlier,
you were carrying the bag together.

735
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,715
-I thought he made you carry it.
-Really?

736
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,675
His face looks so fierce.

737
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,512
That was because
he became nauseous on the way back.

738
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,222
He had a really hard time.

739
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,391
Please slow down.

740
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,227
Easy, point. I mean, you two.

741
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,813
Hey, he wants you to slow down.
He's too tired.

742
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,397
-"Easy, point."
-"Easy, point."

743
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,315
"Easy, point."

744
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,692
-That was jargon.
-Right.

745
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,194
We use that in the military.

746
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,570
-Easy, point?
-Yes.

747
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,364
Easy, point. I mean, you two.

748
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,991
Hey, he wants you to slow down.
He's too tired.

749
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,244
-Excuse me. He wants you to slow down.
-Jeong-su.

750
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,371
-Sorry.
-He's struggling.

751
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,081
He asked me to carry half of it.

752
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,876
It's not what you'd expect, right?

753
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,587
-Yes, with that great physique…
-He's so different.

754
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,965
And he has a fierce look,
but he asked for help.

755
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,049
-"Help me."
-It was funny.

756
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,051
Yeah, he's really funny.

757
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,553
-He's so funny.
-Seriously.

758
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,513
-I can't imagine it.
-He's hilarious.

759
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:45,560
I didn't think of her as competition.

760
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:50,398
I think he enjoyed
his time with me a lot more,

761
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,442
so I feel a bit better about it.

762
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,487
If I said I didn't care, I'd be lying.

763
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,405
But…

764
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,116
Maybe since I was his recent date,
it didn't affect me much.

765
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,703
What matters is
I went with him most recently.

766
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,709
I'm glad they're both in a good mood.

767
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,466
I'm curious, Si-an.

768
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,553
I'm the most curious
because we went with the same person.

769
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,846
That's right.

770
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:27,852
When I was on the helicopter,
I got motion sickness.

771
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,229
So he kept massaging my hand.

772
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,355
My gosh!

773
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,235
And he massaged my hand
the whole time until we arrived.

774
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,361
The whole time?

775
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,072
Even though I told him
I was okay, he kept…

776
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,991
-He kept massaging?
-But the thing is…

777
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,660
I was still thinking
about that massage today.

778
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,704
-Seriously?
-So that's why you said you swooned.

779
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,623
Yeah, I think that's why.

780
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,708
My gosh.

781
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,835
-Things were hot from day one.
-Exactly.

782
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,379
I guess it was pretty intense.

783
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,882
That's incredible.

784
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,425
Hold on, this guy is…

785
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,679
He didn't do the same for you, did he?

786
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,139
Gosh, he's good at this.

787
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,265
"He's good at this."

788
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,100
What? Did he give you a massage?

789
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,560
No, he didn't.

790
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,731
But I think there were
a lot of similar situations.

791
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,359
-He kept taking care of me.
-He did?

792
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,569
What a gentleman.

793
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,614
We kept teasing each other.

794
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,242
-And we joked around a lot.
-I see.

795
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,287
In relationships,

796
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,915
I like it when my partner
feels like a friend.

797
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,710
And Jeong-su gave off that vibe.

798
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,588
So I felt a bit of attraction to him.

799
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,926
But after talking with Si-an,

800
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,806
I realized there was
some common behavior he showed.

801
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,356
-What?
-What?

802
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,109
Shouldn't you get up?

803
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:04,282
He's incredibly considerate
and seems really gentle.

804
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,124
So I decided to
keep an eye on him for now.

805
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,587
If you're still thinking
about that massage today,

806
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,381
then the guy you went with yesterday…

807
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,465
-Right.
-Your chemistry…

808
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,302
You went with the guy
who was next to you, right?

809
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,469
That's right.

810
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,014
He has a unique personality.

811
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,433
He has a different type of charm.

812
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,562
But what made you swoon was the massage?

813
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,522
-She kept thinking about it.
-She did.

814
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:40,318
-The other guy didn't give a massage.
-That's important.

815
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,240
It was the massage.

816
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,665
To be honest,
my time with Theo in Paradise

817
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,044
didn't make me swoon at all.

818
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,378
The reason is

819
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,715
he would confess
his feelings for me constantly.

820
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,259
So it didn't feel all that genuine.

821
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,678
It didn't resonate with me.

822
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,808
I see.

823
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,978
Doesn't Theo seem
overly confident right now?

824
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,814
He thinks she fell for him

825
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,983
since he made
that wedding invitation joke.

826
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:26,155
Yeah, and in contrast,
Si-an's true feelings are so different.

827
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,741
What if Theo keeps confessing
his love in this current state?

828
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,785
That would be a disaster.

829
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,911
It'd mean he's clueless.

830
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,079
I think he'll keep going.

831
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,497
-I know.
-I think he will.

832
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,166
I'm curious to know
what kind of person Jeong-su is.

833
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,752
This might be his way of flirting.

834
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,712
You know what it's like?

835
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,840
It's not always things you do
during good times that stand out.

836
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,219
When she was nauseous
and having a hard time on the helicopter,

837
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,553
he remained calm

838
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,932
and quietly massaged her hand
while looking straight ahead.

839
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,683
I definitely think

840
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:59,146
those kinds of acts
can make a woman fall for someone.

841
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,066
But the moment you realize

842
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:07,113
he's doing the same things
for others as he did for me…

843
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,281
-Right.
-They can become unattractive.

844
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,741
-That's true.
-That's what I think.

845
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:14,620
I think Jeong-su needs to make
a decision before it's too late.

846
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,830
Yes.

847
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,165
I'm hungry!

848
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,209
I'm so hungry.

849
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,503
Seaweed soup and brown rice.

850
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,255
Wow, it looks delicious.

851
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,467
I'll serve the soup.

852
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,635
It's hot.

853
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,054
Do you like seaweed?

854
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:33,931
-No.
-You don't?

855
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:34,849
Nope.

856
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,272
-How many more bowls?
-Just the meat.

857
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,275
This is yours.

858
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,818
-Thank you.
-I gave you only meat.

859
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,072
I'll take that.

860
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,449
But it's mine.

861
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,450
I know.

862
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,534
Here you go.

863
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,206
Should we sit down?

864
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,770
-Jeong-su is a pro.
-Totally.

865
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,356
While garnishing her soup,
he secured his seat.

866
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,357
I know, right?

867
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,568
The way he garnished it was extraordinary.

868
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,195
He did it so skillfully.

869
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,071
He must've done it a lot before.

870
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,867
He's a guy who's good at everything.

871
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,951
-Enjoy.
-Shall we dig in?

872
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,204
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

873
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,664
-Enjoy your meal.
-Eat up.

874
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,665
Enjoy.

875
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,876
Who ladled this bowl?
I have only one piece of meat.

876
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,755
I ladled them randomly.

877
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,424
But we rode on the swings together before.

878
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,509
You're right.

879
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,093
You have only one piece of meat?

880
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,178
Just kidding.

881
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,601
It's delicious.

882
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,769
Is it good?

883
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,695
My arm needs to be
two meters long to reach the kimchi.

884
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,076
Someone should pass the kimchi to her.

885
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,410
Te-hwan, make a move.

886
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,207
-What?
-There you go.

887
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,501
-He's caring for her.
-Because Ji-yeon was lonely.

888
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,502
-Yeah.
-That's right.

889
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,301
Amazing.

890
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,348
Here's some kimchi.

891
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,100
Thank you.

892
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,149
What did you have for lunch yesterday?

893
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,152
Yesterday's lunch was
sweet potatoes and chicken breast.

894
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,487
-So it was the same.
-Yes.

895
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,788
I've been eating way too much.

896
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,123
Yeah.

897
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,333
I've been eating a ton too.

898
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,877
Yesterday, I ate like I was possessed.

899
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,010
I kept eating
until right before I went to bed.

900
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,928
How do you eat right before going to bed?

901
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,388
We just ate as we talked.

902
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:23,267
Yesterday, we went to a restaurant,
and there was a lot of food.

903
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,562
We had things like pasta and steak.

904
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,230
She's still talking about yesterday.

905
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,898
It might annoy her a little.

906
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,109
I bet Jun-seo's feeling uncomfortable.

907
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,777
-He's uneasy.
-Yes.

908
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,577
It was very awkward.

909
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:46,123
I couldn't get close to Jun-seo
or even make eye contact with him.

910
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:49,877
That's why I sat a bit farther away

911
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,754
and didn't look in his direction.

912
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,049
It still feels a bit awkward.

913
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:03,974
In a few moments, the women will play
a game to win a dessert date.

914
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,728
The women will play a game…

915
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,104
Another women's game?

916
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,022
Again?

917
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,316
Please gather at the pool now.

918
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,692
The pool?

919
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,486
Seriously.

920
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:44,556
What is that?

921
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,227
Hold on.

922
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,020
I can't believe this.

923
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,064
-Are we pushing each other?
-I think so.

924
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,748
Today, with dessert
and iced coffee on the line,

925
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,542
the women will play a game.

926
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,295
I want coffee.

927
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,338
I really want some.

928
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,799
The woman who wins the game

929
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,803
will choose one man for a date.

930
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,597
Today's game is…

931
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,684
a race across the log.

932
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,854
…a race across the log.

933
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,771
What?

934
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,815
What do we do?

935
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,608
How do we cross this?

936
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,403
-A race?
-A race?

937
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:43,073
First, the men will stand
on top of the log.

938
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:43,991
-What?
-What?

939
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:44,908
What?

940
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,410
We're supposed to get on?

941
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,291
When the whistle blows,
a woman will cross the log

942
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,251
from one end to the other.

943
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,589
If she safely makes it to the end
without falling, she completes the game.

944
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:03,510
But if anyone falls off the log,
man or woman,

945
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,679
they are immediately disqualified.

946
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:10,559
Only the fastest woman to cross

947
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,228
will be able to pick a date.

948
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,897
Wait, my lower body is so weak.

949
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,192
We will decide the order by drawing names.

950
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,946
-They're going to help.
-Yeah, they'll help them cross.

951
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,492
This may be more
about the physical contact than winning.

952
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,994
It's just about how it feels
as they pass by.

953
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,787
-And it's skin-to-skin contact.
-Exactly.

954
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,039
So it's kind of…

955
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,790
They might hold on for no reason.

956
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,001
If it were me and the woman I liked came…

957
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,253
-Would you hold onto her?
-I'd hug her and fall in.

958
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,547
I wouldn't want her to hug another guy.

959
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,673
That's right.

960
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,759
Yeah, that could be a strategy too.

961
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,015
It's narrower than I thought.

962
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,559
I think it's only wide enough
for one person.

963
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,853
Is it possible to make it across?

964
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,151
This must be nerve-racking.

965
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,530
It's super narrow.

966
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,907
This isn't safe for us either.

967
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,367
I think we all might fall off.

968
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,622
My goodness.

969
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,748
NUMBER 1, CHUNG YOU-JIN

970
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,795
There's more space here.

971
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:22,214
You should step on these areas.

972
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,929
You-jin still seems awkward with Jun-seo.

973
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,478
Chung You-jin.

974
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,981
Please start when the whistle blows.

975
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,651
Get ready.

976
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,739
My goodness!

977
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:55,872
Hold on.

978
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,666
-Hold on.
-Okay.

979
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,049
My goodness!

980
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,593
The skin-to-skin contact.

981
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,511
-They're extremely close.
-Yeah.

982
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,817
She's crossing!

983
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,527
Oh my God!

984
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,530
She's crossing!

985
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,534
No!

986
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,494
No!

987
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,455
No!

988
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,124
My gosh! You need to hold on.

989
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,335
-Is that Te-hwan? Come on!
-No, hold on!

990
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,919
-No!
-If he falls…

991
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,880
No!

992
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:49,926
No!

993
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,974
-Come on.
-He has to hold on.

994
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,143
Why is he pushing his behind out?

995
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,187
What's he doing? What's with his posture?

996
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,493
I can't look!

997
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,664
-Why are you clapping?
-It's so funny.

998
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,541
-Wait, bring your legs together.
-Slowly.

999
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,876
-Bring them together?
-Wait, no.

1000
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,002
No.

1001
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,545
Maybe this wide?

1002
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,839
Wait, move back a bit.

1003
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:32,886
It doesn't look easy.

1004
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,513
-That looks so hard.
-My gosh!

1005
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,349
Did you see his polite hand?

1006
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,394
You're right. What's that?

1007
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,354
He was using his wrist.

1008
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,481
-He's even perfect with his wrist.
-He can use it.

1009
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,073
Hold on. Let me grab your shoulder.

1010
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,325
The first one's the hardest.

1011
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,289
-Like this.
-Move back a bit.

1012
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,468
Put your foot here.

1013
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,221
Wait, let me pass.

1014
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,975
Lean back a little bit.

1015
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,518
He has polite hands too.

1016
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,145
He's being polite like this.

1017
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:26,398
If you think about it,
those polite hands could also mean

1018
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,108
they're not interested at all.

1019
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,025
It's possible.

1020
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,777
Why use polite hands here?

1021
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,113
This can tell us their level of interest.

1022
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,114
That's true.

1023
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,365
Don't you think so?

1024
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,790
So it's like this.

1025
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,751
Chung You-jin has completed the game.

1026
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:46,918
All right.

1027
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,504
-She did it.
-She was the first one to succeed.

1028
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,423
You just need to not fall.

1029
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,049
-And don't rush.
-I hope no one falls.

1030
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,726
-Why are you wetting your toes?
-Why not?

1031
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,061
NUMBER 2, KIM HYE-JIN

1032
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,313
Kim Hye-jin.

1033
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,815
Please start when the whistle blows.

1034
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,733
Get ready.

1035
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,740
Right away.

1036
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,450
Right away.

1037
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,294
She's not hesitating at all.

1038
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:32,547
Hold on!

1039
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,257
Hold on!

1040
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:36,802
Hold on!

1041
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:37,886
Jeez, Te-hwan.

1042
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,805
-Why is he…
-Seriously!

1043
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:40,806
What is he doing?

1044
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,654
Hold on!

1045
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,697
Hold on.

1046
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,783
He's the problem!

1047
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,285
This is so funny!

1048
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,787
They're both so lanky.

1049
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,871
Hold on.

1050
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,957
Why are you so slippery?

1051
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,999
-Me?
-Yes.

1052
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:08,959
Okay.

1053
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,837
Wait, hold on.

1054
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,339
Te-hwan!

1055
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,174
No, you can't let her fall.

1056
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,759
That's the danger zone.

1057
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,886
-Fall in.
-Push her in.

1058
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,641
She did it.

1059
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,520
-Here.
-Okay.

1060
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,605
-Here.
-Okay.

1061
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,861
-You see that?
-He's different.

1062
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,445
-Yeah.
-His pinky scratched her.

1063
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,364
-Did you see his pinky?
-He scratched her.

1064
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,533
-No polite hands here.
-He's acting different.

1065
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,785
-This is such a strange game.
-What is this?

1066
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,854
The rest of the way is smooth.

1067
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,738
-His hands don't touch.
-They don't.

1068
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,624
Kim Hye-jin has completed the game.

1069
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,128
I guess it's easier to do than we thought.

1070
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,132
I'm nervous.

1071
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,884
So nervous.

1072
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,265
-It's nothing.
-What?

1073
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,433
-It's nothing.
-Right.

1074
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,893
-I'll just leave it to you.
-Okay.

1075
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,645
-But you have to hang on.
-Okay.

1076
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,646
You can't go limp.

1077
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,314
Don't leave everything to me.

1078
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,900
Lee Si-an. Get ready.

1079
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,827
You're too tense. Relax.

1080
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,915
You're too tense. Relax.

1081
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,422
She's fast.

1082
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,424
Why did you put on oil?

1083
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,135
They've put on a bunch of oil.

1084
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,680
-She's fast.
-Why is she so quick?

1085
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,639
She's quick.

1086
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,015
Si-an is focused.

1087
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,101
She wants to go on a date with someone.

1088
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,812
-She's fast.
-Why is she so quick?

1089
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:37,691
-Wait, why are you so quick?
-Why on earth did you put on oil?

1090
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,858
I put on oil too.

1091
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,490
-He just hugged her.
-He just…

1092
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,492
He literally gave her a hug.

1093
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,703
He wasn't even using his hands earlier.

1094
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,538
He wasn't just helping her pass.

1095
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,873
-He just hugged her.
-He gave her a hug.

1096
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:54,874
-He wanted a hug.
-Yes.

1097
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,251
-This is his excuse.
-He did.

1098
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,168
He just hugged her.

1099
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,174
I put on oil too.

1100
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,384
She's good.

1101
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,303
She's so fast!

1102
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,473
-How do we beat that?
-Lee Si-an has completed the game.

1103
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,683
LEE SI-AN COMPLETES THE GAME

1104
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:12,809
She was the fastest.

1105
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,520
How did you do it so fast?

1106
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,439
Watch out for oil on numbers two and four.

1107
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,107
Numbers two and four? Okay.

1108
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,779
I feel like I'll rush and fall in.

1109
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,451
Kim Min-seol. Get ready.

1110
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,457
-Come on.
-Hold on!

1111
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,209
-Come on.
-Hold on!

1112
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,586
Wait. Okay.

1113
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,938
-What? She fell in on her own.
-Oh no!

1114
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,899
It looked like Jun-seo pushed her in.

1115
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,777
-It's like he tossed her in.
-Jun-seo.

1116
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,778
Jun-seo…

1117
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,454
Was that on purpose?

1118
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:15,580
Why did you push me?

1119
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,790
Was that on purpose?

1120
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,957
Why did you push me?

1121
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,462
-Kim Min-seol is eliminated.
-Seriously.

1122
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,382
What happened yesterday?

1123
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,801
Nothing.

1124
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,385
I mean, I just started…

1125
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,303
Wait.

1126
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:31,888
Let's go.

1127
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,853
-I'm seriously going to lose my mind!
-This is so funny.

1128
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:45,902
I didn't do it on purpose.

1129
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,154
Just unbelievable.

1130
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,573
Seriously.

1131
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,411
I couldn't make it to the end. I'm so sad.

1132
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:56,955
But that was--

1133
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,957
If he'd tried to hold on until the end

1134
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,961
and fell in together with her,
that would've been better.

1135
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,672
As a former UDT soldier,
Jun-seo hates cold water.

1136
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,758
I'd know this. He probably has PTSD.

1137
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,052
Yes, I'm sure he hates cold water.

1138
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,429
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

1139
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,475
Bae Ji-yeon.

1140
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,477
Please start when the whistle blows.

1141
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,149
Get ready.

1142
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:50,800
Really?

1143
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,010
Really?

1144
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,344
-What?
-What's going on?

1145
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,305
It seems Jun-seo is really tired.

1146
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,222
Jun-seo.

1147
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,808
Tired from what?
He's just been standing there.

1148
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,274
Number one is the problem!

1149
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,651
Bae Ji-yeon is eliminated.

1150
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,945
You didn't toss her, right?

1151
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,073
You're soaked.

1152
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,617
Come here to the left.

1153
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,993
-Seriously.
-My gosh.

1154
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,662
My gosh. Are you okay?

1155
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,499
-Are you okay?
-Yes. Are you okay?

1156
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,376
But when Jun-seo fell in this time…

1157
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,463
-He tried his best to protect Ji-yeon.
-Right.

1158
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,380
That's right.

1159
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,425
He still tried to throw me back on.

1160
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,471
The way they fell was pretty romantic.

1161
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,183
Hey, switch places with me.
Being first is overwhelming.

1162
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,602
-Take your time.
-Okay.

1163
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,438
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

1164
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,609
Jun-seo right now is just…

1165
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,195
-He's been humiliated.
-Seriously.

1166
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,447
-His reputation took a hit.
-It did.

1167
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,328
NUMBER 6, KIM A-RIN

1168
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:03,081
I'm suddenly so nervous
now that two people fell in.

1169
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,336
-Go slow here.
-Yes, slowly.

1170
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,588
-It's slippery here.
-I don't want to fall…

1171
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,590
I'm getting nervous now.

1172
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:15,885
You're already soaked.

1173
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,763
I won't get greedy.

1174
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:19,847
-Yes, slowly.
-Okay.

1175
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,768
Kim A-rin. Get ready.

1176
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,603
Get ready.

1177
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,483
Here we go.

1178
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,068
Pretend I'm not here.

1179
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,361
No, you're right here.

1180
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,783
Grab me!

1181
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,912
Grab me!

1182
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,291
Grab me!

1183
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,046
Again!

1184
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,173
My goodness.

1185
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,633
He tried so hard to save her.

1186
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,802
-He pushed her towards the log.
-He tried.

1187
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:00,597
This is a disaster.

1188
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,141
-Jun-seo, what are you going to do?
-My goodness.

1189
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,809
Grab me!

1190
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,102
Seriously!

1191
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,604
He's the problem!

1192
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,230
Seriously!

1193
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,189
He's the problem!

1194
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,530
Kim A-rin is eliminated.

1195
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,617
How did you make it past him?

1196
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,619
-How did you do it?
-He turned out to be a trap.

1197
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:23,745
How did you get across?

1198
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:26,205
Kim A-rin is eliminated.

1199
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,000
-How did you get across?
-Are you okay?

1200
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,043
I want to go home.

1201
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,755
The water's so refreshing.

1202
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:35,882
I'm so sorry.

1203
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,884
-It wasn't intentional.
-It's fine.

1204
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,928
-Still, he fell in with her.
-He pushed me. I fell in alone.

1205
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,514
Three people couldn't make it.

1206
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:48,519
A dessert and iced coffee date
was on the line in the women's game.

1207
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,105
Third place is Kim Hye-jin

1208
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,192
with a time of 1 minute, 7.5 seconds.

1209
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,485
A minute's fast.

1210
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,197
Second place is…

1211
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:12,126
Chung You-jin with a time
of 49.12 seconds.

1212
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,590
First place is Lee Si-an

1213
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,717
with a time of 20.72 seconds.

1214
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,969
Twenty seconds.

1215
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,805
Really?

1216
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,724
-It was a landslide.
-Yeah.

1217
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,643
Is it going to be Theo or Jeong-su?

1218
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,353
I think she'll pick Jeong-su.

1219
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,437
She'll pick him.

1220
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,940
But Jeong-su is definitely
on her mind right now.

1221
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,567
Lee Si-an.

1222
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:40,822
Please choose the person
you'd like to go on a date with.

1223
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:44,534
The person I'd like to go
on a dessert date with is…

1224
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:03,761
I thought, "Surely, she'll pick me."

1225
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,723
I think we've shared
a lot of emotional connections.

1226
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,475
We get along well too.

1227
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,478
I think Si-an will still be into me.

1228
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,564
Isn't life all about confidence?

1229
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:19,277
The person I'd like to go
