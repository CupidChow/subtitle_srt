SINGLE'S INFERNO

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,888
How are things?
Have you narrowed down who you like?

16
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,561
Who is it? Can I ask?

17
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,025
This is what I've said.

18
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,944
I'll be able to say for sure
after today's conversation.

19
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,113
-Were you waiting for someone?
-What?

20
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,199
I've kept saying
that I wanted to talk to you.

21
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,617
-Really? Why?
-Yeah.

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,952
I've been saying,
"I want to talk to Si-an."

23
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,120
She didn't know?

24
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,705
-I guess not.
-Jeez.

25
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,832
She must've thought
they were just friends.

26
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,044
I've kept saying
that I wanted to talk to you.

27
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,462
-Really? Why?
-Yeah.

28
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,714
I've been saying,
"I want to talk to Si-an."

29
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,258
I had no clue.

30
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,261
-Last time, when we had coffee together…
-Yeah.

31
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,221
It was really short.

32
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,514
-Yeah.
-But…

33
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,307
You were different from what I imagined.

34
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,060
And that was the type of personality
I've always liked.

35
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,145
-I see.
-Yeah. I thought it was great.

36
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,773
I thought hanging out with you
would be fun and relaxing.

37
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,941
I completely…

38
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,236
Honestly, after talking with you,

39
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,113
I wasn't really sure.

40
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,030
-Really?
-Nope.

41
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,949
-You didn't feel anything?
-I didn't.

42
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,951
I didn't feel anything.

43
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:03,456
You were more laid-back than I expected.
That's exactly my type.

44
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,043
I thought, "If I'm with her,
at least it won't be boring."

45
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,798
I guess we were on different wavelengths.

46
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,216
Yeah, really.

47
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,926
-What a shame.
-It's a shame.

48
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,430
Wow, so that's how it was.

49
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,897
How do I put this?
You have this strong appearance.

50
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,815
Strong appearance?

51
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,358
But you're so easygoing.

52
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,943
That contrast is very attractive.

53
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,487
You're suddenly laying it on thick.

54
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,947
It's different from our last date.

55
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,032
I was the same.
I said the same thing back there.

56
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,367
You just don't remember.

57
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,869
-No.
-What?

58
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,786
No.

59
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,497
I told you that you were different
from what I expected.

60
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,207
-That is true.
-It's the same thing.

61
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,251
Right, but it's just…

62
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,586
You're right.

63
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,254
She's not accepting it.

64
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,589
-She's not.
-No.

65
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,465
-She's feeling something.
-Really?

66
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,467
-Yeah, she is.
-Really? Are you sure?

67
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,182
But you know, when you talk with others,

68
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,228
you can't keep asking
about how Inferno or Paradise is

69
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,938
or if they're enjoying the food.

70
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,318
You can't talk about
the same, old superficial stuff forever.

71
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,570
But no matter how much time
you spend here,

72
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,489
it's hard to get beyond that level
with some people.

73
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,160
And as you talk,
you realize it's possible with others.

74
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,496
I think I'm drawn
to those kinds of people.

75
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,500
That's why Min-seol
was comfortable with me from the start.

76
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:33,963
And I felt so comfortable around you
as I did with Min-seol.

77
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,340
That's what I really liked.

78
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,927
And while I was having coffee with you,

79
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:44,474
I thought, "This feels comfortable too
but in a different way."

80
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,809
"It'd be fun if I went
to Paradise with her."

81
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,062
That's why I suggested
going to Paradise together.

82
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,647
-Right.
-Yeah.

83
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,149
-Well, who knows if it'll happen?
-I…

84
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,238
I kept wondering
what tomorrow's game might be.

85
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,450
I definitely want to win though.

86
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,534
Not second place?

87
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,037
-You're all about first place?
-Second is meaningless.

88
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,330
Second place would feel worse.

89
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,500
If I'm playing, I have to win.

90
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,669
You're such an honest person.

91
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,963
I don't want to put on an act here.

92
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:15,880
Me neither.

93
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,510
Jun-seo,

94
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,721
do you think
you can fall in love within ten days?

95
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,016
I've never experienced that before.

96
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,562
But who knows?

97
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,320
I told you something's starting.

98
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,239
Yeah, she seems to have a lot on her mind.

99
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,156
It's possible.

100
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,909
Look, they spent the day
at the pool together.

101
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,412
And they hung out,
thinking they were just friends.

102
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,122
But after hearing this now,

103
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,083
she could think he was with her,
because he liked her.

104
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,751
That would be too much for her.

105
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,044
She'll be exhausted.

106
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,087
-That's true.
-Just…

107
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,422
With three men.

108
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,715
She needs to stop now.

109
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,925
Seriously.

110
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,511
From my perspective,
this is the type of person Si-an is.

111
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,346
This is just what I think.

112
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,682
It doesn't matter if someone likes her.

113
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,227
For her, it's more about who she likes.

114
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,520
No way.

115
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,605
-Because…
-But…

116
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,482
I mean, how long have you known Si-an?

117
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,484
-It's because I know her well.
-Do you now?

118
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,653
I know her very well now.

119
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,949
But in my opinion, Si-an has thought
of Jun-seo as a decent guy.

120
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,368
Kyuhyun, in my opinion,

121
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,748
Si-an may be momentarily swayed
by people she's interested in.

122
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,375
-But in the end, I think it's Jeong-su.
-Jeong-su.

123
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,377
She's the type who dates people she likes.

124
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,962
She keeps getting drawn to him.

125
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,757
-This is when Jun-seo steps in.
-Yeah, I think so too.

126
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,842
To me, Si-an actually seems honest.

127
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,843
-Yeah.
-Like…

128
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,930
-She's allowing her emotions sway her.
-Yes, she's wavering.

129
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,058
But she's not wavering right now.

130
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,018
It's so obvious that she's not.

131
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,561
No, she was swayed.

132
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,104
She was a little surprised.

133
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,272
-Us two…
-I don't know.

134
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,774
-I don't think she was.
-I say no.

135
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,151
Us three say she wasn't swayed.
These two think she was.

136
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,611
We do have bad instincts at times.

137
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,529
Let's see who's right about this.

138
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,947
-We'll find out.
-Yeah.

139
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,117
-I heard you were playing a game.
-"Would You Rather."

140
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,327
-Yeah.
-Let's play. Sit.

141
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,221
I drank way too much.

142
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,102
Let's sober up.

143
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,938
Si-an, let's sober up.

144
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,982
It changed last year.

145
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,734
There was someone I used to like.

146
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,444
-What's Si-an doing?
-The person I liked…

147
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,445
She's sobering up.

148
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,033
What are you doing?

149
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,410
Hey, what are you doing?

150
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,411
You scared me.

151
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,457
-I'm so drunk.
-You are?

152
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,000
Your face was red earlier.

153
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,293
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

154
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,878
-I can't handle…
-Did you drink a lot?

155
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,171
No, not that much.

156
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,137
-Did you get to talk to a lot with others?
-Yeah.

157
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,304
-Really?
-Yeah.

158
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,014
-What…
-I did… What?

159
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,099
With who?

160
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,308
-Everyone, right?
-With who?

161
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,852
-What?
-I saw you.

162
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,186
-Saw what?
-Over there.

163
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,980
-You were with Theo.
-Yeah.

164
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,232
And you talked with Jun-seo too.

165
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,233
That was all.

166
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,151
-Really?
-Yeah.

167
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,694
Just the ones I saw?

168
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,945
Yeah.

169
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,281
I couldn't find
the right time to talk to you.

170
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,699
-I see.
-Yeah.

171
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,414
Have you sobered up a little?

172
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,707
-No.
-Not yet?

173
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,417
That's why I'm on the swing.

174
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,127
I wanted to get some fresh air.

175
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,256
Come back after you sober up.

176
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,758
-Okay. Bye.
-Yeah.

177
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,186
He should've stayed longer.

178
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:02,315
Si-an isn't giving him
any opportunity to do that.

179
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,193
It seems Si-an
really isn't interested in Jong-hoon.

180
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,694
-You think so?
-I agree.

181
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,029
-I felt it.
-It's obvious.

182
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,739
I agree with you.

183
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,158
Otherwise, she would never react that way.

184
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,537
PARADISE
PARK HAE-LIN & KIM JEONG-SU

185
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,793
This is amazing.

186
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,338
I love it.

187
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,716
Goodness.

188
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,135
I almost broke your arm again.

189
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,014
-I'll lay out the blanket for you.
-Okay.

190
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,189
-Jeong-su has such good manners.
-It's second nature for him.

191
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,232
Yeah.

192
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,442
Wow, this is so nice.

193
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,443
It's off.

194
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,403
What more could we ask for right now?

195
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,321
Yeah.

196
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,825
I think I'm older than you.

197
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,494
-Really?
-I feel like I am.

198
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,163
I'm good at guessing ages,
but I can't figure yours out.

199
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,666
-Want me to tell you?
-Yeah.

200
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,043
I'm 24.

201
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,837
Twenty-four? Really?

202
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,130
I was born in 2000.

203
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,094
What?

204
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,222
-Nineteen ninety…
-I never would've guessed.

205
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,057
You really had no idea.

206
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,142
Usually when someone's beautiful,

207
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,728
it's hard to guess their age.

208
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,818
What do you do for work?

209
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:33,114
I'm a student majoring in acting.

210
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,199
-No wonder.
-Why?

211
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,579
I'm currently a college student.

212
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,709
I love reading classic literature
as part of my acting training.

213
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,670
They feature a lot of characters
you'd never even imagine.

214
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,757
I think it's really cool to study them,

215
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,510
so I've been doing my best to learn.

216
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,265
PARK HAE-LIN, AGE 24
SEJONG UNIVERSITY, FILM ARTS MAJOR

217
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,604
What time did you go to bed last night?

218
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,023
-Last night?
-Yeah, did you go straight to bed?

219
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,901
-I was just waiting for you.
-Yeah?

220
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,404
Waiting for what? For me to finish?

221
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,740
-Yeah, I waited for you to finish.
-I see.

222
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,033
You took a pretty long time.

223
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,951
But…

224
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,828
I waited and then…

225
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,748
-I went to bed after washing up.
-I see.

226
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,667
You spent a lot of time
talking with people, right?

227
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,877
Yeah.

228
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,962
But I…

229
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,799
But I…

230
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,429
-Wait.
-Jeez.

231
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,597
Isn't that what couples do?

232
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,391
Did he do that instinctively
because it's second nature,

233
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,686
or did he do it on purpose
as a way to impress her?

234
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,356
-I think that's natural for Jeong-su.
-I see.

235
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,107
-I think he's flirting.
-Me too.

236
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,150
-Of course.
-Me too.

237
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,527
-That's flirting.
-He tucked her hair back.

238
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,945
But I…

239
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:03,621
As I mentioned before,
I have two people in mind.

240
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,789
Right.

241
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,040
Nothing much has changed.

242
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,917
-You mean us two?
-Yeah.

243
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,001
Nothing's changed.

244
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,215
After talking with you,
everyone said you had a great personality.

245
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,675
Really?

246
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,177
Well, the women…

247
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,055
But one thing's for sure.

248
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,684
None of the other women
have the same look…

249
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,852
My look?

250
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,146
No one's similar to you.

251
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,693
That makes me curious.

252
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,613
You stand out.

253
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,616
-Really? That makes me happy.
-Yeah.

254
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,369
Just go and enjoy it.

255
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,288
Hearing that would make you happy.

256
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,373
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

257
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,792
Jeong-su keeps making an effort.

258
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,876
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

259
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,588
We're here.

260
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,799
There are duck boats.

261
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,551
Yeah, this is what I was talking about.

262
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,136
-What?
-I wanted to ride that.

263
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,262
-That?
-Things like that.

264
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,722
-I wanted to ride inflatables.
-Let's do it.

265
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,518
Let's go.

266
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,811
-Shall we?
-Okay.

267
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,817
It's cold!

268
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,906
We might flip over!

269
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,878
A subtle touch.

270
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,966
Oh no!

271
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,600
Is this right?

272
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,650
We had so much fun.

273
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,319
-Han River tastes great.
-Yeah.

274
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,738
You can do it!

275
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,993
Is he showing her?

276
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,245
-He must know how to ride.
-He must be good.

277
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,455
There he goes.

278
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,798
And he's off.

279
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,428
He's good.

280
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,555
He's good at everything.

281
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,057
There's nothing he can't do.

282
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,059
Standing up like that is difficult.

283
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,143
-Is that so?
-Yes.

284
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,236
He looks very experienced.

285
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,489
But he doesn't seem that skilled at it.

286
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,578
You can do it!

287
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,961
You're good at this.

288
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,630
That was fun.

289
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,674
-It was fun.
-It was really fun.

290
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,429
But there doesn't seem to be
a lot of a romantic chemistry.

291
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,348
-They seem cautious.
-I agree.

292
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,100
I can't really feel it.

293
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,354
Jeong-su seems to be trying
to make the conversation flow naturally.

294
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,648
-But it didn't feel all that natural.
-Right?

295
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,652
After their conversation on the yacht,
I think she sensed they weren't a match.

296
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,697
-Hae-lin's enthusiasm died down.
-Right.

297
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,282
I feel like

298
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:31,495
Jeong-su always gives off
a strong, charming impression

299
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,581
-when he first meets people.
-Right.

300
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,624
But as time goes on,

301
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,461
if he's not careful
with how skilled he is, it'll come off as,

302
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,297
"He's not that way with just me."

303
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,716
"He treats every woman like that."

304
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,636
So if it were me,
even if I started to feel interested,

305
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,221
I would…

306
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,599
-Keep my distance.
-You're right.

307
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,808
Right.

308
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,643
PARADISE
PARK HAE-LIN & KOOK DONG-HO

309
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,061
The sunset is beautiful.

310
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,855
We got good seats.

311
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,816
Let's toast.

312
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,077
Can I…

313
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,163
Can I guess your age?

314
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,832
-You were curious.
-Was I too hasty?

315
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,709
No, not at all.

316
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,419
How old do I look?

317
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,131
Twenty…

318
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,133
You still said twenties.

319
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,345
Twenty-four?

320
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,597
I see.

321
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,016
So you're 24.

322
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,144
How old do I look?

323
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,646
You don't look that old.

324
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,230
How old?

325
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,775
Thirty.

326
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,276
-Yeah.
-Really?

327
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,862
-You were right. I'm 30.
-Really?

328
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,781
-Incredible.
-That was a good guess.

329
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,742
I was curious about what you do.

330
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,661
-Can I try to guess it?
-Sure.

331
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:59,208
You look like a haegeum performer
with the National Gugak Center.

332
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,419
Or you look like you studied the gayageum.

333
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,380
You know, like plucking strings?

334
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,132
It's so fun to just imagine that.

335
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,135
-I'm a college student.
-What's your major?

336
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,263
I major in acting.

337
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,474
-I see.
-Yeah.

338
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,559
That's interesting.

339
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,312
What do you think I do?

340
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,898
You seem like you did well in school.

341
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,901
I use a calculator a lot when I work.

342
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,194
I figured you might.

343
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,654
-What does that mean?
-Yeah.

344
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,447
-Really?
-You seem…

345
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,449
-You seem like a math person.
-Really?

346
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,451
You give off a math and science vibe.

347
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,620
-What is this?
-Yeah, like…

348
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,914
Math and sciences suit you.

349
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,416
An accountant?

350
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,252
-You're right. I'm a CPA.
-Really?

351
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,421
-I'm good at guessing, right?
-Yeah.

352
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,423
You're really good at guessing.

353
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,926
I'm a certified public accountant.

354
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,848
I currently work
at a large accounting firm in Korea.

355
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,600
The duties of an accountant

356
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,396
generally include auditing, filing taxes,
and financial advisory services.

357
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,398
I work in financial advisory services,

358
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,192
where I provide consulting
on tasks, such as valuation,

359
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,237
financial due diligence,
and investment fundraising

360
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,573
to help companies make critical decisions.

361
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:20,164
KOOK DONG-HO, AGE 30
CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT

362
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,582
I see.

363
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,250
I like that.

364
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,668
You do?

365
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,840
Is that what you've always wanted to do?

366
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,760
For me,

367
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,388
I just studied
because I didn't know what I liked.

368
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,265
-Honestly…
-Interesting.

369
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,768
I think it's so cool
when I see people do what they enjoy.

370
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,102
-Really?
-Yeah.

371
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,939
-You're enjoy what you do, right?
-That's right.

372
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,443
This is so fascinating,
because you're so different from me.

373
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,576
I chose the two of you at the start

374
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:02,331
because Jeong-su has
a lot in common with me,

375
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,834
while you we're completely…

376
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,336
-Completely different.
-Different.

377
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,420
-Right.
-Yeah.

378
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:09,838
That's right.

379
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,883
So I wanted to have fun with Jeong-su,

380
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,552
and I wanted to sit down
and talk with you.

381
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,225
Yeah.

382
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,397
What was your hobby again?
I remember mentioning hiking as mine.

383
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,400
-We never talked about it.
-We didn't? Then, tell me.

384
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,944
I like reading.

385
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,487
-You do?
-Yeah, a lot.

386
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,655
I hate reading.

387
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,074
Really? We're so different.

388
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,326
-You can read all of my books for me.
-Okay.

389
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,079
I hate books.

390
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,080
Why?

391
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,749
I had to read a lot when I studied.

392
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,502
-You must be sick of it.
-I'm not good at reading.

393
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,546
I don't think
I have good linguistic abilities.

394
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,589
Do you like working out?

395
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,174
I don't think you do.

396
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,092
Well…

397
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,178
I do work out. I'm still human.

398
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,973
But I'm not super into it.

399
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,143
I don't get excited when working out.

400
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,019
I do it to stay healthy

401
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,521
-and to live to 100.
-Yeah.

402
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,856
You want a long life?

403
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,232
A long and healthy life.

404
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,151
-We differ on this too.
-Yeah.

405
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,278
I want a short but eventful life.

406
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,905
I don't see the point
in living a long life.

407
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,990
That's what I think.

408
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,244
Everything's so different.

409
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,163
-It's amazing.
-It's really amazing.

410
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,374
They're different
but more different than expected.

411
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,876
Right?

412
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,420
-Some people are drawn to opposites.
-That's true.

413
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,047
-But for me…
-Yeah?

414
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,175
I usually like people who are different.

415
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,558
I don't know about you though.

416
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,732
But I do have this thought.

417
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,650
I feel like

418
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,820
you wouldn't usually go
for someone like me.

419
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,699
Honestly…

420
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,537
Well, honestly…

421
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,999
You're the first one who's different
from the type of people I've dated before.

422
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:09,917
I thought so.

423
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,670
That's why this feels
even more unique to me.

424
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,589
It definitely makes me more curious.

425
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,636
You seem like you'd go
for the innocent type.

426
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,138
Right? Be honest.

427
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,556
I like being honest.

428
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,184
I'm curious about things like this.

429
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,019
Usually, someone bright…

430
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,855
I think you like people
who are nice and bright like sunshine.

431
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,691
-You're right. Is it obvious?
-I'm not like that though.

432
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,153
-You're more like the sun itself.
-So…

433
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,364
You're intense.

434
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,701
Someone like sunshine?

435
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,287
-I'll have a look tomorrow.
-Well…

436
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,499
Let me know who it is tomorrow.

437
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,088
It's because I'm genuinely curious.

438
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,923
I'm a pretty curious person.

439
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,050
You know how it is.

440
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,302
If you're not interested,
you never become curious.

441
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,263
Right.

442
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,185
You surprise me every three minutes,
so it's hard to get a grip.

443
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,645
-Really? Feeling dizzy?
-No.

444
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,940
Making people feel dizzy
is part of my charm.

445
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,488
Hae-lin's making him lose his composure.

446
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,740
She shook him up.

447
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,994
-The vibes here are definitely different.
-Completely different.

448
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,413
I'm kind of curious.

449
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,082
I'm interested to see
how well you get along with others.

450
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,710
-Yeah.
-I want to see the women play a game.

451
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,254
-What?
-I want to see that energetic spirit.

452
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,297
-I'm curious.
-Yeah.

453
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,382
You think you'd definitely win?

454
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,718
Are the other women all tall?

455
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,469
You might be the tallest.

456
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,846
-Really?
-Over 170 cm?

457
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,973
No way. I'm 170 cm tall.

458
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,516
-Exactly 170 cm?
-Yeah.

459
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,851
That's a nice physique.

460
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,353
You have solid shoulders.

461
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,939
-Really.
-Is that a compliment?

462
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,357
-It's a compliment.
-Is it?

463
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,859
You look really fit.

464
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,902
You're tall and long.

465
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:01,987
What? My arm reach?

466
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,822
My arms are really long.

467
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,240
Let's compare them later.

468
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,408
Okay, let's do it.

469
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,451
I'm sure we're similar.

470
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,994
-Mine are really long.
-You're right.

471
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,996
Yeah, I even need custom-fitted suits.

472
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,290
-They're long like an orangutan's.
-Me too.

473
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,793
We finally found one thing in common.

474
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,632
-Are you done eating?
-Yeah.

475
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,801
-Did you enjoy it?
-I loved it.

476
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,932
Let's compare arm lengths.
We can put our shoulders together.

477
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,063
I told you I'm like an orangutan.

478
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,689
They're long. But mine are too, right?

479
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,192
They are long for your height.

480
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,485
-You're 170 cm, right?
-Yeah.

481
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,527
I'm 187 cm tall.

482
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,946
You're so tall.

483
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,909
I have big hands.
You said yours are big too, right?

484
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,911
Honestly, mine are big too.

485
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,496
Let's try your right hand.

486
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,541
-Your nails.
-My nails?

487
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,460
We're the same size
if we count your nails.

488
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,797
The reason I think
your hands are pretty big is

489
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,340
my hands are…

490
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,549
Bigger than most guys.

491
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,801
They're pretty similar.

492
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,552
-Your fingers are so long.
-Yeah.

493
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,557
Take a nap if you're sleepy.

494
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,434
-I can't sleep.
-You can.

495
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,978
I didn't get to sleep a lot today.

496
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,939
-I slept a lot yesterday.
-Right.

497
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,943
You can just wake up when we arrive later.

498
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,298
He's holding back from turning his head.

499
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,759
It seems he fell for her.

500
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,802
-Yes.
-He's so cute.

501
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,137
-Right?
-Yes.

502
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,514
But to Hae-lin,

503
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,892
Dong-ho didn't say
he likes people who are like the sun.

504
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,185
He wouldn't do that.

505
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,437
I think that's part of Dong-ho's charm.

506
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,191
I think Hae-lin has developed
a lot of feelings for Dong-ho.

507
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,526
-She finds him cute.
-Yes.

508
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,319
And when she teases him,

509
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,738
he gets flustered
and shows an innocent side.

510
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,656
Right.

511
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,366
It makes him different from Jeong-su.

512
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,325
-Right.
-Yes.

513
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,660
There was more excitement here.

514
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,036
-I agree.
-Hae-lin and Dong-ho.

515
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,956
-Their conversation was fun to listen to.
-Right.

516
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,040
It draws you in.

517
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,095
There's a lot of sea fog.

518
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,056
Sea fog?

519
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,725
You can't see anything outside.

520
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,609
Goodness.

521
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,903
-Theo.
-Yeah?

522
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,407
Here. This is yours.

523
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,784
-What on earth?
-What?

524
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,703
It's too early to look so beautiful.

525
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,038
Jeez.

526
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:00,457
It's begun.

527
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,334
-Theo never changes.
-Right.

528
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,759
Did you do your hair?

529
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,676
What?

530
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,261
Did you do your hair, Jun-seo?

531
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,179
-Me?
-Yeah.

532
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,639
Does it look like I didn't?

533
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,599
You don't remember, do you?

534
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,600
Of course, I do.

535
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,517
What?

536
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,103
-Were you drunk yesterday?
-No, I was totally fine.

537
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,861
Okay, shall we get started now?

538
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,784
How was it? You spent
quite a bit of time with Theo yesterday.

539
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,286
Theo seems a bit more serious now.

540
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,624
Before, all he'd do
was kid around the whole time.

541
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,209
-He'd just crack jokes.
-Yeah.

542
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,879
But what about you, You-jin?

543
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,714
Dong-ho?

544
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,093
Yeah, I'm still curious about Dong-ho.

545
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,136
A-rin's right next to her.

546
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,933
Yeah, I'm still curious about Dong-ho.

547
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,518
But honestly,

548
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,104
I didn't express

549
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,982
my feelings to him that much.

550
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,108
I see.

551
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,819
-Like how I feel about him.
-Right.

552
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,741
We talked about what we like
and what types we prefer,

553
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,077
but that's all so far.

554
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,127
She's so cute. My gosh.

555
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,421
-She was flustered.
-She seems so worried.

556
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,755
She's suddenly busy.

557
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,222
Why isn't she coming out?

558
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,482
-What?
-What?

559
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,276
-Excuse me?
-What?

560
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,277
What is it?

561
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,949
Yes! Cereal.

562
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,784
This cereal is good.

563
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,286
I like cereal.

564
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,581
-No strawberry jam, right?
-Hey, you're expecting too much.

565
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,749
This is Inferno, kid.

566
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,500
I thought we had some.

567
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,752
I wish there was.

568
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,086
We really don't have any?

569
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,591
Your outfits today…

570
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,051
-They're matching.
-What?

571
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,469
They're totally different.

572
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,888
You're both wearing
a mix of black and white.

573
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,389
They're completely different vibes.

574
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,599
Black and white.

575
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,854
This looks good!
I'm going to have some cereal.

576
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,357
Can you pass me a box of cereal over here?

577
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,736
-You wore glasses.
-I did.

578
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,945
They look good on you.

579
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,197
-Really?
-Yeah.

580
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,576
No more seats are left.

581
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,097
-Did you sleep well?
-Yeah.

582
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,848
You said you'd come over to do your hair.

583
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,808
I'll go tomorrow.

584
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,684
I woke up late today.

585
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,438
Why am I so sleepy?

586
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,780
Ma'am, what is this?

587
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,031
-What?
-Are these for Alkkagi?

588
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,282
They're for you to eat.

589
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,243
I prepared them especially for you.

590
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,661
Wow, thank you.

591
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:31,709
What do you think?

592
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,672
I could eat this.

593
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,183
Thank you.

594
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,406
He's basically staging a protest.

595
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,199
That's definitely a protest.

596
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,743
-That's a protest.
-It is.

597
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,453
He's saying it's bothering him.

598
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,466
He even pours his cereal like a tough guy.

599
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:21,843
What?

600
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,180
What is it?

601
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,400
It's good, right?

602
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,282
-Isn't he so cute?
-He is.

603
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,868
Theo being jealous is pretty cute.

604
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,454
-And Min-seol is looking around.
-She's observing.

605
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,705
He's like a little kid.

606
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,127
But seriously…

607
00:29:56,211 --> 00:30:00,048
There's an intriguing vibe
between Jun-seo and Si-an.

608
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,092
-It seems they've quickly become close.
-See? I was right.

609
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,552
-Yeah.
-See?

610
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:09,182
But I still get the feeling
Jun-seo and Si-an are just friends.

611
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,099
Really?

612
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,684
You're so clueless, Jin-kyung.

613
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:15,021
No, it's only like this
because Jeong-su isn't there.

614
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,231
She'll go back to him.

615
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,899
-Exactly.
-Come on. No way.

616
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,150
It's because he's not there.

617
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,318
-Seriously.
-Think about it.

618
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,653
She's still thinking about him.

619
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:27,242
For example, it's not like she forgot
and he had remind her to do his hair.

620
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,119
First thing in the morning,
she opened the door and mentioned it.

621
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,120
Think about it.

622
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,330
She totally likes him.

623
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,291
And if Si-an really didn't have
feelings for Jun-seo,

624
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,544
she'd totally be like, "What's with him?"

625
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,503
Right.

626
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,089
-Yeah.
-She did have that look earlier.

627
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,799
But then, she found it cute.

628
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,300
-Exactly.
-She eventually laughed.

629
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,262
-I'm telling you Si-an likes Jun-seo.
-She does.

630
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,304
Say something.

631
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,057
-Yeah, Jin-young.
-I'm still not sure.

632
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,851
He's next to her,
so she's just being nice.

633
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,018
-You're so clueless.
-Right?

634
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,436
-And when you're eating…
-Come on.

635
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,897
-There's nothing to say. It's awkward.
-Yeah.

636
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,692
She's just glared at him as she ate.

637
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,235
-Exactly.
-That's not it.

638
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,361
Jun-seo and Si-an…

639
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,822
-You're absolutely clueless.
-Seriously.

640
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,074
-You have no insight.
-Let's see who's really clueless.

641
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,702
-Right.
-The three of us are on the same page.

642
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,412
-Seriously.
-Jeez, you're so clueless.

643
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,329
Goodness.

644
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,539
-Si-an is…
-You know nothing.

645
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,875
To that wild side of Jun-seo…

646
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,917
She's drawn to him.

647
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,711
-She's subconsciously drawn to him.
-Right.

648
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,170
Just wait and see.

649
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,423
-Okay? Let's see who's right.
-You're so frustrating.

650
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,508
-Watch when he returns.
-We'll see who had insight.

651
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,093
-Let's have a look.
-Seriously.

652
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,474
The whole group will finally be together.

653
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,685
I'm so curious. I hope they come soon.

654
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,021
-Me too. I'm so curious.
-Right?

655
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,148
I want to see what happens with Jeong-su.

656
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,608
I'm curious about Jeong-su too.

657
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,859
Yeah, Jeong-su and her.

658
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,612
-Why?
-The two had something going on.

659
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,529
-Like what?
-Really?

660
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,031
They had a really long talk.

661
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,199
-Yeah, Jeong-su…
-They spent a while together.

662
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,701
-Like…
-He seemed interested.

663
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,453
-Really?
-He said they connected.

664
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,997
She's seems tall, right?

665
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,957
Because of her look?

666
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,838
Should us girls all sit together here?

667
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,382
-In a line?
-Yeah.

668
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,134
Should we look at them like this?

669
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,469
"Welcome."

670
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,221
Like, "Welcome back."

671
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,057
-"Hello."
-"Why are you so late?"

672
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,350
We're back.

673
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,981
I guess your girls
will be there when we arrive.

674
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,858
I wonder who they are.

675
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,943
"Who's that?"

676
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,528
-This way.
-But this is…

677
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,656
Hang in there.

678
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,449
It's light though.

679
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,327
Dong-ho is carrying her bag.

680
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,286
Right.

681
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,914
The ladies need to be on alert.

682
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,375
They're here.

683
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,335
They're back.

684
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,755
They're walking with…

685
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,757
-Confidence.
-Yeah.

686
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,426
Everyone's there.

687
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,055
They're looking at us like meerkats.

688
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,515
Right? They're so cute.

689
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,768
-She's so tall.
-They look super close.

690
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,479
Seriously.

691
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,820
Hello.

692
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,571
She's already saying hi.

693
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,659
-Hello.
-Hello.

694
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,453
My gosh.

695
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,956
-She's full of energy.
-Incredible.

696
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,333
She seems super cheerful.

697
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:23,876
How nerve-racking.

698
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,880
Hello.

699
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,465
-Hello.
-Hello.

700
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,633
Hello.

701
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,635
-How have you all been?
-We missed you.

702
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,056
I finally get to meet you all.

703
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,933
Gosh.

704
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,019
They're so beautiful.

705
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,271
-Gosh, how have you been?
-We've been great.

706
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,397
What were you up to?

707
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,398
Our newcomer.

708
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,277
I was honestly jealous
when the two of them walked up together.

709
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,529
As soon as Jeong-su arrived,

710
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,990
he looked at me
and gave this little smile.

711
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,493
And his hair was
nicely styled with bangs too.

712
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,746
He looked so cute.

713
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,208
I'm getting pissed.

714
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,086
-See?
-I told you I was right.

715
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,422
-You see that?
-Jeez, you two.

716
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,299
-They're so clueless.
-Goodness.

717
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,426
She's happy to see him
since it's been a while.

718
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,263
That's not it. Making eye contact with him
shows where her heart's leaning.

719
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,848
-You see her face?
-It's been a while.

720
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,516
-Of course, you'd look.
-She's unhappy.

721
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,809
And she called him cute.

722
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,270
-That means it's over.
-Yeah. It's game over.

723
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,650
I'd forgotten about Jeong-su,

724
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:34,363
but seeing him again made me really happy.

725
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,492
You know, he was the first one
I went to Paradise with.

726
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,619
So he's kind of like my first love.

727
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,664
Didn't things cool off after the campfire?

728
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,416
What's going on?

729
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,213
When they first walked up,

730
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,925
I noticed Dong-ho was carrying her bag.

731
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,636
So even though she went with two guys,

732
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,932
I got the impression
she and Dong-ho grew closer on the trip.

733
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,227
-How have you been?
-I missed you.

734
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,688
-It's been two days.
-Yeah.

735
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,733
-It's been hard to see you.
-Have a seat.

736
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,406
-It was fun.
-Hello.

737
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,659
-Let's give her a hand.
-Nice to meet you.

738
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,039
My name is Park Hae-lin.
And it's "Hae," not "Hye."

739
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,836
What did you three do yesterday?

740
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:34,048
Are you interviewing us right now?
About what the three of us did?

741
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,299
It's a secret.

742
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,300
It's a secret?

743
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,469
Come on, tell us too.

744
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,638
Girls.

745
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,306
Girls.

746
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,684
You sure you want to say that?

747
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,102
It's a term of endearment.

748
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,478
I mean, what were you…

749
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,646
That was bold.

750
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,439
She's something else.

751
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,150
"Girls"!

752
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,528
-What?
-That was so cool.

753
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,699
-"Girls"!
-She crushed it!

754
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,744
-My gosh, I love this!
-This is a declaration of war.

755
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,704
She declared war.

756
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,581
It's game over.

757
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,040
They're mad right now.

758
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,750
Wow, that one word did it.

759
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,295
Come on, tell us too.

760
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,463
Girls.

761
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,215
Girls.

762
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,927
-You sure you want to say that?
-It's a term of endearment.

763
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,470
I mean, what were you…

764
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,388
That was bold.

765
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,307
She's something else.

766
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,975
You sure you want to say that?

767
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,435
It's a term of endearment.

768
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,937
I mean, what were you up to?
I'm so curious.

769
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,439
I came and no one was here.

770
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,402
We were curious too
about what you've been up to.

771
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,906
Well, the three of us
spent the night in Paradise.

772
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,949
-We spent the night together.
-Really?

773
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,660
-In one bed?
-No, in three separate beds.

774
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,287
Who's using this room?

775
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,496
Me. I'm your roommate.

776
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,750
What was that?

777
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,631
She's the most energetic,
and I'm the least energetic.

778
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,548
No way.

779
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,842
I heard a lot of people
were more energetic than me.

780
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:00,801
You said that.

781
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,136
You said so.

782
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,430
But they're hiding it.

783
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,556
They are?

784
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,516
We're shy…

785
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,936
-Long time no see.
-Why are you holding back?

786
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,480
Me? Well, we're…

787
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,898
It must've been fun.

788
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,984
-They've already lost control.
-Yeah.

789
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,194
-Exactly.
-Oh no.

790
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,655
She's even sitting
at the head of the table.

791
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,699
She's so bright.
She really is like the sun.

792
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,701
I've waited so long to meet you ladies.

793
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,413
What?

794
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:37,296
Gosh, why is everyone so beautiful?

795
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,552
She was amazing.

796
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,179
Unbelievable.

797
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,182
She's so energetic and extremely cheerful.

798
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,393
She has such an interesting personality.

799
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,020
She's so cheerful.

800
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,856
She suddenly raised the energy level.

801
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,942
So my energy level went down.

802
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,610
I guess I felt drained?

803
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,195
I felt drained like this.

804
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,198
She's very lively,
and she seemed assertive.

805
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,408
I feel like

806
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,953
even Dong-ho would be swayed by her.

807
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:12,081
The game changer is definitely
charming enough to do that.

808
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,333
Everyone's flustered.

809
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,669
-Their jaws are on the floor right now.
-Yeah.

810
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,796
It's not easy
to act like that around strangers.

811
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,172
She really is unique.

812
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,841
-Seriously.
-Hae-lin stands out.

813
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,009
-She's so cool.
-Yeah.

814
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:23,926
She's amazing.

815
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,845
You can't even be mad at her.

816
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,887
-Yeah.
-Right.

817
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,348
-If you get angry here, you lose.
-Exactly.

818
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,225
Because Hae-lin is harmless.

819
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,727
You lose if you get annoyed.

820
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,353
That's why everyone is just…

821
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,939
-They're lost.
-They can only sit and watch.

822
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:37,857
You're annoyed,

823
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,026
but if you get annoyed,

824
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,736
-you feel like the bad guy.
-Exactly.

825
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,031
There's nothing to be mad about.
She keeps saying they're pretty.

826
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,826
But the ladies don't hear it
as a compliment.

827
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:52,413
They think, "What's going on?
Her compliments feel like I'm being hit."

828
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,414
Exactly.

829
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,207
Calling them "girls" was so bold.

830
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,876
-It really was.
-Seriously.

831
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,586
This could become a catchphrase.

832
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,837
-Right?
-"Girls."

833
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,131
-Right now, A-rin…
-It really was bold.

834
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,216
She's already stressed out.

835
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:08,012
A-rin's melted under the sun.
Her face says it all.

836
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,056
-She can't hide her feelings.
-"Melted"!

837
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,266
Yes, the sun's up right now.

838
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,273
A-rin seemed a bit out of it today.

839
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,191
Really?

840
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,443
Because you weren't here
when she came back.

841
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,528
She said it's all too entangled.

842
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,323
I wanted to talk to her,
but she seemed so out of it.

843
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,616
I couldn't approach her.

844
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,619
I'm such a sucker for this kind of stuff.

845
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,538
This morning at breakfast,

846
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,290
when A-rin was eating…

847
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,295
She was eating like this. She barely ate.

848
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,465
She was staring off into space as she ate.

849
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,844
Wow, the fact that A-rin
was out of it really bothers me.

850
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,394
How was Paradise?

851
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,979
I liked it a lot.

852
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,606
-It's nice.
-Right? Isn't it?

853
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,610
-How were the guys?
-What made you choose those two?

854
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,323
Jeong-su is my type in terms of looks,

855
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,866
and Dong-ho's personality is…

856
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,577
-Your type?
-Close to my type.

857
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,080
-Who do you like more?
-More?

858
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,665
I'm still so torn.

859
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,959
They're both very…

860
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,669
If you had to pick just one?

861
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,129
I'm not sure right now.

862
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,463
I liked them both.

863
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,424
They were both good.

864
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:32,096
-Can I ask what was most memorable?
-About what? Going to Paradise?

865
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,306
Yeah, about Paradise and both of them.

866
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,350
But the most memorable part

867
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,978
and who I liked most
are two different things.

868
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,521
The most memorable part was…

869
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,566
We rode those floating things
in the water.

870
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,110
The ones that shake like this.

871
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,778
-That's cool.
-So my face was…

872
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,239
-We have to ask this.
-With Jeong-su.

873
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,741
Did you feel a romantic spark?

874
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,076
Definitely.

875
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,412
With who?

876
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:02,835
Dong-ho.

877
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,378
Dong-ho?

878
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,173
Dong-ho?

879
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,011
I see. Mind if I ask what it was?

880
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,929
But there's no pressure to answer.

881
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,347
Well…

882
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,141
I don't know if I should say this,

883
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,269
but their charms are so different,
so I liked being with both of them.

884
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,438
Then, are you planning to see

885
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,107
which person you're leaning towards more?

886
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:29,195
Yes, because they're so different
from each other.

887
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,572
But who knows how they feel about me?

888
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,412
So you spent a day with them
on Inferno before leaving, right?

889
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,247
-I did.
-Was there anyone

890
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,374
with a surprising side to them?

891
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,878
Jeong-su was a bit…

892
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,631
-Surprising?
-I wouldn't say surprising, but…

893
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,967
I didn't think he'd have
a serious side, but he did.

894
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,394
Are you sleepy again, Si-an?

895
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,730
I just feel drained.

896
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,858
I'm wondering what made you swoon.

897
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,444
-I wonder what it was.
-I'm curious.

898
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,240
For me, it wasn't something specific.

899
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,784
It's his personality that's my type.

900
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:17,993
He's kind of calm…

901
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,912
-And Jeong-su's a bit talkative.
-Yeah, so…

902
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,915
I just liked
the overall impression he gave.

903
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,835
Did you have any calm
and deep conversations?

904
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,381
Yes, I like quiet people
rather than assertive people.

905
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,674
He is calm.

906
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,595
-Someone who's calm.
-Dong-ho is the quietest one here.

907
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,222
But he can be funny too.

908
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,181
That's true.

909
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,309
Wasn't it awkward?

910
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,603
You spent a whole day with just the guys.

911
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,648
It wasn't that awkward.

912
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,442
You seem to have a great personality.

913
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,614
I've never seen A-rin
ask so many questions before.

914
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,032
-She's so talkative.
-Yeah.

915
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,618
She knocked two people out
with her Paradise recap.

916
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,497
My head hurts!

917
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,415
Yeah.

918
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:13,173
I was really curious about what happened
with Dong-ho in Paradise.

919
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,135
So I want to initiate
a conversation with him.

920
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,262
I'm confused.

921
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:22,433
Honestly, I was starting to let go
of my feelings for Jeong-su.

922
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,312
I was leaning a bit more towards Theo,

923
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:30,274
and I was thinking I should have
another proper conversation with Jun-seo.

924
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,192
But after Jeong-su came back today,

925
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,779
I feel really shaken and confused.

926
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,583
Where is he?

927
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,212
No one's there.

928
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,380
-No one's here?
-Nope.

929
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,510
You're right.

930
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,555
Where did they go?

931
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,223
They're in panic mode now.

932
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,141
Exactly.

933
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,726
-Really?
-Yes, we told you so.

934
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,645
-Yeah, this is what we meant.
-Yeah.

935
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,104
Why is she like that?

936
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,606
What do you mean "why"?

937
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,524
-You've seen everything.
-Jeong-su's gone.

938
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,860
-Is he unpacking?
-Who?

939
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:15,903
Dong-ho.

940
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,780
-Yeah, he is.
-He's unpacking?

941
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,114
Let's wait for them here.

942
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,827
-Hello.
-Hello.

943
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,622
-Are you busy?
-What?

944
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,415
-Busy?
-We have plenty of time.

945
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,833
-You do?
-Yes.

946
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,960
Should we stay here a bit longer?

947
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:33,962
What's next?

948
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:34,880
What?

949
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,632
-How have you been?
-Good.

950
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,218
We're so curious about what you two did.

951
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,135
No.

952
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,845
-You're not?
-Not curious at all?

953
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,889
I mean, no. I am curious.

954
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,141
-You don't seem curious at all.
-What did you do?

955
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,770
In any case, they were chosen,
so I bet they had a great time.

956
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,771
We were thankful.

957
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,523
Yeah.

958
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,359
We both keep saying we're thankful.

959
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,860
-She seems cheerful.
-She is.

960
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,404
I bet things weren't awkward.

961
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,322
What did you do?

962
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,325
We came back and heard you two were gone,

963
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,536
so we were surprised.

964
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,497
-What's with the long face?
-I'm fine.

965
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,790
-Are you tired?
-I am.

966
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,875
-I guess that's why.
-You must've had so much fun.

967
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,044
Right? Being on Inferno must've been nice.

968
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,629
Of course.

969
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:16,672
It was?

970
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,549
Inferno was nice.

971
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,969
Should we talk?

972
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,387
-Sure.
-Let's go.

973
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,764
-Let's go that way.
-Okay.

974
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,061
I should put some sunscreen on.

975
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,187
-Did you?
-No.

976
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,816
Did you have a good time?

977
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,317
No.

978
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,235
Really?

979
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,529
-No?
-Did he say "no"?

980
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,993
-You have your bangs down.
-What?

981
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,911
-You have your bangs down.
-Yeah.

982
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,414
You look better with them down.

983
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,499
I did it to look good.

984
00:45:58,922 --> 00:45:59,923
How was it?

985
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,885
Water skiing was fun.

986
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,969
It sounds fun.

987
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,555
I did it alone.

988
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,141
I fell into the water alone too.

989
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,225
It must've been fun.

990
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,396
It wasn't fun.

991
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,860
I didn't want to go.

992
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,530
Whatever.
They said you talked the longest.

993
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,282
-Me?
-Yeah, you two.

994
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,200
Who said that?

995
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,035
Who told you that?

996
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,454
-Who was it?
-The guys.

997
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,456
-What?
-One of the guys.

998
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,457
That's not true.

999
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:35,959
It was brief.

1000
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,587
I see.

1001
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,716
-Liar.
-What's with him? Jeez.

1002
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,011
It can't be helped.

1003
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,554
-He can't tell her.
-Really?

1004
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,181
He can't say he really wanted to go.

1005
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,390
He has to comfort her.

1006
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,228
He said, "I didn't want to
go water skiing, and it wasn't fun."

1007
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,356
He could just be stating those facts.

1008
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,649
But it's so pathetic.

1009
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,900
-But…
-Exactly.

1010
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,610
-I agree. It wasn't good.
-Right.

1011
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:04,071
-Jeong-su's words…
-But you have to comfort her.

1012
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,906
But still, that's…

1013
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,574
He brushed her hair back.

1014
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,700
I kind of agree.

1015
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,037
For example, "I had a good time.
We had a great conversation."

1016
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,288
He could've said that.

1017
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,123
-But he just lied.
-Exactly.

1018
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,041
That's right.

1019
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,125
That's the point.

1020
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,546
If they're dating right now,
Si-an is going to be really upset.

1021
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,630
Exactly.

1022
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,509
She'd say, "You said you didn't have fun!"

1023
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,723
First…

1024
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:32,808
Gosh.

1025
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,186
-She's truly harmless.
-It feels so cool.

1026
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,896
-Right.
-She's so cheerful.

1027
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,731
-Right?
-Yeah.

1028
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,316
She's such a bright spirit.

1029
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,659
Why are you so grumpy?

1030
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,744
-What?
-You seem grumpy.

1031
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:53,662
-Me?
-Yeah.

1032
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,955
Not at all.

1033
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,207
-You're just tired?
-Yeah, I'm just tired.

1034
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,625
You didn't sleep well?

1035
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,711
No, I slept fine.

1036
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,631
I wonder what we'll do today.

1037
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,632
-Today?
-Yeah.

1038
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:07,801
Hang out with me.

1039
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:09,511
Sure.

1040
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,806
What are you up to?

1041
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,225
Come on over.

1042
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,185
Jeong-su's girls.

1043
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,730
-Right. Jeong-su's girls.
-What do you mean?

1044
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,107
It seems Jeong-su has more girls now.

1045
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,406
What did you talk about?
How was it? Hurry and tell me.

1046
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,618
We asked each other
how Paradise was yesterday.

1047
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,785
I was being scolded.

1048
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,745
Being scolded?

1049
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,288
What are you talking about?

1050
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,497
-That's not true.
-Why?

1051
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,624
I don't know.

1052
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,709
Why?

1053
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,211
Why were you being scolded?

1054
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:48,842
What?

1055
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,721
What? Did your feelings
change after returning?

1056
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,390
-What?
-Did your feelings change?

1057
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,977
No changes.

1058
00:48:59,061 --> 00:48:59,895
No changes?

1059
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,152
Jeong-su's answer was incredible though.

1060
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,320
-Right?
-"No changes."

1061
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,237
Yeah.

1062
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,532
That answer can apply to everyone.

1063
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,950
-So…
-He's no ordinary guy.

1064
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,202
To answer like that

1065
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,954
-in that brief moment…
-It's really impressive.

1066
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:27,964
It's kind of…

1067
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,267
-As if things would change now.
-Sit.

1068
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,897
When are they coming?
They're so late.

1069
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,065
Should I leave?

1070
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,651
Why? You should enjoy yourself.

1071
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,530
-I…
-Enjoy the moment.

1072
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,864
I don't have the guts for this.

1073
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,452
Well…

1074
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,543
I'm sleepy. I'm going to nap.

1075
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,962
-What? You're sleepy?
-I'm going to use the restroom.

1076
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,630
Me too. Then, I'm going to nap.

1077
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,048
I'll go with you.

1078
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,804
Am I the only one not sleepy today?
I'm totally fine.

1079
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,436
She's like, "What's up with that girl?"

1080
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,106
-"She must be frail."
-Seriously, Hae-lin.

1081
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,734
-She's so harmless though.
-Yeah.

1082
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,237
Am I the only one not sleepy today?
I'm totally fine.

1083
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,114
You didn't sleep much.

1084
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,949
How many hours did you sleep?

1085
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,368
-Did you fall asleep quick?
-What time did we go to bed?

1086
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:41,037
-We went to bed early.
-We woke up at 5:30 a.m.

1087
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,433
I'm out of it.

1088
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,268
I'm so out of it.

1089
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,186
Why?

1090
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:07,063
I saw Jeong-su's face,
and my mind went blank.

1091
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,191
I feel like a lunatic.

1092
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,526
I felt the same way.

1093
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,779
I'd forgotten about him,

1094
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:17,532
but when he came back,
it felt so nice to see him again.

1095
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:21,995
It's been so long
I think my feelings could shift again.

1096
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,331
This is too hard.

1097
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,835
Well…

1098
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,545
He must have that kind of charm.

1099
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,797
-Right.
-In reality.

1100
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,215
It has to be acknowledged.

1101
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,008
Even though at the campfire…

1102
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,052
-He made mistakes.
-He had slip-ups.

1103
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,470
The two have fallen hard.

1104
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:39,721
-Amazing.
-Hye-jin too.

1105
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,306
Do you agree with us now?

1106
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,307
What do you think?

1107
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,225
I agree.

1108
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,018
See? She's having a hard time.

1109
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,478
-Hanhae.
-Yes?

1110
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,230
-Do you agree?
-I agree.

1111
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,607
-But things aren't over yet.
-Wait.

1112
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,650
-Her feelings?
-Yes.

1113
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,695
No, I think Si-an still has
multiple options in mind.

1114
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,113
-Yeah.
-I haven't given up.

1115
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,657
-Exactly.
-Let's be patient.

1116
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,535
We still have Jun-seo.

1117
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,536
-Yes.
-Right?

1118
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,204
What kind of charm could it be?

1119
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,789
I mean…

1120
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,792
Is he like a five-star hotel to them?

1121
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,127
You know, when you're there,

1122
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:15,215
everything is perfect,
and it feels like you're being pampered.

1123
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,133
Is that the vibe Jeong-su gives off?

1124
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:21,805
I really think
it's that initial impression he made.

1125
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,307
That first experience made a huge impact.

1126
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,727
So what happened?
You went to Paradise in the morning…

1127
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,565
Yeah, we went to Paradise
and made our choices.

1128
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,735
-They're everywhere we go.
-But…

1129
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,321
-We just need some water.
-Could we get some water?

1130
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,365
Yes, of course.

1131
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,784
We're not going to stop you. Go ahead.

1132
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,418
This spot feels the coolest.

1133
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,670
That's true. And there's no sun here.

1134
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,339
-And there's a good breeze.
-No.

1135
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,009
We can just eat them. They're clean.

1136
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,098
Now, there's one, two…

1137
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,809
Wait. Are there six guys now?

1138
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,394
Six guys and seven girls.

1139
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,980
You're right.

1140
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,023
Seven girls.

1141
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,066
You brought one here, so it's seven.

1142
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,736
-I brought her here?
-Yes. You carried her bag too.

1143
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,654
I did carry it for her.

1144
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,072
Let's go.

1145
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,702
I wish you two happiness. Be happy.

1146
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,039
"I wish you two happiness"!

1147
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,043
Isn't that basically an insult?

1148
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,377
-Isn't it?
-It totally is.

1149
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,795
This had no intent either?

1150
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,047
This had to be intentional.

1151
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,715
That one had some contempt.

1152
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,426
I wish you two happiness. Be happy.

1153
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,887
-Have a nice chat.
-Thanks.

1154
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,265
Where would you like to go?

1155
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:50,226
-We're on a date.
-Who do you want to go on a date with?

1156
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:59,361
This place feels suffocating.

1157
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,947
-We can't even have a conversation.
-I know, right?

1158
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,283
I don't think she was trying
to be mean on purpose.

1159
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,618
That's just who she is.

1160
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,453
-She was joking.
-If I were A-rin…

1161
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,454
You'd be annoyed.

1162
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,122
I would've been angry.

1163
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,960
I can see how it could
come across that way though.

1164
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,338
What were we talking about
before being interrupted?

1165
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,006
I lost track when they came in.

1166
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,136
What did you do
after the game changer came?

1167
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,099
-I heard you had one-on-one talks.
-We really… Hey.

1168
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,394
-What are you up to?
-Just talking.

1169
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,645
-Really?
-Yeah.

1170
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:34,896
Mind if I join?

1171
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,314
Make yourself comfortable.

1172
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,232
Okay.

1173
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,822
Every time they try to talk,
people keep coming in and out.

1174
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,657
Can't they just talk in secret somewhere?

1175
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,534
-They need to find a corner.
-Yeah.

1176
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,831
Everyone's going crazy here.

1177
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:53,832
Hi.

1178
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,001
Hey, there.

1179
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,585
We came to take Polaroids.

1180
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,087
Let's all take one together.

1181
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,220
Yeah, it was fine.

1182
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:08,722
Quiet.

1183
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,809
-Singles.
-What is it?

1184
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:16,104
Please gather at the pool right now.

1185
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,689
The swimming pool? Again?

1186
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,899
It's going to be a game.

1187
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,068
Why the pool again? I'm going to lose it.

1188
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,659
What kind of game could it be?

1189
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,045
They have their shirts off again.

1190
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,172
All I see is bare skin.

1191
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,738
What's going on?
Why is there nothing here?

1192
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,114
What are we doing?

1193
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,241
I'm so curious
since it's just the empty pool here.

1194
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,451
Right.

1195
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:16,206
Today, you'll play a couples' game
to win a chance to have a special meal.

1196
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,832
A couples' game?

1197
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,000
It's a couples' game.

1198
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:23,588
Members of the winning pair will each pick
someone they're interested in

1199
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,298
for a date over a special meal.

1200
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,634
-We get to choose.
-We can pick our dates.

1201
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:32,055
Today's couple game
is a hat-snatching challenge.

1202
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,350
Hat-snatching?

1203
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:38,103
The women will climb onto the men's backs.

1204
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,606
The couple that takes off
their opponents' hat first wins.

1205
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,360
-Taller people will have an edge.
-Right.

1206
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,778
And people with long arms.

1207
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,826
First, we will determine the couples.

1208
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:58,039
Those who pick the same colored balls
from the box will become a couple.

1209
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,000
-There's an extra person.
-You're right, one will be left out.

1210
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:05,171
However, the woman who picks the gray ball

1211
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,549
won't be able to participate in the game.

1212
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,801
-That's so unfair.
-So that's a dud.

1213
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,427
My goodness.

1214
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,428
That's harsh.

1215
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,641
Kim A-rin will draw the first ball.

1216
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,645
-The white ball.
-Kim A-rin, white.

1217
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,441
Red.

1218
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,110
Chung You-jin, red.

1219
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,321
-I got blue.
-Kim Min-seol, blue.

1220
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,740
What? Hold on.

1221
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,119
I'm so bad at random draws.

1222
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,332
-Bae Ji-yeon, yellow.
-My goodness.

1223
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,709
No one's picked gray yet.

1224
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,335
It's a 33% chance.

1225
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,879
It'll be at the end.

1226
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,716
-Oh no.
-Oh no. Wait.

1227
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,936
Kim Hye-jin, gray.

1228
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,440
Oh no!

1229
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,983
Oh no.

1230
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,902
-Unbelievable.
-I don't believe it!

1231
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,320
KIM HYE-JIN CANNOT PARTICIPATE

1232
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,660
-Purple.
-Park Hae-lin, purple.

1233
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,579
Lastly, Lee Si-an has picked green.

1234
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,623
Green.

1235
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,543
Next, the men will draw their balls.

1236
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,963
Blue. Kim Min-seol and An Jong-hoon.

1237
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,052
Yellow. Bae Ji-yeon and Jang Theo.

1238
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,223
Green. Lee Si-an and Kook Dong-ho.

1239
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,685
I can't believe
they've all avoided each other.

1240
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:47,732
Red. Chung You-jin and Kim Jeong-su.

1241
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,736
White. Kim A-rin and Yuk Jun-Seo.

1242
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,949
And purple. Park Hae-lin and Kim Te-hwan.

1243
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,160
How did this happen?

1244
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,079
-Right? They're split up.
-They're spread out.

1245
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:01,996
What happened?

1246
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,040
-They missed each other.
-They all lack chemistry.

1247
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,375
They'll only focus on the game.

1248
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,668
You have to play hard and win.

1249
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:07,835
That's right.

1250
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,212
We have to win.

1251
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:11,130
I'm all fired up now.

1252
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,882
I think you're the sturdiest one.

1253
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,300
-I am. Don't worry.
-Right.

1254
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,635
So I feel reassured.

1255
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,136
-But…
-Can I grab your hair?

1256
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,972
-Yeah, feel free.
-Is it okay?

1257
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:19,889
Give it a try.

1258
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,392
-Thanks.
-Great.

1259
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,227
So this could happen.

1260
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,020
-It's just a game to them.
-It is.

1261
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,814
This might actually make it fun.

1262
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,274
The first match.

1263
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:33,486
Chung You-jin and Kim Jeong-su,
who picked the red ball, will face

1264
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,447
Lee Si-an and Kook Dong-ho,
who picked the green ball.

1265
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,159
-Good luck.
-Let's go.

1266
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,244
You can do it.

1267
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,665
Gentlemen, carry the ladies
on your backs and get ready.

1268
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,345
Please start when the whistle blows.

1269
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,930
Get ready.

1270
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,309
-Are you right-handed?
-Yeah.

1271
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,019
Wait, don't get too close.

1272
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,563
Wait, don't get too close.

1273
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,983
I'm scared.

1274
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:14,777
Si-an's height
definitely gives her an edge.

1275
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,945
I'm scared.

1276
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,239
She's too tall.

1277
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,294
-Goodness.
-It almost came off.

1278
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,296
I thought You-jin said she was scared.

1279
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,440
My gosh!

1280
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,915
It's over.

1281
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,166
She got it off.

1282
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,549
-Hold on.
-Oh no.

1283
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,385
-Wait! Let go of her!
-She fell backwards!

1284
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,765
-Nice.
-Goodness!

1285
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,435
Lee Si-an and Kook Dong-ho win.

1286
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,020
Hey!

1287
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,897
They're too tall!

1288
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,649
-They're pretty tall.
-So tall.

1289
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,777
Having a long reach
seems like an advantage.

1290
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,029
They're the best team as the tall couple.

1291
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,031
The next match.

1292
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:46,494
Park Hae-lin and Kim Te-hwan,
who picked the purple ball, will face

1293
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:50,206
Bae Ji-yeon and Jang Theo,
who picked the yellow ball.

1294
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,124
Let's go in.

1295
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,962
-What on earth?
-See? She swims well.

1296
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,590
Oh, yeah. But they all know
we have a long reach.

1297
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:00,633
Yeah, they do.

1298
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,386
Jeez. Why are they so tall?

1299
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,387
One, two, three.

1300
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,644
Hey, go easy on us.

1301
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,021
Easy? You need to go all out
for a special meal.

1302
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,482
Please start when the whistle blows.

1303
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,400
Get ready.

1304
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,498
Hold on.

1305
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,125
-No.
-What?

1306
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:43,801
-What?
-Gosh, what happened?

1307
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:44,802
What's wrong with him?

1308
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,262
-Was that Te-hwan?
-Te-hwan…

1309
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,221
Was that Te-hwan?

1310
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,931
I knew this would happen.

1311
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,186
Goodness.

1312
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,146
Wait…

1313
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,106
Now's the time!

1314
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,524
Now's the time!

1315
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,905
Careful. He looks unstable.

1316
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:06,741
Go forward…

1317
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,704
Go forward…

1318
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,127
Gosh, it came off.

1319
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,879
-Did they both come off?
-What happened?

1320
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,214
Back up. Go forward…

1321
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:29,430
Go forward…

1322
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:36,145
-Did we win?
-Park Hae-lin and Kim Te-hwan win.

1323
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,230
-We won.
-Good job.

1324
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,648
You did great.

1325
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,149
I thought we had won.

1326
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:44,737
Te-hwan was hilarious.

1327
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,448
We've never seen anyone
buckle like that before.

1328
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,868
It wasn't from being attacked either.
He just collapsed on his own.

1329
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,581
The last match of the round.

1330
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,668
Kim Min-seol and An Jong-hoon,
who picked the blue ball, will face…

1331
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,086
Let's go.

1332
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:03,422
Kim A-rin and Yuk Jun-seo,
who picked the white ball.

1333
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,512
They look pretty intense.

1334
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:13,057
Gentlemen, carry the ladies
on your backs and get ready.

1335
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,360
He looks so stable, right?

1336
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,574
Please start when the whistle blows.

1337
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,158
Get ready.

1338
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,785
-You can do it!
-Let's go.

1339
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:34,453
Let's go.

1340
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,163
Get closer.

1341
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:37,915
Get closer.

1342
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,029
-Her head…
-Did she pull her hair?

1343
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:18,164
Kim Min-seol!

1344
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,290
She just…

1345
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,709
-Did we win?
-My gosh! Jong-hoon, we won!

1346
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:22,627
Amazing.

1347
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,503
Kim Min-seol and An Jong-hoon win.

1348
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,422
That was scary.

1349
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,300
-That was amazing.
-Great job.

1350
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:31,010
That's a dangerous team.

1351
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,137
Min-seol is a bit…

1352
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,306
-She's good.
-She's a bit of a threat.

1353
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,349
The dark horse?

1354
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,558
Yeah, a dark horse.

1355
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,435
-You have to do your best.
-Yeah.

1356
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,979
The final round will be a three-way match.

1357
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:44,398
Lee Si-an and Kook Dong-ho.

1358
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,442
Park Hae-lin and Kim Te-hwan.

1359
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,570
Kim Min-seol and An Jong-hoon.
Please get ready.

1360
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:52,907
This is going to be fun.

1361
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,040
Good.

1362
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,125
Strategy is key here, right?

1363
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,210
-Of course.
-Right?

1364
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,504
It's best to jump in
when one couple is taken out.

1365
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:07,421
Right.

1366
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,132
It's best to have
the other two teams fight, right?

1367
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,093
Please start when the whistle blows.

1368
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:13,803
Get ready.

1369
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:16,597
-Be careful. You can go slow.
-Yeah.

1370
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,184
Right side.

1371
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,237
Go.

1372
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,156
Why are you both coming at us?

1373
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,658
-Did you plan this?
-Go.

1374
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,910
Why are you both coming at us?

1375
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,161
-Go.
-Did you plan this?

1376
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,079
Go.

1377
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,039
I'm scared.

1378
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,250
You should fight each other.

1379
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,835
-No.
-Did you plan this?

1380
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,175
She's good dodging.

1381
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,097
Stop.

1382
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,975
Just leave them be.

1383
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:02,143
Let them go.

1384
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,284
Bam!

1385
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,828
-Oh no!
-Nice.

1386
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,748
-Oh no!
-Nice.

1387
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:26,375
-Park Hae-lin and Kim Te-hwan are out.
-They teamed up on us.

1388
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,293
Come on.

1389
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,836
Si-an is so…

1390
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,337
They lost so easily.

1391
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,756
Show your skills, Si-an.

1392
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,808
Move back.

1393
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:44,727
Move back.

1394
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:46,979
Move back.

1395
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,815
Go back!

1396
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,567
Go back!

1397
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:53,360
I fell in.

1398
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,612
Go back!

1399
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:56,530
I fell in.

1400
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,744
-No! Min-seol.
-She can get back up.

1401
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,996
Hey, wait!

1402
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,415
-Did she get your hat?
-No.

1403
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:07,625
Should I move back?

1404
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:08,542
What?

1405
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,256
Wow, this is intense.

1406
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,841
Wow, this is no joke.

1407
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,348
-Si-an has long arms.
-Yeah.

1408
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,974
-I'll go this way.
-I should move back.

1409
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:26,060
You're too close.

1410
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,229
You're too close.

1411
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,606
Si-an isn't even worried
about Dong-ho's head.

1412
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,775
-The girls aren't concerned.
-Yeah.

1413
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,401
You're too close.

1414
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,737
You went too close!

1415
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,240
You went too close!

1416
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:47,581
This is scary.

1417
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:48,624
I'm so scared.

1418
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:53,462
-A headbutt?
-Really?

1419
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,797
A headbutt?

1420
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:02,012
They're headbutting each other.

1421
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:12,523
Stop it!

1422
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:21,824
Stop it!

1423
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,496
Lee Si-an and Kook Dong-ho win.

1424
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,123
-Where's my cap?
-Over there.

1425
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,251
They were so good.

1426
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,794
She did it like a boss.

1427
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,671
You have to give it to them.

1428
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:36,589
That headbutt…

1429
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,299
I'm all wet.

1430
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,301
You did great, Min-seol.

1431
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:41,260
You both did.

1432
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,265
A special meal date
was on the line in the couples' game.

1433
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,725
The winners are

1434
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,685
Lee Si-an and Kook Dong-ho.

1435
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,610
Si-an's won all the games.

1436
01:09:58,569 --> 01:09:59,612
That was so intense.

1437
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:04,408
Dong-ho was just Si-an's game partner.
Nothing more, nothing less.

1438
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,202
-Exactly.
-Right?

1439
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,621
She was literally grabbing
his head like this.

1440
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:10,956
But since they won,

1441
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,375
-Dong-ho gets to choose too.
-That's true.

1442
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:17,504
I wonder who Si-an had in mind
to try so hard like this.

1443
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,632
It feels pretty obvious.

1444
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,675
-Right?
-It's obviously Jeong-su.

1445
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:23,177
-Yeah, it's so obvious.
-But…

1446
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,803
It couldn't be Jun-seo?

1447
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:28,349
I think the key decision for her
is whether to choose Jun-seo now

1448
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:30,476
or go with him later to Paradise.

1449
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,519
I see.

1450
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:34,396
You don't look convinced at all.

1451
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,440
But Dong-ho can pick a date too, right?

1452
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:37,816
-They were a team.
-Yes.

1453
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,026
I'm more curious about this.

1454
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:42,321
Won't Dong-ho choose A-rin?
They didn't get to talk earlier.

1455
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,615
I think he's going to choose A-rin too.

1456
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,285
Lee Si-an, as the winner,

1457
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:52,665
please name the person you'd like to
enjoy a date with for a special meal.

1458
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,844
The person I'd like to go
on a special meal date with is…

1459
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,846
Kim Jeong-su.

1460
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,183
Kim Jeong-su.

1461
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,144
Kim Jeong-su.

1462
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,066
Lee Si-an has selected Kim Jeong-su.

1463
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:21,986
Enjoy your special meal date.

1464
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,489
Kook Dong-ho,

1465
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:30,202
please name the person you'd like to
enjoy a date with for a special meal.

1466
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,205
The person I'd like to go
on a special meal date with is…

1467
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,011
Kim A-rin.

1468
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,054
Kim A-rin.

1469
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,893
Kook Dong-ho has selected Kim A-rin.

1470
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,855
Enjoy your special meal date.

1471
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:00,190
Hae-lin has a confused look on her face.

1472
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,860
Yeah, this feeling is strange to her.

1473
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,196
I'm so hungry.

1474
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,073
-You were hungry, right?
-Yeah, I'm starving.

1475
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,158
Me too.

1476
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,287
I applaud you

1477
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,664
for that competitive spirit of yours.

1478
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,544
-Well…
-Yeah?

1479
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:23,464
After going to Paradise with you…

1480
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:24,506
Yeah.

1481
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,051
It felt like we never had
a real date before.

1482
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:29,303
So I picked you.

1483
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:30,220
What?

1484
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,638
That's why I picked you.

1485
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:34,892
Well done.

1486
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,728
What did you eat yesterday?

1487
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:38,771
-Yesterday?
-Yeah.

1488
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,649
Well…

1489
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,363
We were on a yacht.

1490
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:50,115
We had champagne.

1491
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:53,410
And there were sandwiches.

1492
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:54,703
-I see.
-Nothing special.

1493
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:02,211
Yeah, that's how he does things.

1494
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,921
-He's comforting her.
-It's no big deal.

1495
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:04,838
Yeah.

1496
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:12,721
Yesterday's date was really fun.

1497
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:19,603
And Hae-lin is really charming and great.

1498
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:21,146
But…

1499
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:26,110
while I was on my date with her…

1500
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:29,696
I kept thinking of you
every time we went to a new spot.

1501
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,411
And I kept…

1502
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,667
thinking about things
we talked about and stuff like that.

1503
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,046
-So…
-I honestly didn't know that.

1504
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,216
To be honest,

1505
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:52,386
I don't want this to be a casual thing.

1506
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,388
I'd just like to get to know you more.

1507
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:00,561
I see.

1508
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,691
During my time here,

1509
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:09,027
I'd like to go back with you
at least once.

1510
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:10,487
To Paradise?

1511
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,866
One last trip to Paradise?

1512
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:18,620
Well, if that's what you want.

1513
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,293
We can go three times too.

1514
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:38,765
It's a done deal now.

1515
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,477
Why are you giving up?

1516
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,020
They're going to be a couple.

1517
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:45,189
Hanhae, they're going to end up together.

1518
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,983
You really don't know anything.

1519
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:48,984
-Still?
-Just wait.

1520
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,652
-Not letting go yet?
-Wait for what?

1521
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,237
He told us to be patient.

1522
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,114
-Wait.
-You've held your breath for a while.

1523
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,741
Are you a deep-sea diver?

1524
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,828
Did you talk a lot
with the people who stayed?

1525
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:00,746
Yeah.

1526
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:06,543
Yesterday, I just talked
with Theo and Jun-seo.

1527
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:13,467
But after those talks…

1528
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,932
I don't really need to do any more now.

1529
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:22,643
The other…

1530
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,771
I'm all set with the other guys now.

1531
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:27,940
-I see.
-That's it.

1532
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:33,487
What about you?

1533
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:45,165
I don't need to.

1534
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,338
Well…

1535
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:54,925
As for the other girls…

1536
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:01,431
I'm…

1537
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:14,611
That's how I feel.

1538
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,531
Okay.

1539
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,702
He gave her assurance.

1540
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:22,744
He gave her an answer.

1541
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:27,082
That's why when he returned,
he said, "All that stuff wasn't fun."

1542
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:31,420
I think he was telling her
he's done with the other women now.

1543
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:33,005
That's if he meant it.

1544
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,548
I hope he meant what he said.

1545
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:37,050
But if he acts differently
after saying that…

1546
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:38,302
That would be wrong.

1547
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:39,553
-Yeah.
-If he goes to Hae-lin?

1548
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:41,054
-Seriously.
-To someone else.

1549
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:42,681
-That would be…
-Yeah, that's…

1550
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:44,808
-No way.
-I mean…

1551
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:46,768
That hasn't even happened yet.

1552
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,187
I don't know what'll happen next,
but he was so cool.

1553
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,606
-Right.
-As a man…

1554
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,858
-He was real and honest.
-Right.

1555
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:56,653
I initially thought what he said
at the end felt a bit weak,

1556
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,405
but thinking about it now, it was great.

1557
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:00,282
He said, "That's how I feel."

1558
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:02,242
If it were me,
here's what I would've said.

1559
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,703
"I don't need anyone else but you."

1560
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,288
I would've made it definitive.

1561
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:09,124
But to be considerate to her,
keeping his answer subtle

1562
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:10,417
was the best choice.

1563
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,668
It is considerate.

1564
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,337
She still had a lot on her mind then.

1565
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,423
Giving such a definitive answer could be…

1566
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:17,924
She might've felt pressured,

1567
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,843
so I think he was being considerate.

1568
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:21,637
He just simply said, "That's how I feel."

1569
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,390
After all this, you still think
Si-an and Jun-seo have a chance?

1570
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:26,892
-Just wait a bit.
-Really?

1571
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,144
How many times are you going to
grill me this episode?

1572
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:32,481
I do want Si-an and Jun-seo
to go to Paradise together at least once.

1573
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:33,815
-Paradise?
-At least once.

1574
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:34,816
Right.

1575
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,318
By the way, what about Theo?

1576
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:40,030
-Si-an still…
-No one's worrying about Theo.

1577
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:42,282
Theo is on Si-an's mind, right?

1578
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:43,325
Are you sure?

1579
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:46,870
Enjoy.

1580
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:48,288
You too.

1581
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:51,333
-Thanks to you, I get to eat this.
-It's nothing.

1582
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:52,584
I was just lucky.

1583
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:53,543
Yeah.

1584
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,671
-Si-an took care of it all.
-Yeah.

1585
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:56,755
She's brightened up.

1586
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,256
-She's so happy.
-She's cheered up.

1587
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,299
It's been a while.

1588
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:01,635
-She's so transparent.
-We've never seen her like this.

1589
01:18:01,718 --> 01:18:02,928
She likes him so much.

1590
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:07,683
So, what did you do in Paradise?

1591
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,769
-We didn't get to finish that talk before.
-You're right.

1592
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:12,354
Yesterday…

1593
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:15,941
I left.

1594
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,277
-I left…
-You left.

1595
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,197
Before I knew it, I was in the helicopter.

1596
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,700
But Hae-lin was already there.

1597
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:27,035
Jeong-su was there too. They were talking.

1598
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,829
I greeted them and sat down.

1599
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:30,872
She sat in between us.

1600
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,999
It was the first helicopter I ever rode.

1601
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,001
-No, not that stuff.
-Right.

1602
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:36,712
"Not that stuff."

1603
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,841
-He really is a math and science person.
-Yeah.

1604
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:42,634
He sounds like such an accountant.

1605
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,303
He's actually going through
everything in order.

1606
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:47,681
-No, not that stuff.
-Right.

1607
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:49,391
-No, not that stuff.
-Right.

1608
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:51,184
I'm just telling you everything.

1609
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:52,519
-I'm just…
-Right, a timeline.

1610
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:54,271
I'm just like that.

1611
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:56,857
And then, we arrived.

1612
01:18:57,607 --> 01:18:59,025
It was a unique experience.

1613
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:02,279
It was a chance
to get to know all about Hae-lin.

1614
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:03,697
We talked a lot.

1615
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,742
So do you think

1616
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:10,787
going to Paradise makes you
want to get to know someone better?

1617
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:13,457
It's a tight schedule,

1618
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,959
so it's hard to be sure
after just one day there.

1619
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:18,044
But it helped me know
which direction to head in.

1620
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,047
-Why?
-What?

1621
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:23,133
-I feel like I did all the talking.
-Not at all.

1622
01:19:23,216 --> 01:19:27,429
You had a special experience yesterday.
I didn't have much going on.

1623
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:28,889
What did you do?

1624
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:30,849
We had free time.

1625
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:32,476
I'm asking about you.

1626
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,644
Things just felt a bit dull for me.

1627
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:38,607
It was a shame.

1628
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,693
I wanted to chat more,
but the situation didn't allow for it.

1629
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,321
It felt so frustrating and listless.

1630
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:45,947
That's how it was.

1631
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:49,910
Just a lot of reasons made me think,
"Gosh, why are things…"

1632
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:56,124
I thought you would've talked with others
and had a good time.

1633
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,752
-But then…
-It wasn't so.

1634
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:00,962
But when I asked my roommates,

1635
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,839
it didn't seem that way.

1636
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:04,841
That made me feel bad a little bit.

1637
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,009
I see.

1638
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,767
That's why I was waiting for today.

1639
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:15,644
I waited.

1640
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:20,482
But you came carrying both of your bags
while Jeong-su was carrying his own.

1641
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:23,068
EARLIER THIS MORNING

1642
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,778
-Hello.
-Hello.

1643
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:25,946
Hello.

1644
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:34,412
Also, the game changer
said something as she was walking up.

1645
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:38,583
But she was only looking at you
while she talked.

1646
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:42,128
So I assumed you both
became really close and talked a lot.

1647
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:43,755
-I…
-That's what I thought.

1648
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,299
What? Why are you laughing?

1649
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,513
-He finds her cute.
-Yeah.

1650
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:55,851
Dong-ho seems to be at ease with A-rin.

1651
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:56,768
Right.

1652
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:59,563
They seem to get along really well.

1653
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,606
But depending on what Hae-lin does,

1654
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,650
things might shift a bit.

1655
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:06,069
There's still that possibility.

1656
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:13,660
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1657
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,872
Why am I getting chills?

1658
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,457
The men have already chosen

1659
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:23,461
the women they'd like to go
to Paradise with.

1660
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,096
Ladies,

1661
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:37,851
please name the person you'd like to go
on a date with in Paradise.

1662
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:41,688
I haven't decided yet.

1663
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,899
Me neither.

1664
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:50,822
This one's important.

1665
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:51,865
-Exactly.
-For real.

1666
01:21:51,948 --> 01:21:54,200
Te-hwan and Ji-yeon
will definitely go, right?

1667
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,161
-Yes, 100%.
-Yes, they will.

1668
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,747
-But for Dong-ho…
-Yes?

1669
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,332
I still can't quite read him.

1670
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:03,043
I think he'll choose A-rin this round.

1671
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,210
At least once, right?

1672
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:05,420
-Dong-ho.
-Right?

1673
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:08,089
After all this,
he wouldn't pick someone else.

1674
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,966
I think he'll go with her at least once.

1675
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,677
-Yeah, at least once.
-He was with Hae-lin yesterday.

1676
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,263
-Theo would've chosen Si-an.
-Yes.

1677
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:17,349
What about Jeong-su?

1678
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,060
-Jeong-su…
-He probably chose Si-an.

1679
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:23,688
I think he chose Si-an,
because if he chose someone else…

1680
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,066
-If he did, he's done for.
-Exactly.

1681
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:27,359
There's no turning back.

1682
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,694
If he does, I won't even mention his name.

1683
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,614
-I mean…
-Then, Jeong-su…

1684
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:33,823
"That guy."

1685
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,033
You're still a host.

1686
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,618
-You can't do that.
-I'm sorry.

1687
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:39,245
What she said is understandable.

1688
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:43,291
During his last conversation with Si-an,
he made things so clear.

1689
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,210
-He made his feelings clear.
-Yeah.

1690
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,753
Si-an is the problem.

1691
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:49,422
I think Si-an will choose Jeong-su.

1692
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:50,590
I don't think so.

1693
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:53,635
-This is the moment. It's time.
-It's time for Jun-seo. Yes.

1694
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,261
-The time has come.
-Really?

1695
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,262
Jun-seo's turn?

1696
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:57,555
-It's today.
-It's Jun-seo.

1697
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:58,473
Really?

1698
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:00,183
-I've waited so long for this.
-It's Yuk.

1699
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:02,978
-For sure.
-You're sticking with this awful guess?

1700
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:05,146
I think she chose Jeong-su.

1701
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,648
-No, it's Yuk.
-She didn't?

1702
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:13,446
PARADISE-BOUND COUPLE MATCHING

1703
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:17,617
We will begin with Chung You-jin's choice.

1704
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,828
-Good luck.
-Why am I always the first one?

1705
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,372
I don't know how You-jin feels.

1706
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:23,873
-You-jin?
-I have no idea.

1707
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:24,791
Yeah.

1708
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:29,295
You-jin needs someone calm and stable.

1709
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:35,260
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1710
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:39,014
Kook Dong-ho.

1711
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:49,691
Chung You-jin has matched with…

1712
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:58,700
Since Dong-ho and I
haven't had much time to talk,

1713
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:04,873
I was hoping he would choose me
so that we could have some time to chat.

1714
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:12,881
But Dong-ho doesn't know
she feels this way, right?

1715
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,800
She wasn't expressing her feelings.

1716
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:19,721
Chung You-jin has matched with…

1717
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:23,308
no one.

1718
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,351
Please return to your room.

1719
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,192
Chung You-jin has matched with…

1720
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:33,902
Someone picked her.

1721
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:36,529
…no one.

1722
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,615
Please return to your room.

1723
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:40,950
They let everyone know like this?

1724
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:44,954
…no one.

1725
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:47,082
Please return to your room.

1726
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:51,211
They're going to
announce it publicly like this?

1727
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:54,005
-This is so cruel! I'm going to cry!
-Seriously.

1728
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,424
I'm still getting chills. My gosh.

1729
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,359
I came back later than expected, right?

1730
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:17,487
Not at all.

1731
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:21,950
Why is it so foggy in here?

1732
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:23,284
I used a spray.

1733
01:25:27,163 --> 01:25:30,083
So, you don't know
who chose you or who didn't?

1734
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:32,418
It seems neither the guys or girls know.

1735
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:37,298
-Only the ones who choose each other go.
-They'll get to go.

1736
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,392
Park Hae-lin.

1737
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,228
Please make your selection.

1738
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:58,945
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1739
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:09,372
Kook Dong-ho.

1740
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,459
That's right.

1741
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:16,421
-I knew she would.
-Dong-ho is really popular.

1742
01:26:17,046 --> 01:26:20,008
Even though I went to Paradise
with both of them yesterday,

1743
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:24,929
my interest in Dong-ho
has grown a little bit more.

1744
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,556
He just keeps coming to mind.

1745
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:31,769
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1746
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,814
Kook Dong-ho.

1747
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:41,988
It depends on Dong-ho choice now.

1748
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:44,991
Park Hae-lin has matched with…

1749
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:50,872
Kim A-rin has matched with…

1750
01:26:56,419 --> 01:26:58,004
Are they going to match?

1751
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,809
-Dong-ho is walking out.
-Yeah.

1752
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:21,819
What?

1753
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,697
It'll be over
if he picks Hae-lin here, right?

1754
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:25,907
That would be the end.

1755
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,700
That would end everything.

1756
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:29,744
Let's go.

1757
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:33,498
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1758
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:35,166
There you go!

1759
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,626
Finally.

1760
01:27:36,709 --> 01:27:37,543
Off they go.

1761
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:38,461
Gosh.

1762
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:44,509
Isn't it heavy?

1763
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:45,718
It's heavy.

1764
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,095
Want me to carry it?

1765
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:50,014
Let's have fun.

1766
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,769
"Let's have fun."

1767
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:55,853
That was so awkward.

1768
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,772
So you're not going to have fun?

1769
01:27:57,855 --> 01:28:00,358
No, let's have fun. Beep, boop.

1770
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:03,069
She's so happy.

1771
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,780
That "beep, boop" was cute.

1772
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:07,699
They had to go once.

1773
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:08,700
-Exactly.
-Right.

1774
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,119
Finally…

1775
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:12,912
-What?
-Finally, it's A-rin's turn.

1776
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:20,128
The two who chose Dong-ho couldn't go.

1777
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:24,090
I'm not sure if it's the heat
or if it's my anger.

1778
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:25,925
I have no idea.

1779
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:27,093
Dong-ho?

1780
01:28:27,176 --> 01:28:29,929
Yes, I knew what I was getting into.

1781
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:33,474
I knew when I chose,

1782
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:35,810
so I thought I'd be fine.

1783
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:36,728
Still…

1784
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:38,855
You don't.

1785
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:42,525
I was right about it not working out,
so it feels worse.

1786
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:46,904
Seeing A-rin

1787
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:52,160
act so excited, which is a side of her
I've never seen before…

1788
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:55,246
It was a bit upsetting.

1789
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,499
Is my hair weird? Can you check?
Does it look too old-fashioned?

1790
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,543
-You've always had it down.
-It looks great.

1791
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:01,461
-It does?
-Yeah.

1792
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,755
My bracelet doesn't match, right?

1793
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:04,839
-Is it okay?
-Yeah.

1794
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:06,799
Is this too much?

1795
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,261
I get that she's going to Paradise.

1796
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:14,140
I wish she'd just go quietly.

1797
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:15,725
"Quietly."

1798
01:29:20,563 --> 01:29:21,939
A-rin deserves to be happy.

1799
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,441
-Yeah, the whole time…
-Yeah.

1800
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,234
-It's her first time!
-Yeah.

1801
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,362
-She'd been quiet. Exactly.
-She couldn't help it.

1802
01:29:28,404 --> 01:29:30,823
I get that she's going to Paradise.

1803
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:34,702
I wish she'd just go quietly.

1804
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:36,788
I'm so nervous.

1805
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,083
Even until the last moment,
while putting on her shoes…

1806
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:41,793
How are my shoes?

1807
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,669
Are the ribbons too big?

1808
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:45,254
-They're fine.
-They're cute.

1809
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:47,548
After seeing her be so excited

1810
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:50,635
and hearing how she matched with Dong-ho…

1811
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:56,349
It didn't feel great.

1812
01:29:56,432 --> 01:29:57,934
Of course, she can't be happy.

1813
01:29:58,017 --> 01:29:59,102
-I understand.
-Right.

1814
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:01,729
But A-rin did ask a lot of questions.

1815
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:02,647
-Right?
-Yeah.

1816
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:04,690
At least choose your shoes by yourself.

1817
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:06,442
Can't you see how You-jin feels?

1818
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:09,362
Our room is "The Dong-ho Room."

1819
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:11,656
Because the three of us are roommates.

1820
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,157
The next chance I get,

1821
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,660
I'll make sure to win
and talk to Dong-ho first.

1822
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,583
Hae-lin looks a little angry right now.

1823
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:23,668
Yeah.

1824
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:26,087
-She seems mad and determined now.
-She does.

1825
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:32,176
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1826
01:30:33,427 --> 01:30:34,971
Kim Te-hwan.

1827
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,974
Finally, it's time for these two.

1828
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:40,143
-We want your ages and jobs.
-They'll go for sure.

1829
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,061
It's your first time?

1830
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:43,688
-…Kim Te-hwan.
-That's right.

1831
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:44,939
-Have fun.
-Kim Te-hwan.

1832
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:46,774
Please come outside.

1833
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,580
He's like a little kid.

1834
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:01,497
It's so cute.

1835
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,541
You think Te-hwan was born in 2005?

1836
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:05,293
It seems like it.

1837
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:12,550
-Let's go this way.
-Let's go.

1838
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,177
-This way?
-Yeah, be careful.

1839
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:16,387
-Are your heels okay?
-Yeah.

1840
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:19,140
The weather's nice.

1841
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:21,851
We're finally going to Paradise.

1842
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,895
-Right?
-Yeah.

1843
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:27,023
Kim Hye-jin.

1844
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:29,442
Please make your choice.

1845
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:32,570
Who do you think Hye-jin will pick?

1846
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:34,405
I'm not sure.

1847
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:37,033
You've been to Paradise with her.

1848
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,619
Didn't you become really close?

1849
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:41,537
Yeah, we did get close.

1850
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:47,585
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1851
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,595
An Jong-hoon.

1852
01:31:59,555 --> 01:32:03,100
I've been to Paradise once with Jeong-su,

1853
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:06,812
but with Jong-hoon, the three of us went.

1854
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:10,024
I thought going with just him this time
would feel different,

1855
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:11,359
so I chose him.

1856
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:14,820
Kim Hye-jin matched with…

1857
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:22,828
no one.

1858
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,914
Please return to your room.

1859
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:35,049
Who did Jong-hoon pick?

1860
01:32:35,132 --> 01:32:35,967
-Si-an?
-Yeah.

1861
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:36,968
It seems like it.

1862
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:47,436
My heart feels heavy.

1863
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:50,064
She must've worked hard to pack.

1864
01:32:57,196 --> 01:32:59,865
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1865
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:02,660
-Yuk.
-Yuk?

1866
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:07,373
Jun-seo is such a mystery.

1867
01:33:08,165 --> 01:33:09,000
I don't know.

1868
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:11,669
I don't know my own feelings right now.

1869
01:33:13,045 --> 01:33:16,173
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1870
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:26,267
Jang Theo.

1871
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:27,476
What?

1872
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:28,853
-What on earth?
-What?

1873
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:30,521
-What's going on?
-What is this?

1874
01:33:30,604 --> 01:33:32,606
This basically means she wants to stay.

1875
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,608
I don't think he picked her.

1876
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:39,447
After talking with Jun-seo yesterday,
my biggest takeaway was

1877
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:42,867
he said he was curious about Si-an.

1878
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:46,203
It made me realize
I shouldn't just hang onto Jun-seo.

1879
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:50,499
The most interesting person here
after Jun-seo is Theo.

1880
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:52,168
So I became curious about him.

1881
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,173
Kim Min-seol matched with…

1882
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,302
no one.

1883
01:34:01,385 --> 01:34:03,304
Please return to your room.

1884
01:34:08,642 --> 01:34:10,895
My goodness, Min-seol.

1885
01:34:21,864 --> 01:34:25,076
I told you I didn't need to pack a lot.

1886
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:36,462
-I'm curious about Si-an's choice.
-Who did she pick?

1887
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:38,214
-Yuk.
-It's Yuk.

1888
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:39,382
It's Yuk this time.

1889
01:34:39,465 --> 01:34:40,341
I choose Yuk too.

1890
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:47,890
Lee Si-an. It is now your turn.

1891
01:34:47,973 --> 01:34:49,642
Please come outside.

1892
01:34:49,725 --> 01:34:50,893
Good luck.

1893
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:54,855
Is she the last one?

1894
01:34:56,315 --> 01:34:57,274
She's the last one.

1895
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:07,576
30 MINUTES AGO

1896
01:35:10,496 --> 01:35:13,165
LEE SI-AN

1897
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:18,879
LEE SI-AN

1898
01:35:22,716 --> 01:35:24,635
LEE SI-AN

1899
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:32,017
LEE SI-AN

1900
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:37,398
THEO, JEONG-SU, JONG-HOON,
JUN-SEO SELECTED SI-AN

1901
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:40,067
Four votes.

1902
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,237
-She swept the choices.
-For real.

1903
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,905
Four guys out of six chose her.

1904
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:58,794
I'd rather not have the option to choose.

1905
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:02,006
I'd rather not have it.

1906
01:36:11,515 --> 01:36:14,143
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1907
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,781
This is an important decision.

1908
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:30,075
-It's going to be Yuk.
-Yuk?

1909
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:31,368
I really don't know.

1910
01:36:51,388 --> 01:36:54,099
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1911
01:36:57,102 --> 01:36:58,812
Yuk Jun-seo.

1912
01:37:27,633 --> 01:37:29,510
Isn't Paradise a scary place?

1913
01:37:29,593 --> 01:37:31,845
Now I see why everyone says
you have to come here.

1914
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:33,597
It was better than I expected.

NEXT EPISODE

1916
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:37,560
Dong-ho seems really busy right now.

1917
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:39,520
There were women
who wanted to talk to him.

1918
01:37:39,603 --> 01:37:41,313
Did you have fun? Was it different?

1919
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:42,856
I want to go with you.

1920
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:45,401
I've never met anyone
like her before in my life.

1921
01:37:45,484 --> 01:37:49,363
Can't you decide
after going to Paradise with me?

1922
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:51,490
I'll really think about it.

1923
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:55,160
Since I know someone in the same room
has feelings for him too,

1924
01:37:55,244 --> 01:37:56,412
it feels a bit uncomfortable.

1925
01:37:56,996 --> 01:37:58,330
Who do you like the most?

1926
01:37:58,414 --> 01:37:59,582
Right now, it's Theo.

1927
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:01,250
That's why I'm confused.

1928
01:38:03,502 --> 01:38:04,878
Do you want a flower?

1929
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:06,755
For me, it's always been you.

1930
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:08,090
I still feel the same.

1931
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:10,050
Si-an is my top choice.

1932
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:11,969
I should've picked you from the start.

1933
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:13,929
Is there even any room for me?

1934
01:38:14,013 --> 01:38:15,306
Do you want to go to Paradise?

1935
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:16,682
Of course, I do.

1936
01:38:16,765 --> 01:38:18,559
I think that's when I became more certain.

1937
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:22,521
Aren't you moving too fast?

1938
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:23,564
What?

1939
01:38:23,647 --> 01:38:24,523
Did he hug her?

1940
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,317
I always lose my mind on these two.

1941
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,360
We've never seen this before.

1942
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:29,612
-My gosh!
-What?

1943
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:04,813
