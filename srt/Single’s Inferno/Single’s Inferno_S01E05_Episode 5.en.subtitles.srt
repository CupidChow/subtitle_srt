INFERNO

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,585
Time flies. It's evening already.

12
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,296
Wait. I need to put on my shoes.

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,131
-It won't take long.
-Okay. Take your time.

14
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,725
I see someone.

15
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,019
-Someone's there.
-Really?

16
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,645
-Yes, someone's there.
-Shall we?

17
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,117
-Is someone there?
-Someone is there.

18
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,744
Where?

19
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,871
-I saw someone in white.
-Me too.

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,126
-Oh, what? There she is.
-My gosh!

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,878
There is someone.

22
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,379
-What?
-What? Hold on.

23
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,684
Hello.

24
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,685
-Hello.
-Hello.

25
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,187
-Hello.
-Hello.

26
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,398
Hello.

27
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,608
Hello.

28
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,567
Welcome.

29
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,735
Hello.

30
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,322
-Shall we sit down?
-Right. Please take a seat.

31
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,158
Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,247
You must be really nervous.

33
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,999
-She must be.
-I didn't expect to see anyone new here.

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,376
I see.

35
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,546
Hello, my name is Kim Su-min.

36
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,800
I would describe myself
as a bright, friendly,

37
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,344
and energetic person.

38
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,556
I get hit on by many guys.

39
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,351
-Look at her dimples.
-She has dimples.

40
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,602
Oh, my. Look at the dimples.

41
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,063
-She's so pretty.
-I know.

42
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:32,026
I think I'm quite popular with guys.

43
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,489
I think it's important
to believe in myself and have confidence.

44
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,118
As for appearance, my ideal type is

45
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,454
someone who has thick double eyelids.

46
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,625
I also like men
who are true to their feelings.

47
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,669
If I find someone attractive,

48
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,005
I'll do my best to win his heart.

49
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,339
I can do it!

50
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,176
Gosh. They have a strong opponent now.

51
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,094
Indeed.

52
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,221
We have a lot of guys
who are true to themselves here.

53
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,556
On Single's Inferno.

54
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:02,974
Welcome.

55
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,475
Welcome. A round of applause.

56
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,894
Where have you been all this time?

57
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,647
This place is literally hell.
I'm not joking.

58
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,524
-Is that so?
-You have no idea.

59
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,692
What's your name?

60
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,486
My name is Kim Su-min.

61
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,322
-Okay. Su-min.
-Su-min.

62
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,698
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

63
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,408
-May I ask how old you are?
-A handshake?

64
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,826
-Oh, sure.
-It's nice to meet you.

65
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,369
I heard I'm not supposed to tell you.

66
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,662
-Oh, you know the rule.
-I do.

67
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,624
Have you eaten yet?

68
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,917
I had only one meal today.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,585
-You must be hungry.
-When did you eat?

70
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,878
I had breakfast.

71
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,005
-We can't eat much here.
-Is that so?

72
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,090
Have you heard about Paradise?

73
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,300
Oh. Yes, I have.

74
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,551
I see.

75
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,303
-It's heavenly.
-You haven't been there, right?

76
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,804
-No.
-I haven't either.

77
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,848
Right.

78
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,933
-Among…
-Right.

79
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,684
us here, I'm the only one who hasn't.

80
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,602
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

81
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,270
-Just like me.
-Exactly.

82
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,897
-I want to go there.
-Me too.

83
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,484
Oh, my.

84
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,902
That was smooth.

85
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,153
It was.

86
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,696
You can do it, Se-hoon.

87
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,782
Me too.

88
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,869
-I want to go there too.
-You do?

89
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,247
-Let's go together sometime.
-That's a cute pick-up line.

90
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,041
They're coming.

91
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,542
-Right. The other participants.
-Yes.

92
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,420
Wait. Their fashion seems…

93
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,547
Meet our Avengers.

94
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,010
-They look different today.
-They all seem so determined today.

95
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,220
-Do you see her?
-Can you see?

96
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,137
Is that her?

97
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,056
-I see the guys sitting there.
-I see the guys.

98
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,683
I bet they're sitting with the new girl.

99
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,810
-You're right.
-See? There's a girl.

100
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,730
-Are you girls jealous or what?
-Really?

101
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,191
-They're coming out strong today.
-They really are.

102
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,736
They all look gorgeous.

103
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,990
-There's a girl.
-There's a girl there.

104
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,825
-I see her hair.
-She has long hair.

105
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,789
Hello.

106
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,874
-Why are we standing up?
-They're all gorgeous.

107
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,876
It's just a formality.

108
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:55,878
Hello.

109
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,963
Hello.

110
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,673
-She's so pretty.
-I know.

111
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,675
Hello.

112
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:01,926
We saw you.

113
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,053
-What?
-We heard and saw you.

114
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,096
Please take your seats.

115
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,055
Right.

116
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,392
The guys seemed really excited.

117
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,520
I don't think I've ever seen them
this happy on this island.

118
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:16,149
"It looks like there might be
a new couple now.

119
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,275
Well, this is exciting."

120
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,776
That's what I thought.

121
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,114
With the reveal
of the new participant, Kim Su-min,

122
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,826
the male participants all seem so lively.

123
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,369
Their eyes are sparkling.

124
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,788
They all look very excited.

125
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,500
And when the female participants
appeared later,

126
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,210
I could feel some

127
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,046
-tension…
-The tension, yes.

128
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,340
and awkwardness.

129
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,800
-The female participants are
-I know.

130
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,969
dressed up really nicely today.

131
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,431
Are we supposed to make
our own dinner here?

132
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,766
-Yes.
-Always.

133
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,310
-Oh, I see.
-What should we make today?

134
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,520
-We can make egg fried rice.
-Wait, is that tofu?

135
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,481
-We have so many options.
-We can make pajeon!

136
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,110
Pajeon, kimchijeon, and rice.

137
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,696
-So rice and…
-He's really good at cooking rice.

138
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,782
-Right. He's good at it.
-Because he spent two nights

139
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,075
on this island.

140
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,077
-We can make egg soup
-Sounds good.

141
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,244
and something with kimchi.

142
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,537
-All right.
-Okay.

143
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,955
-Okay.
-Okay.

144
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,248
Let's go.

145
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,918
We need to set the table
and everything else too.

146
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,801
Does this spring onion look good?

147
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,010
Do you need any help?

148
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,303
Oh. Well…

149
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,679
-Jun-sik.
-Yes?

150
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,806
I should do something.

151
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,768
Or at least pretend to do something.

152
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,354
It's okay. Just make yourself comfortable.
We've all been there.

153
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,106
-Really?
-Just make yourself comfortable.

154
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,150
So what's your first impression of her?

155
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,112
I thought she might be your type.

156
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,405
That's actually true.

157
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,532
I knew it.

158
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,408
-You know my type.
-Yes.

159
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,371
But here, I realized
that doesn't really matter.

160
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,040
The seasoning is important for egg soup.

161
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,376
I have nothing to do.

162
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,467
Be careful.

163
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,930
-I have nothing to do.
-I can see that.

164
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,432
We just made a fire
and started cooking rice.

165
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,809
Would you like to go have a look?

166
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,812
-Would you like to go and hang out?
-Si-hun.

167
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,773
-Would you like to watch us?
-Make some space for Su-min.

168
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,732
Su-min, have a seat.

169
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,025
-Is it fun?
-Please have a seat.

170
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,153
-Have a seat.
-Watch us make a fire.

171
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,115
Is it okay to just watch the fire here?

172
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,993
Here, you can watch the fire
as much as you want. I'm not kidding.

173
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,621
-Se-hoon is taking care of her.
-Right.

174
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,623
Su-min has positive vibes.

175
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,666
Right.

176
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,334
Can you beat the eggs?

177
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,627
Sure, I'll try.

178
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,755
-Then could you beat
-Yes?

179
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,300
-15 eggs here?
-All of a sudden?

180
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,926
-Beat 15 eggs here and…
-Okay.

181
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,721
You can put the eggshells here.

182
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,097
In here.

183
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,432
-No rush.
-Okay.

184
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,517
-Take your time.
-I added one.

185
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,061
I know I keep saying this
but I think we should…

186
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,814
It's okay.

187
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,149
It's all right.

188
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,400
Is it really okay?

189
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,449
I was having a hard time
fitting in because I was new.

190
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,161
But Se-hoon helped me a lot.
He was so nice to me.

191
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,662
And I was really grateful.

192
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,039
That's how I felt.

193
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,334
Su-min gave me
a very nice first impression.

194
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,836
Her eyes looked so pure.

195
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,007
She had a nice energy,
trying to mingle with the others.

196
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,259
That left a strong impression on me.

197
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,222
I've never made such a big pajeon before.

198
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,934
Thanks. Could you drizzle
the oil along the edge?

199
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,815
-Add vinegar and sugar.
-What is this in Japanese?

200
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,943
What's this? Honey?

201
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,946
-Sesame oil.
-What are you making?

202
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,739
-Sauce.
-The sauce.

203
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,533
Okay. A sauce for what?

204
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,909
For the pajeon.

205
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,410
It looks delicious.

206
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,495
Do you like chili powder?

207
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,705
Yes, I do.

208
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,964
Now, the eggs go in.

209
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,678
-My eyes burn.
-It's hot, right?

210
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,595
Sorry?

211
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,181
-You must be hot.
-My eyes are burning. It's hot too.

212
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,647
I feel bad.

213
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,149
Cooking rice is not easy,

214
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,694
but once it's done, it's delicious.

215
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,196
So-yeon is feeling uncomfortable.

216
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,449
-Right.
-What Se-hoon is doing now must be…

217
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,867
-Right.
-Right.

218
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,160
…bugging So-yeon.

219
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:44,041
We can read the participants' minds,
and I can't just watch them in peace.

220
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,794
-When one is doing well, the other isn't.
-We're walking on eggshells.

221
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,546
Gosh.

222
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,673
-Su-min, could you taste this?
-Yes.

223
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,468
Try it.

224
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,429
Be careful. It's hot.

225
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,475
-It's tasty.
-Is it?

226
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,227
-Yes.
-All right. The soup is done.

227
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,521
-Is it good?
-Would you like to taste it?

228
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,689
Yes.

229
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,066
-It's tasty, right?
-Yes.

230
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,484
-It tastes good.
-Is it all right?

231
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,986
-Su-min made it.
-I want to try too.

232
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,404
-It tastes really good.
-Really.

233
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,823
-I want to try some too.
-Would you like to try some?

234
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,617
-Su-min made it.
-Not really.

235
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,618
Really.

236
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,578
-Be careful.
-Okay.

237
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,372
-I'm scared.
-I'll be careful.

238
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,540
-Be careful.
-Okay.

239
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,421
I can't believe we made this.
I'm impressed.

240
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,672
I know, right?

241
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,010
Look.

242
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,346
-Nice.
-It looks really nice, doesn't it?

243
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,019
Gosh, I think this is
the most decent meal we've made.

244
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,062
Let's dig in.

245
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,647
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

246
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,107
I feel like we have meat today.

247
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,484
-Right.
-We have some protein.

248
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,401
It tastes so good.

249
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,071
It's delicious.

250
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,864
It tastes so good.

251
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,617
-I'm glad you guys like it.
-It's really good.

252
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,910
-Right?
-It really is.

253
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,336
It tastes amazing.

254
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,880
It's been a while
since we ate all together.

255
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,882
Is this our last meal today?

256
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,593
-Yes. Make sure to eat a lot.
-We never know when we get to eat next.

257
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,637
-Eat a lot.
-We don't know when we get to eat next?

258
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,556
They turn off the light at midnight
and we all sleep around that time.

259
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,599
Eat while you can.

260
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,976
But the thing is,
we never know what time it is now.

261
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,770
-I see.
-I know what time it is.

262
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,606
-What time is it? He's a human clock.
-Are you a sundial?

263
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,900
-A human clock.
-I think it's about 7:20 p.m.

264
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,655
How do you like the food, Su-min?

265
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,032
Really?

266
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,076
I have a big appetite today.

267
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,537
-Dinner is on me today.
-Oh, my gosh.

268
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,038
Thank you.

269
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,957
-Thanks, Jin-taek.
-Thank you.

270
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,959
-Next time, you can pay.
-Thanks for the dinner.

271
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,877
Let's go.

272
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,673
-It's cold now.
-It's so cold.

273
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,591
It's so much colder at night.

274
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,551
Seriously.

275
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,386
Wait. Oh, my gosh!

276
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,430
My gosh! What's all this?

277
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,806
-We have drinks.
-What?

278
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,599
-Let's go have a look.
-Drinks!

279
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,102
-I can't believe this.
-Oh, my gosh. We have some snacks too.

280
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,271
This is amazing.

281
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,773
We have so many drinks.

282
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,525
-Really?
-My gosh.

283
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,528
This is where I sat on the first day.

284
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,155
Where should we sit?

285
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,116
Let's sit here. Se-hoon, you sit here.

286
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,202
-Can we just sit anywhere?
-What's that?

287
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,455
It's beer.

288
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,497
-What?
-Beer.

289
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,874
Beer?

290
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,709
I had makgeolli yesterday.

291
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,378
-Be careful.
-Oh, no.

292
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,629
Here.

293
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,474
This is exciting.

294
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:48,976
This is really nice.

295
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,561
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

296
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,980
-I feel like I'm on a vacation today.
-Right.

297
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,736
What would you like to drink?

298
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,070
I'll have a Guinness.

299
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,572
-Guinness?
-Is there one?

300
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,782
-Wait. I'd like to have this one.
-It's dark beer.

301
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,950
-Hold it.
-Okay.

302
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,833
Where should I sit?

303
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,376
Come here.

304
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,128
So-yeon, come here.

305
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:17,838
Scoot over.

306
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,266
-Jin-taek is suddenly
-Jin-taek?

307
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,393
-being nice to So-yeon.
-He is.

308
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,270
-Jin-taek…
-Well, this is a bit…

309
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,314
This is going to be

310
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,775
so uncomfortable.

311
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,194
It looks nice, but also uncomfortable.

312
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,405
Should we open it?

313
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,407
-Welcome to the island, Su-min.
-Welcome!

314
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,368
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

315
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,577
-Thank you.
-Nice to meet you.

316
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,412
-Welcome.
-Cheers.

317
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,122
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

318
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,832
Welcome.

319
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,258
-How about we have a Q and A session?
-Okay.

320
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,342
Can I ask you a question?

321
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,427
-Sure. Go ahead.
-What's your ideal type?

322
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,637
-Me?
-Yes.

323
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:08,973
Well…

324
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,140
Here we go again.

325
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:17,106
I'm attracted to those
who are true to their feelings.

326
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,899
I like that.

327
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,900
That's Se-hoon.

328
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:25,656
Is any of us here close
to your ideal type, appearance-wise?

329
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,325
-Appearance-wise?
-Only yes or no for an answer.

330
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,371
How many of us?

331
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,000
-Do we need to know that?
-Just roughly.

332
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,043
Come on. I want to know how many.

333
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,795
Well, that's a bit…

334
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,255
Right. That's a bit…

335
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,760
Then what's your ideal type?

336
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,137
-Me?
-Yes.

337
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,723
She wants to know Se-hoon's ideal type.

338
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,016
All right. Answer her.

339
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,726
I want to know too.

340
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,561
-Me too.
-I want to know all your ideal types,

341
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,855
but Se-hoon and I got
pretty close today, so…

342
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,567
I'm glad you think so. Thank you.

343
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,611
My ideal type?

344
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,740
I'm attracted to those
who can express their feelings or thoughts

345
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,700
-Straightforwardly?
-verbally well.

346
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,621
-Those who can clearly express themselves.
-Right.

347
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,206
-I'd like to ask Si-hun.
-Okay.

348
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,250
Among us here,

349
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,670
is there one specific person

350
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,089
that you like?

351
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,299
I've already made up my mind.

352
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,092
I've already made up my mind.

353
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,637
None of this matters now.

354
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,221
-Nothing.
-I mean…

355
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,223
Is there one specific person?

356
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,266
Yes or no?

357
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,435
-Yes.
-Yes?

358
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,187
Okay. That's all I wanted to know.

359
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,524
I'll ask Hyeon-joong now.

360
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,361
-Hyeon-joong?
-I want to ask

361
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,862
-the same question.
-I see.

362
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,947
I'm curious.

363
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,494
Is there one specific person
you like here? Yes or no?

364
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,411
-Yes, there is.
-Yes?

365
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,704
Yes?

366
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,457
All right.

367
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,544
I'd like to ask the same question to Ji-a.

368
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:12,930
Yes.

369
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,849
Yes. She said yes.

370
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,976
Your turn, Ji-a.

371
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,478
-Yes.
-Yes. She said yes.

372
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,231
-Yes?
-Yes?

373
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,399
Yes?

374
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,777
I want to ask Jin-taek

375
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,779
-Okay.
-the same question.

376
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,364
-Okay. The same question.
-I'm curious.

377
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,699
Right. I'm curious too.

378
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,033
-I was curious.
-Me too.

379
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,077
You mean, if I like
one particular person here?

380
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,621
Isn't the answer obvious?

381
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,373
One person?

382
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,541
-What?
-One?

383
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,007
-Oh, my.
-Say no more.

384
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,342
-Okay. Let's stop asking.
-I didn't say anything.

385
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,343
Fine.

386
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,971
-Is this our last day here?
-Oh, my gosh.

387
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,184
He didn't say whether it was one or two.

388
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:05,858
His answer really puzzled me.
It left me with more questions.

389
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,861
I got very confused.

390
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,157
Gosh, Jin-taek.

391
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,200
-My gosh.
-I had no idea he was like this.

392
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,036
-Who is he?
-Seriously.

393
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,954
He could've said
he was interested in only one,

394
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,956
but if he meant there were two people,

395
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,125
to So-yeon, it would sound like

396
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,253
that he was interested
in both her and Ji-yeon.

397
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,338
I mean, he didn't have
to say who it was anyway.

398
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,133
-Well, it means…
-That one person?

399
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,259
I think he made a mistake.

400
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,178
I don't understand
why he talked like that.

401
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,014
Actually, I felt that

402
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,641
Ji-yeon was hitting on Jin-taek.

403
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,311
She suddenly mentioned
that they had makgeolli together,

404
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,814
and during the dinner preparation,
she asked him questions.

405
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,318
But then Jin-taek asked So-yeon
to sit next to him.

406
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,695
-Right.
-The women must be really confused.

407
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,239
Hyeon-joong and Si-hun
are interested in Ji-a.

408
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,658
And Ji-a said
she was interested in one person.

409
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,079
It could be Hyeon-joong or Si-hun.

410
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,163
Who do you think it is?

411
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,500
From what we saw until now,
I think she meant Hyeon-joong.

412
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,794
-Hyeon-joong?
-I think so too.

413
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,671
I think Ji-a said that

414
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,884
so Si-hun doesn't get
the wrong impression.

415
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,470
But Si-hun thinks she meant him.

416
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,848
-He might think she meant him.
-I think that's what it is.

417
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,058
Really?

418
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,559
But when she said that,

419
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,186
Si-hun made this gesture.

420
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,354
Yes.

421
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,481
She said yes.

422
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,858
Wait. Maybe that meant, "I'm so touched."

423
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,444
"She's talking about me."
Is that what it meant?

424
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:37,616
Ji-a, don't you mention
some other guy's name later, okay?

425
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:41,245
And it seems Se-hoon and Su-min

426
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,122
are definitely interested in each other.

427
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,081
She seems to feel

428
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,126
comfortable around Se-hoon.
She even sat next to him.

429
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,086
It seems to be smooth sailing for now.

430
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,170
-I think so.
-Yes.

431
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,757
Jin-taek, is there anyone else
you want to talk with?

432
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,925
-Me?
-Yes.

433
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,886
To be honest, So-yeon and Ji-yeon are

434
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,972
the only ones I want to talk to.

435
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,014
-Only them?
-Yes.

436
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,685
At first, So-yeon was
the only one I wanted to talk to,

437
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,646
-but after I talked with Ji-yeon…
-I know what you mean.

438
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,856
She's charming, right?

439
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,358
She's charming too.

440
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,611
You know what's interesting?
Ji-yeon is everywhere.

441
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,071
That's her charm.

442
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,116
-I know. She's so popular.
-She is.

443
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,075
There she comes.

444
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,997
I removed all my makeup.

445
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,792
Ji-yeon is out to have some beer.

446
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,043
Who wants to join?

447
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,379
I think

448
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,882
I should pack up my things
and get ready to go home now.

449
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:35,841
Why?

450
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,467
-Why?
-What are you saying?

451
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,344
This is getting too tough for me.

452
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,513
We need to talk.

453
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,723
What?

454
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:49,521
-She's so cute.
-Yesterday was the toughest day for me.

455
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,232
Even today, when we were
asking each other questions,

456
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,401
he was asked if he was
interested in one or two,

457
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,777
-but he couldn't answer.
-Right.

458
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,404
I was really surprised to hear that.

459
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,907
-You asked him the question.
-Right. I asked that on purpose.

460
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,117
But it made things more confusing.

461
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,037
-Right.
-He keeps being like that.

462
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,208
He keeps looking after me.
He even asked me to sit next to him.

463
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,667
Why is he doing that?

464
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,085
It really is odd.

465
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,047
-Right. He's being nice to you.
-I wish he wouldn't look after me

466
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,674
and would just go for Ji-yeon.

467
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,387
Why does he play with my feelings?
I'm starting to feel offended.

468
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,183
By the way,
I have a huge confession to make.

469
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,226
What is it?

470
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,561
-What?
-Are you interested in someone else now?

471
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,564
-I chose Se-hoon on the first day.
-Really?

472
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,775
Isn't that crazy? I had no idea.

473
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:39,613
I didn't know who wrote to me,
but I got one more postcard. I had two.

474
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,950
And it turned out
one of them was from Se-hoon.

475
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,827
-But I didn't know.
-Really?

476
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,664
So at first, we clicked,

477
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,875
but then Jin-taek
and I became like a couple.

478
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,629
Earlier, when we were sitting together,

479
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:59,132
I couldn't sit next to Se-hoon.

480
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,802
This is just…

481
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,430
Maybe I should just be
brazen about this whole thing.

482
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,724
Should I just go after Se-hoon?

483
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,976
Just go for it.

484
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,312
-Are you okay with it?
-You should just be brazen.

485
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,898
Will you give up on him?

486
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,900
Well, I am a little interested in him.

487
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,988
But we're allowed
to choose the same person, right?

488
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:21,905
True.

489
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:27,536
And for now, I'm just
observing the people here.

490
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,997
-I'm still curious.
-I understand.

491
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,624
Well, I guess we don't know
what Se-hoon is thinking.

492
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,335
Ji-a.

493
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,295
Yes?

494
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,092
This feels like a war. Right?

495
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,594
It must be tough.

496
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,513
-Right.
-It must be mentally distressing.

497
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,181
But Su-min was right there.

498
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,850
-I know.
-Exactly.

499
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,560
This is getting weird.

500
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,769
It's a war indeed.

501
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,688
Are you joining us?

502
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,398
-She loves daytime drinking.
-Of course.

503
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,400
-Cheers.
-But you can't drink much.

504
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,069
-I like drinking.
-She doesn't drink much,

505
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,865
-but she can party like she does.
-You're right.

506
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:09,536
You know a lot about me.

507
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,415
Didn't we go to bed early last night?
Around midnight?

508
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,292
-Right. Around midnight.
-Right.

509
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,460
You looked so tired.

510
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,711
Right. I yawned a lot.

511
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,795
Right.

512
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,383
I love the sound of the waves.

513
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,968
-Me too.
-Right?

514
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,636
Right.

515
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,141
We have four days left now.

516
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,144
Right.

517
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,228
I'll be right back.

518
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,813
Okay. See you.

519
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,232
I should go to bed soon.

520
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,909
Se-hoon and Ji-yeon are left alone.

521
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,119
What are they going to do?

522
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,726
Well, this is awkward.

523
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,520
-What?
-It's awkward.

524
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,480
-Right.
-Everyone went inside.

525
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,109
What's with the smoke?

526
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,071
Are they visual effects?

527
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,948
And why does it have
to be going to Se-hoon?

528
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,245
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

529
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,504
-Are you having fun?
-Here?

530
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,756
-Yes.
-Kind of.

531
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,424
-Kind of?
-Yes.

532
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,136
I was very worried before I came here.

533
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,973
Even now, I'm not feeling so comfortable.

534
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:58,979
I can't stop but ask myself
if this was a good decision.

535
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:05,235
Hi, we're here. Let's talk.

536
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,486
-Join us.
-Come here.

537
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,113
-Sit in the center.
-Sit in the center.

538
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:09,990
-You were here.
-If you're cold,

539
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,242
-I'll get you a blanket.
-Who's in the room?

540
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,910
-No one.
-No one?

541
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,203
-You didn't go to bed?
-No.

542
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,830
-Oh, really?
-No.

543
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,415
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

544
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,791
You must be really tired.

545
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,751
-Aren't you?
-Do you know each other's names?

546
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,628
-Ji-yeon.
-Of course, we do.

547
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,506
-Who knows? Maybe you don't.
-Su-min. Ji-yeon.

548
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,676
Did everyone go to bed already?
Where is everyone?

549
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,597
Two of them went there
and some of them went there.

550
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,473
I'll be right back.

551
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,110
Do you have any idea
how nervous I was there?

552
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,404
-When I put the postcard in.
-Seriously?

553
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,156
-Seriously.
-I was nervous too.

554
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,159
I thought we'd be doing this today.

555
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:57,162
-Me too.
-So I was thinking about what to draw.

556
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,873
Your drawing was nice.
I wanted to draw something, but I gave up.

557
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,251
I wanted to draw something
and then write, "Oppa", but I gave up.

558
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,837
-I messed it up.
-It was shocking. "Oppa?"

559
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,923
Why? Oppa?

560
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,092
-I even added a question mark.
-Right.

561
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,220
-Right?
-I knew it was you.

562
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,721
I told you.

563
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,307
I thought you'd have never known.

564
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,978
Have you made up your mind?
Or are you not sure?

565
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,063
-Me?
-Yes.

566
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,066
-Do you want my honest answer?
-You can be honest.

567
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,318
-I've made up my mind already.
-I see.

568
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,738
-What about you?
-What if three new guys show up?

569
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,865
-Three?
-Yes.

570
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,492
-No way.
-And they're your ideal type?

571
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,536
-That's impossible.
-Okay.

572
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,579
And I have you.

573
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,250
My eyes are fixed on you.

574
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,294
-My eyes are fixed on you too.
-I saw you sit next to Si-hun.

575
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,254
Right.

576
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,558
What? He shouldn't be sleeping right now.

577
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,102
Si-hun, you don't have time for that.

578
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,603
-He must be tired.
-Wake up, Si-hun.

579
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,814
Well, it's not like
he can butt in there either.

580
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,442
-When did you come out?
-I was about to go to bed.

581
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,402
I see.

582
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,529
Did you want to talk to me?

583
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,739
-You must be tired.
-Yes, I am.

584
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,366
You look tired.

585
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,952
-I've been tired since yesterday.
-I can see that.

586
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:24,582
I know we're supposed
to follow our hearts, but…

587
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,042
I am following my heart.

588
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:31,589
I know you're just following your heart,
but I feel like you're playing with me.

589
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,507
Is that so?

590
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:36,803
Since we went to the hotel,

591
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:40,557
-Yes.
-I don't really feel like we got closer

592
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,268
or that you're really into me.

593
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,227
I see.

594
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,063
I feel like
we've rather grown distant since.

595
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,565
-Is that so?
-Yes.

596
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,359
Actually, I'm not sure
what you're feeling.

597
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,319
-You're not sure?
-No.

598
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,363
I'm not even sure
if you're interested in me at all.

599
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,364
I see.

600
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,908
-I don't know--
-When we were on Paradise…

601
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,995
When we were in the hotel,
didn't I make it clear?

602
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,621
You did.

603
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:09,919
But have you ever made
any moves here on Inferno?

604
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:10,962
You haven't.

605
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,882
Not even a small move.

606
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:19,346
You could've sat next to me
when you visited our lodging,

607
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,472
for example.

608
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:25,560
It may sound childish
but think about if you ever

609
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,855
showed me any small gestures like that. I…

610
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,692
So it bothered you that I didn't show
small gestures like that.

611
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,236
-Of course.
-I see.

612
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,533
At the second voting session,

613
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,746
-Yes.
-I thought you'd stay on this island,

614
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,583
so I voted for someone
whom I thought would never vote for me.

615
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,834
I did the same.

616
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,629
When we were at the Ice Cafe before,

617
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,632
you said you were
interested in Ji-yeon too,

618
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,719
-and that's why you voted for her.
-Right.

619
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,223
You're saying you voted for her
because you wanted to stay here with me,

620
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,558
-but to be honest, it's hard to believe.
-I see.

621
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,062
What kind of answer is that?

622
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,064
-What about my answer? I'm listening.
-You're…

623
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,108
You're supposed to say
whether I'm right or wrong.

624
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,526
What do you mean by, "I see"?

625
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,445
So was I right? Or was I wrong?

626
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,155
Give me a clear answer.

627
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:24,035
Well, I voted for the person
whom I wanted to get to know after you.

628
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:24,994
Okay.

629
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,288
Then why did you say

630
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,750
that you wanted to stay here too?

631
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,711
I thought I was going to stay.

632
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,256
I see. You voted for
a person you were interested in but…

633
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,759
-But I thought I would stay behind.
-You thought you would stay.

634
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,053
I see. That makes sense.

635
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,684
Everyone thinks differently, so…

636
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,227
But…

637
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,105
I must say,
this gives me a lot to think about.

638
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,648
-Okay.
-Yes.

639
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,485
I think I got to know you better.

640
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,654
What about me did you get to know?

641
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,157
I'd rather not say.

642
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,324
I see.

643
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,624
It'd be great to be
in Paradise on our last night.

644
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,876
Right.

645
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,295
-I had this thought.
-What thought?

646
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,922
-You went to Paradise with Si-hun.
-Yes.

647
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,633
Well, I got jealous and all, for sure.

648
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,804
But you're free to do
whatever you want to do.

649
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,681
We're staying here for a long time,

650
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,518
-and you can't hang out only with me.
-I was really torn when I heard

651
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,145
that I wasn't allowed to vote for you.

652
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,481
I was so torn until the last moment.

653
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,983
-Really?
-Yes.

654
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,572
Well done.

655
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,908
-I'm glad we talked today.
-Me too.

656
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,036
I'm looking forward to it.

657
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,329
Why?

658
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,747
No reason.

659
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,332
-Looking forward to what?
-What?

660
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,374
Looking forward to what?

661
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,668
All the fun we'll have together.

662
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,549
-Hold my hand.
-I'm not sleepy.

663
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,642
-They're all lovey-dovey.
-They're lovey-dovey indeed.

664
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,061
-Where is Si-hun? Is he sleeping?
-Oh, my goodness.

665
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,687
-Si-hun is sleeping.
-Gosh. He's asleep.

666
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,814
Is he sleeping right now?

667
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,816
Si-hun made
an official announcement earlier.

668
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,733
-Right.
-Right.

669
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,985
He said he made up his mind.
He said he's done.

670
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,363
He said he's only going for one person.

671
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,366
He said that before everyone, but Ji-a is

672
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,868
more interested in Hyeon-joong.

673
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,162
Remember the gesture Si-hun made?

674
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,956
I think he got what she meant.

675
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,582
-I think so too.
-That must be it.

676
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,292
He kind of seemed dispirited.

677
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,418
That must be why.

678
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,004
Otherwise, he can't be sleeping like that.

679
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,090
I think that's the best
he can do at the moment.

680
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,299
Sleeping?

681
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,217
Because…

682
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,719
-Don't you think you're being too mean?
-Wait. Let me explain.

683
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,054
Sleeping is the best he can do?

684
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,098
-How could you say that?
-Hanhae's ears turned red.

685
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,767
He can't just go there and say,
"I'd like to hold your hand too."

686
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,478
Should he do that?

687
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,939
-There's nothing he can do.
-"Why can't I hold your hand?"

688
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,774
"I can hold your hand too."

689
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,110
That's the best he can do.

690
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,445
Let's talk about So-yeon
and Jin-taek's conversation.

691
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,198
-It didn't end on a high note.
-Right.

692
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,410
I think it would've gone better
if he was honest with her

693
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,452
in the first place.

694
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,621
Because it's okay
to be interested in someone else.

695
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,914
-Right.
-That's right.

696
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,666
It's okay to be interested in two people.

697
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,710
He could have said this
in the first place.

698
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,503
"I was interested in you at first,

699
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,172
but after talking to Ji-yeon,
I came to think she's quite nice too."

700
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,632
-"I'm a bit confused now."
-Right.

701
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,217
"I'm a bit swayed."

702
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,887
If he had said this from the beginning,
So-yeon would've understood.

703
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,014
-But he was…
-That would've been so much better.

704
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,641
What we can tell now for sure

705
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,562
is that Se-hoon and Ji-yeon
will never be a couple.

706
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,023
-It's never going to happen.
-Right.

707
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,066
Ji-yeon is sure about her feelings.

708
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,192
Right.

709
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,866
-Will there be apples?
-Yes.

710
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,451
I wish there were bananas.

711
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:52,994
Bananas!

712
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:53,912
Do we have bananas?

713
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,038
Banana.

714
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,915
-Let me take one.
-Nice.

715
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,710
Do you want me to peel the apples?
It's better to eat the skin too though.

716
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,177
-Did you work out in the morning?
-Yes.

717
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,219
-I saw.
-I worked out.

718
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,972
I woke up really early,
so I didn't expect to see anyone.

719
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,434
I woke up quite early on my own today.

720
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,028
-Oh, no. They're together.
-So-yeon just gave them a dirty look.

721
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,696
-Right. I saw it.
-She must be upset.

722
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,032
-She must feel really uncomfortable.
-Right.

723
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,283
Oh, we have bananas.

724
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,078
It looks delicious.

725
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,455
-We have bananas today.
-Bananas.

726
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,713
You need a spoon.

727
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,173
-What?
-A spoon.

728
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,133
-Do you want me to get you one?
-No, I'm good.

729
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,106
I wonder what we're doing today.

730
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,693
I can't wait to see
what's going to happen today.

731
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,695
-Right?
-I can't wait either.

732
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,780
-Seriously.
-Is there anything you want to do?

733
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,157
I want to go see the water.

734
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,576
-Do you like water?
-How about we go in the water later?

735
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,079
-Do you like to play in the water?
-There's water, so…

736
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,330
-Splashing water?
-Yes.

737
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,499
-I see.
-You can go there for a walk later.

738
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,920
-That was a great meal.
-That was a great meal.

739
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,008
-Did you enjoy the food?
-I did.

740
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,468
-Good.
-I'm so full.

741
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,553
-Right?
-Yes.

742
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,558
I'm completely lost right now.

743
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,561
I have no idea whom I should choose.

744
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,439
It's like Jin-taek and Se-hoon are

745
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,024
building a friendship now.

746
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,570
You know, guys can be loyal
to each other too, like you and me.

747
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,780
-You know what I mean.
-Right.

748
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,532
I'm confused.

749
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,076
Why did it have to be those two, right?

750
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,202
I know.

751
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,291
Ji-a.

752
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,835
I want you to come out here later.

753
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,128
I'm going back to the room now.

754
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,629
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

755
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,673
-What are you going to do?
-What?

756
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,842
-What are you going to do?
-I'll go get some water.

757
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,802
-Oh, I see.
-Yes.

758
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,471
It's too far away.

759
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,513
It is.

760
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,349
And it'll be really hot right now.

761
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,434
Do you want to rest then?

762
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,518
Do we have to go now?

763
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,688
-It's too hot right now.
-Okay.

764
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,235
I wanted to spend more time with Ji-a,

765
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,321
doing this and that.

766
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:38,534
My feelings for her haven't changed.
I still like her.

767
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:43,289
Am I upset? I'm not sure yet.

768
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,124
It's just…

769
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,544
I'm just having a hard time mentally.

770
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,966
Oh, my gosh.

771
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,887
It's really nice out here.

772
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,806
-It's nice, isn't it?
-Yes.

773
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,973
My gosh.

774
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,393
-I really love the ocean.
-I see.

775
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,812
I really love it.

776
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,273
-You seem very optimistic.
-I do?

777
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,274
-You think?
-Yes.

778
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,610
-You seem to be an optimistic person.
-Why?

779
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,195
You're just so bright.

780
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,907
-It's a compliment.
-I know. I get that a lot.

781
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,744
We're almost there.

782
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,871
-Is this the place?
-Yes.

783
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,956
Oh, this is the place?

784
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,833
-Do you see it?
-Yes.

785
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,376
Can you open it?

786
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,464
-That's so little.
-I know.

787
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,301
It's not easy, right?
Look at me all sweaty.

788
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,514
-Are you hot?
-Yes.

789
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,099
-Would you like to wash your face?
-No.

790
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,434
Are you okay?

791
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,981
Here. Hang on.
Could you put it on this thing?

792
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:54,861
Are you okay?

793
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,279
Of course. Shall we?

794
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,196
Okay.

795
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,741
It's okay. Let me carry it.

796
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,743
-Be careful not to hit it.
-Okay.

797
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,330
This is really cool.

798
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,876
-They kind of look cute together.
-They do.

799
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,878
Su-min is such a bubbly girl.

800
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,421
She has positive vibes.

801
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,256
Wait, this means Se-hoon is…

802
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,675
No, don't be like that.

803
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,093
Seriously.

804
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,428
I mean, look what's happening.

805
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,387
No.

806
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,347
That's not happening. No way.

807
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,057
Gosh, I'm getting teary-eyed.

808
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,269
Si-hun asked Ji-a to join him,

809
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,146
but she gave him the cold shoulder.

810
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,149
-But Su-min gladly joined him.
-Right.

811
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,985
He might have developed
some feelings for her then.

812
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,445
I mean, as he said earlier,

813
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,947
she's very close to Si-hun's ideal type,

814
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,115
-appearance-wise.
-Right.

815
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,159
Now, Se-hoon is…

816
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:47,830
So-yeon said before that she was

817
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,458
-interested in Se-hoon.
-Right.

818
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,002
And that she was now considering others.

819
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,213
-Right
-And if she and Si-hun become a couple…

820
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:59,425
Things are starting to get twisted.
This place might literally become hell.

821
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,885
They can't leave the island either.

822
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,638
I'm afraid Se-hoon might

823
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,431
never get to go to Paradise.

824
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,808
Don't say that. Be careful
what you say. It might come true.

825
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,185
-Okay.
-Seriously, don't say that.

826
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,853
-I take it back.
-Seriously, take it back.

827
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,980
I want to know what he does for a living.

828
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,983
Hyeon-joong.

829
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,361
Would you like to go for a walk with me?

830
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,238
I'd like to talk with you.

831
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,198
-Cafeteria?
-Okay.

832
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,535
Se-hoon wrote to me
at our first voting session.

833
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,453
-He did?
-At first.

834
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,207
What do you think I should do?

835
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,124
Se-hoon?

836
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,084
-No, I mean…
-You?

837
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,001
Yes.

838
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,630
So you're torn
between Se-hoon and Jin-taek?

839
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,798
Yes.

840
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,799
I see.

841
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,594
Who do you think is more sincere?

842
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,182
I think I get what your problem is.

843
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,978
Jin-taek doesn't like to say
things that might hurt others.

844
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,187
That's just his personality.

845
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,314
Well, here's what I think.

846
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,194
Jin-taek went to Paradise
with Ji-yeon, right?

847
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,905
And I was really shocked by that.

848
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,532
-It was shocking for all of us.
-Right.

849
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,285
But I have no idea…

850
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,664
when they could have
possibly been bonding.

851
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:16,043
I'll be honest with you.
He had to choose someone

852
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,462
other than you. That was the rule.

853
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,089
-That's why he chose her.
-I know that.

854
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,133
-That's what happened.
-I know that.

855
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,469
But ever since he went
to Paradise with her,

856
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,640
he started to act differently
from what he initially told me.

857
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,602
For example, he said
he chose Ji-yeon because she was the one

858
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,730
whom he was second most interested in.

859
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,232
But before that,
when we went to the hotel together,

860
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,026
he said he wasn't
interested in anyone else.

861
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,110
I see.

862
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,280
And what's shocking to me
is that he's interested

863
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,615
in someone besides me.

864
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,953
Well, we're supposed
to communicate with different people here.

865
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,708
And Jin-taek did
what he was supposed to do.

866
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,086
I think Jin-taek is all right.

867
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,006
-From what I've…
-What about Se-hoon?

868
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,090
-What?
-Se-hoon.

869
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,176
They're both great
but so different from each other.

870
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,805
-They're totally different.
-Right. They're totally different.

871
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,224
I had no idea
Se-hoon was interested in me.

872
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,810
I was so shocked yesterday.

873
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,312
Seriously, I was stunned.

874
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:21,442
I think you should talk to Se-hoon first.

875
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,903
I'd see what Se-hoon does

876
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,029
and then make a decision

877
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,865
if I were in your position.

878
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,158
Do you want me to call him out?

879
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,410
It's cool out here. Talk here.

880
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,621
Okay.

881
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,872
Wait here.

882
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,041
I'm a little scared.

883
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,793
I'll call him. Wait here.

884
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,342
This is really nice.

885
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:50,971
Se-hoon.

886
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,849
Me?

887
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,602
Am I being interviewed?

888
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,646
-What?
-What is it?

889
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,064
So-yeon wants to talk to you.

890
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,232
-Who?
-So-yeon.

891
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,650
-So-yeon?
-She's at the cafeteria.

892
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,318
-Cafeteria?
-Yes.

893
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,379
What were you doing here?

894
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,506
I was talking with Hyeon-joong.

895
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,716
-With Hyeon-joong?
-Yes.

896
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,973
Did you give it some thought last night?

897
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,267
Well…

898
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,397
I mean, if you're like,
"It's Ji-yeon or no one."

899
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,108
Whatever happens,
"I won't regret my choice,"

900
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,235
that's really cool.

901
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,570
No, I'm not like that.

902
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,906
But Ji-yeon keeps rejecting you.

903
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,159
But you keep trying.

904
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,620
And I think you might be
making her feel uncomfortable.

905
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,623
I actually hate doing this to others.

906
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,877
Is there anything
you want to know about me?

907
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,088
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say this,

908
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,008
but I chose you on the first day.
"The best fried rice ever." That was me.

909
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,845
Maybe I'm not allowed to say this

910
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,680
but it was me who wrote that.

911
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,183
I feel like I'm looking at you

912
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,643
the way you're looking at Ji-yeon.

913
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,736
What do you want to know? How I feel?

914
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,863
-What I think?
-Yes.

915
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,243
-Okay. I'll tell you what I think first.
-Okay.

916
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,998
-I was really shocked yesterday.
-I can imagine.

917
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,501
-I mean…
-I was shocked myself.

918
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,337
-Why?
-My plan was just to give you my advice.

919
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,632
-Okay.
-But then you told me all of that.

920
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:53,219
I didn't know that you wrote to me
on the first day until yesterday.

921
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,055
Then things started to make sense.

922
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,308
Actually, that's…

923
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,687
-That didn't really mean anything.
-Okay.

924
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,148
I wasn't trying to tell you anything.
I was just informing you

925
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,691
that that's what happened.

926
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,362
Anyway, let me tell you how I feel,
which is the most important.

927
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,701
When you gave me the advice,

928
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,580
which I'm not sure if it was, I…

929
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,500
Well…

930
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,094
To be honest, I almost cried.

931
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,053
Why?

932
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,596
Because it really hurt my pride.

933
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,682
What I said about Ji-yeon?

934
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,641
Yes.

935
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:49,525
I actually don't even want
to think about it again.

936
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,990
"She's not interested in you."
"Se-hoon, snap out of it."

937
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,158
"You're being stupid now."
"Don't be stupid."

938
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,494
That's exactly how it sounded to me.

939
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,539
That's exactly how I felt.

940
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,499
But I couldn't understand…

941
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,546
why I had to hear that…

942
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,759
from someone else.

943
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,177
I see.

944
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,269
It made me feel miserable.

945
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,812
It really hurt my pride.

946
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,731
-Really? I'm sorry.
-Yes. I felt…

947
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,024
That's not what I meant.

948
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,484
I know. But that's how I felt.

949
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,403
And it hurt me a lot.

950
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,113
And…

951
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,995
I was just worried about you.

952
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:46,707
Because I saw you were hurt

953
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,711
while we were spending
time together here in Inferno.

954
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:55,382
-Right.
-And when I saw you being hurt again, I…

955
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,094
-You felt bad for me.
-I wouldn't say I felt bad for you.

956
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,222
I think it was easier for me to spot it

957
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:06,435
-because I was interested in you.
-I see.

958
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:11,023
And I saw what's going on
between Jin-taek and Ji-yeon.

959
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,775
After seeing that,

960
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:17,404
I came to think
I don't know Jin-taek anymore.

961
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,907
So I told you how I was feeling about you.

962
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,492
But…

963
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:25,621
-I'd like to comment on that too.
-Okay.

964
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,794
That's actually
what offended me even more.

965
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,462
Okay.

966
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:38,008
When you told me
about how you felt about me,

967
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:43,305
I wish you had started the conversation

968
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,808
with some small talk,

969
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:50,312
like, "Don't you want to get to know me?"

970
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,732
or "I want to talk to you"

971
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,193
before giving me the advice
about Ji-yeon and Jin-taek

972
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,821
so we could get to know each other.

973
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,031
To be perfectly honest,

974
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,492
I thought,

975
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,120
"She's doing this because

976
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,997
-Jin-taek went to Paradise with Ji-yeon."
-Because I was upset about him?

977
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,374
Yes.

978
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,462
You sounded too aggressive.

979
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,590
"Will you move on from Ji-yeon?"

980
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,051
-"Are you ready to move on?"
-Well, here's what I thought.

981
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,930
I thought I should mention
that I liked you first

982
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,933
so I don't hurt your feelings.

983
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,393
-No, that's…
-I mean…

984
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,812
That's a different matter. That's not…

985
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,649
-It's just…
-I mean, you seemed so depressed to me.

986
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,568
You were like,

987
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:41,447
"Oh, well. I'm doomed."

988
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,116
That's how you looked to me, so I…

989
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,452
But you didn't need
to talk to me like that.

990
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,412
-I said that
-I…

991
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,956
because I was interested in you.

992
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,459
-If you're not interested in me,
-Yes?

993
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,878
you can just say so.

994
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:57,463
Okay?

995
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,843
I started talking to you
because I wanted to tell you one thing.

996
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,262
Then one thing led to another,
and we ended up here.

997
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,349
It seems like we got lost
since I started to talk about my feelings.

998
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,112
Participants, please come to the campfire.

999
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,158
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

1000
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,540
-Oh, no.
-What just happened?

1001
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,625
Oh, no.

1002
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,835
I can't help but sigh.

1003
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,379
Actually, we also talked about this

1004
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:43,926
when So-yeon confessed
her feelings for Se-hoon before,

1005
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,929
saying that she could've
found a better time to say it.

1006
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,722
-Right. We did.
-In the last episode, right?

1007
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:49,806
Yes, we talked about it.

1008
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,392
And it turned out
that timing wasn't the only problem.

1009
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,561
Her telling him
that Ji-yeon wasn't interested

1010
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,064
and that he shouldn't act like that

1011
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,942
seems to have hurt his pride and heart.

1012
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,529
As you know, we're only
observing them from the outside.

1013
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,114
And Se-hoon is the only one

1014
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,825
who hasn't been to Paradise.

1015
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,995
I got the feeling that he might be
way more hurt than we thought.

1016
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,956
-Right.
-It just crossed my mind.

1017
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,626
Still, I think So-yeon is the one

1018
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,420
who takes care of Se-hoon the most.

1019
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,131
She must've talked like that

1020
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,843
because she thought
they had become good friends.

1021
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:30,597
He didn't need to be so mean to her.
He was so cold to her.

1022
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,016
So-yeon seemed really upset.

1023
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,437
I think, though they ended up
getting a little emotional,

1024
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,857
it was right to open up like this. I mean…

1025
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,528
If they didn't have this conversation,
this misunderstanding would've remained.

1026
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,031
Right. And I think they are
very different people, to begin with.

1027
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:52,411
That became clear
through the conversation.

1028
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:55,205
I think they realized
that they can never get along.

1029
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,791
That's the conclusion.

1030
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,085
Watching that made me feel bad.

1031
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,336
Yes, I feel bad too.

1032
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,254
She must be so upset.

1033
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,923
-I understand Se-hoon though.
-Me too.

1034
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,146
Sit here, Su-min.

1035
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,365
Do we have a newcomer?

1036
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,908
Maybe it's another male participant.

1037
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,082
Hey, look.

1038
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,126
-Why? What is it?
-What?

1039
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,505
All right. Shake it up.

1040
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,841
Nice.

1041
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,095
-What?
-A new female participant?

1042
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,305
What?

1043
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:55,891
I didn't see this coming.

1044
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:01,855
This is crazy.

1045
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,526
She looks pretty.

1046
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,694
-She does.
-Right?

1047
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,743
Her skin is so fair.

1048
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,748
-Hello.
-Hello.

1049
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:20,916
-Hello.
-Hello.

1050
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,001
Welcome.

1051
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,169
Hello.

1052
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,128
Hello.

1053
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,714
Hello.

1054
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,680
-Please have a seat.
-Please have a seat.

1055
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,901
Hello, my name is Seong Min-ji.

1056
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,320
Many people say

1057
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,281
that I look cold and hard to approach,

1058
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:57,285
but once they get to know me,
they say I'm very friendly and playful,

1059
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,330
which surprises them.

1060
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:04,376
Appearance-wise, I'm attracted
to men who have pretty noses.

1061
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:10,048
I'd like to be with someone
who has similar hobbies or tastes with me.

1062
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,718
I'm really competitive.

1063
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:16,346
I'm the kind of person who never gives up.

1064
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,475
I will get the man I want.

1065
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,020
Oh, my. This is getting interesting.

1066
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,605
She says she'll get the man she wants.

1067
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,399
Nice to meet you.

1068
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,567
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

1069
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,526
Hello.

1070
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,111
Welcome to the deserted island.

1071
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,154
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

1072
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,238
Welcome.

1073
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,367
-Are they the same?
-Their tops are the same.

1074
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,077
Maybe they should sit together.

1075
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,371
-You two are like a couple.
-They're wearing the same top.

1076
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,373
They're wearing the same top.

1077
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,833
She's right.

1078
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,792
What?

1079
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,835
You're right.

1080
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,503
-Are you friends?
-How is this possible?

1081
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,588
No, we're not.

1082
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,381
-What are the odds?
-This is so interesting.

1083
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,549
They're of one mind.

1084
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,925
They must have similar tastes.

1085
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,093
You might be right.

1086
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,060
-Someone's coming.
-Again?

1087
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,604
-There's another one?
-Another one?

1088
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,980
-It's a man.
-It's a man.

1089
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,815
-Who is it?
-It's a man.

1090
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,378
He looks charming.

1091
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,089
He looks cool.

1092
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,132
He looks cool.

1093
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,219
He has such broad shoulders.

1094
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,268
Oh, my gosh. He's good-looking.

1095
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,187
-He is.
-He's too good-looking.

1096
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,534
Hello, my name is Cha Hyun-seung.

1097
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,328
I think I have a well-proportioned body.

1098
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,414
I have a well-proportioned body.

1099
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,043
Sometimes people tell me

1100
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:14,089
that I have a charming smile.

1101
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:20,262
I work out almost six days a week.

1102
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,807
I love water sports

1103
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,518
like freediving or wakesurfing.

1104
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,148
-You're leaning forward too much.
-Okay.

1105
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:39,948
I'm attracted to women
who are cheerful, funny, positive

1106
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,283
and have beautiful smiles.

1107
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,372
Wait.

1108
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,207
-Do you know him?
-Do you know him?

1109
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,711
No way.

1110
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,922
-I worked out with him last week.
-Really?

1111
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,966
-He knows him.
-He knows him?

1112
00:52:58,967 --> 00:52:59,885
My gosh.

1113
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,344
-Hello.
-Hello.

1114
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,512
Hello.

1115
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,556
He looks fit too.

1116
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,143
Nice to meet you.

1117
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,644
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

1118
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,896
-Hello.
-What's going on?

1119
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,230
-Hello.
-What's going on?

1120
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,815
-Do you know him?
-Yes.

1121
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,275
Does Ji-a know him too?

1122
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,486
Seriously, what is going on?

1123
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:26,161
-Please have a seat.
-We worked out together last week.

1124
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,079
-Really? That's amazing.
-Awesome.

1125
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,751
One of my acquaintances said
we might make good business partners,

1126
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:37,672
so we almost worked together,
but we couldn't because of our schedules.

1127
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,049
Then we met here.

1128
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,344
We knew each other,
but we have never met each other.

1129
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,720
So it's my first time seeing him.

1130
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,681
We're very close friends.

1131
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,308
We work out together all the time.

1132
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,602
I thought I mistook him for someone else.

1133
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,146
I couldn't believe it was him.

1134
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,231
I was really surprised.

1135
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,608
I had no idea I'd see him here.

1136
00:53:58,443 --> 00:53:59,486
Well, this is awkward.

1137
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,656
-I can't believe this.
-What a coincidence.

1138
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,075
This is unfair to me.

1139
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,500
To welcome today's newcomers,

1140
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,753
we've prepared
a romantic yacht date for you.

1141
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:17,712
That sounds awesome.

1142
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:23,009
The newcomers,
Hyun-seung, Su-min, and Min-ji,

1143
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,721
will choose the person they want to get
to know better and go on a date with.

1144
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,223
-Right now?
-My gosh.

1145
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,391
Right now?

1146
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:34,646
Female participants get to choose first,
and whoever is ready can start.

1147
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,856
-Okay.
-I see.

1148
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,024
They get to choose first.

1149
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,530
Could you guys maybe
take off your sunglasses?

1150
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,615
Right. To see our faces.

1151
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,701
Right. To see our faces.

1152
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:48,952
Of course.

1153
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,122
-She's amazing.
-She needs to see their faces.

1154
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,249
-Of course, she does.
-She's so charming.

1155
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,378
-Right. To see our faces.
-She wants to see our faces.

1156
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,594
I choose…

1157
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,638
-Me? Okay.
-Yes.

1158
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,223
-Me? Okay.
-Yes.

1159
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,976
-What? Really?
-Se-hoon!

1160
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,144
Se-hoon.

1161
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,311
Se-hoon.

1162
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,774
-Me? Okay.
-Yes.

1163
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,902
Moon Se-hoon.

1164
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:34,789
If Min-ji hadn't chosen Se-hoon,

1165
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:39,002
I might have chosen him.

1166
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,048
I choose…

1167
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,141
Jun-sik.

1168
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,727
Am I older than her?

1169
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,064
-What?
-What?

1170
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,151
Jun-sik was Yea-won's match.

1171
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,782
She doesn't feel so good.

1172
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,202
I choose…

1173
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,162
I choose…

1174
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,248
I wonder who he'll pick.

1175
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,461
I choose…

1176
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,431
I choose…

1177
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,517
Ji-a.

1178
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,061
Oh, my gosh!

1179
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:40,730
No.

1180
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,731
I choose…

1181
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:43,817
Ji-a.

1182
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,528
Ji-a.

1183
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,115
This is so cruel.

1184
