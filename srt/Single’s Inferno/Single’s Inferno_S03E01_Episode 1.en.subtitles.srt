1
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,103
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,567
Please work.

3
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,739
A true inferno will be unleashed here.

4
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,533
An inferno more brutal…

5
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,411
-This really is like hell.
-It is.

6
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,412
What do we do now?

7
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,125
…more intense…

8
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,918
That's really cruel.

9
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,462
I can't watch this.

10
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,505
They were really going at it.

11
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,841
…and more ruthless than ever.

12
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,050
-It's too late.
-Why?

13
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,802
Love is all about timing.

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,472
Keep hitting on me,
and maybe I'll dream about you.

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,600
-Hey.
-What?

16
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,976
Do better.

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,479
That was rude.

18
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,938
Who do they think they are?

19
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,483
Remember, you have to
chase after love to get it.

20
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,569
I really hate this.

21
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,366
This fiercely competitive place
is located on a remote island.

22
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,118
We call it Inferno.

23
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,666
Participants who find their match
can make their escape to Paradise.

24
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,215
A hotter place…

25
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,717
You have a great body.

26
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,844
You're irresistible.

27
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,347
A more captivating place…

28
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,973
I love you.

29
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,559
Your heart is racing, isn't it?

30
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,353
A more honest place than any other.

31
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,687
Why did you choose me?

32
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,606
Because you were my type.

33
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,191
Why do you keep smiling at me?

34
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,567
-Because you're pretty.
-I am?

35
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,568
Yes.

36
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,821
The person I want to be with the most

37
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,905
is you.

38
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,700
You made the biggest impression on me,

39
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,494
and I like you the most.

40
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,665
In a fierce competition

41
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,086
taking place at the crossroads
of Inferno and Paradise…

42
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,674
singles wage war with
desire and decision.

43
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:16,970
What's with him?

44
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,265
He's not ready to commit
but still wants to keep her around.

45
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,808
I'm a little angry now.

46
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,810
You're going to come back to me.

47
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,562
My head is about to explode.

48
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,814
Me? What you see is what you get.

49
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,440
She's a conniving little fox.

50
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,025
Am I cheating on her?

51
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,736
How does it feel to be a cheater?

52
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,822
From now on, this is war.

53
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,950
This is the hottest Inferno in the world.

54
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,077
Single's Inferno.

55
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,871
SINGLE'S INFERNO

56
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,455
That was amazing.

57
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,374
This season will be the best yet.

58
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,168
HANHAE, KIM JIN-YOUNG, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

59
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,044
Everyone seems brutally honest.

60
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,629
Right? I think so too.

61
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,797
-Yes.
-Totally.

62
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,632
-By the way, Jin-young.
-Yes?

63
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,801
You were a participant last season.

64
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,095
-We watched you on-screen.
-This feels so different.

65
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,597
It's like a totally different show.

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,016
How does it feel to be
in the audience now?

67
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,518
I think he was in shock the whole time.

68
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,646
It made the hair
on the back of my neck stand up.

69
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,482
It brought back some memories

70
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,778
and some emotions,
but I felt excited overall.

71
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,780
-I see.
-My heart was pounding.

72
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,074
Inferno looks a bit different.

73
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,119
Right. It's like an upgraded version
compared to before.

74
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,746
There are so many bugs now.

75
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,955
Why are there so many?

76
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,290
It's not what I expected.

77
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,793
-Inferno has to provide basic necessities,
-True.

78
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,046
-but it's just the bare minimum now.
-Right.

79
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,965
So I bet that made Paradise
feel a lot more special.

80
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:43,056
INFERNO

81
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,437
Hello.

82
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,439
My name is Kim Gyu-ri.

83
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,566
I decided to join Single's Inferno

84
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:42,156
in the hopes of meeting someone
who can get my heart racing.

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,200
I think of myself

86
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,454
as a bright person who likes to laugh.

87
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,874
But I tend to be cautious
when approaching new people,

88
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,920
so people think I'm cold and distant,
or shy, when they first meet me.

89
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,300
The type of person I'd like to meet
on Single's Inferno

90
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,886
is someone who makes me smile
every time I look at him.

91
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,994
My name is Choi Hye-seon.

92
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,122
I have a very bright
and outgoing personality,

93
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,958
so I've been told
that I'm like a ball of sunshine.

94
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,669
I've also been told that I'm goofy.

95
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,590
I definitely think that I have a nice body
and good proportions.

96
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,468
I really like men who are masculine.

97
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,847
I do weight training five times a week.

98
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,227
I've had a lot of guys
ask for my number at the gym.

99
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,814
Everywhere I go, it seems like
there's always someone interested in me.

100
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,193
My plan is to come back

101
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,945
with all my love hormones
kicked into gear.

102
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,824
Hello.

103
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,750
She's so pretty.

104
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,339
When someone calls you pretty,

105
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,633
-you normally say, "You too."
-"You too."

106
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,885
-But she just took the compliment.
-Jin-kyung…

107
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,553
-You're right.
-She didn't respond.

108
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,514
She's probably used to hearing that.

109
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,851
She's so pretty.

110
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,355
I saw Gyu-ri sitting there

111
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,649
and thought she was gorgeous.

112
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,609
She looked like a doll.

113
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,904
I just thought she was really pretty.

114
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,003
Hello.

115
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,588
Hello.

116
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,883
-Hello.
-Hello.

117
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,603
My name is Choi Min-woo.

118
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,024
I think I'm more into older women.

119
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,695
I like women
who seem innocent and elegant.

120
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:30,616
I also tend to like women
who are bright and cheerful.

121
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,120
I think one of my more attractive features

122
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,955
is my physique,

123
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,874
like my height and shoulders.

124
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:42,170
I've been told that I have a nice physique
ever since I was young.

125
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:47,175
If I happen to meet
my dream girl on Single's Inferno,

126
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,719
I'll do my best to win her over.

127
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,364
-Hello.
-Hello.

128
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,741
Hello.

129
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,842
Hello, my name is Lee Jin-seok.

130
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,637
I work out diligently
and take good care of myself,

131
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,430
so I'm confident about my body.

132
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,724
My chest is pretty well-developed,

133
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,893
so that's the part of my body
I'm proudest of.

134
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,688
He has the best body
out of all the participants we've seen.

135
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,732
Yes, he looks like a personal trainer.

136
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:49,278
I do weight training
every day of the week,

137
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,197
so I'm confident in my physical strength.

138
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,534
A lot of people have told me

139
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,829
that I look intimidating and indifferent.

140
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,583
But they also seem
to find it cute when I smile

141
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,127
because it catches them off guard.

142
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,603
My name is An Min-young.

143
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,607
I came here to meet a guy
who'll make my heart race.

144
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:30,403
I'm a bright and bubbly person,

145
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,406
and people around me say that I'm sweet.

146
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,367
I'm confident that I can use my charm

147
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,121
to win over anyone I'm interested in.

148
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,543
Hello.

149
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,253
Hello.

150
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,130
Hello.

151
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,684
-May I ask your name?
-I'm An Min-young.

152
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,445
Going off of first impressions,

153
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,905
I'd say Gyu-ri comes in first, then me,

154
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,116
and then Min-young.

155
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,132
My name is Lee Gwan-hee.

156
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,385
I tend to go all in
when it comes to work and relationships,

157
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,472
so I think the word "passionate"
best describes me.

158
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,224
Hold on. This guy is already famous.

159
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,476
-What?
-Really?

160
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,645
-Yes, he's pretty amazing.
-Seriously?

161
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,521
-Yes.
-Now I'm curious.

162
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,233
You can't be on this show
if you're not popular, right?

163
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,570
I'm confident that I can get the ladies
to approach me first.

164
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,657
What makes me attractive

165
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,201
is that I'm Lee Gwan-hee.

166
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,827
I think that sums it up.

167
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,287
I don't have any goals,

168
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:08,376
but I can promise that this season
will be much better than the previous two.

169
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,752
Thanks to me, of course.

170
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,963
He'll see to it.

171
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,465
Is he on the production team?

172
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,300
He's thinking like a producer.

173
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,677
-He's a bit much.
-Oh, dear.

174
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,721
-Jin-young seems bothered.
-Totally.

175
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,599
But it doesn't feel like
his confidence is baseless.

176
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,309
He seems to have good reason for it,

177
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,228
-so I can't say anything.
-Exciting.

178
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,188
-Let's sit back and watch.
-Okay.

179
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,317
Hello.

180
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,152
-Hello.
-Hello.

181
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,542
I'll go with him for now.

182
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,544
-Lee Gwan-hee?
-Yes.

183
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,087
But you don't get a say.

184
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:54,922
Just leave me be.

185
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,471
Greetings, singles.

186
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,182
Welcome to the hottest inferno
in the world,

187
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,893
-Single's Inferno.
-I guess it's just six people.

188
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,312
-That's it?
-What?

189
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,230
There are only six.

190
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,731
-Look at the chairs.
-Really?

191
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,569
-Single's Inferno.
-I guess it's just six people.

192
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,280
I feel like

193
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,574
I won't get to meet
as many guys as I had expected.

194
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,786
I was a little disappointed.

195
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:30,416
I think I'm the best catch
out of all the female participants.

196
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,543
One of them is quite bubbly,

197
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,670
and the other just seems nice.

198
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,882
I don't really feel threatened
by either of them.

199
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:42,094
I saw five participants as I walked in.

200
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,263
That proves I'm the star of the show.

201
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,474
The star always makes their entrance last.

202
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,643
I don't feel any competition.
I know I'll be the most popular.

203
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,895
That's just a given.

204
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,980
What's wrong with him?

205
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,190
Jeez, Gwan-hee…

206
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,733
I told you he was a bit much.

207
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,528
I didn't expect myself
to judge him like that so quickly.

208
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,033
-I normally hold it in until I can't.
-It only took a minute.

209
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,620
-But we need people like him.
-Everyone has such strong personalities.

210
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,998
The participants this season
are all eager and energetic.

211
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,291
-Right.
-And confident.

212
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,418
I can see Hye-seon being really popular.

213
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,795
-Right.
-I can definitely see that happening.

214
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,048
I agree that Hye-seon will be popular.

215
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,466
-Really?
-It's the way

216
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,051
-she smiles a lot.
-Right.

217
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,221
She seems really approachable.

218
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,139
For the men, I'll go with Min-woo.

219
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,474
There's something about him.

220
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,893
-His physique demands attention.
-Right.

221
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,688
-How about you, Jin-young?
-I think Gyu-ri will be the most popular.

222
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,943
I think she has many charming features
that men find attractive.

223
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,694
Men like yourself?

224
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,820
Well, yes.

225
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,698
You probably feel like
a participant yourself right now.

226
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,326
If I were, it would've taken me
just three seconds

227
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,536
to go for Gyu-ri.

228
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,746
I would've fallen for her.

229
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,831
I agree with everyone.

230
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,626
I think Gyu-ri will be the most popular.

231
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,212
As for the men, I'm thinking Jin-seok.

232
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,880
Really?

233
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,882
I also think it'll be Jin-seok.

234
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,385
He seems so masculine right now,

235
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,554
but wait until he shows his softer side.

236
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,138
-It'll be a nice surprise.
-I think

237
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,807
-it'll be worth waiting for.
-Yes.

238
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,352
I don't know if I should say this,
but I picture Gwan-hee

239
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,312
crying a lot toward the end.

240
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,024
He'll be overconfident at first

241
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,026
-but then embarrass himself.
-In a big way.

242
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,154
I have a feeling
he'll cry a lot after that.

243
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,239
That'd be hilarious.

244
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,199
-He'll sob his eyes out.
-Yeah.

245
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,493
WHO MADE THE BEST FIRST IMPRESSION?

246
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,247
Lee Jin-seok made
the best first impression on me.

247
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,251
I like masculine men with nice bodies.

248
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,045
While he was approaching us,

249
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,256
I noticed that he had a great build.

250
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,758
I found that really attractive.

251
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,845
Based on first impressions,

252
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,681
I think Choi Hye-seon
was the most memorable.

253
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,183
I like women who are sweet
and good-natured,

254
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:57,563
and Choi Hye-seon seemed to be
the sweetest of them all.

255
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,024
The person I was attracted to the most

256
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,026
was Min-woo.

257
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,862
I liked how he smiled while looking at me,

258
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,239
and he seemed as innocent as a puppy.

259
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,660
Jin-seok is really attractive.

260
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,954
He seems to be the most masculine,

261
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,041
but he also intimidates me a little.

262
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,045
He's not very approachable.

263
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:26,091
I think Min-woo made
the best first impression.

264
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,095
He seemed nice and proper.

265
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,806
I think Gyu-ri is my top pick so far.

266
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,184
I like women who are sweet and innocent,

267
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,229
and I think I sat next to her
because that was the vibe I got from her.

268
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,233
I could tell that Hye-seon
had a great personality

269
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,818
in that short amount of time.

270
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,988
So based on that,
I think she made the best impression.

271
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,032
Let's see here.

272
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,327
So that's two votes for Hye-seon, right?

273
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,496
Yes. One from Jin-seok.

274
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,289
-And one from Gwan-hee.
-Right.

275
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,667
-Min-woo also got two votes.
-Yes.

276
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,543
-From Min-young and Gyu-ri.
-Right.

277
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,045
-And then we have…
-Gwan-hee…

278
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,047
-Gwan-hee has nothing.
-Zero votes.

279
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,132
Let's review this, shall we?

280
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,176
For all his boasting and confidence,

281
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,136
his name wasn't mentioned once.

282
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,514
So the way I see it,

283
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,308
-But actually…
-there's a good chance he won't make it.

284
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,936
He said his best feature was himself.

285
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,981
He sounded so confident,
but nobody's talking about him.

286
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,774
Since he put it all out there,

287
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,317
-I'm sure he'll do well.
-Yes.

288
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,319
-We'll see.
-He has to do well.

289
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:33,075
The only way to escape this remote island
is to leave as a couple.

290
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,702
Welcome to Inferno.

291
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,580
You are not allowed to reveal
your age or occupation in Inferno.

292
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,374
PROFESSIONS AND AGES CANNOT BE REVEALED

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,960
If you successfully become a couple,

294
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,754
you can escape Inferno
and spend a night in Paradise.

295
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:52,511
Now, please proceed to the cafeteria
and enjoy your lunch.

296
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,556
-Let's go.
-All right.

297
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,142
-Where's the cafeteria?
-Does anyone know?

298
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,233
CAFETERIA

299
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,074
Here it is.

300
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,368
It's got plates and everything.

301
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,252
The food's over here.

302
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,505
-Chicken breast?
-What?

303
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,883
-Carrots!
-And chicken.

304
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,094
Carrots? Wow.

305
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,056
-What else?
-Is that it?

306
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,724
No way.

307
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,811
I think that's everything.

308
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,150
I don't see anything else.

309
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:49,943
This can't be right.

310
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,071
How can we live on this?

311
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,073
I found this over there.

312
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,326
-This is it?
-I think we have to dig for food.

313
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,788
Dig for what, exactly?

314
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,418
Is this corn?

315
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,253
-My gosh!
-What is it?

316
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,671
I think it's just a plant.

317
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,881
I guess you're right.

318
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,760
They look so out of place
in those outfits.

319
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,928
I agree.

320
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,640
-Min-young seems pretty eager though.
-Yeah.

321
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,521
I'm no good at this.

322
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,524
You're doing great.

323
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,317
No, I'm not.

324
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:33,821
Sorry.

325
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,782
-I'll put these here.
-Sure.

326
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,785
-Should we sit down and eat?
-Okay.

327
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,870
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy.

328
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,955
Enjoy, everyone.

329
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,958
-Thank you.
-Please help yourself.

330
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,000
This looks good.

331
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,299
-Raw carrots?
-That's not a meal.

332
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,217
-Right?
-Yes.

333
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,552
They're just eating them raw.

334
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,928
Seriously? Just like that?

335
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,478
It sounds like you're eating an apple.

336
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,191
It's a good thing I like carrots.

337
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,279
I pictured us wearing aprons
and helping each other

338
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,031
wash and prepare the vegetables.

339
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,159
But look at us.

340
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,285
Same here.

341
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,954
I didn't think we'd just have carrots.

342
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,958
I thought we'd at least get potatoes.

343
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,419
-Have you ever eaten just carrots?
-No way.

344
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,088
I'm struggling right now.

345
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,425
I'm having trouble eating this.

346
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,843
It's hurting my teeth.

347
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,305
You have an interesting way of speaking.

348
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,897
Hey, it's seasoned.

349
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,693
-Here. Have this.
-Thank you.

350
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,237
Have some more carrots, then.

351
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,156
-I don't think I can.
-Why not?

352
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,074
-What?
-You don't like carrots?

353
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:01,992
No, I do.

354
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,161
I think you're lying.

355
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,831
This is the first time
I've eaten just carrots.

356
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,833
They're too hard.

357
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,086
I can chop them up for you?

358
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,714
No thanks. I think I've had enough.

359
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,090
You'll be hungry, though.

360
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,551
-He can't make eye contact.
-You're right.

361
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,094
-Oh yeah.
-He can't look at her.

362
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,387
-Right.
-He really can't.

363
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,139
This isn't like Gwan-hee.

364
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,017
-He's surprisingly charming.
-It's rather cute.

365
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,936
-Right. It is cute.
-It's adorable.

366
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,730
-Not bad.
-They're getting to know each other.

367
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,524
Do you not eat carrots?

368
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,653
I just wanted a smaller piece.

369
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,406
That one there seems to be smaller.

370
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,953
Singles.

371
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,666
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

372
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,917
Already?

373
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,834
What?

374
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,379
-What?
-So soon?

375
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,047
-Already?
-That was quick.

376
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,799
-It hasn't been that long.
-They just met.

377
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,842
-Things are moving fast.
-Totally.

378
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,179
Please check under the table
where you are seated.

379
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,138
Already?

380
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:07,891
Isn't it too soon?

381
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,271
Please write down the name of the person

382
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,399
you'd like to go to Paradise with
on the Paradise-bound ticket.

383
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:21,113
Couples that match
will leave for Paradise immediately.

384
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,908
Immediately?

385
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,535
Right now?

386
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,412
Nothing is easy here.

387
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,331
I really like this fast pace.

388
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,042
I've never seen a show
that sends people to a hotel

389
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,294
based on first impressions.

390
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,631
Here's how the first couple-matching
will proceed.

391
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,258
The participants have written down

392
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,052
the name of the person
they'd like to take to Paradise.

393
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,140
In a moment, they will deliver the ticket
to the person they've chosen.

394
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,934
They can only give the ticket
to the person they've written down,

395
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,519
and that decision is final.

396
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,854
Here's my guess.

397
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,732
I think the people who remained optimistic

398
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,694
despite the poor living conditions
will receive more attention.

399
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,362
-I agree.
-In that short time…

400
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,780
Even though they just met.

401
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:07,034
I liked how Min-young tried to dig up
a random plant with a hand rake

402
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,953
-in that red dress she was wearing.
-Oh, yes.

403
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,538
-It was charming.
-I agree.

404
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,914
That could be a big plus.

405
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,251
On the other hand,
Gyu-ri stayed in the shade.

406
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,297
Right. It might've seemed
as though she wasn't very engaged.

407
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,845
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

408
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,805
PARADISE-BOUND COUPLE MATCHING RESULTS

409
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,519
Lee Gwan-hee.

410
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,357
Please deliver your ticket to the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

411
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,456
LEE GWAN-HEE SELECTED CHOI HYE-SEON

412
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,630
Choi Hye-seon.

413
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,718
Please deliver your ticket to the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

414
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:36,581
LEE GWAN-HEE & CHOI HYE-SEON
SUCCESSFULLY MATCHED

415
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,802
Sitting next to her…

416
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,095
-Helped him a lot.
-Yes.

417
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,680
It really seems that way.

418
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,476
Kim Gyu-ri.

419
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,982
Please deliver your ticket to the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

420
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,913
KIM GYU-RI SELECTED CHOI MIN-WOO

421
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,883
What if they all get matched?

422
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,094
-It could happen.
-They might all end up going.

423
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:33,889
Choi Min-woo.

424
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:38,894
Please deliver your ticket to the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

425
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,361
Min-woo will go for Gyu-ri, right?

426
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,706
-Did he walk by?
-He walked past her.

427
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,208
-Really?
-Are you serious?

428
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,334
Is he going to Hye-seon?

429
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,257
-What just happened?
-He delivered it.

430
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,675
-No way.
-Really?

431
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,593
Is it Hye-seon?

432
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,605
CHOI MIN-WOO SELECTED AN MIN-YOUNG

433
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,236
-I didn't see that coming.
-What in the world?

434
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,738
Was Jin-young right about the hand rake?

435
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,865
-That might be the case.
-It's possible.

436
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,829
The person I chose was An Min-young.

437
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:44,626
The reason why I changed my mind
from Gyu-ri to Min-young

438
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,712
is because I tend to be
quiet and composed,

439
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,383
so I prefer women
who are bubbly and outgoing.

440
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,760
I saw her trying to lighten the mood

441
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,137
while we were eating together,

442
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,182
so I thought I'd like to get to know her.

443
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,276
Lee Jin-seok.

444
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:14,197
Please deliver your ticket to the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

445
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,458
LEE JIN-SEOK SELECTED AN MIN-YOUNG

446
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:27,961
He went with Min-young.

447
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,796
-Did she get two votes?
-Yes.

448
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,423
-It's thanks to the hand rake.
-Right!

449
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,383
-It definitely helped.
-Totally.

450
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,468
-She was so cheerful.
-She laughed a lot.

451
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,096
-She was really eager.
-It made her seem independent.

452
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,361
An Min-young.

453
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:58,325
Please deliver your ticket to the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

454
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,939
LEE JIN-SEOK & AN MIN-YOUNG
SUCCESSFULLY MATCHED

455
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,317
-She chose Jin-seok.
-It's Jin-seok.

456
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:33,943
He got the ticket.

457
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,112
That means two couples are going.

458
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,405
-Yes.
-That's right.

459
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,449
Gyu-ri and Min-woo are staying behind.

460
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,992
-That's not good.
-It's…

461
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,745
-They're staying in Inferno!
-That's so awkward.

462
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,205
I feel bad for those two.

463
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:04,182
The first Paradise-bound
couple matching is over.

464
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,354
Couples that have matched,
please hold hands and leave for Paradise.

465
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,945
-Shall we?
-Okay.

466
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,957
Your shoes seem uncomfortable.

467
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,874
They are.

468
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,793
I can't wait to get there.

469
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,676
Let's go and enjoy some good food.

470
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,221
You should've gone easy on the carrots.

471
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,317
-Let's go.
-Okay.

472
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,988
I can't believe we get
to go to Paradise on the first day.

473
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:00,905
Yeah.

474
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,490
-Let's go this way.
-Okay.

475
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,159
To avoid the rocks.

476
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,668
I didn't think anybody would pick me.

477
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,878
Really?

478
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,463
-But when I first saw you,
-Yes?

479
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,506
I honestly thought
you'd be the most popular.

480
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,467
Really? Based on my first impression?

481
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,844
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

482
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,888
Try holding onto my back while we walk.

483
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,432
I was a bit scared when I first saw you.

484
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,225
-Did I look intimidating?
-Yes.

485
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,144
So this is a nice surprise.

486
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,855
I get that all the time.

487
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,858
I think you need to hold on tighter.

488
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,820
-Is that an excuse to hold hands?
-You got me.

489
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,493
Did you hear that?

490
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,621
Seriously.

491
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,762
I was a little puzzled
that I didn't receive

492
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,472
a single vote.

493
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,850
It's never happened to her before.

494
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,436
-Agreed.
-This is her first time getting rejected.

495
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,939
I'm not sure how to put it,

496
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,943
but I guess the people staying behind
will have to keep each other company.

497
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,281
-She seems shocked.
-She probably didn't expect this.

498
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,784
-Gyu-ri is charming in a demure way.
-Seriously.

499
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,577
I think she's at a loss right now.

500
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,745
-Yeah.
-I can tell.

501
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,081
-She can't hide her disappointment.
-Right.

502
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,208
I know Gyu-ri is disappointed right now,

503
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,418
but I think it's actually good for her.

504
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,629
-Really?
-Instead of going to Paradise

505
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,214
from the very beginning,

506
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,132
-hitting rock bottom first
-I see.

507
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,594
and then working her way back up
could be better in the long run.

508
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,811
-We're taking a helicopter!
-I'm nervous.

509
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,568
I'm so excited!

510
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,707
I'm scared.

511
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,340
This is so cool!

512
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,184
Shall we get going?

513
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,187
Watch your step.

514
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,689
Thank you.

515
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,192
What should we do for dinner?

516
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,361
Don't tell me
we have to eat carrots again.

517
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,946
Carrots and chicken breast?

518
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,116
Do you know how to cook?

519
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,827
No, not really.

520
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,247
But I'll try my best. What about you?

521
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,000
-I can't cook.
-Really?

522
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,502
But we need to survive, so…

523
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,087
Right.

524
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,635
What's in your hand?

525
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,595
That thing from before.

526
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,098
Why are you holding on to it?
Throw it away.

527
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,897
Is this our lodging?

528
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,982
It's nicer than I expected.

529
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,944
Hey, this is nice.

530
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,487
WOMEN'S LODGING

531
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,738
It looks pretty cozy.

532
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,406
MEN'S LODGING

533
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,171
PARADISE

534
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,727
Awesome.

535
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,604
We're here.

536
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,776
PARADISE
LEE GWAN-HEE & CHOI HYE-SEON

537
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,696
-My gosh.
-Look at that.

538
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,155
It's a brand-new Paradise.

539
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,165
This place is huge.

540
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,918
It has a great view.

541
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,259
No way!

542
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,972
This isn't just any hotel. It's amazing.

543
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,641
-Five people could stay here.
-Five?

544
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,268
Fifteen is more like it.

545
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,227
My gosh!

546
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,568
There's no need to go to the pool.

547
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,738
This is so nice.

548
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,741
It's incredible here.

549
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,202
Don't tell me there's only one bed.

550
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,079
I'm pretty sure

551
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,790
there's an extra one.

552
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,917
This is great. Look at that.

553
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,127
The view is amazing.

554
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,713
It's so cool.

555
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,368
-I never thought I'd be here so soon.
-Same.

556
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,007
I was wondering

557
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,842
if there was any particular reason…

558
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,429
why you chose me.

559
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:00,932
Well, first off,

560
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:05,520
you were fun and pleasant
when we were having lunch.

561
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,649
You also took charge of things naturally.

562
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,484
You got all that from some carrots?

563
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,280
I guess you could say that.

564
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,202
When I first saw you,

565
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,288
even in that brief moment,

566
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,626
I could tell that you had
the best personality.

567
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,710
So I think

568
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,797
that's why I chose you.

569
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,714
Thank you.

570
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,723
Guess how old I am.

571
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,060
Maybe 28?

572
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,019
Excuse me?

573
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,896
Twenty…

574
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,064
We're done here.

575
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,732
You're not 28?

576
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,903
Maybe 27, then?

577
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,656
Are you 27?

578
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,075
-I think--
-You can't be younger than 27.

579
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,535
Or are you?

580
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,621
I might look more mature today
because of my makeup.

581
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,707
Give me a second.

582
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,916
Are you…

583
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,378
Are you 25?

584
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,921
-I'm 26.
-You're 26?

585
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:14,881
I see.

586
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,217
If you're 26,
that means you were born in 1998?

587
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,219
-Yes.
-So you were born in 1998.

588
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,267
There's not much difference
between 26 and 28.

589
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,518
It's just two years.

590
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,980
Are you 32?

591
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,899
-Me?
-Yes.

592
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,108
Do I look like I'm over 30?

593
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,320
You're the one who said 28
was close enough.

594
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,155
You're close.

595
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,699
Are you 31?

596
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,785
I'm actually 36.

597
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,745
-You're 36?
-Yes.

598
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,330
-Seriously?
-I was born in 1988.

599
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,793
You were born in 1998…

600
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,839
What do you do for a living?

601
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,090
I'm a college student.

602
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,967
-A college student?
-Yes.

603
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,136
-I'm a life sciences major.
-I see.

604
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,015
I work with computers a lot.

605
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,186
I'm currently attending
Ewha Women's University,

606
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,814
majoring in bioinformatics
in the Life Sciences Department.

607
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,361
Last winter, I completed
a biomedical science internship

608
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,695
at Seoul National University.

609
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,615
I also had an internship
at a start-up in Silicon Valley,

610
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,533
which I'm continuing to do remotely.

611
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,703
CHOI HYE-SEON, AGE 26

612
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,538
EWHA WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY
LIFE SCIENCE MAJOR

613
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,792
Just the fact that she attends
Ewha Women's University…

614
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,502
-Gosh.
-Does she seem different now?

615
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,755
-She seems even cooler.
-And she's a life sciences major.

616
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,341
-Exactly. Her school and major…
-It was unexpected.

617
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,385
Single's Inferno is intense.

618
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,804
So you wear a lab coat
and perform experiments?

619
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,888
I do.

620
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:50,017
But my main job involves
working with computers.

621
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,728
I'm pretty bad with computers.

622
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,563
Can you fix mine if it breaks down?

623
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,317
Sorry, but even I have to call
someone for that.

624
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,736
So you work with computers.

625
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,072
I bet you have an unusual job.

626
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,282
-Me?
-Yes.

627
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,284
-I'm an athlete.
-Seriously?

628
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,411
That's so cool!

629
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,704
I'm a basketball player.

630
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,792
I'm a professional basketball player,

631
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,211
and I'm a shooting guard.

632
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,714
I guess you can say that I act as a bridge

633
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,799
between the point guard and center.

634
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,218
You can think of it as a position

635
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,721
that's best at hitting long-range shots.

636
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,766
LEE GWAN-HEE, AGE 36
PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER

637
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,643
He's a really famous player.

638
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,103
-Really?
-Seriously?

639
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,521
He's still active too.

640
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,398
Then he must be really popular.

641
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,899
So that's why he's so tall.

642
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,152
He even made it
on the KBL All-Star roster.

643
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,862
-I see.
-That's how famous he is.

644
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,697
That's amazing.

645
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,991
I've never met
a professional athlete before.

646
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,659
This is so cool

647
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,329
because I've always wanted to meet someone

648
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,832
from a different line of work.

649
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,335
So you're an athlete.

650
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,671
Our food is here.

651
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,882
Allow us to serve your meal.

652
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,051
This is a Caesar salad
topped with lobster.

653
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,889
My gosh. This looks delicious.

654
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,311
This is so cool.

655
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,439
Enjoy your meal.

656
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,274
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

657
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,071
I can't go back to Inferno after this.

658
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,698
Enjoy your meal.

659
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,244
Do you prefer meat over seafood?

660
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,830
I actually like both.
Everything looks amazing.

661
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,050
I'm so happy right now.

662
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,391
Are you the talkative type
when you're in a relationship?

663
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,976
Do you want a girlfriend
who's like a good friend?

664
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,438
Or do you like a relationship
that makes your heart race?

665
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,983
I'm the type that jokes around a lot.

666
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,527
Right, I can see that.

667
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,655
I can't leave my partner alone
for even a moment.

668
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,617
Like, I might poke her in the side
and run away.

669
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,704
I tend to take the lead in a relationship.

670
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,999
So I guess

671
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,710
it must have been weird

672
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,505
to let someone else take the lead today.

673
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,882
-Do you want to drive?
-Sure, I'll give it a try.

674
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,384
-What?
-I want to drive.

675
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,510
Really?

676
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,636
Is that okay with you?

677
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,054
Sure, I guess.

678
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,931
Is this the exit?

679
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,434
-Turn left here.
-Left? Got it.

680
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:39,854
Turn left.

681
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:44,442
I told him that I wanted to drive.

682
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,153
And he put his hand on the wheel to help,

683
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,363
so I felt like I could rely on him.

684
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,742
If you were my girlfriend,

685
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,661
and you drove like that,

686
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,955
I would ask you to step out of the car.

687
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,249
Then I would take over.

688
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,712
I don't think I would've let you stay
in the driver's seat.

689
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,096
This is making me
want to come here every day.

690
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,725
We got spoiled too soon.

691
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,313
INFERNO

692
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:26,275
We have rice, carrots,
chicken breast, and canned ham.

693
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,034
-That's not easy.
-It's not.

694
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,036
-It's hard to start a fire.
-I feel so bad.

695
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,787
This is the polar opposite of Paradise.

696
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,664
It's even harder when someone's watching.

697
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,002
You're almost there.

698
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,504
I see sparks flying.

699
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,471
My gosh. You're sweating.

700
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,391
It's okay. I got this.

701
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,812
Do you think we can eat tonight?

702
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,648
I'll make sure we do.

703
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,693
I'll make this work.

704
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:12,863
Come on.

705
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,573
Please.

706
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,117
Please work.

707
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,290
-Got it.
-That's amazing.

708
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:24,959
Be careful.

709
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,133
It took a while to get a fire going.

710
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,178
I felt so bad seeing him work so hard.

711
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,639
I was really grateful
for his help yesterday.

712
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,350
We really earned this.

713
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,394
Bon appétit.

714
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,568
Is it good?

715
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,321
How does it taste?

716
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,870
The rice is a little crunchy.

717
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,123
It's kind of like scorched rice.

718
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:13,257
I bet the others are enjoying
much nicer meals than this.

719
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,552
They're probably getting room service.

720
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,681
Doesn't it feel uncomfortable
using honorifics?

721
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,058
Shall we drop them, then?

722
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,858
-All right. Let's speak casually.
-Okay.

723
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,994
It's pretty.

724
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,454
It really is.

725
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,248
It's getting chilly.

726
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,207
I'm cold.

727
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,252
Do you want to wear this on the walk down?

728
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,338
Thank you.

729
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,720
-Should we go?
-Sure.

730
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,891
I'm sorry for putting you
through so much today.

731
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,059
What do you mean?

732
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,561
I should've done a better job.

733
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,271
But you were great.

734
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,525
After spending a lot of time

735
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,194
cooking together in Inferno,

736
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,446
I realized how comfortable
she made me feel.

737
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,114
This is going really well.

738
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,077
We made rice in a pot over a fire.

739
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,454
This is hard to do, you know.

740
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,998
She was cute in unexpected ways.

741
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,543
Waving around carrots
can be our distress signal.

742
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,130
I think we got a lot closer

743
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,508
while making dinner together.

744
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,593
I really enjoyed my time with her.

745
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,472
Gyu-ri has perked up a lot.

746
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,682
-Yes.
-You're right.

747
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,517
-Maybe…
-It's because she hit rock bottom.

748
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,977
-She's trying a different approach.
-Rock bottom?

749
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,397
-I'm glad it happened.
-You're glad she hit rock bottom?

750
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,023
-That's so mean.
-I'm just saying…

751
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,192
I think it could be better for her

752
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,652
-in the long run.
-Right.

753
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,821
I agree. I think falling for someone

754
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,073
at a place like Inferno
will have a deeper impact

755
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,243
-than falling for someone in Paradise.
-You're right.

756
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,120
-It's harder to forget.
-It's more memorable.

757
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,413
-Right.
-On the island.

758
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,580
That was fun to watch.

759
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,124
PARADISE
LEE JIN-SEOK & AN MIN-YOUNG

760
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,375
The ocean is beautiful.

761
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,668
-It is, isn't it?
-Yeah.

762
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:15,921
It's making me excited.

763
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,471
-Are you glad to be here?
-Of course I am.

764
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,641
I feel like you're a good liar.

765
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,394
I'm a pretty bad liar.

766
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,687
Are you good at lying?

767
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,355
No, I'm pretty straightforward.

768
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,232
That's what I thought.

769
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,067
-Was that a compliment?
-Of course.

770
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,028
I think it'd be easy to tell
if you're lying.

771
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,948
-You're right.
-Yeah. It'd be so obvious.

772
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,493
I think we're here.

773
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,792
This place is so cute.

774
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,918
-It's cute.
-Right?

775
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,212
Yes. We went
from eating carrots to dessert.

776
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,298
-Should I cut this up?
-Yes.

777
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,674
Okay, I will.

778
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,181
This is really hard to cut.

779
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,433
I can tell you're not a chef.

780
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,061
You try using this.

781
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,022
It doesn't have a sharp edge.

782
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,857
You're definitely not a chef.

783
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,816
Yes, I'm sorry.

784
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,862
-Here. Take the first bite.
-Thank you.

785
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,448
-Is it small enough?
-Yes.

786
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,365
Good.

787
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,494
-I didn't think it was.
-It's okay.

788
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,163
-I think I might know
-Yes?

789
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,040
what you do for a living.

790
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,166
-Really?
-Yes.

791
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,083
Take a guess.

792
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,002
Are you a car racing model?

793
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,046
Okay, maybe not.

794
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:43,884
I'm a Pilates instructor,
and I have my own studio.

795
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:51,099
I work as a Pilates instructor
and run my own studio.

796
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,436
I check the schedule,

797
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,648
tell the manager
what needs to be done that day,

798
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:03,320
and provide one-on-one sessions
when people make appointments.

AN MIN-YOUNG
PILATES STUDIO DIRECTOR

800
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,743
I can see that.

801
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,706
I feel like you might be an athlete.

802
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,666
Sorry, but no.

803
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:20,337
I just like to work out as a hobby.

804
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,089
Actually,

805
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,508
I run a café.

806
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,760
I own and run a bakery café.

807
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,596
I've been doing it
for about four years now.

808
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:36,687
I run three cafés in Daegu.

809
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,816
I do everything from making desserts

810
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:45,529
to making coffee and roasting beans.

811
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,284
I'm in charge of
the day-to-day business operations.

LEE JIN-SEOK
BAKERY CAFÉ OWNER

813
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,873
I'd like to see pictures of your café.

814
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,043
I'll show you sometime.

815
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,921
-Soon.
-Sounds good.

816
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:08,343
I run three cafés in the area I live in.

817
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,761
-I see.
-Yeah.

818
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,138
-Where do you live?
-What?

819
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,723
Where do you live?

820
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,350
I live in Daegu.

821
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,102
What about you?

822
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,103
I live in Seoul.

823
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,982
-But your hometown is…
-Busan.

824
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,151
I travel back and forth for work.

825
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,110
I see.

826
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,070
-I'll visit you when I'm in Daegu.
-Okay.

827
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,656
I'll come looking for you if you don't.

828
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,741
But I go to Busan often.

829
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,492
Same here. I go there a lot.

830
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,077
Come find me when you're in Busan.

831
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,663
I definitely will.

832
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,375
So then…

833
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,337
Your age is…

834
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,254
Can I take a guess?

835
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,881
-Sure.
-Are you 26?

836
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:46,965
How did you know?

837
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,133
I had a feeling.

838
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,801
I'm really good at this.

839
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,220
-You got it on your first try.
-So you're 26.

840
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,890
Are you 33?

841
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:55,974
Not even close.

842
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,769
That kind of hurt.

843
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,313
-Are you in your twenties?
-No.

844
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,814
Then are you 31?

845
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:03,732
Correct.

846
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,027
-You were close the first time.
-I was.

847
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,280
Jin-seok, you've got something…

848
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,323
-On my nose?
-Yes.

849
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,450
I was saving it for later.

850
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,208
She called him by his first name.

851
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,959
-They're good together.
-They're cute.

852
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,920
-They seem comfortable together.
-Right.

853
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,049
-Do you want to watch the sunset?
-Sure.

854
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,928
-It's beautiful today, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

855
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,055
I love the sunset vibes.

856
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,560
-Feel free to speak casually to me.
-May I?

857
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,938
Then please do the same.

858
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,523
I can do that.

859
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:45,482
Really?

860
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,651
Sounds good.

861
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,736
-All right, then.
-All right.

862
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,072
-I'm good, aren't I?
-Yes.

863
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,453
How many times have they said "all right"?

864
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,538
I know, right?

865
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,666
-Why am I laughing?
-It's not funny, but I'm so here for it.

866
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:03,709
Right?

867
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,043
-Jin-seok.
-Jin-seok.

868
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,212
-Min-young has already fallen for him.
-Yes.

869
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,506
Even I'm falling for Jin-seok right now.

870

PARADISE
LEE GWAN-HEE & CHOI HYE-SEON

It's not Single's Inferno without a pool.

872
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,807
The water is warm.

873
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,559
It's so pretty here.

874
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,272
This is the nicest pool I've ever seen.

875
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,236
I can't wait to get in.

876
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,285
Are you going to jump in?

877
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,124
It's warm.

878
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,001
It looks pretty deep.

879
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,340
It's about this deep.

880
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,137
It's nice and warm.

881
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,182
I like this.

882
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,350
It's better than I expected.

883
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,165
I think when we get back to Inferno,

884
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,586
I'm going to feel really attached to you.

885
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,755
-Out of everyone else?
-Yes.

886
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,424
That's understandable.

887
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:38,303
We basically spent the whole day together.

888
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,181
What do you think…

889
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:46,228
would have happened
if we'd stayed behind in Inferno?

890
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,607
If the reason we were left behind

891
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,693
was because you didn't choose me
even though I chose you,

892
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,488
I would've been
pretty disappointed in you.

893
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,866
If the roles were reversed…

894
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,495
I would've gone straight to bed.

895
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,373
-Just to avoid me?
-Absolutely.

896
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,253
Then I'd ignore you the next day.

897
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,964
And you'd speak to me very formally.

898
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,550
"Hello. I'm sorry,
but what was your name again?"

899
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,677
You'd refuse to remember.

900
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:25,517
I don't know
what's going to happen tomorrow,

901
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,854
but if that happens,
I won't be upset with you.

902
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,774
I wish I was a good swimmer.

903
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,318
If you were, we could race each other.

904
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,737
-Dog paddle?
-Sure.

905
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,531
You want to dog-paddle race?

906
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,658
-Shall we?
-Are we swimming?

907
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,243
Sure. Do whatever you want.

908
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,787
Whatever I want?

909
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,835
Hye-seon is adorable.

910
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,461
-She's like a puppy.
-Right.

911
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,799
I can't believe this.

912
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,635
I'm sorry!

913
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,017
You're so fast!

914
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,815
-Get comfy.
-The water's colder than I thought.

915
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:14,733
Is it?

916
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,986
I think the pool over there…

917
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,946
We should go check it out.

918
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,114
Is it warm?

919
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,658
It's not just warm. It's hot.

920
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,910
-Watch your step.
-Okay.

921
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,703
-Is it steep?
-Yes.

922
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,541
-It's warm.
-We should've come here sooner.

923
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,500
It's so warm!

924
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,004
Oh my.

925
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,757
Gosh, it's warm.

926
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,301
This is so nice.

927
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,430
When we head back tomorrow,
it'll be six people again.

928
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:48,141
-And we'll probably have to play games.
-Right.

929
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,478
I was wondering

930
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,940
if you'd be disappointed

931
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,194
if I chose a different person in a game.

932
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,237
I already told you that I'd understand.

933
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,822
-I would.
-Really?

934
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,408
And then you'd choose someone else, right?

935
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,786
You totally got me.
You were quick to catch on.

936
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,456
"Go ahead and choose someone else.
I'll do the same."

937
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,291
Let's see who does it first.

938
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,669
But to be honest,

939
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,254
it's kind of natural
when you think about it

940
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,715
because it's only the first day.

941
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,926
I mean, think about it.

942
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,930
If someone were to pick me all the time

943
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,349
without ever showing interest
in anyone else,

944
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,726
I think that could be a little scary too.

945
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,270
We should get to know everyone first

946
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,856
and then decide later on.

947
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,986
I'd appreciate it more if you told me
that even after meeting the others,

948
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,737
you still like me the best.

949
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,447
It'd be more genuine.

950
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,491
That goes for me as well.

951
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,702
So you want to reunite on the last day?

952
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,622
We can share the chocolate
they left us on the last day.

953
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:54,833
Let's do that.

954
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,669
I guess I just wanted to say…

955
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,923
that nothing will change much on my end.

956
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,392
Let's just wait and see
what happens tomorrow.

957
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,813
I'm going to write this all down
to remember everything.

958
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,483
"Lee Gwan-hee went back on his word."

959
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,235
"What a jerk."

960
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,662
Are you warmed up now?

961
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,330
Totally.

962
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,464
Shall we go back inside?

963
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:49,721
Let's go.

964
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,064
That was a master move.

965
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,023
Do you mean this?

966
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,067
Nicely done.

967
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,152
-Is that a good move?
-Yes, definitely.

968
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,070
Really?

969
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,322
-Splashing water?
-That's the best part.

970
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,239
It is?

971
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,284
It shows that she was
paying close attention to him.

972
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,286
-She didn't want him to get cold.
-Right.

973
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:16,748
Participants get a little touchy-feely
when no one's looking, right?

974
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,000
Just tell us the truth.

975
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,878
-They might already be holding hands.
-Really?

976
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:22,796
Right.

977
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:26,216
Maybe it's because Gwan-hee is older,

978
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:29,177
but he seems very experienced.

979
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,970
-Everything was very natural.
-Yes.

980
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,348
-Their time together at the hotel.
-Exactly.

981
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,601
I didn't see any awkward moments
stemming from inexperience.

982
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,228
He was very calm and collected.

983
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,230
I could tell he had dating experience.

984
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,607
Do you really think
Gwan-hee won't change his mind?

985
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:44,901
-Gwan-hee?
-Yes.

986
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,028
I bet he'll have
second thoughts right away.

987
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,197
I thought maybe
he'd stay true to Hye-seon.

988
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,825
I think Gwan-hee will meet
a lot of different people

989
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:55,036
and enjoy his time
participating in Single's Inferno.

990
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,955
-He's definitely here to have fun.
-Yes.

991
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,164
I can just tell.

992
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:02,377
PARADISE
LEE JIN-SEOK & AN MIN-YOUNG

993
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,757
Will you go in first, Jin-seok?

994
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:08,675
All right.

995
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,303
Let me splash some water on myself

996
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,597
before I go in.

997
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,653
It's not as deep as I expected.

998
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,571
Is it shallow?

999
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,072
-No, it's deep.
-I'm scared.

1000
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,035
It's pretty deep. Hold on, I'm scared.

1001
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,705
-Help me.
-Aren't you exaggerating a bit?

1002
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,789
Hold on.

1003
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,459
Are your feet touching the bottom?

1004
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,586
-Yes, they are.
-The water's up to my neck.

1005
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,962
-What?
-It's up to my neck.

1006
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,505
You can get on my back, then.

1007
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:55,805
What?

1008
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,016
-Get on.
-It's okay.

1009
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,142
I'll carry you on my back.

1010
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,019
I can do that much.

1011
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,270
-Really?
-Yes.

1012
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,354
I'm heavy, though.

1013
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:04,981
Hold me up instead.

1014
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,864
I feel like I need to carry you.

1015
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,326
Stand on your tiptoes.

1016
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,205
-Why?
-So you don't fall.

1017
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,606
-What's going on?
-That's just…

1018
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,734
They're not wasting any time this season.

1019
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,805
-Come here.
-Okay.

1020
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:23,977
-What?
-What are they doing?

1021
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,896
-What's there to whisper about in a pool?
-Seriously?

1022
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,690
This is what real couples do.

1023
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,983
-Yeah.
-But I mean,

1024
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,485
they can hear just fine
since it's just the two of them.

1025
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,112
What were they laughing about?

1026
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,155
Kyuhyun, your ears turned really red.

1027
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,448
-I just…
-Look at them.

1028
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,159
They're a little sensitive.

1029
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,750
The pool has been the most fun, right?

1030
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,669
The pool? Yes, it's the best.

1031
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,337
Does my hair look like seaweed?

1032
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,631
-Yes, but it's a good look on you.
-Really?

1033
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,217
Or maybe it's laver.

1034
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,469
No, it's more like slimy seaweed.

1035
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,263
All right, I'll stop.

1036
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,389
I'm sorry.

1037
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,851
I don't want to go too far
and get in trouble.

1038
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,563
If you keep it up, I'll dunk your head in.

1039
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,522
I don't mind.

1040
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,316
I'll just go underwater.

1041
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,819
You have no problem walking.

1042
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,822
I'm trying my best
to walk on my tiptoes right now.

1043
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,618
Do you want to sit down?

1044
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,746
You seem to be having a hard time.

1045
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,205
I'm getting a little tired.

1046
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:28,708
Let's get you up.

1047
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,961
Wait here. I'll go and get your robe.

1048
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,263
Come on up.

1049
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,223
I'll wrap you in this.

1050
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,939
-You look good in that.
-Thank you.

1051
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:52,857
Sure thing.

1052
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:57,904
Ready to go?

1053
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:02,408
-That was the most fun I had today.
-Yeah, that was great.

1054
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:06,371
It was fun because
we got to enjoy each other's company.

1055
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,164
-Right?
-Right.

1056
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,208
These two are insane.

1057
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,001
They're practically a couple now.

1058
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,587
-This is normally episode-seven material.
-Right?

1059
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,964
-Their hormones are out of control.
-Yes.

1060
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,842
I don't want to go to bed just yet.

1061
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,428
I think we should
since we're both worn out.

1062
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,306
Do you want a facial mask?

1063
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,599
-Is there one for me?
-Yes.

1064
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:28,393
Okay.

1065
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,814
There we go.

1066
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:37,360
Mine's a bit small.
Does this mean my face is big?

1067
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,322
Come here.

1068
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,833
You know what you're doing.

1069
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,842
-They seem like a couple too.
-They're like newlyweds.

1070
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,222
-You're leaving it on, right?
-Yes.

1071
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,517
-I'm going to take mine off.
-Okay.

1072
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,186
Here. Try this on.

1073
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,104
What is it?

1074
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:17,191
I get a lot of aroma products as gifts.

1075
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,401
Really?

1076
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,988
Rub it on the nape of your neck.

1077
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,030
Like this?

1078
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,866
It'll help me sleep better, right?

1079
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,617
-How's the scent?
-I love it.

1080
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,955
This stuff is expensive,

1081
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,291
so pay me back in carrots.

1082
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,547
This is great. Thank you.

1083
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,141
I'm going to bed. Sleep tight.

1084
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,310
-Good night.
-Turn off those lights, okay?

1085
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:54,353
Got it. Sleep well.

1086
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,859
If you can't sleep,
come find me on the sofa.

1087
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,450
This bed is way too short for me.

1088
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,243
If it's too short, come in here.

1089
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,370
-What?
-Come here.

1090
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,873
-What?
-Excuse me?

1091
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,000
-Seriously?
-Don't do this, guys.

1092
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,503
If it's too short, come in here.

1093
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,588
-What?
-Come here.

1094
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,090
-You heard me?
-Yes.

1095
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,509
It's okay. I'll be fine.

1096
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,093
Seriously, just come here.

1097
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:27,845
Good night.

1098
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,557
That's it, right? It ended there.

1099
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,769
Young people these days are so bold.

1100
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:38,105
I can't get over how bold they are.

1101
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,941
-I don't get it.
-I'm so confused.

1102
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,610
I could tell from Gwan-hee's reaction

1103
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,612
that he was caught off guard.

1104
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,699
I'm having a hard time believing

1105
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,994
that we're only on the first episode
since things are moving so fast.

1106
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:55,414
-Yeah, they really are.
-They're so touchy-feely.

1107
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,791
My head is spinning.

1108
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,418
For me, it felt like
I was watching two couples.

1109
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,379
Two couples who are already dating?

1110
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,172
-Yes.
-Right.

1111
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:07,176
I think it's pretty sweet
how Hye-seon interacts with Gwan-hee.

1112
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:13,182
But I'm not really getting
the same vibe from Gwan-hee.

1113
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,901
-Want to go eat?
-Sure.

1114
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,528
PARADISE
LEE GWAN-HEE & CHOI HYE-SEON

1115
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,118
This is my omelet, right?

1116
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,747
My gosh. Look at the blueberries.

1117
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,416
I love blueberries.

1118
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,628
This is amazing. I'm so happy.

1119
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,674
I can't believe we're going back
to Inferno after this.

1120
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:51,596
How is it?

1121
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:53,055
-It's delicious.
-Is it?

1122
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,269
This is insanely good.

1123
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,106
I don't want to go home.

1124
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,399
I mean, Inferno.

1125
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,240
I see mangoes.

1126
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,910
All my favorites are here.

1127
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,119
You can have them all.

1128
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,583
We won't get to eat
this kind of food again for a while.

1129
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:23,711
Are you sure?

1130
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,088
I'll give you a piece.

1131
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,173
You don't want one?

1132
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,591
I'll just have some melon.

1133
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,051
Thank you.

1134
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,309
This is so good.

1135
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,441
I put out some supplements
for you over there.

1136
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:46,901
Take them before we leave.

1137
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:47,985
What kind of supplements?

1138
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,364
-Just some vitamins
-Really?

1139
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:52,657
and red ginseng.

1140
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,785
You're the best.

1141
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,163
You said your lips get chapped
when you're tired.

1142
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:00,122
That's right.

1143
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,709
You're so thoughtful.

1144
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,671
-I get a sore throat when I'm tired.
-I see.

1145
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:11,133
He seems indifferent
but still cares for her.

1146
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,052
He's totally different from yesterday.

1147
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,096
-Right.
-He's not the same jokester.

1148
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:16,931
-He's actually quite thoughtful.
-Yes.

1149
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:26,607
Choi Hye-seon…

1150
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:32,530
you may not return to Inferno
with Lee Gwan-hee.

1151
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,617
-What?
-Why?

1152
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,285
-What is it?
-What's changed?

1153
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,537
I just got chills.

1154
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,455
-Seriously?
-What's going on?

1155
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,209
She said you won't be returning.

1156
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,878
Does that mean you're going home?

1157
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:50,673
Choi Hye-seon,

1158
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,260
a new male participant
is waiting for you in the lobby.

1159
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,679
Please return to Inferno with him.

1160
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:12,987
-What's going on?
-What?

1161
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,073
What?

1162
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,241
What in the world?

1163
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,704
You're returning to Inferno
with a new guy?

1164
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,166
No way.

1165
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,881
If it's a new guy…

1166
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:36,052
Does that mean there's a new participant?

1167
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,059
What am I supposed to do now?

1168
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,268
This is crazy.

1169
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,520
Give me back that mango I gave you.

1170
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,944
-This is kind of cute.
-It is.

1171
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,946
-It's adorable.
-He's jealous.

1172
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:57,823
I can't believe this.

1173
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:05,623
You go on ahead.
I'll make the bed and do the laundry.

1174
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,416
So go on ahead.

1175
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,959
-See you.
-I'll see you there.

1176
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,712
Make sure to carry your own bag.

1177
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,798
Don't let that guy carry it, okay?

1178
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,801
-Thanks for everything.
-Sure.

1179
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,428
-See you. I'll return your stuff later.
-Okay. See you.

1180
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:02,179
Hello.

1181
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,598
-Hello.
-Hello.

1182
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:07,017
Hello.

1183
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,478
-Hello.
-Hello.

1184
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:17,069
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

1185
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:21,699
It's nice to meet you.

1186
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,119
This is all so unexpected.

1187
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:28,122
-Did I keep you waiting?
-No, not at all.

1188
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:31,876
-It's really nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

1189
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,007
I don't know what's going on either.

1190
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:39,800
I heard the news over breakfast.

1191
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,553
I mean, I'm only here
because I matched with someone.

1192
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:44,680
But where did the matching take place?

1193
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,392
Don't you know where we're going?

1194
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:49,602
As far as I know,

1195
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,478
-we're going to Inferno.
-That's right.

1196
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,648
I came here after I matched
with someone in Inferno yesterday.

1197
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,317
-Really?
-Yes.

1198
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,610
As for us, we…

1199
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,236
"Us"?

1200
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:00,863
Right. Us.

1201
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:02,198
As for us, we…

1202
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:03,824
"Us"?

1203
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,409
Right. Us.

1204
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:06,911
-There are more people?
-Yes.

1205
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,122
-What?
-What?

1206
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,123
"As for us"?

1207
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:14,168
There are five people in our group.

1208
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,546
What about yours?

1209
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,924
Right. We have five people.

1210
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,926
-Including yourself?
-That's right.

1211
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,886
So three men and two women?

1212
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,429
Yes. Three men and two women.

1213
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,140
Do you know each other's names?

1214
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,893
Of course. We were in Inferno too.

1215
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:32,144
We went to Inferno

1216
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,648
and ate chicken breast and carrots.

1217
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:38,150
I'm getting chills.

1218
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,985
-Was there another group?
-Looks like it.

1219
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,071
-There must've been a separate Inferno.
-Right.

1220
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:43,739
There are two Infernos.

1221
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,533
I arrived in Inferno yesterday
