00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,389
How's your second day in Paradise been?

16
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,018
-Second day in Paradise?
-Yeah.

17
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,818
You sleeping?

18
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,736
"You sleeping?"

19
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,197
That's ridiculous.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,114
Really?

21
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,282
No way.

22
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,119
Are you sleeping?

23
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:19,996
No.

24
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,333
What a relief.

25
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,501
Thank goodness.

26
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,422
So, how has your second day
in Paradise been?

27
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,174
My second day in Paradise?

28
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,219
How did we end up
in Paradise for two days?

29
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,683
Gosh.

30
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,644
How did we make it back here?

31
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,022
Because you won and came in first place.

32
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,106
That's right.

33
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,237
-Do you feel like it was worth it though?
-What?

34
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,531
What do you think?

35
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,949
It's pretty disappointing.

36
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,035
-Disappointing?
-Yeah, we couldn't talk much today.

37
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,662
I know, right?

38
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,164
I felt today was a really important day.

39
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,457
Right?

40
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,335
I'm not sure.

41
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,047
I don't know

42
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,591
how you feel now…

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,301
to be honest.

44
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,182
We barely even talked.

45
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,645
I'm wondering

46
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,898
if you're not curious about me anymore.

47
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,776
That thought crossed my mind.

48
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,865
Maybe it's because you're just tired.

49
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,118
That's what I've been…

50
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,164
trying to think of it as.

51
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,583
Still,

52
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,545
I think I did try hard.

53
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,880
Right.

54
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,923
But from your perspective,

55
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,259
I looked too tired…

56
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,887
-Yeah.
-So it bothered you?

57
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,805
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

58
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,683
Your vibe wasn't the same
as it was yesterday.

59
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,976
Right.

60
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,570
I'm not the type
who expresses things verbally.

61
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,782
Expressing myself with words
isn't my thing.

62
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,286
Is this how tough guys
show their feelings?

63
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,456
I don't really get it.

64
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,927
I can't get used to
the pace of this place.

65
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,390
How can you make
such big decisions in a day or two?

66
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,144
No, I'm not asking you to decide.

67
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,438
I just wanted to know
how you feel right now.

68
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,023
I feel good right now.

69
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,860
Then, you can treat me more kindly!

70
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,571
But this is just how I am.
What am I supposed to do?

71
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,534
I'll try my best though.

72
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,204
You can be more gentle.

73
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,455
Be gentle with me.

74
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,250
Have I ever been gentle with you?

75
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,584
Yeah, you were yesterday.

76
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,919
-I was yesterday?
-Yeah.

77
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,257
Okay.

78
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,425
I'll try my best.

79
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,012
Not a high five!

80
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:24,973
No, not a high five.

81
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,392
-That's not the time for it!
-Give her a hug instead.

82
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,023
Why are you on Si-an's side now?

83
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,067
Why is he doing that?

84
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,235
He's doing this!

85
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,112
Kyuhyun's been very patient with him.

86
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,447
He's channeling Si-an right now.

87
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,157
Does a high five make sense right now?

88
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,867
"All right, let's go!"

89
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,286
That's ridiculous.

90
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,166
Not a high five!

91
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,004
You're so annoying.

92
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,384
I don't think an ideal relationship

93
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,469
is something you can will into existence.

94
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,595
That's what I think.

95
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,055
Especially, a romantic one.

96
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,348
I see.

97
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,977
But being in a relationship
is about finding common ground.

98
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,894
That's true.

99
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,230
We came from different backgrounds.

100
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,565
-Both you and I.
-Right.

101
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,482
-Right?
-Yeah.

102
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,611
I'm just saying
let's try a little harder.

103
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,114
If it's possible, of course.

104
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,160
-You and I have some similarities.
-Yeah.

105
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,203
We're probably different in many ways too.

106
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,122
I'll try my best too.

107
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,459
I'll work on being a bit gentler.

108
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,713
Cover up.

109
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,052
Should we go to bed?

110
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:44,969
Yeah.

111
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,597
Let's do that.

112
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,812
I really liked that conversation.

113
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,189
I understand them both.

114
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,026
Even though it was frustrating at times
and there were moments I didn't like,

115
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,695
the conversation they just had
was so beautiful.

116
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,697
-It was ideal.
-It felt comfortable and natural.

117
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,698
-It was nice.
-Yes.

118
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,616
As Si-an said,

119
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,953
a relationship is about putting in effort
to adjust to each other.

120
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,121
That's what you have to do.

121
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,957
But wanting to fix someone
or wanting someone to change

122
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,794
isn't what you should think about.

123
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:22,006
You can't shape someone
into the person you want them to be.

124
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,218
People don't really change
or drastically become different.

125
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,427
-That's what I think.
-Right.

126
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,345
That's hard.

127
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,347
It's not the first time she's said this.

128
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,932
-Right.
-She's said the same thing.

129
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,059
-She keeps repeating it.
-Yeah.

130
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,769
But I think it's like this.

131
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,979
Even though they know
they're not that compatible,

132
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,648
they're still drawn to each other.

133
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,649
-Yeah.
-Right.

134
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,236
A funny thing Jun-seo said was,

135
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,738
"Have I ever been gentle with you?"

136
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,031
That was…

137
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,407
They're not clicking.

138
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,868
I couldn't believe
he could say that to her.

139
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,204
-"I'm not the gentle type."
-That's not easy to say.

140
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,373
He's the type
to follow that with a high five.

141
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,375
But honestly,

142
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,462
it wouldn't suit Jun-seo
if he tried to act sweet like Jeong-su.

143
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,923
Si-an's asking for too much
to expect that.

144
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,425
She knows he's not that kind of person.

145
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,220
And she fell for who he was.

146
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,514
In such cases,
one person wants their partner to change.

147
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,682
-And the other says…
-Right.

148
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,808
"This is who I am."

149
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,601
They say, "You used to be like this."

150
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,687
They're always stuck in the past

151
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,856
-and bringing things up from then.
-Right.

152
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,943
But Jun-seo thinks, "I didn't change.
I've always been like this. Did I change?"

153
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:28,156
It's the start of their relationship,
so they set expectations for those things.

154
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,073
That's right.

155
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,434
They're in the same room.

156
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,729
-They're in there together now.
-The silence.

157
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,113
It's Min-seol.

158
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,451
Is she here to vent her frustrations?

159
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,577
Min-seol?

160
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,038
Hey.

161
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,623
I came to hang out.

162
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,127
Have you decided on anything?

163
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,837
Me?

164
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,548
I…

165
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:29,842
Yeah?

166
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,177
I'm going to push ahead.

167
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,887
To Jun-seo?

168
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,223
Nice. That's so cool.

169
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,725
But…

170
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,562
He went to Paradise with Si-an

171
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,149
to confirm his feelings for on her, right?

172
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,319
The best way to know
is to ask him when he returns.

173
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,321
I'm going to ask when he comes back,

174
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,240
but I'm worried about doing that.

175
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,492
I'm not sure how to bring it up.

176
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,536
I really struggle with people like him.

177
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,122
But honestly, Jun-seo needs to
let me know now, right?

178
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,457
Of course.

179
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:07,004
We had something
going on between us too.

180
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,342
He needs to clarify things,
so I can sort my feelings out.

181
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,177
Do I have to keep suffering like this?

182
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,890
I recommend asking him
and bringing it up first.

183
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,933
Ask him what?

184
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,143
Should I ask, "Want to drink
Johnnie Walker together?"

185
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,774
"Let's drink some Johnnie Walker…"

186
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,527
Which is better,
"Do you want to" or "Let's go"?

187
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,946
I'll say,
"Let's go drink some Johnnie Walker."

188
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:32,989
That sounds cuter.

189
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,198
Let's practice.

190
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,617
-Practice what?
-Someone pretend to be Jun-seo.

191
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,535
-Practice?
-Okay.

192
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,578
I'll start.

193
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,620
Go ahead.

194
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,289
Jun-seo, we need to talk.

195
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,290
-Sure.
-Let's talk.

196
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,207
Okay.

197
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,126
We walk.

198
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,128
-We walk and sit down.
-We sit down.

199
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,254
She's unbelievable.

200
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,171
Why?

201
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,673
-Go on. It's fun.
-We sit down.

202
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,633
-How was Paradise?
-Well…

203
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,926
Did you have fun?

204
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,637
-Yeah, we talked about this and that.
-This is hilarious.

205
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,723
Then, did you drink Johnnie Walker?

206
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,642
Let's pretend that he didn't.

207
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,315
-My goodness.
-She's adorable.

208
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,233
He didn't have any, okay?

209
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,236
You asked me
if I wanted to go to Paradise.

210
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,614
Yeah, mention that
and say he gave you the wrong idea.

211
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,198
"I have absolutely no idea."

212
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,951
"I'm just so confused."
That's what I'll say.

213
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,869
You're so hilarious.

214
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,287
-It's insane.
-"Seriously."

215
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,789
"I couldn't sleep at all, Jun-seo."

216
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,334
"Why did you even ask me
if I wanted to go?"

217
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,045
"Why did you look at me
like you were going to pick me?"

218
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,504
-I'll do that.
-Say you were upset.

219
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,673
-Like, "I was upset!"
-"I was upset!"

220
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,925
Yeah. Like, "I thought it would be me!"

221
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,677
"My roommates thought I was going."

222
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,137
"We even said our goodbyes."

223
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,263
-Nice!
-I should say that.

224
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,348
-It's good.
-Is that good?

225
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,265
I love it.

226
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,892
-You think it's okay?
-That's my style.

227
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,602
You're so adorable.

228
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,229
Thanks to Min-seol,

229
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,439
the vibe on Single's Inferno

230
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,066
-is so much brighter.
-Right.

231
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,359
I appreciate it so much.

232
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,152
-It's refreshing.
-Yeah, it's so nice.

233
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,570
Her energy is so positive.

234
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,951
Goodbye.

235
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,083
I got a dopamine rush. It's crazy.

236
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,047
Are you sleepy?

237
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,174
Lean on me.

238
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,764
Wow, we're above the clouds.

239
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,063
Jeong-su.

240
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,691
-Why do they keep sitting like that?
-Right?

241
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,361
If I were Jun-seo,
I would've switched seats.

242
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,012
Take a nap.

243
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,141
Time to sleep.

244
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:16,527
In the helicopter,
I saw her head on Jun-seo's shoulder.

245
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,362
So…

246
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,117
Since I tend to be a bit conservative,

247
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,453
I had a hard time accepting that

248
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,122
and found myself thinking a lot.

249
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,625
So he's the conservative type.

250
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,212
If he has a hard time accepting that,

251
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,256
did he expect her
to lean on his shoulder then?

252
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,133
Conservative or not,

253
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,761
if a woman I'm interested in
leans on another guy's shoulder…

254
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,889
-Of course, I'd be bothered.
-You'd be bothered.

255
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,683
-It's annoying.
-Yeah, he might start to think,

256
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,728
"She has more interest
in Jun-seo than me."

257
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,645
-For sure.
-Yeah.

258
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,483
I actually see Jeong-su's reaction
as a positive sign,

259
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,735
because being jealous like that means

260
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,821
he has genuine feelings for her.

261
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,408
But even though Jeong-su has
genuine feelings for Si-an,

262
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,370
has he given her
a definite, clear response of how he feels

263
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,498
and expressed them to her?

264
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,415
He hasn't.

265
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,000
But he's sure of his feelings now.

266
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,920
Si-an doesn't know that now though.

267
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,463
-She doesn't know.
-Yeah.

268
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,507
-Right.
-Things just haven't worked out.

269
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,842
This turned out great.

270
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,802
-Yeah, it's great.
-Yeah.

271
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,180
I think this turned out well too.

272
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,681
This one's cute.

273
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,476
-Theo…
-He looks so thin.

274
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,603
-He's become so gaunt.
-He looks haggard.

275
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,604
I'm not surprised.

276
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,231
Is that Si-an next to you?

277
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,774
-I definitely took this photo.
-Yeah.

278
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,733
You took it well.

279
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,652
-The flower ring I gave her.
-Where?

280
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,320
You two look like a couple.

281
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,363
That one looks so cool.

282
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,629
You miss her.

283
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,588
What?

284
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,632
You miss Si-an, don't you?

285
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,633
Be quiet.

286
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,636
-What is it?
-Give me the photo. I'll put it up.

287
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,179
He misses Si-an so much

288
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,306
that he was staring at it longingly,
as if he'd cry.

289
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,933
-It was a yawn.
-Give us one.

290
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,976
I thought I'd ask.

291
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:12,935
I just yawned.

292
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,272
Si-an went to Paradise, so…

293
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,192
But who knows if going to Paradise
will make feelings grow deeper or not?

294
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,236
Or will things stay the same?

295
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,946
It's uncertain.

296
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,949
I tried to make myself
not become impatient.

297
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,205
Where is everyone?

298
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,957
We're back.

299
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,292
-Wait, no.
-We're finally back.

300
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,752
-I said I wouldn't greet them like that.
-Right.

301
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,338
I need to behave properly
to match my outfit today.

302
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,965
Elegant and graceful.

303
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,383
You've already failed at that.

304
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,766
-Thanks for carrying my bag.
-Sure.

305
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,935
-No problem.
-Bye.

306
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,188
Want me to get the door for you?

307
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,107
Si-an's got it.

308
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,202
How was it? I'm so curious.

309
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,038
-Us?
-Yeah.

310
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,917
It was super fun,
and I had a really good time.

311
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,629
-We had become close on Inferno.
-Right.

312
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,130
-She's listening.
-Yeah.

313
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,048
Yeah.

314
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,510
Going to Paradise after becoming close
made it more comfortable and fun.

315
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,764
-It felt much different and relaxed.
-I bet.

316
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,058
-He's funny.
-You must get along really well.

317
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,809
Yeah, more than I expected.

318
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,520
We were both
goofing around with each other.

319
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,438
I see.

320
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,399
After seeing him on Inferno,
I didn't expect he'd be like that.

321
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,610
It was kind of like that.

322
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,952
We were out of water then.

323
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,705
Time to go see Hye-jin.

324
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,835
Here she comes.

325
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,629
-It's her!
-Hye-jin?

326
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,172
-Hi.
-She's here.

327
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,715
Here she comes.

328
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,597
-Why are you back so early?
-Right?

329
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,140
What did you do yesterday?

330
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,852
Yesterday? We ate ramyeon
and had a party among ourselves.

331
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,480
Yeah, and we all talked with each other.

332
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,815
That must've been nice.

333
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,776
Theo was something else yesterday.

334
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,194
He was something else.

335
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,822
-Why?
-It was just the way he was talking.

336
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,781
I see.

337
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,324
Theo…

338
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,618
Theo.

339
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,621
No.

340
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,832
No?

341
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,459
Did you have fun?

342
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,087
-Did you have fun?
-It was just…

343
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,089
It was fun, but…

344
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,218
I don't know.

345
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,512
I guess he was just tired.

346
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,848
I don't know. Overall, it was just…

347
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01,895
I guess I had my hopes up a bit
since we had a nice time the day before.

348
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,522
Since it was back-to-back?

349
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,734
Yeah, since we went back-to-back,
I think I was expecting more.

350
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,029
-I guess more of an emotional connection?
-Communication.

351
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,032
I think I wanted us to be more expressive.

352
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:18,037
Jun-seo isn't exactly
the warm and affectionate type.

353
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,580
-You know?
-That's right.

354
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,789
-He's a "tough guy."
-Yeah.

355
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,915
He's like a beast.

356
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,916
-"A beast."
-Yeah.

357
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,377
He's always saying, "Hey."

358
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,337
Right. Like, "Hey, you did that?"

359
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,464
Yeah, "Hey, you did that?"

360
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,965
So it wasn't just to me.

361
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,342
-I was hurt over that.
-Yeah, me too.

362
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,137
So I kept reminding him
to call me by my name.

363
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,389
-Right.
-He kept calling me, "Hey."

364
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,308
-That's how he calls you?
-He's always like…

365
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,268
-"Hey, what did you do?"
-Like, "Hey." Right.

366
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,728
-It was just…
-I see.

367
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,979
-It was…
-I asked him too.

368
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,690
"Are you usually like this,
or are you too comfortable with me?"

369
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,816
I asked him in Paradise.

370
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,070
He does tell me he likes things.

371
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,488
-Yeah.
-But…

372
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,407
I'm not sure if he means it.

373
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,992
-Jun-seo?
-He says he likes things.

374
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:57,910
-Right.
-Yeah.

375
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,913
"Yeah, I liked it. It was nice."
But that's pretty much it.

376
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,289
It's the same with me.

377
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,208
He's like that with me too.

378
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,963
That's all he says to me.
"It was nice," and that's it.

379
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,590
Oh my god, that's not good.

380
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,513
I don't know. So it's a little…

381
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:23,936
He definitely said he liked me,
but it doesn't feel genuine.

382
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,938
He said he liked you?

383
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,439
I get what you mean.

384
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,650
-Why? How come it doesn't feel genuine?
-What?

385
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,318
Why does it not feel genuine?

386
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,319
I don't know.

387
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,490
Maybe he was just tired yesterday,
or maybe I was expecting too much.

388
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:40,536
Or maybe Jun-seo and I
have different approaches to things.

389
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,787
So I told him.

390
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,956
I told him what I didn't like

391
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,960
and asked him to be
a bit warmer and kinder.

392
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,962
-He said he'd try to adapt.
-Right.

393
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,506
-And he said he'd work on it.
-Right.

394
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,093
You even talked about that kind of stuff?

395
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,470
Then, he's totally into Si-an.

396
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,266
I didn't know you talked
about that kind of stuff.

397
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,686
But… I almost forgot.

398
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,770
We were eating.

399
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,105
-We were eating together.
-Okay.

400
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,898
And we were talking about things,

401
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,778
and he said something like,
"Min-seol's been weighing on my mind."

402
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,531
Or something like, "She is on my mind."

403
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,574
-Anyway…
-Really?

404
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,285
Min-seol's name came up,
and I was so flustered.

405
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,207
My goodness, Kim Min-seol.

406
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,585
She started grinning.

407
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,671
How can she be so obvious?

408
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,048
Nothing that happened before matters.

409
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,885
Min-seol's name came up,
and I was so flustered.

410
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,597
I was like, "Jeez."

411
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,935
I thought Jun-seo only saw me
as like a close little sister,

412
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,230
but to hear he was still thinking of me
even in Paradise…

413
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,984
I feel bad for Si-an,
but that made me happy.

414
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,153
I had a hard time trying not to smile.

415
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,616
But I have something to share too.

416
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,912
He came up to me and asked
if I wanted to go to Paradise.

417
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,330
-Really?
-Yeah.

418
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,957
He asked me if I wanted to go.

419
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:14,129
He told me he likes drinking whiskey,
and he said he likes Johnnie Walker.

420
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,049
I said, "Let's have some the next time
we go to Paradise together."

421
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,259
Yesterday, I heard he drank whiskey.

422
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,136
So I asked him about it.

423
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,305
And he said,
"I haven't had Johnnie Walker yet."

424
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,642
-That's what he said. That's why…
-What on earth?

425
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,269
So I was expecting
to go to Paradise yesterday.

426
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,395
I got my hopes up.

427
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,855
We even said our goodbyes.

428
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,773
-Right.
-Yeah.

429
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,651
-But he suddenly picked Si-an…
-I thought he'd pick Min-seol.

430
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,110
I was so shocked.

431
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,738
So I was thinking
if I got a chance to talk to him,

432
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,824
I really want to ask why he approached me.

433
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,409
But…

434
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,830
On our first trip to Paradise,

435
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,960
I was feeling so much pressure and stress,

436
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,169
and I had a lot on my mind.

437
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,923
But something Jun-seo said then
really stuck with me.

438
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,926
"You don't have to pick me.
I'm choosing you."

439
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,927
-He said that?
-Really?

440
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,886
He told me that.

441
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,346
-The day before yesterday?
-Yeah.

442
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,350
-During your first Paradise date?
-Yeah, during our first Paradise date.

443
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,145
But then,
when we were eating the next day,

444
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,691
he said you were on his mind.

445
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,817
Why bring that up?

446
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,735
It felt like
he couldn't focus on the date.

447
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,196
-But why…
-It could've been because he was tired.

448
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,365
I'm saying why would he tell you that?

449
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,493
Why would he tell you
that I was on his mind?

450
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,455
Anyway, he looked unhappy the whole time.

451
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,958
-You know that awkward feeling, right?
-Yeah.

452
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,960
We finish eating,

453
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,004
and he says, "Let's go,"
and immediately gets up.

454
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,755
-And we hadn't talked much.
-What?

455
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,508
What on earth?

456
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,885
Seriously.

457
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,137
Exactly.

458
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,349
This confusion I'm feeling
isn't wrong, right?

459
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,019
I'm not going crazy, am I?

460
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,064
How interesting.

461
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,774
Yeah, it really is.

462
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,609
Interesting.

463
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,990
I think this could be something
that causes Si-an to waver again.

464
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,367
-This conversation in their room.
-Of course.

465
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,079
Because the person who she thought
was completely focused on her

466
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,080
seems to have said

467
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,541
-similar things to Min-seol.
-Exactly.

468
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,710
-And she could start overthinking again.
-Yeah.

469
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,379
I don't think Min-seol
was trying to stir things up.

470
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,799
There were things on her mind
she was genuinely curious about

471
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,509
and just let them all out.

472
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,594
-Yes.
-Right?

473
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,596
I mean, she hadn't said much

474
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,639
until Si-an said
Jun-seo was thinking about her.

475
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,224
Then, it poured out of her.

476
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,310
-Right.
-That's when she mentioned Johnnie Walker.

477
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,146
-She's not lying.
-Yes, it is true.

478
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:40,817
But from Si-an's perspective,
she could totally get the wrong idea.

479
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,278
Jun-seo is just…

480
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,571
That scared me.

481
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,742
Today, the women will play a game

482
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,827
to win a date in Paradise.

483
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,828
Come on, no way.

484
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,246
Unbelievable.

485
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,917
Please gather at the pool.

486
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,461
Why is it the pool again?

487
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,378
Incredible.

488
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,882
-I'm suddenly feeling stressed out.
-I'm getting stressed again.

489
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:04,800
Please.

490
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,810
They have to make them fall in.

491
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:15,852
You're right.

492
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,354
I guess you push each other in.

493
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,314
Here they come.

494
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,626
This is too brutal.

495
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,130
I'm scared.

496
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,465
Please, I'm begging you.

497
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,467
-I'm scared. Is it this?
-I really want to go.

498
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,969
-Pushing people off?
-It's possible.

499
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,388
This is the most nervous I've ever been.

500
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,389
Me too.

501
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:59,855
Today, the women will be competing
in a game for a date in Paradise.

502
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:07,654
Only the top three winners in order
of their ranking can each pick a man,

503
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,323
to take on a date to Paradise.

504
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,536
Today's game is called…

505
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,205
"Push Off the Buoy."

506
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,540
Is that the buoy?

507
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,000
We need to push that?

508
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,543
-So we get on top…
-We stand on it.

509
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,170
We push from on top of it?

510
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,591
The women will stand
on top of the buoy and wait.

511
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:32,596
When the whistle blows, they will try
to push each other off the buoy.

512
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,058
The risky thing about this game is

513
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,770
you'll see some awesome moments
but also embarrassing ones too.

514
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,815
The girls are going to compete
so fiercely this time.

515
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,359
Hae-lin, A-rin, and Min-seol
will try really hard.

516
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,070
-You're right.
-It's going to be vicious.

517
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,072
-My gosh.
-What do we do?

518
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:55,285
The three winners of the preliminaries
will advance to the finals.

519
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,870
Please let me make it to the finals.

520
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,040
The matchups will be decided
by drawing balls.

521
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,960
If three people pick the same color,

522
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,047
they will have a three-way match
in the preliminaries.

523
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,718
-A three-way match…
-That'll be the hardest.

524
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,179
-The matchups will be crucial.
-That's right.

525
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,765
I just want to avoid Si-an.

526
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,727
Kim A-rin will draw the first ball.

527
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,606
Please not the three-way match.

528
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,360
-Green.
-Kim A-rin, green.

529
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,656
What is it?

530
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,078
Chung You-jin, red.

531
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,792
Please pick a selected color.

532
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,759
Lee Si-an, green.

533
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,680
Lee Si-an, green.

534
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,014
It might be a three-way match.

535
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,727
What?

536
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,730
Kim Hye-jin, green.

537
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,648
What?

538
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,899
It's a three-way match!

539
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,402
-My gosh!
-My gosh!

540
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,320
GREEN BALL
A-RIN, SI-AN, HYE-JIN

541
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,363
Wow, that's insane.

542
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,365
Take it easy on me, will you?

543
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,452
It's not going to be easy.

544
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,996
We have a three-way match already.

545
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,163
Yeah, that's right.

546
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,171
Park Hae-lin, yellow.

547
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,173
Kim Min-seol, yellow.

548
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,217
-Hae-lin, I want to go to Paradise.
-I want to go.

549
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,011
-Me too.
-Gosh, fate is cruel.

550
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:36,970
I want to go too.

551
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,598
Bae Ji-yeon, red.

552
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,684
RED BALL - YOU-JIN VS JI-YEON

553
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,185
I'm so scared!

554
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,856
-Let's not be left behind today.
-Yeah, let's not.

555
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,358
-Please, let's leave.
-Yeah, us three should stop.

556
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,152
But we have no choice. One has to stay.

557
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,237
But I'm going against Si-an.

558
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,073
First, those who picked the red ball,

559
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,658
Chung You-jin and Bae Ji-yeon.

560
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,618
Please climb onto the buoy.

561
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,078
-Good luck.
-Let's go!

562
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,705
-Good luck!
-You can do it.

563
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,500
Gosh, it's freezing!

564
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,211
It must be cold.

565
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,590
It's so slippery.

566
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,971
Ji-yeon, I'm scared.

567
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,222
Are you good at sports?

568
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,267
Are you? I think you are.

569
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,520
But I've never tried
anything like this before.

570
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,190
I don't know who'll win.
Doesn't Ji-yeon work out a lot?

571
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,734
-They both seem athletic.
-Really?

572
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,612
You-jin has strong legs,
so she might maintain good balance.

573
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,696
Yeah.

574
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,616
Jeez, your stance looks so stable.

575
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,368
Why are you so stable?

576
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,036
I'm so scared.

577
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,287
She's only saying that.

578
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,997
What if she suddenly changes?

579
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,165
Get ready.

580
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,461
Good luck.

581
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,269
My gosh.

582
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,814
"I'm scared"!

583
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,940
"I'm so scared"!

584
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,944
Ji-yeon!

585
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,159
Wow, a chokehold?

586
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,327
That's a chokehold.

587
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,164
Wow, Ji-yeon!

588
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,249
Ji-yeon!

589
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,088
This is scary.

590
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,589
It's so fun!

591
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,351
No!

592
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,687
-Ji-yeon!
-Ji-yeon!

593
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,071
She's not pulling her hair, right?

594
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,908
Wow, Ji-yeon!

595
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:04,826
Ji-yeon!

596
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,247
Tickle, tickle.

597
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,415
Tickle, tickle.

598
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,252
Brownie points for cuteness.

599
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,420
Tickle, tickle.

600
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,088
Tickle, tickle!

601
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:19,841
No!

602
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:23,720
No!

603
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,681
It's not working.

604
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,016
My goodness!

605
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,726
No!

606
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,687
Wait!

607
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,938
No!

608
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,782
Bae Ji-yeon is eliminated.

609
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,159
The winner is Chung You-jin.

610
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,702
-Great job.
-They're fiercer than us.

611
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,703
I'm sorry.

612
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,331
She used her head.

613
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,000
Wow, this is intense.

614
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,085
This game is so fun.

615
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,046
-Ji-yeon won in cuteness.
-I agree.

616
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,423
"Tickle, tickle" was so charming.

617
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,717
Good job.

618
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,221
Those who picked the yellow ball,
Park Hae-lin and Kim Min-seol.

619
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,515
-Let's go!
-Please climb onto the buoy.

620
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,225
You can do it.

621
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,104
Two people who are eager to go
are up again.

622
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,022
Jeez, this game.

623
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,316
Both Min-seol and Hae-lin are desperate.

624
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,234
-Right.
-Exactly.

625
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,777
-They need to win.
-Yeah. Gosh.

626
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,363
-These two like different guys too.
-Yes.

627
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,699
Why is it us?

628
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,493
I know, right?

629
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,538
I haven't been to Paradise in days.

630
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,082
I have no idea
what's happening on the outside.

631
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,335
I need to win today
and go to Paradise with Jun-seo.

632
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,337
I have no choice but to settle things.

633
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,715
First off, I'm pretty strong.

634
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,343
And I'm tall, so I thought
I'd have an edge in this game.

635
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,554
My heart's racing.

636
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,390
Get ready.

637
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,441
She's strong.

638
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,569
-She's in position.
-What? It's already over?

639
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,153
She's just going to push like that?

640
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,408
Lower your stance!

641
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,285
Get low!

642
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,120
Hae-lin is no joke!

643
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,252
-No, Min-seol!
-Grab her leg, Min-seol.

644
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,962
Grab her leg. Go low.

645
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,381
Grab her leg. Go low.

646
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,677
Nice!

647
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,264
-She's turned the tables!
-Really?

648
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,724
She follows instructions well.

649
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,725
-Nice!
-You can do it!

650
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,894
-Nice!
-A bit more!

651
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,440
It's anyone's game.

652
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,150
-Push!
-Come on!

653
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,693
-Push!
-Push her!

654
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,112
-Push!
-Come on!

655
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,405
-I'm out of strength.
-Oh no.

656
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,489
She's exhausted.

657
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,909
She's up.

658
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:54,913
She lifted her…

659
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,960
No!

660
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,046
-Oh no!
-Oh no!

661
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,047
Leg splits!

662
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,716
-I won't go in.
-No!

663
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,468
No, I'm not going in!

664
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,719
I'm not going in!

665
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,721
No, I'm not going in!

666
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,139
I'm not going in!

667
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,016
-A chokehold!
-She's hanging in there!

668
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,768
My gosh!

669
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,605
No, I'm not going in!

670
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,065
I'm not going in!

671
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,484
No!

672
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,860
Min-seol!

673
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,531
"I'm not going in!" My goodness!

674
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,950
Yeah, don't go in.

675
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,661
No!

676
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,746
Min-seol!

677
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,341
Kim Min-seol is eliminated.

678
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,468
The winner is Park Hae-lin.

679
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,971
-She's so strong.
-Right?

680
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,263
I'm so tired.

681
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,768
Our poor youngest cast member.

682
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,687
That was intense.

683
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,105
Gosh, she tried so hard.

684
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,316
-Good job.
-You did great.

685
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,486
You were so good, Hae-lin.

686
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,035
She looks really disappointed.

687
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,581
-I'm curious about the three-way match.
-Me too.

688
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,793
All three of us
have different people in mind, so…

689
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,837
-I'm so nervous.
-I'm more nervous.

690
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,380
It's all your fault!

691
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,215
I'm so nervous.

692
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,299
Seriously.

693
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,136
Those who picked the green ball,

694
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,055
Kim A-rin, Lee Si-an, and Kim Hye-jin.

695
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,683
Please climb onto the buoy.

696
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,019
A three-way match
isn't going to be easy.

697
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,937
-They'll target Si-an first.
-I agree

698
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,689
-The other two will.
-Most likely.

699
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,274
It's because she seems strong.

700
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,859
-Right.
-She has a good physique too.

701
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,776
That's true.

702
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:50,903
I can do this.

703
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,579
Let's go, Lee Si-an!

704
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,625
Lucky you.

705
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,710
Let's go.

706
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,046
-You can do it.
-Let's go, Hye-jin!

707
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,510
Please start when the whistle blows.

708
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:15,928
Get ready.

709
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,990
Wow, what on earth?

710
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:36,908
What?

711
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,707
Oh my goodness!

712
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,125
Both of them?

713
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,183
-Wow, what on earth?
-What?

714
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,434
My goodness!

715
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,352
This is no joke.

716
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,486
Kim A-rin is eliminated.

717
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,363
-See? It's game over.
-Right.

718
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,948
She had no chance.

719
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,160
No, I don't want to.

720
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,370
-Hold on.
-Okay.

721
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,871
-Okay. Get up.
-Wait!

722
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,164
Please have mercy on me.

723
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,879
What if she pushes after begging?

724
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,548
-Go easy on me, will you?
-Okay.

725
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,882
Okay?

726
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,008
Okay?

727
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,013
She's so scary.

728
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,225
She is folded up like a piece of paper.

729
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,061
No!

730
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,605
-Hye-jin, get back up!
-Hang in there!

731
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,286
My gosh, look at them.

732
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,204
-Gosh, they're kicking.
-What is happening?

733
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,757
Hye-jin is doing great.

734
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,050
Watching them wears me out.

735
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,135
Hang in there!

736
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,222
Wait, hold on.

737
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,391
Hold on. I'm so exhausted.

738
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,520
You look like slave hunters.

739
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,526
Hold on.

740
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,534
You need to sit.

741
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,414
You need to sit.

742
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,833
No!

743
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,001
-No!
-No!

744
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,587
-Oh no!
-My gosh!

745
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,214
She slipped! No!

746
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,635
-What?
-She hung on?

747
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,886
She's like a roly-poly toy!

748
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,221
-She didn't fall!
-She survived?

749
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,977
She survived.

750
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,906
You just have to push!

751
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:22,823
A little more!

752
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,908
-There you go!
-Push!

753
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,637
Hey, girl.

754
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,808
They're amazing! Seriously.

755
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,977
That's incredible.

756
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,229
They must be exhausted.

757
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,564
Just fall in already.

758
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm so exhausted.

759
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,988
-Let's go! Give it your all!
-It's so tiring.

760
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,198
-You can do it!
-I thought I was going to die.

761
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,491
-Hang in there!
-Hang in there!

762
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,617
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

763
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,124
Use your last bit of strength!

764
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,336
Use your last bit of strength!

765
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,136
She might get pushed out.

766
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,929
-Hold on.
-She's holding on again.

767
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,231
Drop her in!

768
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,316
No!

769
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,737
-Lift!
-She's lifting her?

770
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,821
Is that possible?

771
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,864
Drop her in!

772
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,240
No!

773
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,201
Hang in there.

774
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,369
Hang in there.

775
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,706
Kim Hye-jin is eliminated.

776
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,624
The winner is Lee Si-an.

777
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,002
No.

778
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,379
-Si-an must be really strong.
-She is.

779
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,214
-That was no joke.
-What an epic match.

780
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,174
It was an epic match.

781
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,383
You did great.

782
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,593
Seriously. Goodness.

783
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,056
You're too strong.

784
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,814
The final round will be a three-way match.

785
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,859
Chung You-jin,
Park Hae-lin, and Lee Si-an.

786
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,527
Please come out and get ready.

787
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,445
Let's go.

788
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,197
They must be exhausted, right?

789
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,948
I can't bear to watch.

790
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,411
My arms are dead.

791
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,501
Dong-ho, go and have fun.

792
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,879
I'll be here, so have fun.

793
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,800
Hae-lin is good.

794
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,843
You definitely need
long arms and legs to use

795
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,720
-strength in a wide range of motion.
-Right.

796
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,765
But Si-an just finished that last game.

797
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,058
-She might be tired.
-Right.

798
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:57,061
That's why I said target her first
as a team and then fight.

799
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,647
Because they both want to go with Dong-ho.

800
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,943
Please start when the whistle blows.

801
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,444
Get ready.

802
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,710
What on earth?

803
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,672
I said to team up,
but they went for each other.

804
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,965
It must be because of Dong-ho.

805
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,842
A battle for Dong-ho.

806
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,926
What on earth?

807
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,054
I just needed You-jin to fall in.

808
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,766
As soon as it started,
Hae-lin came right at me.

809
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,601
It became a fight for Dong-ho.

810
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,853
Damn it. No.

811
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,107
What are you doing, Hae-lin?

812
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,277
Then, let me.

813
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,321
"Then, let me."

814
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,031
"I'm scared."

815
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,366
Then, let me.

816
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,498
Hae-lin is so good.

817
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,001
-She knows how to play.
-She's the dark horse.

818
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,339
My gosh, no!

819
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,011
My gosh, no!

820
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,679
No! Don't get pushed!

821
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,222
-What on earth?
-My gosh!

822
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,932
-They teamed up?
-They're pushing her.

823
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,769
My gosh, no!

824
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,939
No! Don't get pushed!

825
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,774
-Oh no!
-Her body is twisted.

826
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,570
No! Don't get pushed!

827
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,906
Chung You-jin is eliminated.

828
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,243
I took a hit to the gut,

829
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,331
and I wanted to hold on,
but it knocked the wind out of me.

830
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,875
Then Si-an came over, and I fell in.

831
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,253
Hae-lin is so strong.

832
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,430
She flipped her.

833
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,973
It's basically game over.

834
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,393
This is scary.

835
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,686
My goodness.

836
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,576
I have to hand it to Si-an.

837
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,245
-Seriously.
-At the end…

838
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,121
This is scary.

839
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,122
My goodness.

840
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,878
Park Hae-lin is eliminated.

841
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,588
The winner is Lee Si-an.

842
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,923
She's one scary woman.

843
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,676
I'm suddenly scared of her now.

844
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,635
She's a warrior.

845
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,844
That was strategic.

846
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:36,929
How adorable.

847
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,849
The women's game
to win a date in Paradise.

848
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,435
Here are the final rankings.

849
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,020
First place is Lee Si-an.

850
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,189
Second place is Park Hae-lin.

851
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,275
Third place is Chung You-jin.

852
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:54,280
The top three women from this game

853
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,825
will each choose a man
in the afternoon to go to Paradise with.

854
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,712
Si-an is incredible.

855
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,966
That was the most intense
women's game we've seen.

856
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,384
-It was amazing.
-Yes.

857
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,262
-She won that three-way match too.
-Yeah.

858
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,346
That was pretty fun.

859
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,140
I really enjoyed watching that.

860
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,642
That was like watching
a men's mud pit wrestling match.

861
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,560
It was intense.

862
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,855
I guess Si-an is made for Paradise.

863
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,274
-It's her destiny to stay there.
-She's destined to go.

864
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,191
It is?

865
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,570
Isn't she the only one who's gone
to Paradise every single day?

866
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,406
She gets chosen a lot,
wins games, and is strong.

867
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,033
There's no beating her.

868
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,743
-You can't.
-She's overpowered.

869
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:44,788
But I was curious as to why
Si-an was trying so hard.

870
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,750
As the first-place winner,
she chooses someone to go with.

871
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,543
Did she want that right to choose?

872
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,546
I think it had nothing to do with that,
and it was just competitiveness.

873
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,464
You think so?

874
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:57,134
No, I think she definitely has
someone she wants to go with.

875
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,428
There's only a few days left now.

876
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,139
She needs to confirm her feelings

877
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,058
for the person she wants.

878
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,352
-In my humble opinion, I think…
-Jeong-su?

879
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,645
Ultimately,

880
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,980
-Si-an will end up with Jeong-su.
-Yeah.

881
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,941
In any case, the reason why
she put in so much effort to win…

882
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,693
-We'll find out soon.
-Yes.

883
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,738
-There was also the fight for Dong-ho.
-Right.

884
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,033
We saw two women
fighting each other for Dong-ho.

885
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,494
Hae-lin did say the night before

886
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:27,581
that she was determined
to go with Dong-ho.

887
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,667
-She looked the most desperate.
-Exactly.

888
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,962
The look in her eyes and her attitude
showed her determination to take Dong-ho.

889
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,172
-Right.
-Yeah.

890
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,549
Min-seol seemed desperate too.

891
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,635
-Right.
-"I don't want to fall in!"

892
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,679
-No one did it half-heartedly.
-Right.

893
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,014
Si-an's preliminary match
was like a finals match.

894
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,140
-Right.
-Exactly.

895
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,393
-I became sad and quiet after I saw that.
-Yeah.

896
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,604
I couldn't bear to watch either.
It was scary.

897
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,190
I didn't expect Hae-lin to do that well.

898
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,111
But she did mention
she was confident she'd do well in games.

899
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,529
You-jin came in third, right?

900
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,571
Yeah, that's right.

901
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,782
Then, if Hae-lin doesn't pick Dong-ho,

902
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,743
there's a chance You-jin could pick him.

903
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,789
If she had fun with Jeong-su yesterday,
it's likely she'll pick him.

904
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,998
-Was it fun yesterday?
-What?

905
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:10,916
Was it fun?

906
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,084
She's a comedian.

907
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,252
She's totally a comedian.

908
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,545
-She's charming.
-So charming.

909
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,963
I am curious about her feelings.

910
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,173
-You-jin?
-We had a double date yesterday.

911
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,550
-Really?
-At the pub.

912
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,511
You-jin and Jeong-su
seemed like they were having a blast.

913
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,346
-Their vibe…
-They really clicked?

914
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,597
They got along the best.

915
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,307
-But not in that way.
-Who will she pick?

916
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,225
Really?

917
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,227
-We're like friends.
-She feels like a friend?

918
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,812
Maybe they just have good banter.

919
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,480
Yeah.

920
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,192
But the key is who Si-an picks.

921
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,360
-I'm so curious.
-Right.

922
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:44,116
If Si-an picks Jeong-su,
You-jin won't be able to pick him.

923
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:48,328
I haven't seen Si-an
and Jeong-su together often,

924
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,746
so I don't know what's going on.

925
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,623
That might be why she'd choose him.

926
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,916
-Yeah.
-Exactly

927
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,668
I think she'll pick Theo.

928
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,589
But that could be a sign of her
making a final decision.

929
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,425
-In the end…
-It's okay to make a final decision now.

930
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,595
Right, but she might still feel confused.

931
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,639
If I were in Si-an's shoes,

932
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,058
I'd just choose whoever I like,

933
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:15,397
whether it be Jun-seo, Theo, or Jeong-su.

934
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,690
-Yeah.
-I think she'll do that.

935
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,817
And she seems like the type who'd do that.

936
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,571
There's no need to complicate things now.

937
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:27,409
I think there's no need
to consider anyone else.

938
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,620
Si-an's in the toughest spot.

939
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,371
She must have the biggest headache.

940
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,918
Games just aren't our strong suit.

941
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,170
Right.

942
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,672
How did I look during the game?
Did I seem too desperate?

943
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,090
Actually, you looked pretty.

944
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,008
-Really?
-Yeah.

945
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,302
-Really.
-But at the end…

946
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,471
-I shouldn't have grabbed her leg.
-Right.

947
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:50,432
Why did he tell me to do that?
He had no clue!

948
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,808
Grab her leg, Min-seol.

949
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,228
Grab her leg. Go low.

950
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,607
Why did he tell me to do that?
He had no clue!

951
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,318
I should've pushed her,
but he said to grab her leg.

952
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,153
That is hilarious.

953
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,988
It is a little disappointing.

954
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,282
-I'm so disappointed.
-Yeah.

955
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,118
Still, as long as we try our best,
it's fine.

956
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,036
You're right.

957
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,206
I gave it my all, but it didn't work.
It's not like I didn't try.

958
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:18,460
I tried my best. It just didn't work out.
I can't do anything about that.

959
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,380
It's all luck.
It's about matchup luck too.

960
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,589
You're right.

961
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,132
If we tried our best, it's fine.

962
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,094
-Yeah.
-You can't control

963
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,428
what happens in the end.

964
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,390
Instead of winning
because someone went easy on you…

965
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,349
Right.

966
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,394
It's better to lose
after trying your hardest.

967
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,311
That's true.

968
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,230
Are they all the ones who lost?

969
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,440
You're right. All of them were eliminated.

970
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,112
I'm so curious
about who Si-an will choose today.

971
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,614
-Right. I think it'll be Theo.
-She'll pick Theo.

972
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,699
Yeah.

973
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,367
Jun-seo's already gone twice.

974
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,577
Yeah.

975
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,289
I hope Jun-seo
doesn't go to Paradise today.

976
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:57,958
Hi.

977
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,669
You're all dressed up.

978
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,090
Want to head to our room? Or…

979
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,174
Over there.

980
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,092
Where?

981
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,051
Let's go there.

982
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,596
Let's go over there. It's pretty.

983
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,597
Okay.

984
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,349
Si-an, there are only two days left.

985
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,476
-Time flies, right?
-I know.

986
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,769
-Yeah.
-Gosh.

987
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:26,236
Is there a lot on your mind?
Or are you sorting things out?

988
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,365
I wanted to ask if my approach
has put too much pressure on you.

989
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,283
Not at all.

990
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:35,787
I always tell other people
that Theo doesn't put pressure on me.

991
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,415
I see. I just wanted to ask you that.

992
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:42,002
After coming back yesterday
or as time goes by…

993
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,465
if your feelings for Jun-seo
have grown more than feelings for me,

994
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,925
then my actions toward you
could make you uncomfortable.

995
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,427
And you'd worry about his reaction.

996
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,058
That's why I wanted to ask how you felt.

997
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,476
-Honestly…
-Yeah?

998
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,439
After two trips to Paradise with Jun-seo,

999
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,108
it's true that my feelings
for him have grown.

1000
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,109
Yeah.

1001
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,363
But it's not like I've chosen him either.

1002
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,280
Right.

1003
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,741
To be honest…

1004
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,414
It's so tough
to talk about this with you, but…

1005
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,332
Yeah.

1006
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,128
I figured it'd be better to hear it
from me than through someone else.

1007
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,046
Yeah.

1008
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,137
-Am I putting too much pressure on you?
-No, Theo.

1009
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,556
Should I keep it up?
Am I still on your mind?

1010
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,268
You have to tell me.
You know I like things to be clear.

1011
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,364
If I'm the lowest priority
among the three,

1012
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:56,284
then I don't want to pressure you anymore,
unless I'm second.

1013
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,290
There are only two days left.

1014
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,714
So you have to decide quickly.
Be true to yourself.

1015
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,049
I was true to myself
and made my choice to tell you.

1016
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:11,967
I…

1017
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,146
-For me…
-Yeah?

1018
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,939
-It's Jun-seo and…
-Yeah?

1019
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,361
Well…

1020
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,030
-Jeong-su.
-Yeah. Okay, I'm third in line.

1021
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,658
-It's down to those two.
-Okay, thank you.

1022
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:37,743
Theo…

1023
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,952
I wanted to hear that.

1024
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,293
All the flirting I've been doing…

1025
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,503
-Did it make you uncomfortable?
-No, I appreciated it.

1026
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,504
I see.

1027
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,008
-Theo, you were…
-Yeah?

1028
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:07,522
Gosh, I'm just…

1029
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,192
Honestly, I went full steam ahead
from the start,

1030
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,152
so I did it knowing I might get hurt.

1031
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:17,449
No, you always expressed
your feelings to me,

1032
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:21,369
so honestly,
I felt really drawn to you too.

1033
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,706
But I've kept going…

1034
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,334
-to Paradise.
-Yeah.

1035
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,835
And we were physically apart.

1036
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,086
That's right.

1037
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,589
I guess it became
out of sight, out of mind.

1038
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,049
Yeah, I agree.

1039
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,884
That was the biggest factor for me.

1040
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,220
-Right.
-Yeah.

1041
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,514
But honestly,

1042
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,643
there's no need
to cry or feel guilty about this.

1043
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,561
Because I don't have any regrets.

1044
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,524
In the real world,
I do express myself when I like someone.

1045
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,235
But I don't usually fall
for people this deeply and quickly.

1046
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,612
I'm not someone who falls in love easily.

1047
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,864
I kept wondering why I've felt this way.

1048
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,325
I realized the way I'd been treating you…

1049
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,243
Yeah?

1050
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,787
It was the same way
as when I first fell in love.

1051
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,873
-Right.
-That's why I fell for you so fast.

1052
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,961
So I don't regret anything.

1053
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,421
I mean, I did everything.
I even gave you flowers.

1054
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,714
Let me see your ring.

1055
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,675
And here's your flower ring.

1056
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,635
Isn't it pretty?

1057
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,387
"I missed you."

1058
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,266
-I'm leaving.
-Bye.

1059
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,183
Take this with you.

1060
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,936
I'll work hard
to chop firewood for you.

1061
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,980
And I'll cook warm meals for you.

1062
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:30,981
-Okay.
-Got it?

1063
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,692
I was grateful.

1064
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:37,028
Those were special times
and feelings for me too.

1065
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,823
Gosh.

1066
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,206
I didn't bring any tissues.

1067
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,710
Gosh.

1068
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,761
I have no regrets,
and I want to thank you.

1069
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,098
What's wrong with me?

1070
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,185
When you think of me,

1071
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,523
I hope you remember me
as someone who had an innocent heart

1072
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,817
and treated you like a first love.

1073
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,777
Yeah, of course.

1074
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,738
That's why I feel even more sorry.

1075
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,075
I was really happy and…

1076
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,036
My goodness.

1077
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,498
Gosh. I'm sorry, Theo.

1078
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:31,958
It's okay.

1079
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,462
When she said those words and cried,

1080
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,673
I felt more relieved and better.

1081
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,592
Rather than happy, I felt sad.

1082
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,844
But I think that's why I liked her.

1083
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,679
She's honest with her feelings.

1084
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,806
She's clear
about what she likes and dislikes.

1085
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,477
Stop! What are you doing?

1086
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,728
Which way do we go? This way?

1087
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:52,812
I don't know.

1088
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,078
No, you're good-looking.

1089
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,704
Thanks. You're pretty.

1090
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,461
Well…

1091
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,672
I feel relieved.

1092
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,511
-On Inferno…
-Yeah?

1093
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,475
I feel we didn't get to
spend much time together, so I'm sad.

1094
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,693
It's a bit…

1095
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,363
I told him I was sorry.

1096
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,866
I told Theo that I was turning him down.

1097
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,329
But it hurt more because it was Theo.

1098
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:56,084
He never pressured me,

1099
00:54:56,167 --> 00:55:02,382
and he always honestly expressed
how he felt to me.

1100
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:05,719
That's why I felt even worse
about rejecting him.

1101
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,429
I was so sad.

1102
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,774
-She knows how good of a person he is.
-Right.

1103
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:20,817
When she rejected him…

1104
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,402
-She felt bad.
-Yes, she felt so bad

1105
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,487
-and had a heavy heart.
-Right.

1106
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:30,577
A guy telling someone he loved them
as if they were his first love…

1107
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,245
-That was so cool.
-Right.

1108
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,539
I almost teared up when he said that.

1109
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,458
-That was how much…
-I was moved.

1110
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,376
He loved her like she was his first love.

1111
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,294
Gosh.

1112
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,088
When you love
without holding back like that,

1113
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,549
you have no regrets even if it ends.

1114
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,592
-Right.
-Seriously.

1115
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,510
If you gave it everything you had,

1116
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,764
when things end and you move on,
you have no regrets.

1117
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,223
Theo's such a remarkable person.

1118
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,975
He's probably at peace right now.

1119
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:54,934
-Yes.
-You're right.

1120
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,645
-Si-an won't forget him.
-She'll actually keep thinking of him.

1121
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,148
-She'll think back on him in her life.
-Yeah.

1122
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:03,359
Theo really makes a person think.

1123
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,237
-Are you feeling okay, Min-seol?
-What?

1124
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,489
Are you feeling okay?

1125
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,449
-Do I look okay?
-You don't.

1126
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,034
You didn't look okay.

1127
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,577
I feel really down right now.

1128
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:17,332
Just go talk with Jun-seo now.
He just went into the guys' room.

1129
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,710
-Ask him directly and clear things up.
-Yeah.

1130
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,254
-That'd be better than being unsure.
-It's straightforward.

1131
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,883
-Can I talk to him after dinner?
-The timing might be awkward then.

1132
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,594
It'd be better to do it now.
That's what I think.

1133
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,305
-Jun-seo seems to be in deep thought too.
-Yeah.

1134
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,723
Really?

1135
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,267
Okay, I'll go ask.

1136
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,650
Want to talk?

1137
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,485
-Me?
-Yeah.

1138
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,238
It looked like you had a lot on your mind.

1139
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,573
Not really.

1140
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,699
Really?

1141
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,078
She's the one with a lot on her mind.

1142
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:57,163
People say this spot is so nice.

1143
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,581
It's not bad.

1144
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,166
I think this is the best spot.

1145
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,376
-Really?
-Yeah.

1146
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,799
You must be really disappointed.

1147
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,759
-Me? I am.
-Yeah.

1148
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,637
It would've been nice
if you could've gone to Paradise more.

1149
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,224
Yeah. That's why I was so determined
to win today's game.

1150
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,183
Right.

1151
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,769
-But I failed miserably.
-Yeah.

1152
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:22,313
-Why did you do that?
-Right?

1153
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,108
You should've tried a bit harder.
I should've given you more tips.

1154
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,776
-I really tried my best.
-Yeah.

1155
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,029
You've been spoiled, haven't you?

1156
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,197
What are you talking about?

1157
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,949
Because you've gone to Paradise so much.

1158
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,160
-No.
-Honestly, you don't need to go today.

1159
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:36,870
Stop going.

1160
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,540
You've gone enough.

1161
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,835
-I don't need to go to Paradise.
-Yeah.

1162
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,588
But it can still hurt.

1163
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,548
-Your feelings?
-Yeah.

1164
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,800
-Why would they be hurt?
-I can get hurt if…

1165
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,098
Not being able to go
to Paradise isn't the issue.

1166
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,016
Right.

1167
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,727
It is what it is.

1168
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,270
-What did you say?
-What?

1169
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,105
What are you talking about by yourself?

1170
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:07,484
"What are you talking about?"

1171
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,776
"What are you talking about?"

1172
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,323
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

1173
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,366
-Me?
-Yeah, I was…

1174
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,037
-I was just really curious.
-Yeah.

1175
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,788
That's why I wanted to talk.

1176
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:21,873
Curious about what?

1177
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,043
-Well, after everyone left yesterday…
-Yeah?

1178
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:29,130
I wanted to know why
you wanted to talk to me.

1179
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,803
-I talked about this with Si-an too.
-Yeah.

1180
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:36,888
I just told her.

1181
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,434
At first, I saw Min-seol
as more of a little sister.

1182
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,770
-Yeah.
-But I said she's been on my mind.

1183
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,313
Right.

1184
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:49,609
I told her I hadn't fully figured out
how I feel about it.

1185
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,570
I told her over dinner yesterday
when I didn't have to.

1186
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,738
-Yesterday?
-Yeah.

1187
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:58,034
But the thing is I'm not curious
about what you did yesterday.

1188
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,994
I want to know why you approached me.

1189
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,831
I told you that's what Si-an
and I talked about.

1190
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,626
-So you can't talk about it?
-No, that you've been on my mind.

1191
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,087
-I see.
-That's why I wanted to talk with you.

1192
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,423
But I chose Si-an,
because I have stronger feelings for her.

1193
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:16,219
To sum it up, I talked with Si-an
and spent more time with her,

1194
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,471
and despite some tough moments,

1195
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,308
I was able to confirm
my feelings for Si-an in the end.

1196
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,145
I've come to terms with my feelings.

1197
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:31,609
At this point, what I'm nervous
and concerned about is

1198
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:35,655
giving my all to Si-an
and still not being enough for her.

1199
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,906
Also,

1200
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,076
I was trying to be honest

1201
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,829
but momentarily showed I was indecisive.

1202
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,123
It's up to Si-an to decide.

1203
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,795
-He expressed himself clearly here.
-Yes.

1204
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,800
That's why I started to wonder

1205
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:58,803
if I seemed like too much
of a friendly younger sister to you.

1206
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,179
That's what I thought at first.

1207
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,850
But in the middle,
I was a bit torn and confused.

1208
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,518
When? After we came back from Paradise?

1209
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,270
-Yeah, when we came back.
-Really?

1210
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,316
-You were torn and confused?
-Yeah, I was confused.

1211
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,900
Why? What was the reason?

1212
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:17,196
The reason was my second time
in Paradise was with you.

1213
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,489
-Yeah.
-So…

1214
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,533
I had someone to compare you to.

1215
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,660
-You-jin.
-Yeah, if we're splitting hairs.

1216
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,370
-Yeah.
-So…

1217
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,747
It wasn't trying to compare you.

1218
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:29,292
But the two situations naturally
started to overlap.

1219
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:33,838
I found myself enjoying it way more
during my second time.

1220
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,256
-Right.
-Yeah.

1221
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,884
-Just to put it simply.
-Yeah.

1222
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:42,513
The food tasted better,
and our conversations were so fun.

1223
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,767
I couldn't help but think,
"Isn't this just better?"

1224
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,726
Yeah.

1225
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,062
-That was the reason.
-Yeah.

1226
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,193
I see.

1227
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,403
That's how it was.

1228
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,241
I had no idea you were conflicted.

1229
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,078
-I don't usually show it outwardly.
-Exactly.

1230
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,788
That's why I didn't show it either.

1231
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:12,585
But you had been constantly on my mind.

1232
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,548
I've only been to Paradise with you.

1233
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,466
I know.

1234
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,803
I had so much fun with you.

1235
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,639
-I haven't gotten to know the others much.
-Yeah.

1236
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:29,852
I'm still in that position now
and don't think I'll learn much more.

1237
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:30,978
Yeah.

1238
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,524
So I'm going to keep choosing you.

1239
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,196
That's just how it is.

1240
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,206
-I'm not trying to pressure you.
-Right.

1241
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,749
I don't feel pressured.

1242
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,626
-You don't?
-It's just…

1243
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,961
Then, feel some pressure.

1244
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,505
It's so uncomfortable.

1245
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:58,548
Really?

1246
01:01:58,631 --> 01:01:59,549
No.

1247
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,678
I've come this far
trying to be honest too, so…

1248
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:04,762
Right.

1249
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,264
I get how you feel.

1250
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,015
But…

1251
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,643
-I don't want you to feel pressured.
-Yeah.

1252
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,895
But I do want you to think of me.

1253
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:18,317
I hope you don't feel
uncomfortable around me.

1254
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,153
-Okay, I won't.
-Yeah.

1255
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,739
-I'm fine.
-I'll do the same.

1256
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,949
Rather than uncomfortable,

1257
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,535
I just felt bad.

1258
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:28,745
I see.

1259
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,497
I wanted to talk about that.

1260
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,003
And I'm thankful to you
for talking to me.

1261
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:45,845
Well, if you don't go to Paradise today,
let's just have dinner.

1262
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,221
"Let's just have dinner."

1263
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,390
And we can talk more.

1264
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:55,855
My memories with Jun-seo
will remain for a long time afterwards.

1265
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,148
And I'm grateful to him.

1266
01:02:57,231 --> 01:03:00,777
That's why I feel
a love-hate thing for him.

1267
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,530
When I say "love-hate,"
I mean love and hate!

1268
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,657
It's infuriating.

1269
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,118
What can you do?
I just have to bear it.

1270
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,122
She's so adorable.

1271
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,751
She's Min-seol the baby! A little baby.

1272
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,921
With just a day or two left,

1273
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,881
-things are starting to sort out.
-Right.

1274
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,383
-Jun-seo made things clear.
-Yes.

1275
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,927
Min-seol won't be confused now.

1276
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,386
Right, she definitely won't be.

1277
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,139
They both said
the best things they could say.

1278
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,058
Not only Min-seol but Jun-seo as well

1279
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,393
-won't be confused.
-Right.

1280
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,604
-He'll keep moving forward.
-Yes.

1281
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:41,818
It's always tougher to be the one waiting
to be chosen than the one choosing.

1282
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,987
-I think so too. Right?
-Yeah.

1283
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,992
Yesterday, with Si-an…

1284
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:55,540
I held back on expressing myself
to the point that I felt bad about it.

1285
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,503
I regret that.

1286
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,841
-You held back?
-Yeah.

1287
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,594
It's because the pace here
is different from the outside world.

1288
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,264
But the idea that we have to make a choice

1289
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,100
and become a couple to create an outcome…

1290
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:19,897
I wondered if that's possible
with the level of intensity of this place.

1291
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,734
-It's not easy.
-Right.

1292
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:28,197
I'm definitely going to
move forward with Si-an now.

1293
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,035
-For sure?
-Yeah.

1294
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,329
-You've made up your mind?
-Yeah.

1295
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,843
So, who are you going to choose?

1296
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,596
Me?

1297
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,974
-But…
-Gosh.

1298
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,768
-Go on.
-I'm really…

1299
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,104
-What?
-Honestly, I'm really…

1300
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:03,107
I realized I was more serious
about this than I thought.

1301
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,108
I know, right?

1302
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:05,943
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you're about to cry now too.

1303
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,278
Yeah.

1304
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:13,409
Being interested
in multiple people at the same time is…

1305
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,953
It's been hard to handle.

1306
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,873
It's not something
that's possible outside.

1307
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,208
But here, it's possible.

1308
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,503
But I had feelings
for multiple people at once,

1309
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,839
so I just felt like I was…

1310
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,674
-Very…
-Overwhelmed?

1311
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,052
No, not overwhelmed.

1312
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,054
I just felt like a terrible person.

1313
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,264
-Don't think like that.
-I know.

1314
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,724
But it's also true.

1315
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:38,142
-Yeah.
-But…

1316
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,269
It changes from day to day.

1317
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:44,273
And every little action they did…

1318
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:47,610
-kept making my feelings change so quick.
-Right. True.

1319
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:50,529
Gosh, it must be driving you crazy.

1320
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,701
Seriously, in just these few days…

1321
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:59,455
But it's still… Yeah.

1322
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,626
When I'm in a relationship,

1323
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,879
I like spending a lot of time together
and being affectionate.

1324
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:10,466
I like having emotional interactions
that are really lovey-dovey,

1325
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,343
even if they're a little cheesy.

1326
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:16,764
But Jun-seo doesn't seem like

1327
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:21,268
a really warm or friendly type.

1328
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:24,981
So I thought if we dated,
there could be some issues.

1329
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:29,151
I might end up really upset.
That's what I was thinking.

1330
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,363
Honestly, you can't change
someone's personality.

1331
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,407
It's confusing.

1332
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,408
So…

1333
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:38,828
I don't know.

1334
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,622
I feel like my head's going to explode.

1335
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,005
She's very aware of their differences.

1336
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,007
She also knows personalities don't change.

1337
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:51,924
She knows.

1338
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,593
But I think Jun-seo
would be adorable in a relationship.

1339
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:59,515
Guys who are brusque but show affection
through actions are really charming too.

1340
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,808
-They're very charming.
-Yeah.

1341
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:04,061
But the problem for Si-an was
the way he talks to her.

1342
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,814
That was tough to tolerate for Si-an.

1343
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:09,817
In any case, Si-an said
she'd pick one of the two.

1344
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,277
-Yes.
-Jun-seo or Jeong-su.

1345
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,361
Right.

1346
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,572
But is she going to try
with Jeong-su one last time?

1347
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:15,489
I think so.

1348
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,575
-I think she'll choose Jeong-su.
-Me too.

1349
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:19,744
What do you think? He disagrees.

1350
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,912
Why do I feel like it'll be Jun-seo?

1351
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:26,042
The reason is if she had
a great time with Jun-seo yesterday,

1352
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,753
like their first date in Paradise,

1353
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,463
she'd definitely choose Jeong-su today.

1354
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,173
But yesterday was very disappointing.

1355
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:33,799
Wouldn't it be quicker for her

1356
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,219
to go one more time with him today
to see if she has feelings for him or not?

1357
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:41,182
Instead of checking Jeong-su again
and then comparing him to Jun-seo,

1358
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,142
only to be confused
about who to pick…

1359
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,311
-Right.
-It'd be simpler to make sure of Jun-seo

1360
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,937
and cut him loose if he's not for her.

1361
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,105
I agree with Jin-young.

1362
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,356
That's what I would do.

1363
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,274
-Jun-seo?
-Yes.

1364
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:51,442
She should pick Jun-seo.

1365
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:53,319
This logic makes sense.

1366
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:56,906
-But Si-an may think differently.
-Si-an isn't a logical person.

1367
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:57,865
Right.

1368
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:00,117
Her first Paradise date was with Jeong-su.

1369
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,661
That made a huge impact on her.

1370
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,498
So I'm unsure.
My gut says she'll go with Jeong-su.

1371
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,041
-To be totally sure…
-Yeah.

1372
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,417
It's to confirm her feelings.

1373
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,086
Rather than not pick him and regret it,

1374
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,213
-she'll go once more.
-She wants to confirm.

1375
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,380
Then, she'll decide.

1376
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,716
But if she does pick Jeong-su,

1377
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,429
I think that will mean
her feelings are definitely set on him.

1378
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:24,308
In this situation, I don't think
she would do something reckless

1379
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:27,561
and go with Jeong-su again
to find out how he feels once more.

1380
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,564
I agree because she clearly expressed
her feelings to Theo.

1381
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,649
Right.

1382
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,275
Okay. How about you, Hanhae?

1383
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,277
I think it'll be Jeong-su too.

1384
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:36,403
Then, let's make a bet.

1385
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:37,780
-"A bet"!
-Losers pay for dinner.

1386
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:39,448
Sure, sounds good.

1387
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:41,283
Why are you so eager to lose money?

1388
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:45,037
-They're not picking final couples yet.
-It means I'm that confident.

1389
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:45,955
She's confident.

1390
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:47,206
Sounds good to me.

1391
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,458
-We'll split it three ways.
-Sounds good.

1392
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,711
I have no idea.
I'm so curious to see who Si-an will pick.

1393
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,881
I feel like she'll surprise everyone
with her choice.

1394
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,799
Really?

1395
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,634
Will she go against all expectations?

1396
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:00,511
INFERNO

1397
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:04,974
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1398
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,373
The guys must be nervous.

1399
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:30,374
They must be shaking.

1400
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:32,209
-Their hearts are racing.
-We can feel it!

1401
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:35,045
-They're pounding so fast.
-They're wondering, "Is it me?"

1402
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,183
We'll begin with first-place winner,
Lee Si-an.

1403
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:51,645
Please choose the person you'd like to
go on a date with in Paradise.

1404
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:55,983
It'll be Jun-seo.

1405
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,443
-Yeah.
-I think so too.

1406
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:09,163
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1407
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,292
After my second date with Jun-seo,

1408
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,129
I realized just how different
his personality is from Jeong-su's.

1409
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:20,341
Jun-seo is the tough guy type,

1410
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:25,054
while Jeong-su is
more of the sweet, gentle type.

1411
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:29,558
Would I prefer someone who's more gentle?

1412
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,436
Or do I go with my heart instead?

1413
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:34,230
Even if they're not as gentle,

1414
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:39,276
do I go with someone
I enjoy spending time with?

1415
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,987
That's what I'm torn over.

1416
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,452
She's on the fence.

1417
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:49,703
-She totally is.
-Yeah.

1418
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:53,249
But this sounds like
she's leaning toward Jun-seo.

1419
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:54,375
Right?

1420
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,835
-Her heart's drawn to him.
-She likes him more.

1421
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,056
Wait, hold on.

1422
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:14,019
Why are we so curious
about who Si-an wants to date?

1423
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:17,022
I'm busy enough as it is with my own life,

1424
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,984
but I'm dying to find out
who she'll go on a date with.

1425
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,568
-I'm so curious.
-I'm really curious.

1426
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,612
-It has me all anxious.
-Yes.

1427
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,118
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1428
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,305
Lee Si-an has selected…

1429
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,744
NEXT EPISODE

1430
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,370
I can do anything I put my mind to.

1431
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,955
You just have to push ahead.

1432
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,874
It's a night full of concerns.

1433
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,001
Anything else you want to ask me?

1434
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,712
I'm not the type
who gets curious about those things.

1435
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:23,964
It felt like
he wasn't genuinely interested in me.

1436
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:26,842
It was always you from the start,

1437
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:28,552
and that hasn't changed.

1438
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:34,641
You made it possible
for me to earnestly take part in this.

1439
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:38,354
You will now make your final decision.

1440
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:41,690
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1441
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,684
