SINGLE'S INFERNO

00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,179
1 HOUR BEFORE
PARADISE-BOUND COUPLE MATCHING

16
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,096
INFERNO

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,390
Who do you think Hae-lin will go with?

18
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,892
-Hae-lin?
-Yeah.

19
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,018
Dong-ho, of course.

20
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,645
Then, who should I go with?

21
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,523
Who do I go with?

22
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,243
-Hae-lin?
-Yeah?

23
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,287
Who are you going to go with?

24
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,082
I think I'll probably go with Dong-ho.

25
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,292
-You're sure, right?
-Dong-ho.

26
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:29,672
If that's the case,
I don't really have a choice.

27
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,590
Why not?

28
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,301
Because I pick last.

29
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,806
So I don't think
my conversation will last that long.

30
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,058
I'll be quick and come back.

31
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,560
-With Dong-ho?
-Yeah.

32
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,312
Why? I want to go first.

33
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,480
-Really?
-Yeah.

34
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,523
You want to go first?

35
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,941
Yeah, because I can't go anyway.

36
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,526
-Because you can't go?
-Yeah.

37
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,238
-Things are getting fierce.
-It's intense.

38
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,739
-A battle for Dong-ho.
-It's fierce.

39
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,907
It really is.

40
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,159
There's no compromising anymore.

41
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,078
-They can't anymore.
-Right, they can't.

42
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,664
Dong-ho is so popular.

43
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,165
Yeah, he is.

44
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,834
I can have my talk really quick too.

45
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,211
I only need three minutes.

46
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,841
No one answered me.

47
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,761
I mean, let's just decide.

48
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,180
We can't go and fight over
who opens his door first.

49
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,849
I'll go last then.

50
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,226
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

51
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,689
Seriously, it'll only take a minute.

52
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,482
Let's say five minutes
for us two combined.

53
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,153
-We'll be quick, Ms. Second Place.
-No, it's fine.

54
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,321
You're the one choosing anyway.

55
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,407
I'll make it quick and be right back.

56
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,537
Come in.

57
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,249
-Who is it?
-Should we go?

58
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,376
You look so happy.

59
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,294
-Me?
-Yes.

60
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,211
I don't feel great.

61
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,421
-A-rin's quick.
-You don't?

62
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,338
No.

63
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,049
I don't feel good at all.

64
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,926
-You don't feel too good?
-No.

65
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,056
-Wait for me.
-Right.

66
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,100
Wait for me. Stop moving so fast.

67
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,101
Let's go together.

68
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,647
Together…

69
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,275
So, we have to walk at the same speed?

70
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,610
Yeah.

71
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,777
Understood.

72
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,907
I want to sit here. Come here.

73
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,866
Whatever you'd like.

74
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,578
I really wanted to go today.

75
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,580
You tried really hard.

76
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,498
But as soon as the matchups were drawn…

77
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,293
You knew it wouldn't work out?
Like my wrestling matchup?

78
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,921
Yeah, that's exactly it.
It was a finals match.

79
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,172
Honestly, we have no luck.

80
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,381
I guess not.

81
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,009
Still, I did my best.

82
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,969
I saw that. You gave it your all.

83
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,097
I really wanted to go.
That's why I tried so hard.

84
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,808
In any case,
I'm so disappointed with the outcome.

85
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,562
But despite that,
I'm going to have a lot of fun today.

86
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,315
Yeah, I'm going to have fun.

87
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,903
Who knows if you'll be here or not?

88
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,240
Because you're so popular.

89
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,786
Physically,

90
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,205
I haven't felt well
since we went swimming.

91
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,165
When we went to Paradise?

92
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,083
Yeah.

93
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,418
I was having fun,
so I didn't feel it then.

94
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,462
But I've felt bad after coming back.

95
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,421
I see.

96
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,178
It makes me worried to hear that.

97
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,889
-Are you sure you're worried?
-Of course.

98
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,434
How will you have fun
if you're not feeling well?

99
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,187
What's the point? It's all over.

100
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,981
It's coming to an end tomorrow.

101
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,023
Yeah.

102
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,942
I've said everything I needed to say.

103
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,568
-To tell me you'll have fun?
-Yeah.

104
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,237
I'm going to have a blast.

105
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,447
I bet you'll be so curious
about what I do.

106
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,910
Because I'm going to have the best time.

107
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,497
Let's go.
I made a promise, so I have to keep it.

108
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,750
What do you plan to do?

109
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,419
It's a secret.

110
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,091
A-rin is… How do I put it?
She's pretending to be indifferent.

111
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,636
Isn't she just saying,
"Don't worry about me, and have fun"?

112
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,514
No, I think she's actually saying,
"You better think about me."

113
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,432
Yeah.

114
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,476
He's assured me
of his feelings for a while,

115
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,562
so I didn't feel anxious.

116
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:18,484
It seemed Hae-lin was pursuing Dong-ho
more actively than I expected.

117
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:23,281
I meant, "If you really don't want to go,
be clear and tell the other women."

118
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,700
And to be crystal clear about that,

119
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,703
I wanted to say, "Stay here with me."

120
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,665
That's why I said,
"I'm going to have a blast here tonight."

121
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,168
"So don't you want to stay here too?"

122
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,046
I told him in a way
so he could understand.

123
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,674
That's what she meant?

124
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,967
-What?
-No, I didn't…

125
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,594
-No one got that.
-Not at all.

126
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,305
A-rin,
no one can understand something that way.

127
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,223
That was practically a secret code.

128
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,767
-Seriously.
-Right?

129
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,560
But since she's so certain,

130
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,605
don't you think she thought,
"I want you to decode what I say,"

131
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,106
and said it that way on purpose?

132
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,775
Their date in Paradise

133
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,777
-must've been that good.
-It had a big impact.

134
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,070
I think she felt a connection.

135
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,447
But A-rin,
don't ever say it like that again.

136
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,660
You-jin, want to go to the train?
I've never been there.

137
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,578
-The train?
-Yeah.

138
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,208
I came in third place though.

139
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,127
Still, it's better than nothing.

140
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,756
You saw our wrestling match.
I was put to bed in two seconds.

141
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,217
I was shocked.

142
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,511
Third place…

143
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,889
If by any chance

144
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,726
you're still around when it's my turn,

145
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,394
as I've said before,

146
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,273
I've wanted to go to Paradise with you.

147
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,858
Why did I just assume you were older?

148
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,319
-I could be younger.
-I know.

149
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,487
I'm sorry.

150
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,116
Because I've been set on you…

151
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,997
Since you've earned the right to choose,

152
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,500
I think going
with your heart is the right thing.

153
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,377
When the guys won the wrestling match,

154
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,171
they chose to do what they wanted
instead of contemplating.

155
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,131
That's right.

156
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,132
Yeah.

157
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,217
-You're right.
-That's how it is.

158
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,679
But since we have a chance to talk,

159
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,224
what I really wanted to tell you was
time is short and…

160
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,308
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

161
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,393
We don't have time,

162
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:20,231
so it might be hard for feelings
to shift in a different direction.

163
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,524
I want you to know that.

164
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,360
That may have sounded too serious though.

165
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,654
So…

166
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,203
I think what Dong-ho
was trying to say was,

167
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,205
-"If we had more time…"
-Yeah.

168
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,040
"We could've gotten to know each other."

169
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,167
Right?

170
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,253
He was beating around the bush,
but I think he turned her down.

171
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,754
-There's no time…
-Yes.

172
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,423
-So now…
-So for me to change who I like

173
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,883
from this person to that person…

174
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,050
-It'd be hard.
-Yeah.

175
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,218
-Right.
-That's right.

176
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,262
Then, who does she go to Paradise with?

177
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,140
In that case,
You-jin will need to go to recover,

178
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,558
so maybe Jeong-su…

179
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,314
-Do you have a lot of time?
-I do.

180
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,693
You're dressed like you're ready to party.

181
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,737
You don't like it? Do I look different?

182
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,988
It's so eye-catching.

183
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:09,989
Is it different?

184
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,868
He can't focus again.

185
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,704
His talk with Hae-lin is important.

186
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,167
What? Do you want to go today?

187
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,127
-Me?
-Yeah.

188
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,962
The thing is…

189
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,883
there's not much time left.

190
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:29,800
Yeah.

191
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,011
Is he turning her down?

192
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,889
The thing is…

193
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,851
there's not much time left.

194
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,852
Yeah.

195
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,814
I think there's someone
my interest is leaning towards.

196
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,733
Okay. You have someone?

197
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,401
What?

198
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,653
My goodness, really?

199
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,571
-What?
-What?

200
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,533
So if we had more time…

201
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,450
Yeah?

202
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,620
I'm sure there would've been
more chances to talk to people,

203
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,957
but we only have today
and tomorrow to decide.

204
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,087
I don't quite understand. So what is it?

205
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,839
-At this point…
-Yeah?

206
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,925
-What?
-Yeah.

207
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,971
My interest is leaning
toward someone else.

208
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,348
-I see.
-I think it's clearer for me now.

209
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,432
I see.

210
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,310
Wow, I just got chills.

211
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,730
He decoded A-rin's message?

212
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,482
That's impressive.

213
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,485
My interest is leaning
toward someone else.

214
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,821
-I see.
-I think it's clearer for me now.

215
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,989
I see.

216
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,952
-I think it'll be hard to change my mind.
-I see.

217
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,453
Because we don't have much time.

218
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,664
So, if I take you…

219
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,502
But I thought about that too.

220
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,714
That's your privilege
from winning the game.

221
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,048
-Yeah.
-So…

222
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,342
-You think so?
-I wasn't sure

223
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,595
if it'd be right
to influence your decision.

224
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,060
Yeah.

225
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,773
I think making your choice
is a separate issue.

226
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,776
It's a tough decision, so think about it.

227
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,195
Think about it without any pressure.

228
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,864
Okay.

229
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,283
Okay, I got it.

230
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,370
All right.

231
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,122
Sorry to put this burden on you.

232
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,208
No, it's okay. I'll think about it.

233
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,835
Thanks for telling me.

234
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,380
You can leave that burden with me.
I'll think about it.

235
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,381
Are you okay?

236
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,717
Okay.

237
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,223
I can't believe he decoded that.

238
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,767
But I don't think

239
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,727
-he actually decoded it.
-Right.

240
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,811
-It's how he feels.
-Yes.

241
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,021
Those are just his values.

242
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,314
Right.

243
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,651
But he's not the type
who's usually this expressive.

244
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,319
-I didn't expect that.
-Seriously.

245
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,114
His feelings for A-rin must've been
much stronger than we thought.

246
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,034
-I was surprised by that too.
-Yeah, how could we have…

247
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,619
They did have fun in Paradise.

248
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,456
They did,
but things didn't feel that intense.

249
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,750
-Yeah.
-I didn't feel that type of chemistry.

250
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,960
-He did say they got along well.
-Right.

251
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,129
They talked about being
from the same neighborhood.

252
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,964
-They had some lovey-dovey moments.
-Yeah.

253
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,800
I'm a little worried about Hae-lin.

254
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,552
In order to go to Paradise with Dong-ho,

255
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,596
-she worked hard to win.
-That's right.

256
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,264
-She's about to choose…
-It's a letdown.

257
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,892
-And he says, "There's not much time now."
-Right.

258
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,230
But I think she'd still try.
Knowing the type of person she is…

259
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,981
-Right.
-She'll try until the end.

260
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,067
Even if it won't work out,
she'd still want to try.

261
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,361
She has that kind of tenacious spirit.

262
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,072
But I never expected Dong-ho would say

263
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,740
-something like that.
-Me neither.

264
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,700
-Twice in a row and firmly.
-I got chills.

265
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,703
I bet A-rin will be really touched
when she sees this later.

266
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,622
-I bet she's crying.
-Yeah.

267
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,249
It was such a twist.

268
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,333
Yeah.

269
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,585
INFERNO

270
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,923
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

271
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,927
We'll begin with first-place winner,
Lee Si-an.

272
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,598
Please choose the person you'd like to
go on a date with in Paradise.

273
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,896
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

274
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,870
Kim Jeong-su.

275
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,709
Yeah, I knew it!
I told you, Jin-kyung! See?

276
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,794
-Come on!
-Yeah!

277
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,795
Come on!

278
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,590
-She's going make it confusing again?
-Yes.

279
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,841
And make it this complicated?

280
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,260
-This is Lee Si-an!
-Yeah, this is so like her.

281
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,845
-I knew it.
-I knew it'd be different.

282
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,054
That's incredible.

283
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,222
I knew it. Come on!

284
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,349
Kim Jeong-su.

285
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,146
Kim Jeong-su.

286
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,733
Have a good time.

287
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,817
Have fun.

288
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,906
I'll see you later.

289
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,452
Do I go out?

290
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,871
Yeah, right now. Take your bags and go.

291
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,294
Gosh…

292
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,505
-I bet Jun-seo's confused too.
-She wants to check.

293
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,422
Yeah.

294
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,216
When Jeong-su's name was called,

295
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,635
Jun-seo made a face
I'd never see him make before.

296
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,345
-What kind?
-He looked so disappointed.

297
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,346
I see.

298
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,223
"I should've been
more expressive yesterday."

299
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,974
-I think he's thinking that.
-Right.

300
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,685
I think Jun-seo needs time
to reflect on what he did wrong.

301
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,772
It's the only way he'll get Si-an.

302
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,290
We've been seeing you often.

303
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,375
You're right.

304
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,543
Very often.

305
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,253
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

306
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,339
You smell nice.

307
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,008
It's been a while.

308
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,218
Yes, it has.

309
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,012
Why is this so awkward?

310
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,430
-Why is it so awkward…
-What?

311
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,807
to go to Paradise together?

312
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,184
We went on the first day,
and we're going now.

313
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,270
-The last day.
-You're right.

314
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,438
Gosh, the first and last days for us.

315
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,732
It took a long time.

316
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,902
We've come full circle.

317
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,363
Let's go.

318
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,451
Right, they did come full circle.

319
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,078
-Come full circle?
-It's what she said.

320
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,496
Those are dangerous words.

321
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,456
I think to Si-an,

322
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,458
Jeong-su's like a first love,

323
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,128
so she keeps thinking about him
while on dates with Jun-seo.

324
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,798
And like when he held her hand
in the helicopter and massaged it,

325
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,551
those are things
that she keeps remembering.

326
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,553
But he isn't the same Jeong-su anymore.

327
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,470
-Right.
-Right.

328
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,265
-Jeong-su is set on Si-an now.
-Yeah.

329
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,475
I feel like Si-an might like him more.

330
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,643
Right.

331
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,813
Next is the second-place winner,
Park Hae-lin.

332
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,981
Park Hae-lin,

333
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,402
please choose the person you'd like to
go on a date with in Paradise.

334
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,073
I don't think she's the type
who'll decide to go

335
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,784
-with someone else in this situation.
-Right. It's awkward.

336
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,119
I think it'll be Dong-ho too.

337
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,037
Me too.

338
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,581
It'll be someone other than Dong-ho.

339
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,916
Then, that's four to one.

340
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,833
Yeah.

341
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:27,092
Will I make a choice I want
or let him take the path he wants?

342
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,218
She has to pick Dong-ho.

343
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,511
-Of course.
-Yeah.

344
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,596
-All right.
-Yeah.

345
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,517
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

346
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,612
-She has to pick him.
-No, she won't.

347
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,947
-Kook.
-Nope.

348
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,281
-Kook!
-She won't go with him!

349
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,491
Kook!

350
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:54,495
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

351
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,246
Kook Dong-ho.

352
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,374
-Come on!
-We told you.

353
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,959
Kyuhyun.

354
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,918
-Here you go.
-Listen…

355
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,170
-This isn't a guessing contest.
-Come on!

356
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,382
Kook Dong-ho.

357
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,718
Have fun.

358
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,930
Kook Dong-ho.

359
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,441
I mustered the courage to pick him
despite what he told me.

360
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,612
Honestly, I knew something like this
would happen when I joined the show.

361
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,197
I don't want any regrets.

362
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,033
I don't want to regret anything in life.

363
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,035
That's why.

364
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,705
-Yeah, she's right.
-She's right.

365
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,956
-She's totally right.
-Yeah.

366
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,255
Let's go.

367
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:49,925
Let's go.

368
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,510
Bye.

369
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,595
Take care!

370
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,432
-"Take care!"
-"Take care!"

371
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,017
You-jin really is the best.

372
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,934
-She is.
-Yeah.

373
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,394
-"The best"!
-Seriously.

374
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,645
-She's a pro.
-Yeah.

375
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,230
Bye.

376
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,732
Take care!

377
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,991
Let's go and have fun without any regrets.

378
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,076
Let's go.

379
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,872
Oh, well.

380
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,385
Last is the third-place winner,
Chung You-jin.

381
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,390
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

382
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,102
The person I want to go
to Paradise with today

383
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,063
is Kook Dong-ho.

384
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,776
But if Dong-ho isn't there
when it's my turn to choose,

385
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,737
my next choice is Kim Jeong-su.

386
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,909
But if Jeong-su isn't there either
when it's my turn to choose,

387
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,872
then…

388
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,001
-They're both gone!
-They're both gone.

389
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,879
She could go with Theo.

390
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,881
-All of a sudden?
-He's close with her.

391
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,592
Maybe she'll go with Theo?

392
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,344
I think she'll pick Theo.

393
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,678
He's already gone once though.

394
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,597
Not with You-jin.

395
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,724
-They didn't?
-No.

396
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,476
-Really?
-Yeah.

397
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,727
Then, it'll be Theo.

398
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,396
-She can go recover with Theo.
-"Really?"

399
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,731
-Yeah.
-Since they're close,

400
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,441
-that could be better.
-Yeah.

401
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,159
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

402
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,046
-He's asleep.
-He has no expectations.

403
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,302
An Jong-hoon.

404
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,472
Chung You-jin has selected

405
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,975
-An Jong-hoon.
-What?

406
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,227
Jong-hoon?

407
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,145
Me?

408
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,938
What?

409
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,524
-I didn't expect that.
-He loves it.

410
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,693
-Then, this means Hye-jin…
-Wait. Why couldn't she

411
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,237
-let her have a date on Inferno?
-Yeah?

412
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,281
-An Jong-hoon.
-What?

413
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,409
-No!
-That's the worst!

414
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,494
That is insane.

415
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,787
You-jin!

416
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,331
How dare she?

417
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,509
You-jin.

418
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,219
Jong-hoon.

419
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,305
I'll take that.

420
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,182
Why is this so heavy? Hey.

421
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,601
-What's in here?
-I packed a lot.

422
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,977
-I see.
-Let's have fun.

423
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,023
-You picked me because I'm fun?
-No, it's not that.

424
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,941
-Really?
-Yeah.

425
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:57,029
This will be our first chance
to get to really talk.

426
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,947
-Yeah. Still…
-Yeah?

427
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,575
I picked who I wanted
to go to Paradise with.

428
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,870
To be honest, when he first showed up
as the game changer,

429
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,414
I did vote for Jong-hoon.

430
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,459
I thought it would be nice
to get to know him

431
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,004
and see what kind of person he is.

432
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,714
This seems to make sense.

433
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,760
As she said,
she voted for him as the game changer.

434
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,512
I'm sorry.
I think I underestimated her.

435
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,892
I thought she'd give up
and go to Paradise to rest and recharge.

436
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,144
-Yeah.
-But she's still full of fight.

437
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,354
That's right.

438
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,396
-She won't give up.
-No.

439
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,148
-She did very well.
-Yeah.

440
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,276
Let's go.

441
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,407
This is the last helicopter ride.

442
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,166
You're not feeling sick?

443
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,961
You haven't felt nauseous since then?

444
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,462
No.

445
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,764
-Go to sleep?
-Yeah.

446
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,016
I feel a bit sad though.

447
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,185
Because it's the last time?

448
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,837
Why are you teasing me?

449
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,339
-He must be really tired.
-Yeah.

450
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,465
He really is dozing off.

451
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,510
There's literally nothing on his mind.

452
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,888
If someone you like is next to you,
it's hard to doze off like that.

453
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,515
-She finds it cute.
-Yeah.

454
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,934
I think it's more like
she finds it ridiculous.

455
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,562
That's amazing.

456
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,097
How sweet.

457
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,725
-Like this?
-So sweet.

458
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,854
This makes me
practically a servant, right?

459
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,856
Don't say that.

460
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,870
Jeong-su's sweetness is on another level.

461
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,997
-Did he learn that at some academy?
-Right?

462
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,208
-This is what Si-an wanted.
-Yeah.

463
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,751
He's her support and shade.

464
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,922
Instead of going, "I'll get that for you!"
and being so overt…

465
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,423
Yeah, it's subtle…

466
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,426
After seeing nothing
but tough guys and beasts,

467
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,221
being with someone kind and gentle
must feel so different.

468
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:14,810
PARADISE
LEE SI-AN & KIM JEONG-SU

469
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,026
How much alcohol can you really drink?

470
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,361
-Me?
-Yeah.

471
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,238
I don't know.

472
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,908
I can't drink.
Just think of it like that.

473
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,203
You don't know your limit?

474
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,538
You don't usually drink?

475
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,914
No, I usually don't.

476
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,625
-Just…
-But since we're here,

477
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,627
-you decided to try?
-Yeah.

478
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,462
I see.

479
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,383
I knew it.

480
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,968
-Why?
-What?

481
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,681
It didn't seem like
you could drink that much.

482
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,598
Right.

483
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:59,312
But people kept saying you drank
half a bottle of whiskey.

484
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,398
After hearing something like that,

485
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,568
wouldn't you be worried?

486
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,577
But there are times when I want to drink,

487
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,370
-like when I'm happy.
-Sure.

488
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,080
-That's good.
-Yeah.

489
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,418
-Having a drink is fine when you're happy.
-But whiskey made me drunk so fast.

490
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,212
I mean, whiskey is 40% alcohol.

491
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,130
I see.

492
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,841
-That's the average.
-But next to me…

493
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,925
Jun-seo kept drinking?

494
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,635
He was chugging it like beer.

495
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,264
So I kept drinking along with him
while we were talking.

496
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,682
And then…

497
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,850
Did you get drunk?

498
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:37,851
Yeah.

499
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,520
I got a little drunk.

500
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,693
Then what?

501
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,284
Were you okay? Did anything happen?

502
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,285
No.

503
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,170
What?

504
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,465
-Something felt off.
-Yeah.

505
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:12,010
Also, Si-an's response felt like
there was more to it than that.

506
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,136
She can't lie.

507
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,598
And for someone who doesn't usually drink,
she said she drank a lot.

508
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,766
So it must make him uneasy.

509
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,816
It feels different
to be here at sunset.

510
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,110
I like it here.

511
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,823
The sunset is so pretty.

512
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,908
It's picturesque.

513
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,160
Yeah, it's so nice.

514
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,499
I'm glad I won the game.

515
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,419
I'm glad I was picked.

516
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,262
What's it been like to be so busy?

517
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,724
I never had time
to totally look through my feelings.

518
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,601
Because you were busy?

519
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,729
Because you were
dragged around everywhere?

520
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,772
No.

521
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,151
"Dragged around everywhere."

522
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,866
It really felt like my feelings

523
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,996
were constantly changing so quickly.

524
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,706
I think I was very confused.

525
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,420
You didn't have a hard time?

526
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,923
Were you ever confused or anything?

527
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,469
I am a little bit right now.

528
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,637
I see.

529
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,403
Why are you confused?

530
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,489
-What?
-Why are you confused?

531
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,785
I'm…

532
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,125
Well, when I first went
to Paradise with you,

533
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,835
-it was really fun.
-Yeah.

534
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:13,298
It was nice.
There were times when my heart raced.

535
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,551
Yeah.

536
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:22,599
I thought, "If you felt the same way
as I'd felt in the beginning,

537
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,937
maybe you were thinking of me too."

538
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,773
-Yeah.
-"Then…

539
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,233
maybe things will be okay."

540
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,611
That's what I thought.

541
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,450
After getting to know everyone,

542
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,787
I thought you'd come back and say,
"I'm done looking around," so I waited.

543
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,124
But then, you said Jun-seo
was left on your list.

544
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,751
Yeah.

545
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,045
I said, "Okay."

546
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:52,962
Right.

547
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:57,717
But that took a really long time.

548
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,802
Yeah.

549
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,935
In the helicopter earlier today,
I saw you sleeping on Jun-seo's shoulder.

550
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,649
EARLIER THIS MORNING

551
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,942
We're above the clouds.

552
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,409
I'm not sure about your feelings.

553
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,368
Right.

554
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,915
I see.

555
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,253
To be honest,

556
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,341
after my first date with Jun-seo,

557
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,972
I think my feelings
leaned a lot towards him.

558
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,267
Yeah. But…

559
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,687
you and Jun-seo are so different.

560
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,896
-Your vibes.
-Yeah.

561
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,483
Jun-seo's a bit rough

562
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,736
and has that tough-guy vibe.

563
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,237
That's right.

564
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,032
But from the start,
you've always been so sweet.

565
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,750
I kept thinking about that
even while I was with him.

566
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,341
So the decision I made

567
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,511
was to come to Paradise with you today

568
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,973
to figure out who makes me laugh more,

569
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,727
feel happier, and more comfortable

570
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,813
when I'm with them.

571
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,525
Because I kept telling you
it was a shame.

572
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,820
-Yeah.
-We went to Paradise the first time,

573
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,699
and we didn't get a chance
to talk or have a date after that.

574
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,285
We were both busy.

575
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,538
So for my last day…

576
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,794
I wanted to be with you.

577
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,258
So that was why.

578
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,845
But after hearing what you said,

579
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,519
I think I could quickly clear up
things I'm confused about too.

580
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,436
Yeah.

581
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,939
I feel like I've been making things

582
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,027
more confusing this whole time.

583
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,862
I feel bad about that.

584
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,491
But I didn't know how I felt either.

585
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,408
Right.

586
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,203
Things were so complicated,
and I was confused.

587
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:35,041
So I want you to know
it was because of that,

588
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,295
and I hope you can understand.

589
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,756
In any case,

590
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,635
I wanted to win today

591
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,638
and come here with you.

592
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,934
-But…
-I have a question.

593
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,852
Sure.

594
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,857
-In the helicopter…
-Yeah?

595
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,609
You were sitting between me and Jun-seo.

596
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,527
Right.

597
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,406
When you leaned on Jun-seo's shoulder,

598
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,534
what was the reasoning behind that?

599
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,790
That must've affected him a lot.

600
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:21,087
She went with Jun-seo to Paradise,
so I think it's understandable to do that.

601
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,464
I mean, she didn't go with Jeong-su.

602
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,841
-Yeah.
-I'm sure it hurt.

603
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,552
But to Jeong-su, she sat in the middle,

604
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,387
so by leaning on someone,

605
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,097
he could definitely take that

606
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,433
-as her choosing that person.
-Right.

607
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,268
-It's something he could ask.
-Yeah.

608
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,901
-Tell me the truth.
-Okay.

609
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,988
So when I did that…

610
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,992
he told me to lean on him,
so I did because I was tired.

611
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,120
Then, I realized I made a mistake.

612
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,798
So after that…

613
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,135
how did you feel?

614
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,556
For me,

615
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,018
because of that small act,

616
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,649
countless thoughts ran through my head.

617
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,567
My mind became cluttered.

618
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,869
You rested your head on his shoulder
even when I was there.

619
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,123
I thought…

620
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,960
what was I…

621
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,880
even waiting for?

622
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,262
My reason for waiting disappeared.

623
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,183
I see.

624
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,023
I didn't know it was that serious.

625
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,862
-My feelings?
-Yeah.

626
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,074
To wait and things like that…

627
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,328
Because from what I've seen of you,

628
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,831
you've been to Paradise many times

629
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,875
and have continued to talk
to a lot of other people.

630
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:23,960
Right.

631
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,547
I assumed you were busy with that.

632
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,466
But to hear that you were waiting for me,

633
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,637
it honestly didn't feel that way.

634
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,061
From our perspective as well,

635
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,605
it didn't seem like
he was just waiting around

636
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,024
-for Si-an.
-Right.

637
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,985
Not to mention,
he was sweet to the other girls too.

638
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,196
When they talk with each other,
they share those details.

639
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,198
So from Si-an's perspective,

640
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,036
I can see why she thought
his feelings weren't that serious.

641
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,912
He didn't really express them much.

642
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,958
I guess I wasn't expressive enough.

643
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:12,050
I thought you were freely going around
and getting to know other people.

644
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,009
Right.

645
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:17,096
I thought you wanted
to get to know them.

646
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,559
And well, to be honest…

647
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,311
-Did I ask them to go?
-What?

648
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,479
Did I ask them to go?

649
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,439
They dragged me there.

650
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,982
It's the same thing for me.

651
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,110
Jeong-su, it was the same for me.

652
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,200
During my time here,
I've had exactly three chances to choose.

653
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,285
A date over a special meal,

654
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,164
a dessert date, and a date in Paradise.

655
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,918
Out of those three, I picked you twice.

656
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,005
What?

657
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,966
Why do you look so stunned?

658
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,135
So you picked me twice.

659
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,305
I'm so thankful I could cry.

660
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,985
Let me express myself to you.

661
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,612
What?

662
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,030
I'll express my feelings.

663
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,045
Ta-da.

664
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,464
What's that?

665
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,007
They're my feelings.

666
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,600
What? I think something fell out.

667
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,685
It's right here.

668
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,939
What is it?

669
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,607
An old flower petal.

670
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,193
How old is it?

671
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,111
What?

672
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,739
It's from when I was with Hae-lin.

673
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,950
Hae-lin?

674
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:05,538
You brought this from when you went
to Paradise with Hae-lin?

675
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,455
Yeah.

676
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,754
-When we got in the spa that first time…
-Yeah?

677
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,047
I was really excited.

678
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,258
DAY 1 PARADISE

679
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,593
-Do you like flowers?
-Yeah.

680
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,261
Okay.

681
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,806
Why are you putting them on me?

682
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,855
DAY 5 PARADISE

683
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,296
DAY 6 INFERNO

684
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,350
I was going to give it to you,

685
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:11,604
but that's when Theo shouted your name
and gave you a bouquet of flowers.

686
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,774
-Si-an, come on out.
-You scared me!

687
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,262
So I thought…

688
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,347
I made a mistake.

689
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,265
Why?

690
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,309
I was trying to be considerate to others,

691
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,396
but it feels like this was taken from me.

692
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,816
I should've done what I wanted.

693
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,401
I see.

694
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,868
But it feels good
to get that off my chest.

695
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,000
I feel relieved.

696
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,545
Are you sure?

697
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,587
It's so refreshing.

698
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,091
It's a weight off my shoulders.

699
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,513
You too…

700
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,683
You should do whatever you want.

701
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,813
Because that's what I'm going to do.

702
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,067
I am doing what I want.

703
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,321
I mean that.

704
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,824
Then, let's do what I want and eat.

705
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,992
Yeah, okay.

706
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,620
Let's just clear our minds.

707
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:52,538
Okay.

708
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,956
And let's live in the moment.

709
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,167
Okay.

710
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,297
Wait.

711
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,968
-What?
-Nothing. I'm just a little cold.

712
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,887
Do you want to put something on?

713
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,644
-Here.
-What is it?

714
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,397
-A cardigan.
-A carrot?

715
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,523
A carrot?

716
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,233
It's not bad.

717
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:22,985
Let's go.

718
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,410
This is great.

719
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,788
My meat!

720
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,665
Thank you for the meal.

721
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,666
Let's eat.

722
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,377
Cheers.

723
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,920
Cheers. Our last time in Paradise.

724
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,133
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

725
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,471
-Isn't it good?
-Yeah.

726
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,559
We should've eaten before talking.
We would've been in a better mood.

727
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,687
I feel better now
since we're eating good food.

728
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,484
I actually feel much more relieved now.

729
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:04,902
Really?

730
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,573
-Let's eat first.
-Okay.

731
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,076
Let's start with the steak.

732
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,954
-I'll cut it for you.
-Thank you.

733
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,790
-Tonight, I'm going to…
-Yeah?

734
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,875
try to be a kind, polite woman.

735
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,793
All right.

736
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,753
I will…

737
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,713
-Here you go.
-gladly accept the food.

738
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,215
All right. Enjoy.

739
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,301
Have some mushrooms.

740
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,513
Have some asparagus too.

741
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,769
As a kind, polite woman, you fail.

742
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,107
Here's a scallop.

743
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,276
I'll give you a scallop.

744
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,444
Thank you.

745
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,528
It's so good.

746
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,033
Did you try the scallop?

747
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,285
-Yeah.
-Isn't it good?

748
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,120
-So good. Did you try?
-Good, right?

749
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,121
Yeah, I did.

750
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,335
You know, I've never had
anything this good here before.

751
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,546
I'm so happy.

752
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,090
That's all I can say right now.

753
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,258
It's so good.

754
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,262
Paradise really is great.

755
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,354
I don't know anymore.

756
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,148
-They're so comfortable.
-Yeah.

757
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,817
-I think his voice plays a big role.
-Yeah.

758
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,152
-It sounds so stable.
-Yeah.

759
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,403
-Most importantly…
-It's deep.

760
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,613
He chose a course of action.

761
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,906
-He's so cool.
-Right.

762
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,407
Everything's in order now.

763
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,243
I think Si-an may change her mind.

764
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,871
You never know what she'll do next.

765
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,416
I think everything's been decided.

766
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,710
I think it's a done deal
for Si-an and Jeong-su.

767
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,753
-Really?
-Yeah.

768
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,880
I felt this when she was with Jun-seo too,

769
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,299
but I think
she'll end up going to Jeong-su.

770
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,967
But there's also this.

771
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,095
When you start dating someone,

772
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,932
I think you need to go through
some conflict at least once.

773
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,392
They seemed to handle things very wisely.

774
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,477
-Right.
-Yeah.

775
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,479
When I see Jun-seo and Si-an,

776
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:07,483
it's like they're both standing
on a narrow bridge,

777
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,026
and it feels very precarious.

778
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,236
-That's how they look.
-Yeah.

779
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,363
But when she's with Jeong-su,

780
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:16,116
he's good at putting her at ease
when there's a sign of trouble.

781
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,618
-Right.
-And seeing him do that

782
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,078
made me think once more

783
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,829
-some people are better matches.
-Yeah.

784
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,206
-They look comfortable.
-Yes.

785
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,290
-Yes.
-Right.

786
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,920
We have to do the dishes.

787
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,004
INFERNO

788
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,508
-How do we clean this up?
-Right?

789
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,717
Let's quickly pick someone…

790
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,885
-Okay.
-and make them do it.

791
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,595
Let's play rock, paper, scissors.

792
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,638
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

793
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,889
-Let's pick two people.
-Two?

794
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:39,974
I think it'll be me.

795
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,060
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

796
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,063
Shoot.

797
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,481
-I don't want to do it.
-Shoot.

798
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,651
Shoot.

799
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,610
-What?
-There we go.

800
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,903
Shoot.

801
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,071
-What?
-There we go.

802
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,161
-This is incredible.
-I believe in the universe.

803
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,331
-Min-seol's so happy.
-She really is.

804
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,001
She's grinning ear to ear.

805
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,669
Everyone, get out!

806
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,134
-This is incredible.
-I believe in the universe.

807
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,969
-Gosh.
-That's fate.

808
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,929
-It's all predestined.
-Why did you pick rock?

809
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,599
My goodness!

810
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,766
-We'll go.
-That's so funny.

811
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,767
-Thanks!
-Thank you!

812
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,893
Thanks for the meal.

813
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:29,773
Seriously, as if by fate,
Jun-seo and I ended up washing the dishes.

814
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,026
-She said it was fate!
-Min-seol!

815
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,861
That's not fate!

816
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,655
They just lost at rock, paper, scissors.

817
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,701
I really didn't want to
talk to Jun-seo today.

818
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,792
But seriously, isn't this funny?

819
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,461
Isn't it funny how we both picked rock?

820
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,215
-That was funny.
-I know.

821
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,180
Are you scrubbing them right?

822
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,097
Yeah.

823
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:03,974
They feel oily.

824
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,852
We have to use these again tomorrow.

825
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,354
-Yeah.
-Because we'll still be here.

826
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,107
Yeah, you should've gone.
Why are you still here?

827
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,318
Right?

828
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,571
I should've won the games.

829
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,906
You should've won today.

830
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:19,990
I know.

831
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,743
Still, you at least went once,
so that's good.

832
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,371
-You call that comfort?
-Zero times would be…

833
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,580
You think that's comforting?

834
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,415
Seriously, zero times…

835
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,210
-At least you went once…
-Everyone goes at least once.

836
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,127
Is that so?

837
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,297
If I didn't go with you, I'd be at zero.

838
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,510
Shouldn't you have
taken me one more time out of pity?

839
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,490
I said, "If I haven't gone,
you should've taken me."

840
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,950
He didn't answer me.

841
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,911
I thought, "He's set on Si-an."

842
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:09,623
I inferred that from him.

843
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:14,044
I realized he wasn't thinking
about my feelings at all.

844
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,088
That hurt my feelings a bit.

845
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,597
In any case

846
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:31,145
Jeong-su was the first person
she went to Paradise with.

847
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:36,567
I'd heard in passing that Jeong-su
also has feelings for Si-an,

848
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,318
so I knew.

849
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:43,407
Rather than being anxious or worried,
I was a little hurt by it.

850
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,367
I wanted to spend some time

851
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,412
with Si-an on Inferno.

852
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,122
So I'm disappointed about that.

853
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,834
-I thought he'd talk about Min-seol.
-Me too.

854
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,502
-It was about something else.
-Right.

855
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,879
He was thinking about Si-an.

856
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,255
-She's always on his mind.
-Yeah.

857
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,632
But there's nothing he can do right now.

858
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,843
-That's right.
-All he can do is wait.

859
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,262
Jun-seo's feelings for Si-an
are stronger than expected.

860
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,305
-They are.
-It seems so.

861
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,098
-And I think he's a bit uneasy.
-Yeah.

862
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,267
-As Kyuhyun said, he can't do anything.
-Right.

863
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,853
So he feels even more nervous and worried.

864
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:17,649
PARADISE
LEE SI-AN & KIM JEONG-SU

865
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,337
I'll draw you.

866
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,884
I knew you'd do that!

867
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,469
I knew it!

868
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,390
I knew you'd draw my eyes like that.

869
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,391
How?

870
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,601
Everyone does that.

871
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,978
My eyes slant upwards.

872
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,564
I see two Si-ans.

873
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,233
Hey, Si-an!

874
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:00,943
Don't go.

875
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,403
Si-an!

876
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,031
Your voice…

877
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,328
Are you tired?

878
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:13,747
Should we go rest now?

879
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,089
Let's go to bed.

880
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,382
No!

881
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,260
-Maybe we should take a quick nap?
-Okay.

882
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,095
Let's lie down for a second.

883
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,846
Yeah, for a second.

884
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,152
It's really just for a second.

885
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,070
Yeah.

886
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,909
This is a curious vibe.

887
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,244
This will be interesting.

888
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,245
Yeah.

889
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,381
You need to be scolded.

890
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,924
You hit me right on my mouth.

891
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,844
Was it intentional?

892
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,345
What? No.

893
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,431
Not at all.

894
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,865
I almost had a dream.

895
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,408
What?

896
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,368
I almost had a dream. I flinched.

897
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,411
You had a dream?

898
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:35,621
I almost did.

899
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:36,622
What is it?

900
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,206
I dreamed I was diving.

901
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,458
A falling dream?

902
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:43,003
No, I didn't fall. I dove into water.

903
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,340
I had a dream about diving.

904
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,966
You had a diving dream?

905
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:48,884
Yeah.

906
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,345
You must dream often.

907
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,304
He's moving up.

908
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,640
-There you go.
-A little at a time.

909
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,933
You must dream often.

910
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,356
-He's getting close.
-There you go!

911
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,232
-My goodness.
-There you go.

912
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,323
I don't dream.

913
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,617
You must sleep well.

914
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,910
I guess so.

915
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,168
That scared me.

916
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,214
Your hand kept moving.

917
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,632
-My hand?
-Yeah.

918
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,260
What's wrong?

919
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,928
I had a dream.

920
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,347
Another one?

921
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,224
Yeah.

922
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,935
The girl who dreams.

923
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,044
My gosh, I totally fell asleep.

924
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,504
You can sleep.

925
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,298
-What?
-It's okay to sleep.

926
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,016
I want to poke my eyes.

927
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:02,768
Why?

928
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,478
I'll do it for you.

929
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:37,260
While watching this,
my heart kept racing.

930
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,470
-Wasn't that exciting?
-Yeah.

931
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:39,888
-Yeah, it was.
-Yeah.

932
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:42,599
-Jeong-su really is a gentleman.
-Yeah.

933
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,768
-I think this feels more romantic.
-Right.

934
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,353
-It is romantic.
-It was exciting.

935
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,522
-He watched her sleep.
-Right.

936
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,192
Also, if he only stayed by her feet,
it would've been awful.

937
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,069
He naturally rolled his way up.

938
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,279
-Suddenly, he was next to her.
-Like this.

939
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,157
-Yeah.
-That kind of skill was so impressive.

940
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,409
Also, I think I had only typical thoughts.

941
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,994
He didn't just touch her hair.

942
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,247
-Her hand was flinching, so he held it.
-Yeah.

943
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,166
-And I swooned.
-Right.

944
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,503
But as I observed them,
the look in his eyes as he watched her…

945
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,420
Right.

946
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,756
-There was love in his eyes.
-Yeah, he seems to love her.

947
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,009
That's why my heart raced as I watched.
I could feel it.

948
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,469
It was such a big contrast.

949
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,721
-Both situations happened on the bed.
-Yeah.

950
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,391
-One person just jumped in like a beast.
-Yeah.

951
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,767
But that was effective too.

952
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,685
Yeah, that's right.

953
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,228
-It was impactful.
-They got closer.

954
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,397
But Jeong-su is being cautious.

955
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,190
-He's caring for her.
-He's holding back.

956
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,275
-Right.
-Yeah.

957
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,569
PARADISE
PARK HAE-LIN & KOOK DONG-HO

958
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,736
Incredible!

959
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,196
This is nice.

960
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,739
This is amazing.

961
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,160
Pasta. Wow, I better try this.

962
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,330
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

963
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:51,710
It's good.

964
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,756
It's so good.

965
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,009
Still, aren't you happy
to be back and eating this?

966
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,094
I am. Of course.

967
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,722
To be honest,

968
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,935
I thought about it a lot.

969
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,356
Even as I was standing there, I thought,
"Is this the right thing to do?"

970
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,941
But despite that,

971
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:21,406
when I expressed my feelings
to you yesterday,

972
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:25,327
I didn't think about
what the outcome would be.

973
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,745
In any case,

974
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,122
if that's how it's going to be,

975
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:32,876
I thought I should just make
a decision I wouldn't regret.

976
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,212
But I think I would've really regretted it
if I picked someone else.

977
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,715
When I look back and think about it,

978
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,676
even if I were in the same situation,

979
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,470
I would've done the same.

980
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,471
Yeah.

981
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,310
So, anyway…

982
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,692
Then, what if…

983
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,406
I'm just asking.

984
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,824
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Yeah.

985
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:11,039
-For the remaining two days…
-Yeah?

986
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,040
can you…

987
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,420
be certain that I have absolutely
zero chance with you?

988
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:20,840
You know?

989
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,928
I wonder what he'll say.

990
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,055
I don't think it's zero.

991
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,682
-No, not zero.
-Yeah.

992
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,434
You know?

993
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,401
-I don't think it's likely to happen.
-I see.

994
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,318
Yeah.

995
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,034
He sure is an unwavering person.

996
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,161
It's over.

997
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,998
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no. That must be so deflating.

998
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,715
But it's not that you have zero chance
or I don't like you…

999
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:02,799
Right, that's different.

1000
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:07,429
I think if I'm compatible
with the first person I become close with,

1001
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:10,223
I'm the type who settles down with them.

1002
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,141
I see.

1003
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,894
A-rin and I have talked a lot.

1004
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,273
So we've already
grown on each other a lot.

1005
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,317
-Right.
-Yeah.

1006
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:26,114
But I've always thought of myself
as someone who's calm and strong.

1007
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,741
-I thought I was tough.
-Yeah.

1008
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,744
I realized I wasn't.
I learned a lot of things here.

1009
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,454
-Why? Were you swayed a bit?
-I was…

1010
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,048
I'm so proud.

1011
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,552
Things like this made me confused too.

1012
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:50,096
-My ideal type…
-Yeah, I…

1013
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,014
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1014
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:55,018
You were different from my ideal type,
but there were times when I was curious.

1015
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,145
Then, I became confused.

1016
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,982
Yeah, I feel like
I thought about it a lot here.

1017
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,025
Right.

1018
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:03,902
I see.

1019
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,531
Still, I think I would've done
the same thing if I went back in time.

1020
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,743
Yeah, even if I'd known all of this.

1021
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,245
Yeah.

1022
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,884
Hae-lin was so bright
when she first arrived.

1023
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,178
-Hae-lin…
-She's become so down in just a few days.

1024
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,096
Right.

1025
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,972
-I've never seen her so sad.
-Yeah.

1026
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,682
-She's had a few hardships.
-Yeah.

1027
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:38,728
If it were me, I would've eaten
as much as I wanted first before talking.

1028
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,064
She actually might be able
to eat properly now.

1029
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,148
-Yeah.
-Right.

1030
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,192
-Things have been settled now.
-Yeah.

1031
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:48,029
INFERNO

1032
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,406
Did I tell you this? I think I did.

1033
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,575
You didn't tell me why you were confused.

1034
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,744
-Why I was confused about him?
-Yeah.

1035
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,538
-He is really good to me.
-Yeah.

1036
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,415
He even went around saying,
"Ji-yeon's the only one for me."

1037
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,209
-Yeah.
-He said that,

1038
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,754
and we went to Paradise twice together.

1039
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:09,175
But for some reason, it felt like
he wasn't genuinely interested in me.

1040
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,886
-Why?
-So I thought about it

1041
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,263
-and why I felt that way.
-Yeah.

1042
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,597
But…

1043
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,350
From our perspective,
he seems the most genuine.

1044
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,769
Right? But I don't feel that.

1045
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,062
-Why not?
-So…

1046
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,524
But there were a few incidents.

1047
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,193
We talked to each other about our dreams.

1048
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,029
Things like our dreams and our futures.

1049
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,531
-We were talking about that.
-Right.

1050
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,033
To be honest,

1051
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,035
-I really want to get married.
-Yeah.

1052
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,289
I want to have children
with the person I love…

1053
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,957
-Yeah.
-I want a happy life with them.

1054
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,084
-That's my biggest dream.
-Yeah.

1055
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,420
So I told him all of that.

1056
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,338
-And I'd already told him once before.
-Yeah.

1057
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,716
So Te-hwan knows that.

1058
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,092
-Yeah.
-I told him.

1059
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,260
-Yeah.
-So he knows.

1060
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,306
But then, he suddenly said
he believes in staying single.

1061
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,397
No matter how you look at it,

1062
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,399
if that were me,

1063
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,151
-I wouldn't say that…
-Yeah.

1064
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,612
-to the girl I like.
-Right.

1065
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,823
-Yeah, and you told him of your dreams.
-Yeah.

1066
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,742
Isn't he telling you
he wants something else?

1067
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:16,659
Yeah.

1068
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:21,331
When I try to talk with him,
it's never a deep conversation.

1069
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,625
What did you talk about?

1070
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,753
Honestly, nothing memorable.

1071
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,505
It's just…

1072
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,257
he rarely asks me any questions.

1073
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,093
He keeps talking about himself.

1074
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:39,724
When you like someone,
you notice the little things.

1075
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:44,145
For example, you check to see
if they're eating well during a meal.

1076
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,939
-Yeah.
-Or…

1077
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:49,943
When you're going somewhere,
you try to match their stride.

1078
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,570
But he doesn't do that.
He just goes off by himself.

1079
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:59,327
-So when he says he likes me…
-Gosh, unbelievable.

1080
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,455
I just honestly
can't believe what he says.

1081
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,082
It doesn't sound believable.

1082
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,583
I don't feel it.

1083
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,627
I feel like that's the truth.

1084
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,046
I had no idea.

1085
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,506
I thought you two

1086
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,925
-were sincere about each other.
-Like we had no problems?

1087
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,845
-I'm…
-And from his perspective,

1088
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,848
maybe he doesn't want to pressure you.

1089
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,892
-I mean, if you think of it positively.
-Yeah.

1090
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,187
You can't always think of it positively,
but that could be the case.

1091
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,985
Or realistically, his feelings for you
maybe aren't that serious.

1092
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,152
Yeah.

1093
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,031
He needs to develop them.

1094
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,412
But that's real.

1095
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,455
-This is how she feels.
-Yeah.

1096
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:48,293
-Even if Te-hwan believes in being single…
-Yeah.

1097
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,421
He could've said,
"I don't plan on getting married yet."

1098
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,590
"But if I meet the right person,
then who knows?"

1099
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,466
-He could've said that.
-Yeah.

1100
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,260
But he said, "I believe in being single."

1101
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,886
-It was a bit harsh.
-Yeah.

1102
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,307
You don't easily do that
in front of someone you like.

1103
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,100
I wonder why he said that.

1104
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,728
I'm just curious.

1105
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,438
Me too.

1106
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,071
-You-jin?
-Yeah.

1107
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,699
Is this supposed to hurt my shoulders?

1108
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,784
I feel like my arms are getting a workout.

1109
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,872
Jeez, it's only a fourth of my hair.

1110
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:30,335
No, a fifth. And you're complaining
your shoulders hurt?

1111
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,252
-You-jin.
-I'm done.

1112
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,295
-You are?
-Yeah.

1113
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:33,963
How do I look?

1114
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:34,964
You look pretty.

1115
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:41,512
You-jin, could you not
bring your face that close to me?

1116
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:45,308
The more time I spend
with Jong-hoon in Paradise,

1117
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,768
the more unsure of him I am.

1118
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,270
Anyway, since we're here,

1119
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:55,234
I wanted to have more deep conversations
and get to know what kind of person he is.

1120
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:59,030
Honestly, I can't do the whole,
"He's all right. He's kind of likable."

1121
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:02,367
Or "He's kind of cool.
Should I go on a date with him?"

1122
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,869
Actually, I feel like
our values are somewhat similar.

1123
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,496
-I see.
-I also believe

1124
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,289
it's right to start a relationship

1125
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:11,084
only with someone
I can see myself possibly marrying.

1126
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:15,254
While we were eating,
I felt we were on the verge of something.

1127
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,549
I can really relate to what you're saying.

1128
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,467
Yeah.

1129
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,805
-Now that we're done eating…
-Yeah?

1130
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,640
Shall we go for a swim?

1131
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:26,599
Shall we?

1132
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,892
Shall we?

1133
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,394
-Should we go now?
-Yeah.

1134
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,603
There's so much to do.

1135
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:34,607
Just when I think
we're about to really talk,

1136
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,984
he says, "All right, let's go do this."

1137
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:40,363
"Since we're done eating,
what shall we do next?"

1138
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,490
It felt like our talks
were being interrupted.

1139
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,242
-The date was a bust.
-Right.

1140
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,785
It's just a bust.

1141
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:46,953
She came up empty.

1142
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,501
I think a date in Paradise
is really meaningful.

1143
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,961
-That's right.
-It's huge.

1144
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:58,548
Because you spend the entire day together.

1145
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,925
Time flies, doesn't it?

1146
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:01,843
Yeah.

1147
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,804
Want to go inside now and eat fruit?

1148
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,643
Is he a J-type?

1149
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,311
He could just have plans.

1150
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:17,358
Back when you six voted for us,

1151
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,235
did you vote for me?

1152
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,862
I voted for you then.

1153
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,113
-Really?
-Yeah.

1154
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:26,033
That's why I wanted to
come here with you today.

1155
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,285
I see.

1156
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:30,663
Then, we were in the spa
soaking our feet and eating fruit,

1157
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,416
and when we were
in the midst of a good talk…

1158
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,376
Should we shower and go to bed now?

1159
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,714
He's like a TV show host.

1160
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:42,759
Wait, is he a kindergarten teacher
or something?

1161
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,719
Should we shower and go to bed now?

1162
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,054
He cut off our conversation again.

1163
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:50,892
We could have a genuine conversation
while lying down too.

1164
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:55,938
I thought, "Sure, let's lie down
and try to have a conversation."

1165
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,482
But when I showered and came out…

1166
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,200
I could hear him snoring.

1167
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:15,041
That's the funniest thing
I've seen so far!

1168
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,502
It's like an unstoppable force
meeting an immovable object.

1169
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:21,172
So I couldn't dry my hair,
because I was afraid of waking him.

1170
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,008
You-jin…

1171
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,928
She told me I was snoring.

1172
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:28,930
I felt a bit embarrassed.

1173
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,976
The sound of the running water
from You-jin's shower

1174
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,854
was kind of like ASMR to me.

1175
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:41,943
Right when I woke up,
You-jin was sleeping with a sheet mask on.

1176
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,486
I'd woken up once in the middle.

1177
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:45,947
It was hilarious.

1178
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,866
I felt bad, but it was so funny.

1179
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,953
"I'm going to be in trouble tomorrow."

1180
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:53,788
That's what I thought.

1181
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,586
I wouldn't say I became more attracted
to her while we were together.

1182
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,047
I'd say it's more like we became closer.

1183
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:06,884
I kept thinking about Hye-jin
while I was with You-jin.

1184
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:10,555
I thought, "Hye-jin must be bored."

1185
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,682
Still, You-jin picked me.

1186
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:17,562
I tried not to talk about other people,
because I didn't want to upset You-jin.

1187
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:20,606
I focused on having
a good time with You-jin.

1188
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:27,405
Their date in Paradise felt like
a well-planned and eventful package tour

1189
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,031
carefully arranged by a tour guide.

1190
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:29,949
Yes.

1191
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,784
You can choose either the spa or swimming.

1192
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,994
-Yeah.
-But they did both.

1193
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,912
-They did both.
-A bang-for-your-buck tour.

1194
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,080
I want to try it too.

1195
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:40,459
And even if someone gets swept up
in the atmosphere and wants to do more,

1196
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,337
"Okay, that's it for this part."
And they move on to the next one.

1197
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,547
He was like a tour guide.

1198
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,132
You-jin's time here is like a comedy.

1199
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,551
-Things aren't working out for her.
-They aren't.

1200
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,681
PARADISE
LEE SI-AN & KIM JEONG-SU

1201
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,960
He doesn't want to wake her.

1202
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,130
-He's tiptoeing.
-He's even walking carefully.

1203
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:42,939
Goodness!

1204
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,024
When did you wake up?

1205
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,026
-What?
-When did you wake up?

1206
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:50,947
Want some water?

1207
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:51,989
No, thank you.

1208
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,002
Did you hit me while I was asleep?

1209
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,505
Does it hurt? Does it hurt bad?

1210
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:08,923
My entire body hurts.

1211
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:12,551
What are we going to do?

1212
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,304
I should've given you
a massage before bed.

1213
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,306
No, it was going to hurt anyway.

1214
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:24,939
Miss,

1215
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,774
I will begin your foot massage.

1216
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:27,775
Okay.

1217
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:29,902
My goodness.

1218
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,655
Your feet are rather big.

1219
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,498
-Does it feel good?
-Yeah.

1220
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,713
-Miss, how does it feel?
-As expected, you're good at massaging.

1221
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,717
"Massaging."

1222
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,096
This is a pressure point here.

1223
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,142
-Does that feel good?
-Yes.

1224
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,519
This is a little embarrassing.

1225
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:05,730
That's why there's a limit
to what I can do.

1226
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,240
Da-hee is loving this.

1227
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:17,241
No, I…

1228
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:21,579
-When was your last foot massage?
-No, it's not…

1229
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:22,872
It's not the foot massage.

1230
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,457
Doesn't they look so nice together?

1231
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,417
Yeah, you've never acted like this before.

1232
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,044
So this is what you like.

1233
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,254
It took four seasons to find out.

1234
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,882
-But Jeong-su doesn't miss anything.
-Yeah.

1235
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,925
-He's so thoughtful.
-Seriously.

1236
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,470
On this trip to Paradise so far,

1237
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,764
it seems Jeong-su
has given 130% of his effort.

1238
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,182
-Yeah.
-Right.

1239
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,267
-He doesn't cross the line.
-It hasn't been lacking

1240
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,268
or too much.

1241
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,227
That's right.

1242
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,105
It was a Paradise date
that fulfilled all the things

1243
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,316
-that Si-an felt she lacked.
-Yeah, it was perfect.

1244
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,902
I think Si-an could change her mind too.

1245
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:56,322
Yeah, she had previously
gone to Paradise with Jun-seo.

1246
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,823
So this will be more impactful.

1247
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,117
-And it'll be a more meaningful trip.
-Right.

1248
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,119
-Because of the comparison.
-That's right.

1249
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,246
-It'll leave a lasting impact.
-Yes.

1250
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:08,084
But what if Jun-seo
is kind to her on Inferno?

1251
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,545
-A beast that has become kind?
-Yeah.

1252
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,214
-Then…
-What if he's a kind beast?

1253
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,674
That won't be easy to resist.

1254
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:17,843
INFERNO

1255
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,221
They're not greasy,
so it won't take too long.

1256
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,819
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

1257
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:40,741
There's something you said
that's been bothering me.

1258
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:41,659
Okay.

1259
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,452
What is it?

1260
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:48,541
When we were talking in the pool,

1261
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,211
-you said…
-Yeah?

1262
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,671
you believed in staying single.

1263
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:54,588
Yeah.

1264
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:56,966
But I told you

1265
01:08:57,049 --> 01:09:00,427
that my dream
was to have a happy family.

1266
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:01,345
Yeah.

1267
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:06,809
I clearly told you about my dream,
and you said that right after.

1268
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,520
So I got the feeling

1269
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:11,647
that things could
never work out between us.

1270
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,524
"Is that what he's saying?"

1271
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:14,775
I kept thinking that.

1272
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,194
The more I thought about it,

1273
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,780
I thought, "Why did he say that?"

1274
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,366
I kept wondering why you said that.

1275
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,160
That's what happened.

1276
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,538
I think because of how I am,

1277
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:31,584
I tend to be negative
or say the opposite of what I mean.

1278
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,711
But I think

1279
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:38,799
by saying things
that disagree with something,

1280
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:42,469
I can actually show
how much I agree with it.

1281
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:43,387
What?

1282
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,932
-What does that mean?
-What?

1283
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,685
So, when I said those things,

1284
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:51,645
it was actually…

1285
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,028
It was more…

1286
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:02,740
Kind of…

1287
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:05,576
How can I put it?

1288
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,997
I think he just realized
he contradicted himself as he was talking.

1289
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:10,956
I think so.

1290
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,416
He's not making sense.

1291
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,962
I think I was trying to say

1292
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,299
I was looking for someone
who'd change my mind about those beliefs.

1293
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:21,967
-I see.
-Yeah.

1294
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,637
-"But this is what I generally believe."
-Right.

1295
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,388
-I had to tell you that.
-Right.

1296
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,432
That's just what it was.

1297
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:32,228
But that's just pretty much
how I talk about everything.

1298
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,646
I'm honest.

1299
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:43,530
I believe we first have to understand
how different our values are

1300
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:48,827
to determine what kind of effort
and adjustments are needed.

1301
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:52,831
That's why I told her
about everything honestly.

1302
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,292
-They're not right for each other.
-Right.

1303
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,543
They communicate differently.

1304
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,087
Ji-yeon was already disappointed.

1305
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,756
I think he's difficult
to communicate with.

1306
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:04,551
Te-hwan tends to talk in circles.

1307
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,595
-He makes it difficult.
-Yeah.

1308
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,305
-He's hard to follow.
-Right.

1309
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:13,060
But when Ji-yeon doesn't understand,
she doesn't tell him that right away.

1310
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:13,978
-Yeah.
-Right.

1311
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:17,189
-So the conversations are never deep.
-She tries to be considerate.

1312
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,901
I get the gist
of what Te-hwan is trying to say,

1313
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:23,862
-but I can't completely relate.
-I don't understand.

1314
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:28,200
But in the end, he still didn't answer
her question at all.

1315
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,910
He only talked about the way he speaks.

1316
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:30,911
-Yeah.
-Right.

1317
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:35,708
We've come back to Inferno.

1318
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,628
I wonder what everyone's doing.

1319
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,464
-Like the colors of the flag?
-Here comes red and blue.

1320
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:44,842
Be careful.

1321
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,429
They're all gathered there.

1322
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,515
This is so funny.

1323
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,144
They're here.

1324
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:56,937
-They are?
-Yeah.

1325
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,231
-They are?
-Yeah.

1326
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,483
-Let's take one last shot.
-That was fast.

1327
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:02,526
One last shot.

1328
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,028
Hey!

1329
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:05,654
Pose for them.

1330
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,156
Take our picture too.

1331
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,369
I wonder how it was.

1332
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:13,454
You took so many photos.

1333
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:14,455
Right?

1334
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:15,372
There's more there.

1335
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:16,415
-Amazing.
-We took more.

1336
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:17,416
How do you feel?

1337
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,335
-There are a lot of funny pictures.
-You know.

1338
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:20,836
Are you okay?

1339
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:21,754
Okay, You-jin.

1340
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,422
-You can carry it now.
-Thanks.

1341
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:27,801
-How have you been?
-What?

1342
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,887
-How have you been?
-Did you have fun?

1343
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,722
-Of course.
-You came looking like the flag.

1344
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:32,639
That's right.

1345
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:33,640
Did you have fun?

1346
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:36,185
Our Casanova.

1347
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:37,394
He's so popular.

1348
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:43,817
My goodness!

1349
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:46,320
-You all match so well.
-Get closer.

1350
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:47,488
It looks nice horizontally.

1351
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,114
-Like this?
-Nice, Jun-seo.

1352
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,991
-Okay.
-What?

1353
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,785
One, two…

1354
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:56,580
He could've asked me if I had a good trip.

1355
01:12:56,663 --> 01:12:58,749
Or like, "Did you have fun? How was it?"

1356
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:00,709
It wouldn't hurt to ask.

1357
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:03,003
He didn't talk to me at all.

1358
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,130
He just sat there.

1359
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:09,343
Was he upset? He didn't look upset.

1360
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,553
I'll have to talk to him.

1361
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:16,058
-Si-an still doesn't know how she feels.
-Right? Yeah.

1362
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,352
-She returned and worried about Yuk again.
-Yeah.

1363
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:19,603
That was so unexpected.

1364
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:22,231
I thought she was set on Jeong-su.

1365
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,565
Come on, she's thinking of Yuk.

1366
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,192
-Yuk?
-Of course.

1367
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,695
What did you all do in Paradise yesterday?

1368
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,364
We ate and went bowling.

1369
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,074
-Bowling?
-That must've been fun.

1370
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,909
We had a combined score of 130.

1371
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,327
Wow, really?

1372
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,370
Wow, that's…

1373
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,831
You went bowling? That must've been fun.

1374
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,416
-You went bowling?
-Right?

1375
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,544
Only we did nothing.
They went bowling and swimming.

1376
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:45,129
We just went to bed.

1377
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:51,885
At least I won in bowling.

1378
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,346
I won, and we had a combined score of 130.

1379
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:58,434
We had a really nice bottle
of champagne last night.

1380
01:13:58,517 --> 01:13:59,810
-Really?
-It was so good.

1381
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:01,228
But I burped right after.

1382
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,690
So I felt embarrassed.

1383
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:12,948
Did you have fun?

1384
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:14,199
Yeah, I had fun.

1385
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,660
-You-jin made it so comfortable.
-Right.

1386
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:19,580
-Do we have to keep sitting here?
-No, you can do what you like.

1387
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:20,914
Do you want to go inside?

1388
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,251
Si-an came back from Paradise.

1389
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,044
I guess she wanted to leave,

1390
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:29,006
because she kept asking
if she had to stay.

1391
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:31,842
She didn't look that comfortable.

1392
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:40,976
I don't think Si-an is avoiding Jun-seo,
because they're in conflict.

1393
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:44,271
Rather, she's certain
about her feelings for Jeong-su,

1394
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:45,939
but she feels guilty towards Jun-seo.

1395
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:48,150
It's like how she felt
guilty towards Theo.

1396
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:51,403
-She feels a bit bad.
-It's different.

1397
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,905
-I think it's different.
-It is.

1398
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:55,699
-Jun-seo and Jeong-su are in an exact tie.
-Yeah.

1399
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:57,034
-They're tied.
-Yeah.

1400
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:58,076
-Really?
-Yes.

1401
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,036
I don't think so.

1402
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:01,246
Being with Jeong-su was nice.
But she saw Jun-seo and…

1403
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,123
-They're back.
-She's being swayed again.

1404
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:08,629
I think she was swept up
in the tense energy Jun-seo gave off.

1405
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:09,630
Beasts are like that.

1406
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:13,133
-Oh, no.
-So I think they're tied right now.

1407
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,801
But I wouldn't say it's a tie.

1408
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,386
-Come on.
-He gave off that energy.

1409
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,680
-Jun-seo's making her nervous.
-Yeah.

1410
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,724
-I think she'll be so confused.
-Right?

1411
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:23,018
Si-an has put in so much thought…

1412
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:24,561
-Right.
-She keeps thinking about it.

1413
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:27,272
-Because she wants to find someone good.
-Yeah.

1414
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,440
Her match.

1415
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,192
We're lucky to be just watching.

1416
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:32,611
-Some people overthink when they date.
-Yeah.

1417
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:36,323
There are so many things to consider
if you want a long-lasting relationship.

1418
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:37,282
That's right.

1419
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:46,083
It seems like…

1420
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:51,463
Today is the last day
to freely go on dates

1421
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,216
before tomorrow's final decision.

1422
01:15:57,844 --> 01:16:01,890
We hope everyone
enjoys their dates to the fullest.

1423
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,392
That last remark.

1424
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,227
-"To the fullest."
-Incredible.

1425
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,733
-They're off.
-Jun-seo's going right away.

1426
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,031
-He got up.
-What?

1427
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,575
There's no time for the mirror.

1428
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:20,492
Right.

1429
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:27,332
Who is it?

1430
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,500
Who got there first?

1431
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:08,749
