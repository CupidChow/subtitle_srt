MOON SE-HOON

00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,063
SHIN JI-YEON

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,606
KIM JUN-SIK

00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,108

CHA HYUN-SEUNG

13
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,965
I'd like to go to Paradise
with Moon Se-hoon.

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,931
Eventually…

15
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,016
Let us see his face.

16
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,685
-Show us.
-Let us see his face.

17
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,729
Moon Se-hoon.

18
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:08,234
Se-hoon, please come outside
and leave for Paradise with Ji-yeon.

19
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,028
See you.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,780
Have a good time.

21
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,199
-He's on fire
-See you.

22
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,617
-in the endgame.
-I know.

23
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,410
Moon Se-hoon.

24
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,938
Did you anticipate this?

25
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,147
-Me?
-Yes.

26
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,941
No, I mean, I…

27
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,777
-You did, didn't you?
-I kind of did,

28
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,738
but I wasn't expecting anything.

29
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,240
-Really?
-Yes.

30
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,908
So we're going there again.

31
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,246
-You're just happy to go out, right?
-Yes.

32
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,500
-What do you want to do today?
-Let's eat a lot today.

33
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,543
Sounds good.

34
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,630
This is amazing.

35
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,259
Se-hoon has achieved
what he wanted in Inferno.

36
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,095
-He's growing through this show.
-Right. He's growing.

37
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:22,016
Next up is second runner-up, Kang So-yeon.

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,397
Please choose the person you'd like
to go on a date with in Paradise.

39
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,358
I wonder whom So-yeon will pick.

40
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,319
Hyun-seung. Definitely Hyun-seung.

41
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,532
-I bet she'll choose Jin-taek.
-I agree. This is the last night.

42
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,784
-I think it's Hyun-seung.
-It has to be Jin-taek.

43
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,166
I was so torn.

44
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:51,212
Because I've already been
to Paradise with Jin-taek twice,

45
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,132
and I didn't really
get to know the others.

46
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,093
So I thought, maybe I should
take someone else to Paradise

47
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,678
so I can get to know them better.

48
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,098
Well, I did not see this coming.

49
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,934
So-yeon, you shouldn't risk it.

50
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,648
I'd like to go to Paradise with…

51
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,486
The person Kang So-yeon chose is…

52
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,497
Cha Hyun-seung.

53
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,209
-Cha Hyun-seung.
-What?

54
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,921
-Cha Hyun-seung.
-What?

55
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,466
-Cha Hyun-seung.
-What?

56
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,724
-But Hyun-seung is into Ji-a.
-Hyun-seung seems to like it.

57
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,896
Cha Hyun-seung's neighbor, Oh Jin-taek.

58
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,570
-Cha Hyun-seung's neighbor, Oh Jin-taek.
-What?

59
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,447
-See?
-Jin-taek, please come outside

60
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,241
-"Cha Hyun-seung's neighbor, Oh Jin-taek"?
-and leave for Paradise

61
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,700
-with So-yeon.
-I didn't expect this.

62
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,660
Have fun.

63
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,536
-What?
-What is this?

64
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,081
What?

65
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,878
Seriously?

66
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,507
You chose me.

67
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,719
It was fun, wasn't it?

68
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,638
-Thank you.
-No problem.

69
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,225
We're going there too often.

70
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,355
This is their third time.
It's like they're on a honeymoon.

71
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,524
A honeymoon trip is
usually three days long.

72
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,402
-They're like a married couple.
-This means

73
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,987
-Ji-a,
-Hyun-seung.

74
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,530
Hyeon-joong, and Hyun-seung
are left in Inferno.

75
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,531
All three of them.

76
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,368
This time, I wonder
what's going to happen in Inferno.

77
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,744
-Me too.
-It's going to be fierce.

78
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,787
Exactly.

79
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,914
And Min-ji is feeling bitter now.

80
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,167
I've seen her smile only once.

81
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,170
When she first appeared.

82
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,260
To be honest,
I wasn't feeling so good earlier.

83
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,138
-When? When you talked to Se-hoon?
-Yes. After talking to him.

84
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,270
I even saw him peeling
a sweet potato for Ji-yeon.

85
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,396
-Today?
-Yes.

86
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,772
-Really?
-Earlier, at lunch.

87
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,068
I see. I was trying not to look at them.

88
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,153
-Good.
-Right.

89
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,450
What's that?

90
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,953
-It must be pouring outside.
-It sounds like it is.

91
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,041
Oh, it's so windy.

92
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,710
-This place has literally become hell.
-Right.

93
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,842
INFERNO

94
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:49,140
PARADISE

95
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,686
That place is nice regardless of the rain.

96
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,689
-Right.
-It's always nice.

97
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,690
Right.

98
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,069
Let's eat slowly
so we don't get indigestion.

99
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,196
-Okay.
-Okay?

100
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,073
Do you want to have a drink?

101
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,033
Cheers.

102
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,749
I was really craving this.

103
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,459
-Really?
-Yes.

104
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,088
Thank you so much, Su-min.

105
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,966
Seriously, my eyes are getting teary.

106
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,468
How old are you?

107
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,886
-My age?
-Yes.

108
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,179
I'm 30.

109
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,890
-Really?
-Yes.

110
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,479
-Am I too old?
-My gosh. You have such a babyface.

111
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,772
-I do?
-Yes.

112
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,524
How old are you?

113
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,275
I'm 24.

114
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,568
-You're 24?
-Yes.

115
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,694
I see.

116
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,696
What do you do for a living?

117
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,200
-I do modeling in ads and…
-I see.

118
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,163
I'm a professional model.

119
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:59,544
I'm modeling mostly
for beauty products like face washes.

120
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,463
I like posing for pictures,

121
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,091
and naturally, I became a model.

122
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,551
KIM SU-MIN, 24, BEAUTY PRODUCT MODEL

123
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,262
-She looks so pure and pretty.
-She has such cute dimples.

124
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,722
-She's a beauty model.
-Her smile makes me feel good.

125
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,767
-I have one question.
-Okay.

126
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,354
Well, is there a reason

127
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,107
-why you chose me?
-You mean, why I chose you then?

128
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,692
-Today.
-Oh, today?

129
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,237
I wonder why you chose me today.

130
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,659
Remember I once said
that I was worried about you?

131
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,952
Right.

132
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,329
When I heard you say that,

133
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,498
I thought you might be pitying me.

134
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,375
-No.
-That's what I thought.

135
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,793
I thought I might have looked

136
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,086
-pathetic to you.
-No way.

137
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,631
You know, I just couldn't

138
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,967
get you out of my head.

139
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,053
I kept thinking about you.

140
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,683
-Si-hun, I'd like to talk to you.
-Okay. Let's go talk.

141
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,146
-I didn't get to talk to you much.
-Right.

142
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,857
I heard you said

143
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,109
I was close to your ideal type.

144
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,319
Right.

145
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,697
-Appearance-wise.
-Since I heard that,

146
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,657
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

147
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:16,204
At first,
I didn't know what to think of it.

148
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,207
If you had come here on the first day,

149
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,585
you might have been
the first one I talked to.

150
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,172
Because appearance-wise,
you're the closest

151
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,216
to my ideal type.

152
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,133
I see.

153
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,303
But I couldn't approach you easily

154
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,097
because I was spending
some time here reflecting on myself.

155
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,143
So I couldn't really initiate
a conversation with others.

156
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,270
That talk with you gave me

157
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,232
a very good impression.

158
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,027
I could feel you were sincere.

159
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,237
I see.

160
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,363
And I liked it.

161
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,075
-Do you know what touched my heart?
-What is it? That I called you out?

162
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,827
You're the first person

163
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,081
to call me out of that loneliness.

164
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,293
I was so grateful. I was so happy.

165
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,171
Then we got to talk…

166
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,299
and eventually come here.

167
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,677
I'm so happy.

168
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,392
You know what? I don't think it's good

169
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,061
that he keeps thanking her like that.

170
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,145
Is that so?

171
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,732
Because it doesn't sound like he's glad

172
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,402
to find out that she likes him back.

173
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,988
He keeps saying, "Thank you
for taking me out of there."

174
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,364
"Thank you for saving me."

175
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,490
-That's
-A good point.

176
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,159
not necessarily
what Su-min would like to hear.

177
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,286
-That's how I feel.
-I agree.

178
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,664
But Jin-kyung, as you know,
Si-hun had a really tough time in there.

179
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,707
Right.

180
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,209
-She's probably a silver lining
-Yes?

181
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,420
that came to save him from the agony.

182
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,214
-That's exactly what she wouldn't like.
-Really?

183
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,844
She probably wanted it
to be a mutual spark.

184
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,596
-But he's just grateful.
-All right.

185
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,057
-He says he's grateful.
-Of course.

186
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,310
-He's truly grateful.
-All right.

187
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,479
PARADISE
KANG SO-YEON AND OH JIN-TAEK

188
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,897
This is our last night here.

189
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,693
I didn't know we'd be together
until the last night here.

190
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,738
-You've been tired today, right?
-Yes.

191
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,365
I know why.

192
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,742
What do you mean?

193
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,662
You kept running around
in my mind yesterday.

194
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,290
No wonder you're so tired.

195
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,752
You were running around so much.

196
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,755
Gosh, you never change.

197
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,673
Do you have any siblings?

198
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,426
I have a little sister.

199
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,552
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

200
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,013
She doesn't have a beard, does she?

201
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,350
-She's pretty, unlike me.
-Is that so?

202
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,686
-Yes. My father is kind of hairy.
-Okay.

203
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,106
-One day, he asked me.
-Asked you what?

204
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,526
If I had put on some
hair growth cream on my chest.

205
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,279
-Your father said that?
-Yes.

206
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,447
Doesn't he have chest hair?

207
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,450
-He does, but not as much.
-I see.

208
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,826
Would you like to touch it?

209
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,373
Never mind.

210
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,376
Okay. Let me try touching it.

211
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,753
-How should I touch it?
-What?

212
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,797
How should I touch it? Why are you scared?

213
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,425
Let me just take your hand
and touch it. It's actually quite soft.

214
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,260
-Oh, my gosh!
-What's wrong?

215
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,139
It's like touching a puppy.

216
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,141
-You've never touched a beard?
-No.

217
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,101
-Really?
-No.

218
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,937
-Never in your whole life?
-My dad doesn't have facial hair.

219
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,815
-I guess that's possible.
-Yes.

220
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,901
Right. I lost the game.

221
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,404
The loser will grant the winner's wish.

222
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,322
A FEW MOMENTS AGO AT THE BOWLING ALLEY

223
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,116
I'm going to ask for something harsh.

224
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,909
I'm going to do the same.

225
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,119
You can do it.

226
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,287
Gosh, that's strong.

227
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,667
-Can you see how desperate I am to win?
-I can see.

228
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,961
Darn it.

229
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,713
It went in the same direction.

230
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,674
I win.

231
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,094
What do you think my wish is?

232
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,137
I wonder what it is.

233
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,931
Could you kiss me on my cheek?

234
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,601
Could you kiss me on the cheek?

235
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,523
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

236
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,150
Where's your cheek though?

237
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,903
I can't see your cheek.

238
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,697
-My cheek?
-Yes.

239
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,409
-Where there's no beard.
-Okay.

240
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,121
I won the game,
so I can make this wish, right?

241
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,372
Yes.

242
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,624
You can, but I can't find your cheek.

243
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,128
Try to look for it.

244
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,215
But why on the cheek?

245
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,093
-This is the only chance he has.
-Right.

246
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,346
Maybe he's going to turn his head.

247
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,057
No! Don't do that!-

248
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,517
This can't be happening.

249
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,897
-Should I keep my eyes closed?
-Well…

250
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,547
Well, that was funny.

251
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,508
-Are you okay?
-What?

252
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,550
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

253
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,179
Do you want to go bowling again?

254
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,308
My favorite sport is bowling now.

255
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,103
Gosh.

256
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,859
I had a hard time finding your cheek,
so I kissed your cheekbone.

257
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,029
Gosh, seriously.

258
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,950
You looked so cute
when you were flustered.

259
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,992
What?

260
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,038
Should we give foot massages?

261
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,499
-Should we try it?
-Should we?

262
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,000
-Should we try?
-Do you want it?

263
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,086
This is exciting.

264
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,838
I've never given anyone
a foot massage before,

265
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,257
but I like getting it myself,

266
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,677
-so I'll try what I liked.
-Okay.

267
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,220
Put your foot up.

268
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,477
It feels really good.

269
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,521
It hurts.

270
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,730
Did it hurt?

271
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,190
It hurts.

272
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,485
-Doesn't it feel relaxing?
-It feels good.

273
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,738
-Good.
-You're good.

274
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,324
You must have done this a lot.

275
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,034
No.

276
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,923
I can massage your shoulders.

277
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,675
-My shoulders?
-Yes.

278
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,218
Sounds good.

279
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,851
-Do you want me to lie on my belly?
-Yes.

280
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,446
-Like this?
-Yes.

281
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,871
You have nice skin.

282
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,748
-I do?
-Yes.

283
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,003
-Does it feel good?
-Yes.

284
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,513
Please keep doing it.

285
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,726
Please don't stop.

286
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,897
That feels really nice on my arms.

287
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,361
Do you like it?

288
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,862
Yes. This is the best.

289
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,821
Right?

290
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,032
-So-yeon.
-Yes?

291
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,116
You're the best.

292
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,788
Getting a massage from someone else

293
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,041
feels so relaxing and nice.

294
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,167
It really does.

295
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,920
You must be exhausted.

296
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,591
That's because I worked so hard yesterday
to come here with So-yeon.

297
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,263
Gosh, this is so good.

298
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,974
I'm really good, right?

299
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,183
Is this your first time?

300
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,810
This is how they do it.

301
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,104
My gosh, this feels so good.

302
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,110
I can't help but moan.

303
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,488
-Done.
-So-yeon.

304
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,447
Yes?

305
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,658
I feel like I've been born again.

306
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,205
You loved my massage, didn't you?

307
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,126
Looks like you've fallen in love with me.
I can tell from your eyes.

308
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,045
You see that now?

309
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,631
-Can you see the hearts in my eyes?
-Yes.

310
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,758
Can you see the hearts
popping out of my eyes?

311
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,475
They haven't touched
each other like this before.

312
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,353
It almost seems like
they've started dating.

313
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,312
They're dating now.

314
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,565
-They're definitely a couple.
-Right. They started going out.

315
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,735
-Right.
-They can't choose someone else

316
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,611
-after all this.
-They'd deserve a good scolding.

317
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,405
-For sure.
-If they choose others,

318
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,614
that would be cheating.

319
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,200
-Right. That would be cheating.
-That would be cheating.

320
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,786
PARADISE
SHIN JI-YEON AND MOON SE-HOON

321
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,079
Oh, my gosh.

322
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,248
Oh, my gosh.

323
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,501
What's all this?

324
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,547
It looks so delicious.

325
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,840
There's a pizza too.

326
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,008
I know.

327
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,469
Let's sit here.

328
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,262
Ji-yeon, sit here.

329
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,472
Okay.

330
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,142
What's all this?

331
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,436
-There's one more here.
-Pasta.

332
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,356
-Octopus. Pizza. Steak.
-They all look so good.

333
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,859
-You must be hungry.
-I am.

334
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,530
-Seriously, it looks so good.
-Right?

335
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,992
You keep saying, "Right?"

336
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,911
And we had some steaks yesterday, right?

337
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,370
Right.

338
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,373
How many times are you saying "right"?

339
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,044
-All the dishes here look so pretty.
-It's a little undercooked

340
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,712
for your taste though.

341
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,632
-It's okay.
-How do you want me to cut your steak?

342
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,218
-Into small pieces.
-Okay.

343
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,302
Thanks.

344
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,305
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

345
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,393
It's really good.

346
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,854
I can taste truffles.

347
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,980
-The pizza?
-Yes.

348
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,065
-I see.
-It's tasty.

349
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,694
It's amazing that I came here
two nights in a row.

350
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,447
-with you.
-It is.

351
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,660
-And this is our last night here. Right?
-Yes.

352
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,953
You always say…

353
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,412
Right.

354
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,668
I said that again, right?

355
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,836
You said it again.

356
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,047
-You keep saying "right".
-Okay, I'll stop saying that.

357
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,968
While watching the girls play today,

358
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,594
who did you cheer for?

359
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,638
-Did you cheer for anyone?
-Of course I did.

360
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,143
Actually, I wished
you wouldn't win the game.

361
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,019
-Why?
-I really wished you wouldn't.

362
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,688
-Honestly?
-Yes.

363
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,523
I thought you might not choose me.

364
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,525
Oh, because if I won
and didn't choose you,

365
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,902
-it'd make you feel bad?
-Yes. Right.

366
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,156
-So I wished you would lose.
-So I don't have any choice.

367
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,532
-Right.
-I didn't know

368
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,450
I would win the game at first.

369
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,536
-Really? But you tried so hard.
-Because the game…

370
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,329
-Was that so obvious?
-It was like

371
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,665
you were playing the game for your life.

372
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,669
Did you immediately decide to choose me

373
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,921
or did you have to think a bit

374
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,840
before choosing me?

375
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,967
Well…

376
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,931
Yesterday, we got to have
a proper conversation for the first time.

377
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,559
While talking to you yesterday,

378
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,354
-I came to open my mind.
-I see.

379
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,898
I thought it'd be nice

380
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,609
to talk to you again
and spend more time with you.

381
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,653
So to be honest,
I didn't have to think much about it.

382
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,364
That's nice to hear.

383
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,868
-Right? Did I do a good job?
-Yes, you did a good job.

384
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,244
I did a good job, right?

385
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,955
When I heard you chose me…

386
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,501
-I was so happy.
-Really?

387
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,711
Yes, I was so happy.

388
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,088
-You couldn't keep your face straight.
-I tried to.

389
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,142
This is the last night's date.

390
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,478
-It's nice.
-Our last date here.

391
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,479
I know.

392
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,024
-And we got to go on a date out here.
-Right.

393
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,154
If I were asked to choose
the best moments from yesterday,

394
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,282
it would be when I saw you walk toward me

395
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,533
after I called you out.

396
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,622
I was really happy then.

397
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,627
And remember when
we were at the outdoor pool?

398
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,381
You were leaning on the chair
and I was watching you from the water.

399
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,260
-You were watching me like a seal.
-Right. That moment.

400
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,892
That's when I was
at my happiest yesterday.

401
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,435
-Really?
-Yes.

402
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,271
-You're so sensitive.
-I am?

403
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,397
Yes.

404
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,025
At that very moment,
this thought crossed my mind.

405
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,779
"I'm so happy right now."
That's what I thought.

406
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,698
Was it the best moment of the past week?

407
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,991
-The past week here?
-Yes.

408
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,742
You'd better be clever with your answer.

409
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,702
You're right.

410
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,662
-You'd better be clever.
-That's when I was at my happiest.

411
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,663
Water, cheers.

412
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:31,915
"Water, cheers."

413
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,670
I think you're the one
I knew the least about.

414
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,589
I didn't get to have
a serious conversation with you.

415
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,968
-Right.
-It was so awkward.

416
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,431
-It felt a little awkward.
-We were awkward around each other.

417
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,439
And I thought I might've been the reason

418
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,441
-when I heard you say that.
-I see.

419
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,693
I said this to Hyeon-joong and Si-hun.

420
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,028
I want to stop this.

421
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,114
I don't know why I keep thinking about her

422
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,325
when she's not interested in me at all.

423
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,576
I want to stop this here.

424
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,286
So I thought a lot about it.

425
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,289
-I really thought a lot about it.
-About giving up?

426
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,459
Well, yes. But I couldn't stop…

427
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,586
You know…

428
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,756
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

429
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:30,265
Actually, when I had to choose someone
on our second day there,

430
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,059
I thought a lot about whom to choose.

431
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,020
I knew you were flirting with me,

432
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,481
so I was really torn.

433
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,942
But I ended up choosing someone else.

434
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,532
Well, I'm the one who chooses
whom I want to go on a date with,

435
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,160
but some people asked me,

436
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,580
"Why didn't you choose Se-hoon?"

437
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,208
-On the first and second day?
-Yes.

438
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,335
Well, of course I considered it.

439
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,212
I'm a human after all. Of course I did.

440
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,505
I thought about it,

441
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,382
but hearing those comments

442
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,468
was kind of a burden to me.

443
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,805
Right. I can imagine. I didn't know that.

444
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,099
Others might have not noticed it,

445
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,601
but I was pretty stressed out too.

446
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,524
I'm the kind of person
who needs time to process things.

447
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,525
So it was too…

448
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,363
Well, it would've been nice
if you had said something like…

449
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,322
Like what?

450
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,786
"I think I need some time

451
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,246
to open my mind to you."

452
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,789
Or something like…

453
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,791
I see. Do you think I should've said that?

454
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,209
Well, it's just what I think.

455
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,130
I can't force this thought onto you.

456
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,590
So I'm trying to say…

457
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,929
It wasn't easy for me either.

458
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,141
-I'm sure it wasn't.
-It really wasn't.

459
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,517
I can imagine.

460
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,352
So that's why…

461
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,772
I don't feel so good.

462
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,364
-Don't worry about it.
-Well, okay. Back then…

463
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,163
It must've been tough.

464
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,750
Well, it must've been worse for you.

465
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,795
-No. It's okay. I enjoy this.
-Really?

466
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:28,633
That's why I decided to come here

467
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,052
and I'm doing my best now.

468
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,470
I feel so bad now

469
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,847
-I want to cry.
-What?

470
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,807
Why are you crying?

471
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,810
Gosh. Ji-yeon.

472
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,063
Hey.

473
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,449
-I'm so embarrassed.
-No, it's okay.

474
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,374
Don't cry.

475
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,335
Have some water.

476
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,443
Come on. After all,
we're having a great meal here together.

477
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,904
So everything's fine now. Right?

478
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,574
Whatever it was,

479
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,826
I appreciate

480
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,038
-everything we've been through.
-Right.

481
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,584
During the seven days here,

482
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:48,505
I had a lot of thoughts.

483
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:52,717
I was feeling sorry to Se-hoon too.

484
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,847
But then Se-hoon brought it up.

485
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,934
When he said,
"It must've been tough for you too",

486
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:05,897
it felt like my feelings
that no one had noticed were validated.

487
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,150
I think that's why I got emotional then.

488
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:13,530
I felt like Se-hoon understood me,

489
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,823
and I was so grateful.

490
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,910
I think he's a really cool person.
I like him more now.

491
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:24,082
He had a hard time too,
but he didn't talk about that only.

492
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,209
-"It must've been hard for you too."
-Right.

493
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,004
I think that's
what touched Ji-yeon's heart.

494
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,213
-I agree.
-Right.

495
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,214
It's so…

496
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:35,760
-I thought he was such a stubborn man.
-Right.

497
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,139
No matter what others said,

498
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,557
he didn't listen.

499
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,642
But when he talks to Ji-yeon,

500
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,812
he's so soft like a sponge.

501
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,897
-Right. He accepts everything.
-He accepts everything.

502
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:48,857
Right.

503
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,443
-He embraces everything.
-Yes. He does.

504
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,237
Actually, this is
the kind of person many people like.

505
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,114
He's nice only to me,

506
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,117
but he is cold to others.
Those people are popular.

507
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,201
Right.

508
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,873
Se-hoon was so sad in the beginning.

509
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,459
Seeing Se-hoon used to make me sad,

510
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,337
but he seems to have a happy ending.

511
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,963
I think there's a good chance
that he becomes the final winner.

512
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,965
-He's the true winner of this game.
-Right.

513
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,385
If he had quit the game
on, say, the fifth day there,

514
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,511
what would have happened?

515
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:24,100
I mean, I would've understood
if he had quit then.

516
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,519
He would've said this
when he left. "That was fun."

517
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,021
Right. "That was fun."

518
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,522
He would've said that and left.

519
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,275
It's nice that he hadn't.
His day has come.

520
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,943
Right. You have to endure.

521
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,695
-You do.
-Life is all about enduring.

522
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,905
Right.

523
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,044
Gosh, the weather is so nice today.

524
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,713
We need this kind
of weather once in a while.

525
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,674
We can see really far today.

526
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,259
I know. It's really nice today.

527
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,804
-I feel like this is a different island.
-Right? It feels like

528
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,098
-a totally different island.
-It feels different.

529
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,893
So today is our last day here.

530
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,521
I'm going to miss our time here.

531
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,439
Right? It's almost over already.

532
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,488
-Can we talk?
-Sorry?

533
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,198
-Can we talk?
-Sure.

534
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,866
What did you do here?

535
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,160
Me? I've been waiting for you.

536
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,537
Out here?

537
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,290
I've been here and there.
There are many places I haven't been to.

538
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,583
I see.

539
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,002
It's almost over now.

540
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,088
-I'm sad.
-What a shame.

541
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,340
You smell nice.

542
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,967
-Right?
-Yes.

543
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,053
I should've come here earlier.

544
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:46,891
I know. If you had come earlier,

545
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,686
it would've been much more fun.

546
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,647
Do you want to stay here more?

547
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,360
Well, I had a lot of thoughts,
since we went there together.

548
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,903
-You mean, Paradise?
-Yes.

549
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,992
It was so nice to hang out with you.

550
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,581
When you had just arrived,
I said this at the interview.

551
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,498
What did you say?

552
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:17,213
I said you're my ideal type.
I mean, appearance-wise.

553
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,215
So…

554
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,677
this is going to be hard for me.

555
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,264
Take your time to think about it.

556
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,684
You still have some time.

557
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,519
I will. I haven't made up my mind yet.

558
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:43,323
I guess you're going
to talk to Hyeon-joong after this.

559
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,535
So I'll talk to you more.

560
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,748
-Okay. Let's not go back.
-What? Do you mean it?

561
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,167
Sounds good to me.

562
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,086
We should take an instant photo too.

563
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,171
Let's take one.

564
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,842
-Come here.
-Okay.

565
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,098
Let's take a selfie.

566
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,684
One, two, three.

567
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,147
-Will it come out well?
-Yes.

568
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,315
It's us.

569
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,985
Look at your confidence.

570
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,322
We look gorgeous.

571
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,077
-Can I come in?
-Come in.

572
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,915
Hyun-seung took Ji-a.

573
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,917
Did they go out?

574
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,629
I wonder when the others will be back.

575
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,090
Do you miss Se-hoon?

576
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,178
-It's like watching myself.
-Why?

577
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,097
-Why?
-You're always waiting here.

578
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,223
I am?

579
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,892
Do you think I can change his mind?

580
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,936
I don't know what I should say.

581
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,690
Ji-a said no one will approach me.

582
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,653
And then she always goes
on dates with other guys.

583
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,780
And here I am,
waiting for her like a puppy.

584
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,158
-She has never come to me.
-You seem to be always waiting.

585
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,578
-I always wait and go to see her.
-Right.

586
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,746
Seriously, you're waiting all the time.

587
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,039
-Right?
-Yes.

588
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,458
Even now, I'm waiting for her.

589
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,963
So we're leaving tomorrow.
How do you feel?

590
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,381
I feel bad.

591
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,968
If I had known
the time here would be so short,

592
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,889
I would've called you out all the time.

593
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,806
Right.

594
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,225
We should capture this moment.
This is going to end.

595
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,477
What a shame.

596
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,734
It would have been nice
if you had come here on the first day.

597
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,779
You should've given me
some time to talk to you too.

598
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,408
You need to put in the effort
to win someone's heart.

599
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,409
-Is that so?
-Yes.

600
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,623
But you didn't get to spend much time

601
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,166
with other girls.

602
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,210
-Me?
-Yes. Don't you feel bad about it?

603
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:06,132
I would rather talk with you more
than waste the time on others.

604
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,258
I see.

605
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,826
But Ji-a is hanging out
with some other guy.

606
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,829
It's amazing that he knows
all that but still waits for her.

607
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,082
-Those who joined late…
-I feel like Ji-a and Hyun-seung

608
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,458
-will be a couple.
-You do?

609
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,711
She said she'd like to stay with him,
and that means she likes him.

610
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,838
But she left some hints.

611
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,256
-Right.
-What do you mean?

612
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,676
"It would have been nice
if you had come here…"

613
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,679
-"Would have."
-This sounds like a hint to me.

614
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,972
Oh, that.

615
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:59,185
No, she probably doesn't
even know how she feels.

616
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,646
-It's not over until it's over.
-Until she makes a choice?

617
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,897
-Okay.
-No one knows.

618
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:08,945
We're back.

619
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,657
It's so beautiful here.
Look at the ocean and the sky.

620
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,826
-It's so beautiful today.
-It's so beautiful.

621
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,537
I have no regrets now.

622
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,581
-I'm glad I won the last game.
-I know.

623
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,210
You were like a heroine.

624
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,213
I had fun, Su-min.

625
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,507
Me too.

626
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,511
-Bye.
-Bye, Su-min.

627
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,429
Bye.

628
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,431
-See you later.
-See you.

629
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,432
-Bye.
-See you later.

630
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,349
See you.

631
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,658
Gosh, this is their final night.

632
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,746
I'll sit in front of the drinks.

633
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,039
I want the nachos.

634
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,957
Oh, I love this.

635
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,509
You always sit next to me. I love it.

636
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,552
This is my seat.

637
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,640
Aren't you cold?
You should've brought a jacket.

638
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,476
These are the warmest clothes I have.

639
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,852
You must be cold.

640
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,147
-Ji-a, come here.
-It's so cold.

641
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,861
Looks like we're drinking today.

642
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,197
Let's drink together.

643
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,284
-This is our last night.
-Can I get that black one?

644
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,745
I like this.

645
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,538
I drank a lot.

646
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,582
It was really fun.

647
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,045
Should we make a toast?
Gosh, that scared me.

648
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,546
Good work, guys.

649
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,007
-Good work, everyone.
-Cheers.

650
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,597
-It's tasty.
-I can't stop.

651
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,517
-This is finally our last night here.
-Right.

652
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,228
-Time flew by so fast.
-I know.

653
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,479
Time flew by so fast.

654
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,981
-At first, it didn't.
-Right. It didn't.

655
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,150
-It passed so slowly.
-Time's passing faster.

656
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,363
Right. We should talk about our ages and…

657
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,948
-Professions?
-Let's talk about our professions.

658
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,992
I'm 24,

659
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,871
and am now working
as a beauty products model.

660
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,377
I'm a freelance model.

661
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,174
I model for cosmetic brands
that target people in their 10s and 20s.

662
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:40,096
I also model for clothing brands too.

663
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,726
SEONG MIN-JI, 24, MODEL

664
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,980
Gosh, she's ten years younger than me.

665
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,983
-You're right.
-So-yeon, don't say things like that.

666
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,735
-I wouldn't have said that.
-I didn't know.

667
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,113
How do you feel now?

668
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,614
-I'm so curious.
-Right now?

669
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,032
-Yes. I want to know.
-Me too.

670
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,121
I'm deeply moved.

671
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,501
My gosh. This is just…

672
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,837
-This deserves a good toast.
-Why?

673
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,303
Min-ji, how do you think

674
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,348
things would've been different
if you joined us from the start?

675
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,560
I thought if I had
come here on the first day,

676
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,771
things might have been a little different.

677
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,358
Do you think
you would still have liked Se-hoon?

678
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,991
I think I would have.

679
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,538
-Why?
-Thanks for sharing with us

680
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,998
-She's charming.
-so honestly.

681
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,250
-I have a question.
-Okay.

682
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,461
If I had come here on the first day…

683
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,881
If I had come here on the first day,
how do you think it would've been?

684
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,010
Gosh, this is getting interesting.

685
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,678
Hey, give me more of that.

686
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,764
My goodness.

687
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,858
My…

688
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,161
It would've definitely affected me,

689
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,665
but I don't think
the result would have been different.

690
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:40,132
Gosh, this is uncomfortable.

691
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,429
I have a question.

692
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,392
When they chose partners yesterday,

693
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:58,901
how did you feel when you heard
So-yeon chose Cha Hyun-seung?

694
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,701
I thought,
"Everything I've done was for nothing."

695
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,872
"It was all one-sided."

696
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,711
I had this thought for like two seconds.

697
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,384
But then she chose me,
so I was so grateful.

698
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,639
This might be a little personal…

699
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,393
but I have a question for you.

700
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,061
What is it?

701
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,230
You have no hard feelings
toward me, do you?

702
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,358
Seriously, do you?

703
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,278
Well, I'm rather feeling sorry.

704
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:47,116
At that time,
I was super sensitive emotionally

705
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,076
and so were you.

706
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,494
Which led to a conflict.

707
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,205
And that conflict broke everything
and ended everything.

708
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,875
And that's why I'm thankful to you.

709
00:38:55,958 --> 00:39:01,672
-How was it for you?
-I think that conflict is actually

710
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,300
what brought me here.

711
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:05,926
Really?

712
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,181
Let's drink.

713
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,851
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

714
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:14,769
Cheers.

715
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,690
I think

716
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,527
I'll remember this summer, this beach,

717
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,487
and…

718
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,782
the nice feelings I had here

719
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,368
like photographs for the rest of my life.

720
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,245
I'll remember this for a long time.

721
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,830
I joined this show

722
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,291
because I wanted a hot relationship.

723
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,377
And now, a flame has been ignited.

724
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,423
Above all, it was so nice
to get to know so many great people.

725
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,094
I got to live and communicate in a way

726
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,221
I have never experienced before.

727
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:54,308
I got to see the ocean and the sky,
which I love so much.

728
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,020
I probably will never get a chance
to do something like this again.

729
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:03,192
I was true to my feelings
and I did my best.

730
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:07,738
Being here reminded me
of the emotions I had forgotten.

731
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:12,410
I got to really focus on my feelings here.

732
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,620
I think my stay here

733
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,957
made me a stronger person.

734
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,792
It was a great opportunity for me

735
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,878
to look at myself
from a different perspective.

736
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,046
I enjoyed it.

737
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,298
Oh, no.

738
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,343
SONG JI-A

739
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,011
I think I'm going to cry.

740
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,852
They've all become my friends now.

741
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,021
I'm going to miss them all.

742
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,278
There have been ups and downs
during the past eight days here,

743
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,282
but everyone has been so nice

744
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,826
and now we can end this on a high note.

745
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,165
I feel like I'd never get
to experience anything like this.

746
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,875
And…

747
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,170
KANG SO-YEON

748
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:12,386
We had some really
sentimental and hard moments,

749
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:16,182
but we had so many nice moments too.

750
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:20,186
We may go back
to our normal lives after this,

751
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,316
but I hope we don't forget
the moments we had here

752
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,153
and I hope we can keep in touch.

753
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:35,576
They had both tough times and great times

754
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,578
on the island,

755
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,955
Inferno.

756
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,874
I wonder how many couples will be made.

757
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,792
-It's hard to tell.
-Right.

758
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,711
I'm curious.

759
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,663
This is Single's Inferno,
the hottest inferno in the world.

760
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,249
Now, we have the final voting session left

761
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,834
to decide the couples
who will escape Inferno.

762
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,548
SEONG MIN-JI

763
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:34,468
Each female participant is waiting
for their partners in different places.

764
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,427
SHIN JI-YEON

765
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,138
AN YEA-WON

766
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,349
They're all in different places.

767
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,768
KANG SO-YEON

768
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,270
But they can still see each other.

769
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,314
KIM SU-MIN

770
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,901
SONG JI-A

771
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:58,534
Now, male participants,
please go to the female participants

772
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,786
you have decided on, one at a time.

773
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:14,008
So right now, the female participants
are waiting for their final partners.

774
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,261
The male participants will go
to the female participants

775
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,638
they'd like to be their final partners.

776
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,308
Does that mean
two men can go to one woman?

777
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,350
Yes.

778
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,606
Kim Jun-sik is the first to go.

779
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,234
It's time to go.

780
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,030
Good luck, Jun-sik.

781
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,573
Good luck.

782
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,575
Goodbye.

783
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,913
I've been attracted
to her from the beginning,

784
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,584
and she showed interest in me.

785
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,518
Look at him striding.

786
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,108
-Yea-won, of course.
-Yea-won.

787
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,239
Next up is Kim Hyeon-joong.

788
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,033
Right away?

789
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,336
So not Min-ji or Ji-yeon.

790
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,631
-Are Min-ji and Ji-yeon over there?
-They're up there.

791
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,973
It would be such a big twist
if he went to So-yeon.

792
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,645
You did a great job.

793
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,741
I'm quite stubborn once I make up my mind.

794
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:07,871
Something about Ji-a really fascinated me,

795
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,832
and that's why I chose her immediately.

796
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,960
Hi, puppy.

797
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,552
Next up is Moon Se-hoon.

798
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:23,720
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

799
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,155
I want to get to know her better.

800
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:45,826
I want to know what makes her happy,
what she doesn't like,

801
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,786
what she likes, and what makes her angry.

802
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,496
I want to know those things.

803
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,707
Do you see where Se-hoon is heading?

804
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,084
Min-ji is standing there
and Ji-yeon is behind her.

805
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,420
Oh, my gosh.

806
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,075
Hey.

807
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,076
What?

808
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,164
You did a great job.

809
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,334
You did a great job.

810
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,689
I'm a go-getter.

811
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,400
When I like someone, I do everything I can

812
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,445
to win her heart no matter what.

813
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,285
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

814
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,552
-His face looks different.
-Right.

815
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,096
-Ji-yeon seems happy too.
-Right. Her face has changed.

816
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,640
-Her face has completely changed.
-It's different now.

817
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,100
Se-hoon is awesome.

818
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,685
He really is.

819
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,686
Right. He really is.

820
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,355
Next up is Oh Jin-taek.

821
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,734
Good luck.

822
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,991
She's more sentimental than I thought.

823
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,577
And overall, we have

824
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,704
very similar thoughts and mindsets.

825
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,455
That's why I'm attracted to her.

826
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,299
Hi.

827
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,633
Hi.

828
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:14,391
Next up is Cha Hyun-seung.

829
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,351
I'll go then.

830
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:29,406
When I was with her,
I found her to be so charming.

831
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,245
-I wonder who he's going to.
-Ji-a, of course.

832
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,796
Are you here to choose me?

833
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,200
-It's hot, isn't it?
-I'm dying.

834
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,618
-Go inside.
-What?

835
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,453
-Go inside.
-I'll take her.

836
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,121
No, I'll take her. You can go.

837
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,002
My gosh.

838
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,172
Gosh, can you believe that?
They're even close friends.

839
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,800
Do men always choose love over friendship?

840
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,890
And lastly, we have Choi Si-hun.

841
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:44,439
I wonder who he'll choose.

842
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,733
I think he'll choose Su-min.

843
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,402
He was torn until this morning.

844
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,444
Why? Between who?

845
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,154
Ji-a?

846
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,823
I don't know.

847
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,157
He was torn?

848
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,035
I want to know who he'll choose.

849
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,870
-Will he really choose Su-min?
-I know.

850
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,288
He's the most mysterious.

851
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,126
I'm torn between two women now.

852
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,505
Someone who gave me
a strong first impression

853
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,299
and someone I feel
grateful to and comfortable around.

854
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,969
I'm torn between the two.

855
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,765
-Please.
-No way.

856
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,559
-No, don't go there.
-Don't do that.

857
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,185
-No way.
-Seriously?

858
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,270
I'm not sure.

859
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,147
-Wait. This can't be happening.
-Oh, no.

860
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,952
Su-min.

861
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,998
Thank you so much.

862
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,667
He went to Su-min.

863
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,963
Thank you so much.

864
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,599
-What?
-Seriously?

865
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,775
Ji-a?

866
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:12,986
Amazing.

867
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,413
For real?

868
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,803
Nice to see you again.

869
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,638
You came here.

870
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,049
-No.
-I can't believe this.

871
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:21,429
Somehow, I had no idea
that Si-hun would choose Ji-a.

872
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,181
I literally had no idea.

873
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,558
Well, I thought he might,

874
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,767
Really? I thought he'd choose…

875
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,520
but I wasn't sure if he really would.

876
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,897
He decided to follow his heart,
not the situation.

877
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:31,815
Right.

878
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:36,111
After all, you're supposed
to choose the person you're attracted to.

879
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:39,239
-I guess he just followed his heart.
-We can't predict everything.

880
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,033
So all the male participants
have now made their choices.

881
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,578
Now it's the female participants'
turn to make their choices.

882
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,956
If they want to be a couple
with the man who chose them,

883
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,626
they can take the man's hand
and leave Inferno.

884
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,671
If not, they can leave alone.

885
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,977
Whenever it's hot summer,

886
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,440
I'm going to be reminded
of this place, for a long time.

887
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:18,612
And you're the main reason why

888
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:22,574
this is such a good memory for me.

889
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,992
-Really?
-Yes.

890
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,956
I'm sorry I put you through all that.

891
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,250
Thank you, Ji-yeon.

892
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,420
I'm the one who should thank you.

893
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:40,425
You know, so many things
had happened between us.

894
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:45,680
But I'm glad it all worked out in the end.

895
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,309
I realized that

896
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,771
you're such a good person,

897
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:56,483
and I could feel how much you value me.

898
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,652
That's why I think you're really cool.

899
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,796
-I don't have a good feeling about this.
-What?

900
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:18,922
What's with the tension?

901
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,674
-I feel like she won't…
-What?

902
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:35,772
Okay.

903
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,023
Shall we?

904
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:40,944
Shall we?

905
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,489
She held his hand.

906
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,991
She held his hand.

907
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,867
Thank goodness.

908
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,035
-I was so nervous.
-Me too.

909
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,037
-I thought she might leave.
-I was worried she might.

910
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,122
Me too.

911
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,124
She said she was glad it all worked out.

912
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,171
This place is so beautiful.

913
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,507
I think I'm going to miss it.

914
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,093
-This place?
-Yes, I'm going to really miss this place.

915
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,469
-Of course you will.
-Right.

916
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,430
We're leaving this place for good now.

917
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,515
I'm suddenly sad.

918
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,935
We're leaving.

919
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,855
-We managed to escape.
-Right.

920
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,234
I'll miss this place a lot.

921
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,783
-It's already our last day here.
-Right.

922
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:33,079
Thanks to you, my time in Inferno

923
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,457
felt like heaven.

924
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,752
It's been tough here,

925
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:42,297
but you were so nice to us,
and you made us a lot of great food.

926
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,259
Thank you so much for everything.

927
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,145
Bye.

928
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,440
Oh, no. She just left.

929
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,401
-Is she just leaving like that?
-No way.

930
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,739
Bye.

931
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,574
Let's go.

932
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,286
Gosh. That was a real cliffhanger.

933
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,585
Gosh, she scared me.

934
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,837
I thought she was actually leaving.

935
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,466
I didn't know we'd be leaving together.

936
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,134
-Me neither.
-Right?

937
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,512
I wasn't thinking anything
when I walked down here

938
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,805
-on the first day.
-I know.

939
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,140
Does this mean they're dating now?

940
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,809
-Yes, starting today.
-Yes.

941
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,268
They're all starting
to date on the same day.

942
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,146
-They can celebrate it together.
-They should.

943
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,358
You look nervous.

944
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,360
I'm so nervous. What do I do?

945
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:47,654
Why am I so nervous?

946
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,284
-So-yeon.
-Yes?

947
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,371
Since I came to Inferno,

948
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:01,042
I learned to take
the initiative in the relationship.

949
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,545
It's all thanks to you.

950
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:09,467
Now, I want to take you to somewhere

951
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,262
beyond Paradise.

952
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,768
That sounds a bit weird.

953
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,020
"Somewhere beyond Paradise".

954
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,106
I didn't know there was
something beyond Paradise.

955
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,941
Doesn't Paradise have no end?

956
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,821
I'm sorry. It's just…

957
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,072
-It's okay.
-You're just so…

958
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,574
I knew you'd laugh.

959
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:41,374
Thank you so much
for always being there for me

960
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,794
and showing me trust.

961
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,089
I hope we continue to get along.

962
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,591
Okay.

963
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,634
Now, let's go beyond Paradise.

964
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,348
What's beyond Paradise?

965
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,142
Beyond Paradise?

966
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,686
-You're so funny.
-You didn't see that coming, did you?

967
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,898
Did you practice it?

968
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:09,068
I prepared something else actually.
But then I changed my mind.

969
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,361
-Why?
-I don't know.

970
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,615
You were nervous.

971
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,576
You always make me nervous.

972
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,915
Gosh. He never changes.

973
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,875
Jin-taek is such a smooth-talker.

974
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,627
-We need to learn that.
-Seriously, Jin-taek

975
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,795
-We need to learn that.
-should write a book.

976
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,798
-I'm going to use that someday.
-They make such a cute couple.

977
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:11,631
I can be like a puppy.

978
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,135
I'll always keep you safe
and make you laugh

979
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,805
by your side.

980
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,351
Do you want to go out with me?

981
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,693
I've never regretted that I stuck

982
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,361
with only one person to the end

983
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,572
and I won't regret it
in the future either.

984
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,741
If Ji-a is torn between two,

985
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:42,078
that would be Hyun-seung and me.

986
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:56,175
We could've met earlier, but we met here.

987
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,762
And I think there's a reason for that.

988
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:07,437
If I have to choose between love
and friendship, I'd choose love.

989
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,355
Love comes first.

990
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,876
Ji-a.

991
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:35,882
The last time we talked,
I could feel that you felt bad for me.

992
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,217
I could see you were having a hard time.

993
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,970
So I tried to avoid you since.

994
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,722
I tried so hard not to talk to you.

995
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,849
I just didn't want to burden you.

996
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:49,020
But today is our last day here, so…

997
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:57,362
When I was with Ji-a,
I could feel my heart flutter,

998
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:01,449
though she didn't feel the same about me.

999
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,159
We're supposed to choose

1000
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,370
the one person we were most attracted to.

1001
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:17,840
I can't watch this.

1002
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,231
I'm sorry I can't go
to the hospital with you.

1003
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,817
I'm sorry I can't go
to the hospital with you.

1004
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,068
It's okay.

1005
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,985
Take care.

1006
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,120
Take care.

1007
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,044
I agree with you.
There must be a reason why we met here.

1008
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,362
Let's go, puppy.

1009
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,740
Let's go, puppy.

1010
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:25,825
Let's go, puppy.

1011
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:31,873
Can I lift you up?

1012
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,124
-What?
-Can I lift you up?

1013
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,376
No.

1014
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,213
Puppy. My puppy.

1015
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,883
My puppy. My fluffy puppy.

1016
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:44,927
Of course.

1017
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,220
She could've left alone,

1018
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,097
-but she chose Hyeon-joong.
-There must've been

1019
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,641
-a special bond between them.
-There must have been.

1020
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,311
We have four new couples now.
That's quite a lot, right?

1021
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,604
It's a lot.

1022
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:58,107
Unfortunately, some of them
failed to find their matches here,

1023
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,442
but that's only in here.

1024
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,777
-Right.
-Right.

1025
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,779
-They will meet someone else.
-I'm sure they'll find someone.

1026
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:03,780
Right.

1027
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,497
Let's go home together.

1028
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,335
-We're free now.
-Yes.

1029
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,880
-How do you feel?
-Me? I feel great.

1030
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,174
-Happy?
-I can hold your hand as much as I want.

1031
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,051
I've been waiting for this moment.

1032
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,262
-It's hot, isn't it?
-I'm okay.

1033
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:32,141
I'm not letting go of your hand.
I don't mind sweaty hands.

1034
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,271
Gosh, we're finally leaving.

1035
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,941
We escaped the island. I'm so happy.

1036
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,859
We have a bright future ahead of us.

1037
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,695
-Let's not meet outdoors for a while.
-Okay.

1038
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:51,953
Let me carry you.

1039
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,589
Gosh! This feels great!

1040
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:24,211
