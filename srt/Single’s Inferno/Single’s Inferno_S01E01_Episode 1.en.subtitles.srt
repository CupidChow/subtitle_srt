1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,805
Here are two islands.

2
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,353
On these islands, you focus
only on each other's charms

3
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,065
under limited conditions

4
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,651
without knowing
each other's professions or ages.

5
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,243
This is Inferno.

6
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,043
If you manage to escape from Inferno,
you can go to Paradise.

7
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,846
On Paradise, you can have
fantastic dates under the best conditions

8
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,766
and reveal your professions and ages.

9
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,398
Now, attractive single men and women

10
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,317
have arrived at Inferno.

11
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,862
This place is a jungle.

12
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,572
This is like a survival game.

13
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,407
My heart's racing.

14
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,618
I'm not sure if I can fall in love here.

15
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,286
I don't know anything about her.

16
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,871
I want to know everything about you.

17
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,873
Just sleep here.

18
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,417
I can't say, "Don't go."

19
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,419
You're sly.

20
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,005
Time went by so slowly on Inferno.

21
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,548
-Hold my hand.
-Let's go together.

22
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,843
-What was your first impression of me?
-Sexy.

23
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,012
Are you trying to get to know me
or are you pitying me?

24
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,473
Are you feeling bad for me?
I think you're a bit selfish.

25
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,642
Was it intentional?

26
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,560
This place really feels like hell.

27
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,486
Isolated on a deserted island
in the hot summer.

28
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,533
Will they manage to find love

29
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,619
in the midst of an emotional storm?

30
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,623
This is the hottest inferno in the world.

31
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,625
Single's Inferno.

32
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,297
Oh, my goodness.

33
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,510
-It's so exciting.
-I can already feel it's going to be wild

34
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,512
-That was intense.
-from the opening.

35
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,558
The hottest inferno in the world.
Single's Inferno.

36
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,894
Single's Inferno is finally released
as a Netflix series.

37
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,106
We just took a quick peek,
but it seems to be the hottest dating show

38
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,108
we've ever seen in Korea.

39
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,069
-How was the opening?
-Well, their hot bodies…

40
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,320
Right.

41
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,114
It made me feel small.

42
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,198
Right.

43
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,618
And it doesn't feel
like a Korean dating show.

44
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,288
-That's right.
-It's more like a Michigan one.

45
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,082
-Didn't it have a Michigan vibe?
-It does seem foreign.

46
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,458
-It feels like a foreign show.
-It does.

47
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,627
I wonder what's going
to happen on that island.

48
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,545
Right.

49
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,840
-I heard from the film crew
-Yes?

50
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,885
that being stuck on a deserted island

51
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,513
made the participants
very emotional at the end.

52
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,100
I don't know how they managed
to release their emotions though.

53
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,520
If there's nothing much to do
but date on a deserted island,

54
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,231
I'd be very emotional too.

55
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,901
Because there's no way to let off steam.

56
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,944
Right. They don't have friends there.

57
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,446
-Exactly.
-They're all enemies.

58
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:24,412
INFERNO

59
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,504
What's all this?

60
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,718
Hello, my name is Kim Hyeon-joong.

61
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,013
I decided to come on this show
because I'm curious to see

62
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,348
if I could really find the one for me.

63
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,184
A lot of girls flirt with me.

64
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,604
I can see why.

65
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,817
My charms are this dimple
that shows when I smile,

66
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,362
a fit body,

67
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,407
and a really cute butt.

68
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,998
I try to work out
at least two hours a day.

69
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,419
I like to work out,

70
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,796
so I like women who put efforts
into working out.

71
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,757
His face looks so meek,

72
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,842
but his body looks so aggressive.
He's so charming.

73
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,470
-It's an unexpected charm.
-I had no idea he'd be so fit.

74
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,722
INFERNO
34°C

75
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,999
My name is Moon Se-hoon.

76
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,877
I think I'm unpopular
because people think I'm popular.

77
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,297
Really.

78
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,007
I'm very good at household chores.

79
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,634
Doing laundry, washing dishes…

80
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,386
I think many girls

81
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,598
found that very charming.

82
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,683
I love working out.

83
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,645
I run every day, and I love sweating.

84
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,940
I think I ran
around Seokchon Lake almost every day.

85
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,943
I never give up.

86
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,488
When I find someone I like,
I have to date her.

87
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,740
That's the kind of person I am.

88
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,159
Looks like he's someone
who never gives up.

89
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,077
He's a go-getter.

90
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,412
Hello.

91
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,748
Hello.

92
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,212
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

93
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,061
Someone's coming.

94
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,397
It's a woman.

95
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,836
Hello.

96
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,547
Hello.

97
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,425
-Hello.
-Hello.

98
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,135
Hello.

99
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,136
Hello.

100
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,389
You can sit wherever you want.

101
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,141
It's hot, isn't it?

102
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,310
It's really hot.

103
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,353
I'll sit here.

104
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,369
My name is Shin Ji-yeon.

105
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,541
When it comes to dating,
I know what I want.

106
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,462
I easily turn down those
who aren't my type.

107
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,297
When someone is my type?

108
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,215
Well…

109
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,510
I guess I'd try
to be more straightforward.

110
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,640
When I like someone,

111
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,435
I try to respond enthusiastically.

112
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,357
Personality matters a lot to me.

113
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,111
I like people who can influence me
in positive ways.

114
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,323
I think what makes me a charming person

115
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,368
are my positive vibes, empathy,

116
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,578
and my hands.

117
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,290
-Yes.
-My name is Shin Ji-yeon.

118
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,376
-Ji-yeon? I see.
-Yes, Ji-yeon.

119
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,345
Do you need a cushion?

120
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
Oh, thank you.

121
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,022
-Se-hoon, was it?
-Yes, Se-hoon.

122
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,148
-Se-hoon.
-Yes.

123
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,109
-Moon Se-hoon.
-Se-hoon. Okay.

124
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,578
Se-hoon seems to like her a lot.
It looks so obvious.

125
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,254
Someone's coming.

126
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,172
You're right.

127
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,300
Look at the long strides.

128
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,513
Hello, my name is Kim Jun-sik.

129
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,474
I like cat-face types.

130
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,102
I'm attracted to them.

131
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,022
I like cooking.

132
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,274
I often spend time

133
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,152
with my friends and acquaintances
eating food that I prepare.

134
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,614
This is an inferno for singles.

135
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,616
I'll do my best to make it to paradise.

136
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,619
Hello.

137
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,663
Hello.

138
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,081
-Hello.
-Hello.

139
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,166
Hello.

140
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,797
-You can sit wherever you like.
-Sit wherever.

141
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,551
Now, where they sit
is going to be important too.

142
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,219
-You can sit wherever you like.
-Sit wherever.

143
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,263
I'll sit here.

144
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,240
She's wearing black.

145
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,411
She looks really tall.

146
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,956
I can feel her charisma
even from a distance.

147
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,271
Hello.

148
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,818
-Hello.
-Hello.

149
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,569
-Welcome.
-Hello.

150
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,029
Hello.

151
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,412
Hello.

152
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,704
Hello.

153
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,713
It's hot, isn't it?

154
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,596
Hello, I'm Kang So-yeon.

155
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,307
I'm straightforward and I don't lie.

156
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,226
I think I'm an easygoing person.

157
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,728
I'll be honest. I'm quite popular.

158
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,646
Yes.

159
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,773
She's confident.

160
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,278
I like boxing, swimming, playing golf,

161
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,573
tennis, basketball, running,

162
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:25,411
jujitsu, judo, weightlifting,
yoga, and pilates.

163
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,706
I can confidently do most sports.

164
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,293
What men find charming about me?

165
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,337
That I'm sexy? But…

166
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,465
One can be sexy in so many ways.

167
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,925
I'd like to show different sides of myself

168
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,636
one by one, slowly.

169
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,182
-She looks so healthy.
-Right. With her sun-kissed skin and all.

170
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,058
I think many guys will like her.

171
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:48,976
Right.

172
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,072
I can't believe
we're actually on a deserted island.

173
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,746
Is he an idol singer?

174
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,165
He has really fair skin.

175
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,836
My name is Choi Si-hun.

176
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,298
Some people have

177
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,675
pure, innocent, and untainted eyes.

178
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,385
I like women who have those eyes.

179
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,723
I like going to the gym and boxing.

180
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,352
Going to the gym and boxing.
They're my hobbies.

181
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,729
I believe in destiny.

182
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,357
I'd be really happy to find my destiny

183
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,983
on Single's Inferno.

184
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,944
Hello.

185
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,947
Hello.

186
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,073
Hello.

187
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,077
Nice to meet you.

188
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,414
-You can sit wherever you like to sit.
-I'll sit here then.

189
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,041
-Here?
-In the center, yes.

190
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,045
Nice to meet you.

191
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,880
Gosh, he squeezed in between the two.

192
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,969
Nice to meet you.

193
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,184
You look like an idol singer.

194
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,777
Someone's coming.

195
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,321
There she is.

196
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,169
My name is An Yea-won.

197
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:43,632
My charms?
I'm clumsy and playful in a cute way.

198
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,801
And I have a great body.

199
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,182
In summer, I go to beaches to get a tan.

200
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,935
And while I'm at the beach,
I do some jogging.

201
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,229
-They're all…
-People these days

202
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,648
-seem to work out a lot.
-They work out a lot.

203
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,570
I like people who have nice teeth.

204
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,780
I have really nice teeth. Don't you think?

205
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,787
Gosh, it's hot.

206
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,166
-It must've been tough.
-Thank you.

207
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,395
Oh, my gosh.

208
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,754
-Hello.
-Welcome.

209
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,511
-Hello.
-Hello. Welcome.

210
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,305
-Hello. Welcome.
-Hello.

211
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,226
-Hello.
-Hello. Welcome.

212
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,728
-Hello.
-Hello.

213
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,230
You can sit wherever you want.

214
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

215
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,843
-They can't take their eyes off her.
-Their eyes are fixed on her.

216
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,099
My name is Song Ji-a.

217
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,560
Let me describe myself in two words.

218
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,895
Cute and sexy.

219
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,695
I don't play games when I date someone.

220
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,697
I don't want to have any regrets

221
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,032
when I love someone.

222
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,452
I'll be honest.
Physical attraction is what I see first.

223
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,163
Because that's the first thing you see
when you meet a person.

224
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,622
I like tall guys.

225
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,416
I'd like to be held in a tall guy's arms

226
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,917
because I'm rather small.

227
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,129
Personality is important too.
And how much money he has.

228
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,797
Wait. Am I being picky now?

229
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,383
Oh, no.

230
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,971
If there's something I want to do,
I have to do it.

231
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,515
If there's something I want,
I have to have it.

232
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,643
No other girls can beat me.

233
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,187
I'm that confident.

234
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,284
It's not too hot, is it?

235
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,827
It's so hot.

236
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,204
-There aren't many clouds.
-It's crazy.

237
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,914
It's going to get hotter.

238
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,916
-Wait, that's…
-Over there.

239
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,459
Someone's coming. Oh, my.

240
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,713
Isn't that Men in Black?

241
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,971
-Look at him.
-He doesn't seem to be Korean.

242
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,265
-His walk has a Korean American vibe.
-Right.

243
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,024
My name is Oh Jin-taek.

244
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,987
I really want a flaming romance.
That's why I applied for this.

245
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,532
He's cool.

246
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,075
He's really handsome.

247
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,494
He looks a bit like Lee Jin-wook.

248
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,539
I like sexy women with hot bodies.

249
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,957
I'm sexy…

250
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,919
so I want to be with a sexy woman.

251
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:56,468
I'm a bit of a perfectionist.

252
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,846
As you probably know,

253
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,099
facial hair grows at different speeds.

254
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,101
But I try to keep them at the same length.

255
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,900
When it comes to asking someone out,

256
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,152
I have never failed.

257
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,613
Is he an actor? Is he a celebrity?

258
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,198
-I wonder what his profession is.
-Me too.

259
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,616
He could be a model too.

260
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,495
-Welcome.
-Hello.

261
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,496
-Hello.
-Hello.

262
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,789
Hello.

263
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,084
Hello.

264
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,468
-Nice to meet you. Hello.
-Hello.

265
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,850
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

266
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,310
My name is Oh Jin-taek.

267
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,063
-He's telling us his name already.
-Right.

268
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,078
KIM HYEON-JOONG

269
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,663
MOON SE-HOON

270
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,415
SHIN JI-YEON

271
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,958
KIM JUN-SIK

272
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,460
KANG SO-YEON

273
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,920
CHOI SI-HUN

274
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,338
AN YEA-WON

275
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,048
SONG JI-A

276
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,507
OH JIN-TAEK

277
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,060
All nine participants
have gathered together.

278
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,813
Honestly, just watching them
makes me feel good.

279
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,942
They're all so gorgeous and good-looking.

280
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,610
-They feast my eyes.
-Right.

281
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,279
-They're all charming in their own ways.
-RIght?

282
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,365
It'll be all about their personal tastes.

283
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,867
By the way, the last participant

284
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,119
gave a very strong first impression.

285
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,162
Oh Jin-taek, you mean.

286
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,415
If I walked past him on the street,
I'd turn around to check him out.

287
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,627
And there aren't
many hairy participants on dating shows.

288
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,295
Right. He…

289
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,546
He had charisma.

290
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,091
Personally, I liked Hyeon-joong.
The first person.

291
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,511
-I see.
-I also think that out of the guys,

292
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,181
-Hyeon-joong is the most attractive.
-I agree.

293
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:11,395
-Really?
-He has such a pretty face

294
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,647
and an unexpectedly fit body.

295
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,525
-He looks very attractive when he smiles.
-His dimples.

296
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,069
Right. Some people have dimples
when they smile,

297
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,445
and I find that attractive.

298
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,781
I have a feeling

299
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,827
that many male participants
will go after Ji-a.

300
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,869
She…

301
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,956
-She looks cold on the outside,
-Right.

302
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,002
but I feel like she'll be friendly
once you get to know her.

303
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,422
As a woman, I personally find
So-yeon attractive.

304
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,590
-Right, So-yeon.
-She's very attractive.

305
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,551
I feel like she's the kind of type

306
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,304
who can look really charming in the wild.

307
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,265
But I think men would be more attracted
to someone like Ji-yeon,

308
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,767
-the first female participant.
-Ji-yeon.

309
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,185
-Right.
-She has pale skin

310
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,854
-and she's skinny.
-Really pale.

311
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,647
Right.

312
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,816
I think many men would like
someone like her.

313
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:58,859
Can I take back what I said?

314
00:21:58,942 --> 00:21:59,943
Sure.

315
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,028
I think it's Ji-yeon.

316
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:05,782
All the male participants
are sitting around Ji-yeon.

317
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,367
-Is that so?
-Oh, really?

318
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,828
-Maybe she's just sitting in the center.
-Right.

319
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,415
They said, "Is it too hot? Can you
stand the heat until everyone comes out?"

320
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,666
It's really hot.

321
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,670
Hello, singles.

322
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,506
Welcome to the hottest inferno
in the world,

323
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,842
Single's Inferno.

324
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,223
I'm the Master of Single's Inferno,
and I'll be helping you find love.

325
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:38,231
You will spend
the next nine days here on Inferno.

326
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,025
RULES DURING THE 9 DAYS ON INFERNO

327
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,863
Inferno is isolated from the world.
You will not be able to use your devices.

328
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:49,367
For food, you must cook for yourselves
with the ingredients provided.

329
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,792
Also, you cannot reveal
your professions and ages.

330
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,338
Use only your natural charms

331
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:05,342
and actively win over each others' hearts
to become a couple.

332
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:11,807
Those who become a couple can escape
from Inferno and go to Paradise together.

333
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,809
COUPLES GO TO PARADISE TOGETHER

334
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:19,689
Luxurious suites are waiting in Paradise…

335
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,110
A DATE IN A LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE

336
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:27,447
…where you can ask your partner
whatever you want.

337
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:36,206
Couples must come back to Inferno
after one day in Paradise.

338
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,208
COUPLES MUST RETURN
TO INFERNO THE NEXT DAY

339
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,296
Couple matching sessions
for Paradise will begin tomorrow.

340
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,925
I hope you can all become couples
and escape from Inferno.

341
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,469
-Escape?
-Escape.

342
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,182
The map of the island is on the table.

343
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:58,103
I want you to now split
into three teams of three

344
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,647
and start discovering the island.

345
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,777
So we group up in threes.

346
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,445
They want us to explore the place.

347
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,656
OH JIN-TAEK, KANG SO-YEON, KIM HYEON-JOONG

348
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,867
-I guess that's where we vote.
-That's the voting place.

349
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,577
And…

350
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,537
Why is there a snowflake?

351
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,913
Maybe it means it's cold.

352
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,054
The cafeteria.

353
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,600
Are we supposed to cook here?

354
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,728
-There's even a cauldron.
-A cauldron?

355
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,563
But this is a deserted island.

356
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,900
-We have all the ingredients here.
-This is so cool.

357
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,569
But there's no food.

358
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,404
Yes, there is. Here's some food.

359
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,906
Right. I see cabbages.

360
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,032
There's no protein.

361
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,451
There's no fridge here.

362
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,995
Food is the hardest part.

363
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,247
It almost feels like a survival game.

364
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,750
-Oh, there's water.
-That's water.

365
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,168
Wait. Is that it?

366
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,003
Maybe we should fill these ourselves.

367
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,505
Maybe we should draw water.

368
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,258
Isn't this a water bucket?

369
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,301
Hang on.

370
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,929
-This is a bit…
-I don't have a good feeling about this.

371
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:19,309
The conditions were poorer
than I imagined.

372
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,479
We had to keep drawing water
to stay hydrated.

373
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,397
We were really thirsty.

374
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,983
-I'm thirsty. What about you?
-I'm really thirsty.

375
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,195
-Do you want to go see where the water is?
-Yes.

376
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,739
Is it over there?

377
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,618
How long do we have to walk?

378
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,163
Looks like the water source
is really far from here.

379
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,874
I think this place is teaching me
I should appreciate water.

380
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,881
We have to come all the way here?

381
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,466
Every time? Seriously?

382
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,802
-Seriously?
-We have to come all the way here?

383
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,888
Oh, this is water.

384
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:57,806
That's water.

385
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,099
It's water.

386
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,725
We have to come here for water.

387
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,936
We have to be self-sufficient here.

388
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,355
Well, it's summer.

389
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,357
It's so hot and sunny here.

390
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,361
I'm not sure if I can fall in love
while surviving here for nine days.

391
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,698
It's so far away.

392
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,825
What could possibly be there?

393
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,411
-It's a snowflake.
-There's a snowflake on the map.

394
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,537
Snowflake?

395
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,414
ICE CAFÉ

396
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,207
What's this?

397
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,044
Because it takes time to get here.

398
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,254
-Oh, it's iced water.
-Iced water.

399
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,964
-Do you want some?
-What? Yes, I'd love some.

400
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,092
Looks like this is where we can get ice.

401
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,218
There's ice inside.

402
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,887
-The bugs…
-I wish there weren't any bugs here.

403
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,224
-Bugs are what worries me the most here.
-Weren't there restrooms

404
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,392
-over here?
-Right.

405
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,020
-There are holes on the floor.
-Right.

406
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,021
-It's here.
-I see.

407
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,023
You can see everything inside.

408
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,108
How am I supposed to use this restroom?

409
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,444
There were way more bugs than I thought.

410
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,405
The condition of the showers
and the restrooms was so poor.

411
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,866
And there wasn't much food either.
I was taken aback.

412
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,619
INFERNO
35°C

413
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,666
-Oh, boy.
-Hello.

414
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,751
Hi.

415
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,795
How was it?

416
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,924
Looks like we're getting only
one bucket of water a day. Am I right?

417
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,634
-I think so.
-Are we?

418
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,138
This will make us eager to go to Paradise.

419
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,431
Right.

420
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,058
I hope there are no bugs at night.

421
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,017
Seriously.

422
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,352
The restroom is the worst.

423
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,812
-I don't think I can use it.
-Right. Me neither.

424
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,357
So I decided not to drink so much water.

425
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,443
-We're supposed to go draw water too.
-I know.

426
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:37,405
I think we should
take turns getting the water.

427
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,617
This is literally hell.

428
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,243
Everything's so tough here.

429
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,162
How was the tour?

430
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,458
-Who were you with?
-Si-hun. The one who looks

431
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,043
-like an idol.
-Oh, the idol one.

432
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,711
Right. We met.

433
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,505
Doesn't he look like Lee Jong-suk?

434
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,006
-Oh. You're right.
-He does.

435
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,174
I can see that.

436
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,759
Yes. A bit.

437
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,014
-We talked a lot.
-Did you have fun?

438
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,059
-They both seem really nice.
-Really?

439
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,854
-I think the tallest one
-Who's the tallest?

440
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,314
is Hyeon-joong. Next to me.

441
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,150
-The one in white?
-The one in a pink shirt.

442
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,027
-He's the tallest?
-He's the tallest?

443
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:20,198
Yes, he's the tallest. And the other guy
was the one with the beard.

444
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,368
I remember him.
He gave such a strong first impression.

445
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,079
It looked like a movie
when you walked down the hill.

446
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,957
-Because of your clothes.
-Really?

447
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,709
-From a distance?
-Your clothes matched so well.

448
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,962
What do you think he does?

449
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,672
I feel like he's a business owner.

450
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,257
He looks like one, doesn't he?

451
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,675
I'd be so happy if I was right.

452
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,218
I have no idea.

453
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,761
I can't even guess his age.

454
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,263
-I have no idea.
-No clue.

455
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,725
Do women usually gossip
about men like that?

456
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,851
-Yes.
-They do.

457
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:51,688
They were talking about the restroom
and then suddenly turned to the men.

458
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,607
As for the first impression…
They all seemed different.

459
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,568
-They're all so different.
-All four of them.

460
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,987
-Completely different.
-I liked Ji-yeon.

461
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,448
Her skin is so pale.

462
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,241
Right.

463
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,536
As I saw her walking in,
I was like, "Gosh."

464
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:13,543
She seemed so white and pure.
That's my first impression of her.

465
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,878
Her skin is so fair.

466
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,839
And I like that tone.

467
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:19,966
Then…

468
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,468
-Pale…
-We like the same woman.

469
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,595
We like the same woman.

470
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,221
This is only our first day here.

471
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,224
-We don't know yet.
-You're right.

472
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,642
Next to her was Ji-a.

473
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,228
She was so fabulous.

474
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,106
-Wearing silver wedge heels.
-I didn't get to see any of that.

475
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,233
She was the shiniest.

476
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:42,280
I'm not sure if I'll even get
to talk to her before this is over.

477
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,865
-Why?
-Well…

478
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,451
she didn't seem very approachable.

479
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,245
She looks so different
when she doesn't smile.

480
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,872
That's why I can't approach her.

481
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,500
When there's no expression on her face,

482
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,919
I have no idea what she's thinking.
Or how she's feeling.

483
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,712
I get what you mean.

484
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:06,262
The one who gave me
the best first impression was Ji-yeon.

485
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,765
Her smile was beautiful.

486
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,851
-Do you need a cushion?
-Thank you.

487
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:18,233
The one who was closest
to my ideal type was Ji-yeon.

488
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,945
Her shy smile was so cute.

489
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,114
The one who gave me
the best first impression

490
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:29,118
was Si-hun who walked together with me.

491
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,915
When we walked around the island together,
he was really nice to me.

492
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,000
-Are your shoes comfortable?
-Yes, they are.

493
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,838
-Are you tired? Are you okay?
-I think I'm a bit thirsty.

494
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,797
I'm thirsty too.

495
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,257
They liked each other.

496
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,217
Si-hun is quite aggressive.

497
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,385
Right.

498
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,136
And they look good together.

499
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,096
Yes.

500
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,266
-They're both slim.
-They're both pale too.

501
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,350
-"Pale"?
-Right.

502
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,562
Yea-won and Ji-a

503
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,022
are very close to my ideal type.

504
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,693
I love women who use dialects.

505
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,404
I find it very attractive.

506
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,738
Hello.

507
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:10,827
Jin-taek is the one
who drew my attention the most.

508
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,623
When he showed up with the sunglasses on,

509
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,167
I felt his charisma.

510
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,588
So-yeon, the one sitting next to me
caught my eyes first.

511
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,133
And I think we had
a pretty good conversation.

512
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:30,388
Jin-taek was very responsive
to everything I said.

513
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,848
What's your favorite drink?

514
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,266
I like whiskey.

515
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,309
Whiskey.

516
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,729
It'll be pretty at night
with all the lights on.

517
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,148
It'll look really nice.

518
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,566
All right.

519
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,276
-They look good together.
-They do.

520
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,487
Ji-a is a glamorous type,

521
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,198
which is close to my type.

522
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,327
On the other hand,
Ji-yeon is a pure and pretty type.

523
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,496
I think they're both attractive
but in opposite ways.

524
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,625
None of them is my ideal type.

525
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,920
SONG JI-A

526
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,463
-Goodness.
-Oh, no.

527
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,008
I think it's too early to talk about it.

528
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:11,220
I'd like to get to know them

529
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,348
while having dinner together.

530
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,224
-She's really charming.
-She's charming.

531
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,769
It's not easy
to say that on the first day.

532
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,853
-I agree.
-Right.

533
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,605
-She seems to be very honest.
-Right.

534
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:27,904
CAFETERIA

535
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,207
-We're going to lose some muscles here.
-Right.

536
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,167
-I mean…
-It's all raw.

537
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,418
I see only greens here.

538
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,379
The cauldron is…

539
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,255
We have amazing ingredients today.

540
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,595
It feels so far away.

541
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,554
Tell me about it.

542
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,639
It's so far away.

543
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,726
It's only the first day.
How many times have they changed?

544
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,604
Looks like they brought a lot of clothes.

545
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,319
-What's our main dish?
-Those are the ingredients we have.

546
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,532
We have cabbages and some vegetables.

547
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,326
We have garlic, onions,
and chili peppers too.

548
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,661
Let's divide the work.

549
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,664
Some of us can cook,
some of us can go get water,

550
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,417
-and some of us will clean up…
-Water?

551
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,876
-Shall we begin?
-Let's begin.

552
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,253
Just tell me what to do.

553
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,005
-Tell me what to do.
-Me too.

554
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,883
Are these spring onions enough?

555
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,220
So our main dish is ssambap.
What else are we making?

556
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,723
Stir-fried spring onion kimchi.

557
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,100
How about we make doenjang soup with this?

558
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,476
Can we make doenjang soup?

559
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,647
We can just make some broth with doenjang
and cook the cabbages and onions with it.

560
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,690
Let's try it.

561
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,817
Okay. Finish this up first.

562
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,569
I'll cook the soup when you're done.

563
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,195
I find that really charming.

564
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,657
-They don't have any recipes.
-He's charming.

565
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,160
-He seems familiar with cooking.
-I think Se-hoon is cute.

566
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,495
-Would this be enough? Two?
-Do you…

567
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,831
Do you want an apron?

568
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,750
You're going to ruin your white shirt.

569
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,627
An apron? Okay.

570
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,587
Just put it on.

571
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,506
It's hot.

572
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,883
I think this will be okay.

573
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,634
There.

574
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,219
-Does it look all right?
-Yes.

575
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,637
Nice.

576
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,806
Let me see.

577
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,724
The collar.

578
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,936
-There.
-Good.

579
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,991
So we need to cook rice with these. Gosh.

580
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,910
We need to adjust the heat to cook rice.

581
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,829
Have you made a fire before?

582
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,206
No, of course not.

583
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,541
Let me try.

584
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:49,295
-Do you know how to do it?
-I haven't done it before, but…

585
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,215
-I can do it.
-You can do it.

586
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,216
Don't worry.

587
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,260
-Are you sure I don't need to worry?
-Yes. Don't worry.

588
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,598
We need to make a fire first,
so you can rest for now.

589
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,975
-There's nothing to do right now.
-I can hold it.

590
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,936
I can wash the rice.

591
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:05,937
Rice?

592
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,689
-It'll take a long time to cook rice.
-Oh, we have a torch too.

593
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,691
You're right.
Could you go wash the rice then?

594
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,450
I need to wash the rice.

595
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,080
-What are you doing?
-Washing the rice.

596
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:24,997
Okay.

597
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,667
Do you know how much rice is one serving?

598
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,712
How much rice is one serving?

599
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,176
-Usually…
-Isn't one cup of rice about two servings?

600
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,887
How many people are we? One, two, three…

601
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,681
-One cup of rice for two?
-I think so.

602
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,308
-There are nine of us.
-One cup should be two to three servings.

603
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,393
An apron?

604
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,395
Ten cups should be enough.

605
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,438
-Are you from Busan?
-That's too much.

606
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,731
-Pardon?
-Are you from Busan?

607
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,400
I'm from Gyeongsang Province,

608
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,943
-but not from Busan.
-That's too much.

609
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,529
-I see.
-Is the rice in there?

610
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,865
Hyeon-joong made his point clear.

611
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,825
There are many conversations
at the same time.

612
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,368
-Right.
-Yes.

613
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,620
-I see.
-Is the rice in there?

614
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,710
How can I help?

615
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,010
Go ahead.

616
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,136
Okay.

617
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,347
We have to wait for now.

618
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,982
Hyeon-joong is…

619
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,151
He's staying with Ji-a.

620
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,277
Yes.

621
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,543
-Is this a drama or what?
-I think I'm falling for Hyeon-joong.

622
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,629
He's getting more and more charming.

623
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,672
-He doesn't talk much.
-Right.

624
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,758
-He just quietly looks at her.
-He's quiet.

625
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,134
That's my type.

626
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:04,555
He seems to be watching her
because he wants to help her

627
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,765
if she makes a mistake.

628
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,225
And that's so sweet.

629
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:11,103
Plus, his eyes look so sad there.

630
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:12,980
He looks sad.

631
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,607
-Why, though?
-I don't know.

632
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,150
There's nothing to be sad about.

633
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,684
I wonder how the rice will turn out.

634
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,853
It'll be all right.

635
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,023
-You think?
-Yes. I'm 100 percent sure.

636
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,446
My eyes are burning.

637
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,157
-Gosh, it's hot!
-Oh, no.

638
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,075
-Be careful.
-Oh, no.

639
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,326
Be careful.

640
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,786
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

641
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,954
You should wear gloves.

642
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,414
Did you drop it somewhere?

643
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,040
No. The steam is really hot.

644
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,542
-It's really hot.
-Oh, no.

645
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,336
-Be careful.
-You should be careful.

646
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,337
Are you okay?

647
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,505
Yes.

648
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,429
Did you burn your hand?

649
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,388
I got burned.

650
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,765
-It's so red.
-Oh, no.

651
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,353
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

652
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,063
But it's so red.

653
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,398
I know. It hurts so much.

654
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,649
You need cold water.

655
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,486
-I'm okay.
-Really?

656
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,992
-Don't do it.
-What?

657
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,036
-Don't do it.
-I should get some ointment.

658
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:50,995
You should rest.

659
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,123
Si-hun seems to have a cute side.

660
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:58,252
Anyhow, Si-hun and Ji-a
keep crossing paths.

661
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,670
For whatever reason.

662
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,633
Could you get me some water
from the bucket?

663
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,053
Right, water. How much water do you need?

664
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,221
Not much. Just a little.

665
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,139
This bucket?

666
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,726
Is this enough?

667
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,520
You told me to get just a little, so…

668
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,189
-It should be enough.
-What's that?

669
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,690
We can mix doenjang with water.

670
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,941
Do we have gochujang too?

671
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:21,901
Yes, we do.

672
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,611
A bit of gochujang makes
doenjang soup better.

673
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,779
-Sounds good.
-Right. Then…

674
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,823
Then let's add a bit of gochujang here.

675
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,408
-Just a bit. Okay.
-Yes.

676
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,328
Oh, my.

677
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,330
Se-hoon seems familiar with cooking.

678
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,665
-I know, right?
-But I think Se-hoon might be

679
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,918
-Oh, no.
-focusing too much on cooking now.

680
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,545
I think that can seem more charming.

681
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,716
-You have some good cutting skills.
-Oh, my.

682
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,637
Go, go, go.

683
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,763
We should hurry.

684
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,681
He's so trustworthy.

685
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,939
It's taking forever.

686
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,483
-Well, it's…
-Yes?

687
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,736
I think it's ready now.
You just need to add water to it.

688
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,238
-Is that so?
-Yes.

689
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,531
-It has a nice color.
-Are we making gochujang soup?

690
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,740
No, it's doenjang soup.

691
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,450
-Really?
-It's doenjang soup.

692
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,119
Let me give you a little tip.

693
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:17,123
With this, you can mix it with water
much more easily.

694
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,124
Like this?

695
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,500
I see.

696
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,252
-Did you put in enough doenjang?
-We did.

697
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,337
-A lot?
-We almost emptied one whole jar.

698
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,298
Why do I feel like
we're not doing it right?

699
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,050
I feel like we're missing something.

700
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,511
-I can eat with this. It's okay.
-Oh, really?

701
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,555
-Should we take some of this out?
-Sure.

702
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,477
Is that a spoon?

703
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,230
I thought we should wash it
while we have water.

704
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,778
-Are you washing the dishes?
-Yes.

705
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,451
-I shouldn't use too much.
-I'll do it.

706
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,286
-No, I'm good at it.
-It's okay. I'll do it.

707
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,997
What did the other person use?

708
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,248
I'll make it quick.

709
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,209
-Should I pass you the dishes?
-Yes.

710
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,214
He's really fast.

711
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,592
-We should wash them while we have water.
-Right.

712
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,261
We've perfectly adapted to this place.

713
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,345
Sorry?

714
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,849
When you like someone,
even their clumsiness is cute.

715
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,058
Everything seems lovely.

716
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,895
I'm starting to like Se-hoon.

717
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,313
-Are you?
-Yes.

718
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,441
-The rice is done.
-It is.

719
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,817
Right?

720
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,110
It looks good.

721
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,612
It looks pretty nice.

722
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,741
-My gosh.
-Awesome.

723
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,124
Gosh, this is wild.
It's like a survival game.

724
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,626
-What?
-Kitchen towels?

725
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,252
-It's in the back.
-In the back?

726
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,587
No.

727
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,589
-Do you need some help?
-Yes.

728
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,929
-He's good.
-Nice.

729
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,224
-He's good.
-Seriously. He's really good.

730
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,393
He's so cool.

731
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,978
-He's good.
-Nice.

732
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,442
The three men in the back are so funny.

733
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,573
I can totally understand.
They don't want to mess up.

734
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,075
If they don't know how…

735
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,619
Se-hoon must have earned a lot of points.

736
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,578
Seriously.

737
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,829
I'll go get some water.

738
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,249
Let's go, Jin-taek.

739
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,291
Okay.

740
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,252
Finally.

741
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,005
Will you guys be okay?

742
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,715
-Well…
-Do you want me to come?

743
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,842
-You're more than welcome.
-Come with us.

744
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,388
-We'll be back.
-We'll be back.

745
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,394
The weather is so nice.

746
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,311
It is.

747
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,648
Did you women get to talk?

748
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,483
We talked about our ideal types.

749
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,859
-Pardon?
-Our ideal types.

750
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,611
-I see.
-What's your ideal type like?

751
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,321
I like men who are older than me.

752
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,698
Is that so?

753
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:59,118
Someone I can rely on.

754
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:03,330
Someone who can be
my boyfriend, dad, and friend.

755
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,457
-Boyfriend and dad?
-Someone to rely on.

756
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,875
Yes. Someone I can rely on.

757
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:12,047
I can't tell you who it is,
but one of the male participants

758
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,091
said you seemed hard to approach.

759
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,551
-Really?
-Yes.

760
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,137
I can seem so at first.

761
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,472
I didn't really dress up that much.

762
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,891
I thought I looked innocent.

763
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,520
In fact, I haven't dressed
so feminine in my life.

764
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,480
But apparently I failed.

765
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,734
You did fail.

766
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,403
Ji-a is actually very different
from her first impression.

767
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,113
-Right.
-I agree.

768
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:38,616
Good.

769
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,868
-Are your shoulders okay? Can I let go?
-Sure.

770
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,454
-Can you lift them?
-Try standing up.

771
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,255
You're good.

772
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,174
-It's like punishment.
-You got this.

773
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,759
-It suits you.
-It really does.

774
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,595
-Liars.
-I mean it.

775
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,222
Your veins are popping out.

776
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,391
They might actually pop.

777
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,186
But really, look. They're popping out.

778
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,812
He's right.

779
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:09,855
Goodness.

780
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:10,856
It's amazing.

781
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,610
That's Jun-sik.

782
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,198
What do you like to cook at home?

783
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,824
I like to cook unusual dishes.

784
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,535
-For example?
-Dishes like salmon steak or porchetta.

785
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,120
What?

786
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,497
Are you a chef?

787
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,915
Then…

788
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,167
This should be easy for you.

789
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,712
It looks so good.
I can't believe we made this.

790
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,924
Thanks to the doenjang
and gochujang mix you made.

791
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,051
-I guess
-It's all thanks to you.

792
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,219
I made myself useful.

793
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,512
You did most of it.

794
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,724
Looks like we managed
to make something edible.

795
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,309
We have soup and rice.

796
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,019
-I know.
-I'm impressed.

797
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,771
-I see them.
-Right?

798
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,356
They came back.

799
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,774
We can eat now.

800
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:54,733
Finally.

801
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,985
He looks so tired.

802
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,155
Thank you so much.

803
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,074
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

804
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,117
Well done, guys.

805
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,785
Thanks. Are you okay?

806
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,702
Yes, I'm okay.

807
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,000
Shall we begin?

808
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,168
Shall we?

809
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,545
-Let's dig in.
-Let's eat.

810
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,879
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

811
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,466
I feel like I'll be the first one
to wake up tomorrow.

812
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,844
-I wake up without an alarm.
-Could you wake me up?

813
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,849
It's tasty.

814
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,560
The fried rice tastes amazing.

815
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,978
Really? Nice.

816
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,479
The doenjang soup is good too.

817
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:41,613
-I'm happy. We made this out of nothing.
-You find joy in these things.

818
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,991
This is simple happiness.

819
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,997
It's so nice to have dinner
along with the sound of the waves.

820
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,206
I know. It's almost surreal.

821
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,001
We usually watch YouTube
or listen to music.

822
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,170
The sound of nature instead of music.

823
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,633
Se-hoon seems to be
really enjoying the food.

824
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,469
I like men who love food.

825
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,474
He's here to survive.

826
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,184
Who?

827
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,602
I'm done.

828
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,188
-Oh, my.
-I'm good.

829
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,148
The fried rice is really good.

830
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,816
-Really?
-The best fried rice ever.

831
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,902
I'm glad you like it.

832
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:20,861
It's really good.

833
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,029
-It is.
-I like it too.

834
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,322
It's really tasty.

835
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,953
-Is there something in there?
-Yes.

836
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,667
Can I eat this?

837
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,212
Sure. Help yourself.

838
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,379
Would you like some water?

839
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,006
I'm so thirsty.

840
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,216
Let's have some.

841
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,561
Do we have more water?

842
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,647
We have a lot. Do you want some more?

843
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,898
Here. You can have this.

844
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,678
That's a beautiful sunset.

845
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:31,098
But I bet they can't be at peace
even for a single second there.

846
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,015
Right.

847
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,936
They need to flirt with each other
in front of all the cameras.

848
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,021
It's probably uncomfortable
within their groups too.

849
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,481
-It's their first day,
-Yes?

850
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,734
-so they need to be vague to everyone.
-Right.

851
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,861
And I think they dropped a lot of hints.

852
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,572
They'll probably all snore at night.

853
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,325
-They'll almost pass out.
-Yes. They must be really tired.

854
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,042
I think I'm going to lose weight here.

855
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,462
Does this mean we can't
have caffeine starting tomorrow? Coffee?

856
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,590
I really want to have some coffee.

857
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,800
I need coffee.
I can't stay awake otherwise.

858
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,554
This place makes me appreciate everything.

859
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,597
It really does.

860
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,224
I can't believe
the first day is already over.

861
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,852
Gosh, I'm hungry.

862
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,062
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

863
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,397
Did you not eat much?

864
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,608
I just didn't feel like eating.

865
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,527
Because she was sitting across from you?

866
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,489
Ji-a?

867
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,617
Ji-a?

868
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,000
I'll have to talk to her
to know if I like her,

869
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,253
but I barely got to talk to her today.

870
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,131
I don't know.

871
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,593
What's that? Again?

872
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,097
Now, you will choose a person you like

873
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,225
and convey your feelings for them.

874
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:58,644
Really?

875
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,937
-I didn't think we'd have to do it today.
-Same.

876
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,314
I'm suddenly nervous.

877
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,607
-Me too.
-I'm nervous.

878
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,858
I'm so nervous.

879
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:07,361
You'll see postcards in your rooms.

880
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:11,073
Write down how you feel
about the person you like on a postcard.

881
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:18,246
Then put it in that person's postbox.

882
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:23,126
Please decide now.

883
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,383
You know what?

884
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,636
If I were one of them
and didn't get any postcards,

885
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,971
the next eight days would be too hard.

886
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,223
Me too.

887
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,892
-Some might get multiple postcards.
-Right.

888
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:42,688
How about we guess
who gets the most postcards?

889
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:43,647
-Okay.
-Sure.

890
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,940
I have my guess already.

891
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:47,818
-Who?
-Among female participants, Ji-a.

892
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,778
-Ji-a.
-Yes, she'll get the most.

893
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,987
Among male participants?

894
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,531
-Se-hoon.
-Se-hoon.

895
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,826
Because Ji-a showed a side
that no one expected.

896
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:56,743
Right.

897
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,870
At first, she looked so haughty and cold,

898
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:02,374
but she's actually quite lively.
She's also talkative and hard-working.

899
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,084
She worked a lot.

900
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,001
Right.

901
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,588
While watching the video clip,
I came to think Ji-a is very diligent.

902
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,549
Because she's everywhere?

903
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,593
Seriously, she always seems
to be working hard.

904
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,678
Right.

905
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,347
Whatever she does,

906
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,309
she observes the situations attentively.

907
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,145
She joined the guys getting water.

908
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,271
Right.

909
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,523
My guesses are the same as Kyuhyun's.

910
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,358
I think the most popular ones will be Ji-a

911
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,609
-Really?
-and Se-hoon.

912
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,237
Jin-kyung, you said earlier

913
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:37,159
that Se-hoon was focusing
too much on cooking.

914
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,869
But I don't think that's a problem.

915
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,829
There's no one as considerate as Se-hoon.

916
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:41,830
-I see.
-I agree.

917
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,833
As you saw, he was the one
who controlled the whole kitchen.

918
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,377
But he gave credit to others.

919
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,714
Thanks to the doenjang
and gochujang mix you made.

920
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:51,965
I guess

921
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,592
-It's all thanks to you.
-I made myself useful.

922
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,010
You did most of it.

923
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,680
The fried rice is really good.

924
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,390
-Really?
-The best fried rice ever.

925
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,267
I'm glad you like it.

926
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,810
-It's really good.
-It is.

927
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,145
-I like it too.
-Really.

928
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,857
He may not seem so,
but he makes a lot of thoughtful comments.

929
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,650
I'm not sure.

930
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,819
I think he's more of a practical type.

931
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,447
I think he knows
how to turn on the charm cleverly.

932
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,573
Right.

933
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,867
I also think Se-hoon will get
the most postcards.

934
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,203
-Se-hoon?
-All three of you picked him.

935
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,204
Yes.

936
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,248
You seem surprised, Jin-kyung.

937
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,792
Do you have a different opinion?

938
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,377
I think the male participants

939
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:33,840
think that Si-hun is interested in Ji-a.

940
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:34,800
-Right.
-Okay.

941
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,302
So I feel like they'll avoid her.

942
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,137
-Hyeon-joong?
-You mean, the guys will?

943
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,722
-Yes.
-I see.

944
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,308
I feel like most of them
will choose Ji-yeon.

945
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:46,102
If Ji-a is a fancy flower,

946
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,481
Ji-yeon is more like a wild flower.

947
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,149
-She's so pure.
-Right.

948
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,943
And among the male participants…

949
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,987
I think Jin-taek will get
the most postcards.

950
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,990
-Jin-taek? That's random.
-Yes. Jin-taek.

951
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,326
This is not about your personal taste.

952
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,954
We're talking about
who they would write to.

953
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,705
Well, it's just my guess.

954
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,083
-Let's see how it goes.
-It's not about your taste.

955
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,709
It's not my taste. It's my guess.

956
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,710
Okay.

957
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:14,548
MEN'S MAILBOXES

958
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,799
They must be so nervous.

959
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,259
Jin-taek is the first.

960
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,510
OH JIN-TAEK

961
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:23,765
He's so cool.

962
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,187
Are the male participants
all different from each other too?

963
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,605
I think they're all similar.

964
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:31,857
-I agree.
-Really?

965
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,485
-Except one.
-Right. Except one.

966
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,820
Jin-taek?

967
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:37,988
Because of this. Right?

968
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,532
That and his vibe.

969
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,700
His vibe.

970
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,995
I wonder how many postcards he'll get.

971
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:56,089
-He's Jin-kyung's pick.
-I don't think he got any.

972
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,013
-Nothing?
-He got nothing?

973
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:04,639
It seemed empty.

974
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,057
Oh, my gosh. Not even one?

975
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,225
Not even one.

976
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,602
-He got zero.
-Oh, no.

977
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,228
He seemed bitter.

978
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,772
This probably has never
happened in his life.

979
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,773
Right.

980
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,068
This can't be right.
I'm usually very intuitive.

981
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,155
Goodness. Poor him.

982
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,532
-How was it? Did you get anything?
-What?

983
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,909
Did you get anything?

984
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:25,911
Well…

985
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,379
Man, this is so mean.

986
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,466
I should try harder tomorrow.

987
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,468
OH JIN-TAEK

988
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,178
That's what I thought.

989
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:47,557
Right. Jin-taek was
only watching others today.

990
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,809
I think this will be okay.

991
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,936
There.

992
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,938
-Does it look all right?
-Yes.

993
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,608
He's so cool.

994
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,151
-He's good.
-Nice.

995
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,116
CHOI SI-HUN

996
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,201
It's Si-hun's turn.

997
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,285
Si-hun.

998
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,135
-There's something.
-There is.

999
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,929
-There's one in there.
-He got one.

1000
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,436
"It was nice to meet you today."

1001
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,443
-He seems really happy.
-He's happy.

1002
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,444
CHOI SI-HUN: 1 POSTCARD

1003
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,363
I think I know who wrote to him.

1004
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:44,823
KIM JUN-SIK

1005
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:46,533
I wonder who wrote to Jun-sik.

1006
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,339
Oh, there's one.

1007
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,093
-He got one.
-Thank goodness. He got one.

1008
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,646
-"I like that you care about others"?
-"I like your tan."

1009

MOON SE-HOON

1011
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,199
It's Se-hoon.

1012
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,744
He was one of the most
impressive ones today.

1013
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,120
I can't wait to see.

1014
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,121
Two?

1015
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:36,875
One.

1016
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,384
"I saw you work hard
and enjoy the food today."

1017
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,136
"I find that warm side of you charming."

1018
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,305
I feel like that's So-yeon.

1019
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,684
His hard work paid off.

00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,230
Well, this means…

1023
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,482
-He got one.
-He did.

1024
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,399
Because Jin-taek got none.

1025
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,068
-Only Jin-taek.
-Oh, no.

1026
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,413
OPPA?

1027
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,414
-"Oppa?"
-"Oppa?"

1028
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,415
-Wait.
-Wait.

1029
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,459
-It's Ji-a!
-It's Ji-a!

00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,556
That was a really clever one.

1032
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,266
-It's amazing.
-Seriously.

1033
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,311
She knows how to make
a man's heart flutter.

1034
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,854
-I'm getting goosebumps.
-She knows.

1035
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,440
-And she wrote only two words.
-"Oppa."

1036
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,817
"Oppa." My gosh.

1037
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,943
My gosh. Seriously.

KANG SO-YEON, SONG JI-A,

00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,578
-I'm going now.
-Am I next?

1041
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,997
-Put on a poker face when you come back.
-How?

1042
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,040
Just smile.

1043
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,458
Yes. Smile.

1044
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,127
-A smile would be the best.
-I can't.

1045
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,419
What if I cry?

1046
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,505
-I really might.
-I'll be all teary-eyed.

My goodness.

1050
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,098
I probably didn't get any.

1051
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,769
Wait. What?

1052
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,314
What?

1053
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,943
-She got one.
-Did she get more than one?

1054
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,736
-More than one?
-Maybe.

1055
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,240
What?

1056
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,286
-She got two.
-Two?

1057
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,338
"If someone asks me
how the weather was today,

1058
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,340
I'll say it was like So-yeon."

1059
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,301
"Thanks for your kind heart
and your delightful laughter."

1060
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,886
I feel like this is Jin-taek.

1061
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,015
This is amazing.

1062
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,859
-"The best fried rice ever."
-Right.

1063
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,654
KANG SO-YEON: 2 POSTCARDS

1064
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:12,697
AN YEA-WON

1065
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,115
It's Yea-won's turn.

1066
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,366
Let's see.

1067
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,881
It's empty.

1068
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,466
Oh, no. It's empty.

1069
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:32,926
Oh, no.

1070
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,846
AN YEA-WON: 0 POSTCARDS

1071
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,019
She's back. Yea-won is back.

1072
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,062
I'm back.

1073
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,690
-You look happier, Yea-won.
-It's cold.

1074
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,192
What is it?

1075
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,569
-What happened?
-What happened to your poker face?

1076
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,696
-What happened?
-Nothing.

1077
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,614
What is it?

1078
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,828
Well, it was the first day we met,

1079
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,290
so it didn't bother me that much.

1080
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:06,960
Gosh, it's really cold.

1081
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:07,961
I know.

1082
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:08,878
Yes.

1083
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,425
SHIN JI-YEON

1084
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,052
All right. It's Ji-yeon's turn.

1085
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:17,971
I wonder how many she got.

1086
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,681
-Now, that's Ji-a.
-Ji-a.

1087
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,808
We guessed that they would get the most.

1088
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,519
I feel like most guys

1089
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,230
wrote to Ji-a and Ji-yeon.

1090
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,524
Ji-yeon and Ji-a.

1091
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,025
Ji-yeon and Ji-a.

1092
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,570
I think Ji-yeon and Ji-a
got the most postcards.

1093
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:36,322
Well, I can tell from what the guys say

1094
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,741
that they like those two.

1095
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,994
And they caught my attention as well.

1096
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,914
I think Ji-a is the most popular.

1097
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:49,168
She's obviously the type that guys love.

1098
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,837
She's also very fashionable.

1099
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:52,880
I think it's Ji-yeon.

1100
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:56,342
She looks like someone from a comic book.

1101
00:59:56,426 --> 01:00:00,263
She's the archetype
of a pure and feminine woman.

1102
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,266
She makes us feel like
we need to protect her.

1103
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:08,187
SONG JI-A, SHIN JI-YEON

1104
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,654
There are two postcards.

1105
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:17,780
Are there three?

1106
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:18,740
-Three?
-Three postcards?

1107
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,199
-Three?
-Three?

1108
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,328
-Three postcards?
-This means one of them got zero.

1109
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,787
Yes.

1110
01:00:56,944 --> 01:01:01,949
