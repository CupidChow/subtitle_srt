13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,762
-Hold me.
-Okay.

14
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,641
It would be nice
if dolphins pass by right now.

15
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,188
My gosh.

16
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,357
I feel like I'm on my way to heaven.

17
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,739
Min-ji, should we just
talk casually to each other?

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,492
-What do you say?
-Okay. Let's do that.

19
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,785
-Good.
-Let's do that.

20
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,870
-You can just call me Se-hoon.
-Se-hoon?

21
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,038
Yes, Se-hoon.

22
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,289
So you chose me.

23
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,250
Why did you choose me?

24
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,503
Well, I saw you working hard
when we cooked together.

25
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,629
I see.

26
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,756
I liked that about you.

27
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,882
I see.

28
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,137
-So you joined us in the middle.
-Right.

29
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,057
-You must feel a lot of pressure.
-I feel a lot of pressure.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,392
-And I'm a shy person, so…
-I see.

31
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,853
Is that why you brought me here?

32
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,897
We knew each other, but we had never met.

33
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,234
-So, I thought, "Oh, that's Ji-a."
-"Ji-a is here."

34
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,652
Exactly. "That's Ji-a."

35
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,196
Maybe we were meant to meet.

36
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,537
This show is really cruel to me.

37
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,080
Several times?

38
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:06,000
It's like your best friend
has a crush on your crush.

39
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,504
I think he picked Ji-a because he's shy.

40
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,965
-But what if he's interested in her?
-Okay. Hypothetically.

41
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:12,966
That would be a bummer.

42
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,676
I'm saying this situation is cruel to me.

43
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,220
-Right. I didn't think that way.
-I see what you mean.

44
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,389
Your best friend suddenly shows up

45
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,057
-and…
-I didn't think that far.

46
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,476
-And if he likes the girl you like…
-And he declares war.

47
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,980
I did think Hyun-seung and I

48
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,066
might have similar ideal types.

49
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,778
And I wasn't really happy
about the whole situation.

50
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,613
Yes.

51
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,159
HANHAE, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

52
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,410
Of course.

53
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,580
-Of all women…
-Hyun-seung chose Ji-a.

54
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,747
Right.

55
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,250
He probably didn't know
about Hyeon-joong and Ji-a, right?

56
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,878
Well, Hyun-seung
doesn't know what's going on

57
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,297
-between Hyeon-joong and Ji-a yet.
-Right.

58
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,590
That's probably how he could

59
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,466
-choose her so easily.
-Right.

60
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,430
The three new participants
brought so many new possibilities.

61
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,348
YACHT DATE
CHA HYUN-SEUNG AND SONG JI-A

62
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,184
I can't believe
that I'm here with you right now.

63
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,603
It feels so strange.

64
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,520
I know, right?

65
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,398
How long have you been single?

66
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,609
-Three years, I think.
-Really?

67
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,819
You must be picky.

68
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,778
Me?

69
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,489
You're not?

70
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,033
What's your ideal type?

71
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,328
Someone who clicks with me.

72
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,997
What about appearance-wise?

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,042
Appearance-wise, I'm attracted
to women who have beautiful smiles.

74
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,752
I'm attracted
to those with positive vibes.

75
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,129
I'm attracted to sexy and sweet men.

76
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,216
Looks like someone might have a hard time

77
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,260
-finding a boyfriend.
-Why?

78
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,137
Men like that are hard to find.

79
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,472
They are.

80
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,976
This is your first time
seeing me in person.

81
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,561
What was your first impression of me?

82
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,230
My first impression of you?

83
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,606
-Was it…
-You want to know?

84
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,149
Sexy.

85
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,280
I'm sure you're popular among women.

86
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,865
-Me?
-Yes.

87
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,075
Because you're sexy.

88
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,912
-What should I do to attract women?
-Sexy. What?

89
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:10,124
-What do you think I should do?
-You look sexy just as you are.

90
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,877
Don't you get that a lot?

91
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,587
No, not really.

92
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,049
People tell me that I look cold and scary.

93
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,386
I guess you do kind of look scary.

94
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,180
-I don't smile a lot.
-Because you don't smile.

95
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,141
That's why.
But you look different when you smile.

96
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,852
You look cute when you smile.

97
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,772
The bigger the difference, the better.

98
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,983
It's an unexpected charm.

99
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,532
Who are you attracted to the most?

100
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,369
-Do I need to answer this question?
-What?

101
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,329
It's up to you.

102
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,748
-It's a secret.
-A secret?

103
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,584
A secret.

104
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,718
Seriously, Ji-a is so good

105
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,052
-with men.
-She's cool.

106
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,971
-I find Hyun-seung attractive.
-Me too.

107
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:09,017
I like that he has single eyelids.

108
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,894
It makes him look
so attractive when he smiles.

109
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,021
Right?

110
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,439
YACHT DATE
SEONG MIN-JI AND MOON SE-HOON

111
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,232
So…

112
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,818
-you picked me.
-Right.

113
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,069
Is there a specific reason?

114
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,989
I'm attracted to those
who have pretty noses.

115
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,492
-That's why I chose you.
-I see.

116
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,495
Well, I don't know
your personality yet, so…

117
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,747
Right.

118
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,541
What kind of personality
do you find charming?

119
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,085
-What kind of disposition…
-I like those who like to play games.

120
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,421
-What?
-Games.

121
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,672
-Video games?
-Yes.

122
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,841
-Because you like video games?
-Yes, I like games.

123
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,219
-I see. What games do you play?
-Overwatch.

124
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,304
I see.

125
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,348
Gosh, I hate video games.

126
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,061
I don't even have any accounts.
I've never played any.

127
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,063
-Really?
-She looks flustered.

128
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,190
There are guys like him.

129
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,775
-They don't like video games.
-I see.

130
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,111
I played Maple Story when I was little,
but I haven't played anything since.

131
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,949
Overwatch is a shooting game, right?

132
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,117
I main Junkrat.

133
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,037
It's the name of the character.

134
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,080
What?

135
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,539
-Do you know it?
-Of course not.

136
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,917
How would I know? I don't play.

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,335
"Of course not."

138
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,461
Of course, he doesn't.

139
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,670
He doesn't play the game.

140
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,964
I told you I don't even have
any gaming accounts.

141
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,675
-But…
-I know Sudden Attack and Maple Story.

142
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,094
-I see.
-Those are all I know.

143
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,638
-So you don't play at all.
-Not at all.

144
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,641
Are you good? Are you a ranker?

145
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,559
I'm not a ranker,
but I'm a Platinum player.

146
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,560
-What?
-Platinum.

147
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,603
You don't know, right?

148
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,105
-Plat?
-Platinum.

149
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,356
-Platinum?
-Yes.

150
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,982
-As in, the yogurt brand?
-No.

151
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,197
Gosh, I love Se-hoon.

152
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,117
-There are different tiers in the game.
-What?

153
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,118
-Tiers.
-Tiers?

154
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,245
Gosh, how should I put it?

155
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,373
-Should we change the topic?
-Yes, let's change the topic.

156
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,045
-I'll go learn what tier is and all.
-Okay.

157
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,048
Other guys should know it. I'll ask them.

158
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,049
Okay.

159
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,968
The fact that you don't
like games is already…

160
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,513
Who is your favorite singer?
What kind of music do you like?

161
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,223
I like hip-hop.

162
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,724
Hip-hop?

163
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,646
I never listen to hip-hop.

164
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,235
Okay. You might as well
stop wasting your time.

165
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,488
He changed the subject
from games to music and this happened.

166
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,781
Exactly.

167
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,076
My gosh.

168
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,204
I see.

169
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,706
So hip-hop?

170
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,167
Gosh.

171
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,960
You're full of surprises.

172
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,047
-Gosh.
-What kind of music do you listen to?

173
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,384
My favorite singers are

174
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,219
Jo Sung-mo and…

175
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,429
-What?
-Jo Sung-mo.

176
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,097
-Okay.
-Shin Seung-hun.

177
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,101
-And Yoo Jae-ha.
-So you like ballads.

178
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,936
Yes. I like sentimental ballads.

179
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,354
But you like hip…

180
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,192
-What do we do?
-Well…

181
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,154
I can try some hip-hop.

182
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:13,743
I'll go ask the guys today
who are interested in hip-hop.

183
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,413
My gosh.

184
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,709
YACHT DATE
KIM SU-MIN AND KIM JUN-SIK

185
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,377
Is there anything you want to ask me?

186
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,339
Do you have an ideal type?

187
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,507
Okay.

188
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,176
You said you're
attracted to cat-face types.

189
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,135
Right.

190
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:36,307
I'm attracted to those
who have thick double eyelids.

191
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,394
I don't have double eyelids.
I have single eyelids.

192
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,231
Appearance-wise, I like them.

193
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,316
I'm not a cat-face type either.

194
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,609
It depends on what kind of cat.

195
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,571
Is that so?
Everyone says I look like a puppy.

196
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,824
I think you'll look like a cat
if you have whiskers.

197
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,243
I see.

198
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,501
I did get to know

199
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,338
Jun-sik better than before,

200
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,216
but I'm not sure yet.

201
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,680
It's Hyeon-joong and Si-hun.

202
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,684
Oh, no. They must be devastated.

203
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,241
But seriously, thanks to you,
I got to have a burger.

204
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,411
-I made a promise today.
-Did you have fun?

205
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,204
I'll keep my promise.

206
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,205
Okay.

207
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,334
-Get some rest. See you soon.
-Okay.

208
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,711
-Thanks.
-Bye.

209
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,046
I wonder what it looks like in there.

210
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,881
Get some rest.

211
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,174
-See you later.
-Bye.

212
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,099
-Hello, Hyun-seung.
-Look who's back.

213
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,935
-Seriously, what are the odds?
-What?

214
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,479
-How could you guys meet here?
-I have no idea.

215
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,690
Shall we talk now?

216
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,567
How was it?

217
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,487
-She's so cute. She really surprised me.
-Really?

218
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,072
-She really surprised me.
-I see.

219
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,116
I thought she'd be a cold type,

220
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,619
but she was so funny. She likes hip-hop.

221
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,497
I need to learn some things.
What's a tier?

222
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,541
-Why?
-Things like Grandmaster.

223
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,878
-It's a video game thing.
-She loves video games. I need to learn.

224
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,796
I had no idea.

225
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,675
We were talking about hobbies,
and I said I hate video games.

226
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,469
Then she said she liked video games.

227
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,930
And I don't listen to hip-hop.
I'm allergic to it.

228
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,767
-Really?
-I don't really like it.

229
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,353
-But apparently, she loves hip-hop.
-I see.

230
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,105
Which made it more fun, actually.
We laughed a lot.

231
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,816
-Talking about things you didn't know?
-Right.

232
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,276
We talked about our differences.

233
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,904
We were completely different.

234
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,447
-She was surprised.
-Se-hoon, right?

235
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,450
Yes. We were so shocked to learn

236
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:03,037
-how different we were.
-Really? Are you so different?

237
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,957
-We didn't talk about those things.
-I don't even know what he likes.

238
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,960
-Why didn't you ask him those things?
-I didn't ask him those things.

239
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,630
I answered a lot of her questions.

240
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,050
I told her about what Paradise is like
and what we do there.

241
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,386
Ji-a told me about it too.
She said it's awesome there.

242
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,470
I see.

243
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,430
-It's nice.
-Time goes by fast.

244
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,559
Did you eat there?

245
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,186
No. We didn't have much to eat.

246
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,648
-My date had seasickness.
-Ji-a did?

247
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,857
-She got seasick.
-She puked?

248
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,734
Okay, she didn't puke.

249
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,277
We just talked.

250
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,780
-We sat on the deck and talked a lot.
-I see.

251
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,448
Why did you choose Ji-a?

252
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:45,413
Well, I knew Ji-a,
but I had never met her in person.

253
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,372
I see.

254
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,083
When I saw her,
I thought, "What's she doing here?"

255
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,042
I see.

256
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,045
-It was fun. But I'm so hungry.
-Really?

257
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,422
-Hungry?
-I didn't eat anything.

258
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,924
So you guys already knew each other?

259
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,634
-Yes. Crazy, right?
-That's crazy.

260
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,928
-How interesting. How is it possible?
-I was shocked too.

261
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,347
-He's different from how he looks.
-Really?

262
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,849
He's so meek.

263
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,559
That's really surprising.

264
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,273
Among all the male participants here,

265
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,942
Hyun-seung is the closest
to my ideal type, appearance-wise.

266
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,778
-Really?
-Oh, my.

267
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,822
What's going to happen now?

268
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,907
I'm pretty attracted to him.

269
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,492
Yes.

270
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,328
He's really close to my type.

271
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,293
Ji-a, are you in there?

272
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,252
Yes.

273
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,046
-Do you want me to come out?
-Yes.

274
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,719
-Hi.
-I fell asleep.

275
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,638
You were sleeping?

276
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,265
-Do you want to go back to sleep?
-No.

277
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,433
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

278
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,851
I heard you got seasick.

279
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,145
Yes. Wait. I think
this is falling off, just a second.

280
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,063
Let me see.

281
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,777
What did you do?

282
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,404
Me? I was so depressed here.

283
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,363
Why?

284
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,866
I was so bored.

285
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,327
-Seriously, I…
-Have you eaten yet?

286
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,578
I had some potatoes.

287
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,079
-Potatoes?
-Yes.

288
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,290
So you were that bored?

289
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,710
There's nothing to do
and no one to talk to.

290
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,670
How was it for you?

291
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,840
Well, I got seasick and I'm hungry now.

292
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,384
-Where are we going? Over there?
-Someplace quiet.

293
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,222
Can you see I'm trying?

294
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,431
What do you mean?

295
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,850
-I always come to you.
-Right.

296
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,436
-Everyone says they're impressed.
-They're impressed?

297
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,230
Yes. I'm like a puppy.

298
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,149
You're my master and I always run to you,

299
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,734
-wagging my tail.
-You're like a puppy?

300
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,988
I haven't seen him
saying cute things like that.

301
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,989
-Right.
-Hyeon-joong.

302
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,449
He's a little jealous.

303
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,621
By the way, things were
going well between Ji-a and Hyeon-joong

304
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,208
until she said Hyun-seung
was close to her ideal type.

305
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,086
And Hyeon-joong is
feeling very anxious now.

306
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,421
-Right.
-What happens to Si-hun then?

307
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,215
Well, Si-hun…

308
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:05,177
-Si-hun went to get water with Su-min.
-I know.

309
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,845
And they were getting along pretty well.

310
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,224
-But…
-But Su-min chose Jun-sik.

311
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,351
Right. I thought she'd choose Si-hun.

312
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,769
Me too.

313
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,480
-I wonder what Jun-sik is thinking.
-Se-hoon was so funny.

314
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,399
Se-hoon.

315
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,569
How could they be so different?

316
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,196
-Do you think he's interested…
-Yes.

317
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,489
in Min-ji?

318
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,616
-He says he wants to learn about it.
-Right.

319
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,994
And he seems to find it interesting

320
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,246
that she's so different from him.

321
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,707
-He could find that attractive.
-It doesn't matter

322
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,626
how different they are.
This whole thing must be exciting for him.

323
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,130
Anyhow, he has more possibilities now.

324
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,927
-Crabs?
-Oh, my gosh. Instant noodles!

325
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,929
-Crab noodles!
-Just like what we talked about.

326
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,140
-We talked about this earlier.
-About noodles.

327
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,392
-I told you.
-Look at Jun-sik's face.

328
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,145
A burger and instant noodles?
Today is my lucky day.

329
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,730
-Instant noodles?
-Instant noodles?

330
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,106
Yes! Instant noodles!

331
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,191
Gosh, I really missed instant noodles.

332
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,955
Should we put water on the table?

333
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,749
Okay. Let's set the table.

334
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,793
We need so much water now.

335
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,004
-Let's just tell them to start first.
-Okay.

336
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,548
All right.

337
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,725
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

338
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,976
Enjoy.

339
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,227
Enjoy.

340
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,564
Enjoy.

341
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,952
I haven't eaten with such
a large group of people in a long time.

342
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,244
Hyun-seung, how was it today?

343
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,705
I'm having fun so far.

344
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,832
-So far?
-So far, so good.

345
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,335
Min-ji, how is being on a deserted island?

346
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,586
It's kind of fun.

347
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,545
-Pardon?
-It's fun.

348
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,505
-Fun?
-Yes.

349
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,549
We have three more participants now,
but we're still all different.

350
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,676
-Right.
-True.

351
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,678
All 12 of us are different.

352
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,639
Welcome.

353
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,057
Thank you.

354
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,144
That was a great meal.

355
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,939
My gosh. The sunset is so beautiful today.

356
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,649
Does anybody want to swim in the sunset?

357
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,608
I'm in.

358
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,528
-Hyun-seung, do you like the water?
-I love water.

359
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,238
You do? Great.

360
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,243
-What?
-Let's go.

361
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,536
-Let's go.
-Barefoot is better.

362
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,788
-Let's go!
-All right.

363
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,665
What are they doing?

364
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,004
My gosh! That's crazy.

365
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,923
So manly!

366
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,594
-That was crazy.
-It looks so cold.

367
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,389
That looked amazing.

368
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,283
So cold.

369
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,909
I know. It's so cold.

370
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,244
It looks really cold.

371
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,197
We're watching the sky.

372
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,406
Excuse me.

373
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,534
-The sky is so beautiful.
-Are you on your honeymoon?

374
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,494
-No.
-Yes.

375
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,245
-You came to Bali?
-How did you know?

376
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,622
But the sun was just…

377
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,831
-So beautiful?
-So beautiful.

378
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,167
-It was round.
-Right. The sun was about to set,

379
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,586
-so we hurried and met up
-Right.

380
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,463
to see the sun before it disappears.

381
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,173
-But it was gone already.
-It disappeared.

382
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,675
-Life is all about timing.
-Right.

383
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,885
Seriously.

384
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,806
Who is he waiting for?

385
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,140
I guess it's Ji-a.

386
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,563
-Shall we?
-What?

387
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,565
-Shall we go?
-Where?

388
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,026
Well, how about next to the cafeteria?

389
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,444
-Is that okay?
-Sure.

390
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,779
This seat is nice too.

391
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,323
It looks like
Si-hun has been waiting for Ji-a.

392
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,783
Ji-a is so popular.

393
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,368
-Yes.
-Yes.

394
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,786
Everyone's fighting over her.

395
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,872
-Right?
-Right.

396
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,000
What are you so curious about?

397
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,128
I'm going to ask you everything today.

398
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,506
-Do you want to sit over here?
-Okay.

399
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,885
When we had beer together that night,

400
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,429
you said that you had
feelings for someone.

401
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:05,102
Is there one specific person here
that you like?

402
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,937
-Yes.
-Yes.

403
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,522
She said yes.

404
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,900
So I wanted to ask you
if you've made up your mind now.

405
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,404
I think I barely know both of you.

406
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,363
Okay.

407
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,200
So I'm not sure yet.

408
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,080
This is hard.

409
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,710
He went for a walk with Ji-a.

410
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:30,836
-I know.
-Are you okay?

411
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,421
-I saw her briefly.
-Okay. Are you okay?

412
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,174
He keeps looking for her.

413
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,176
-Well, what can I do about it?
-I know.

414
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,094
I can't say, "Don't go."

415
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,433
When I hear Hyeon-joong say
"Ji-a and I, we…"

416
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,478
I keep hearing him talking about you.

417
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,481
-That was the hardest.
-I see.

418
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,317
I went to a really big one with Ji-a.

419
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,487
You take Jun-sik. I'll take Ji-a.

420
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,865
Me. I want to do it.

421
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,202
I don't know how to put it,
but Ji-a and I have this chemistry.

422
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,038
-She said you communicate with your eyes.
-I can feel it.

423
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,790
Ji-a and I are
really craving pork belly these days.

424
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,172
I didn't want to stay in the room,
so I walked around outside,

425
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,632
and I ended up getting a tan.

426
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,802
-I can see that.
-Look at his face.

427
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,099
I just don't want to stay inside.
And it's getting worse.

428
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,647
But really, I don't know what I want yet.

429
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,065
-But…
-Okay.

430
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,316
So…

431
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,528
What if I end up choosing someone else?
What would you do then?

432
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,655
-Me?
-Yes.

433
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,616
I think I'll be glad
that I did my best at least.

434
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,785
-You're right. You're very proactive.
-Right.

435
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,828
-You're also a good leader.
-Right.

436
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,667
This is really hard.

437
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,129
Seriously, you are the most
mysterious person I've ever met.

438
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,965
-You're number one.
-Why?

439
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,216
You're so complicated.

440
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,551
I think it's because
I don't know what I want either.

441
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,511
I see.

442
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,434
Please sit here.

443
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,561
No, It's okay.

444
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,106
Well, others are coming here too, so…

445
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,441
-Do you want to go for a walk?
-Sounds good.

446
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:25,242
I heard something
really shocking yesterday.

447
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,159
What is it?

448
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,828
Well…

449
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,998
You said that I wasn't being clear
about how I feel about you.

450
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:31,999
Oh, that.

451
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,418
After talking to you,

452
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:38,922
I realized that you talked to me a lot

453
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:44,177
but I've never really
talked to you, not even jokingly,

454
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,722
in front of the others.

455
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,436
The small gestures you mentioned,
like sitting next to you.

456
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,520
I did it today.

457
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,689
Right. I could feel you were trying.

458
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,773
-Right?
-Thank you.

459
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,029
This reminds me of the time
when we dipped our feet in the water.

460
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,948
-Right. We were walking here.
-Right.

461
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,287
Gosh.

462
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,497
Gosh. This is just…

463
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,626
This place is amazing.

464
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,841
Hyeon-joong kept saying
that we looked cute together.

465
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,594
It was kind of embarrassing, right?

466
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,306
-It was embarrassing but nice.
-Was it?

467
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,686
It looks like So-yeon is now trying
to win back Jin-taek's heart.

468
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,064
-Right.
-So-yeon is trying really hard.

469
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,108
I think that conversation
with Se-hoon really shocked her.

470
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,152
-The private conversation with him.
-Right.

471
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,488
-It was hardly a conversation.
-That was a wake-up call.

472
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:48,492
-It almost looked like an argument.
-Right.

473
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,328
So-yeon has been
expressing her feelings to Jin-taek since

474
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,622
-and Ji-yeon seems a bit…
-She's bothered.

475
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,500
-She kept looking at them.
-I could see her eyeing them.

476
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,545
Where's Si-hun?

477
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,590
I think he's still talking to her.

478
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,133
-Where?
-I don't know.

479
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,137
I wish I could tell you how I feel.

480
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,057
-No, you don't need to tell me anything.
-I don't need to?

481
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,559
No. I know you like
to use your eyes to communicate.

482
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,020
So tell me with your eyes.

483
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,021
Tell you what?

484
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,189
You know…

485
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:33,203
It's okay. I don't want to burden you.

486
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,372
I won't pressure you.

487
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,379
Okay. I think…

488
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,383
I heard enough. Thank you.

489
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,895
-Don't cry. Why are you crying?
-I'm not crying.

490
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,566
I wouldn't cry.

491
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,902
Anyway…

492
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,907
Okay. Let's get inside.
There are so many bugs here.

493
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:11,825
Let's go.

494
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,795
That's probably for the best.

495
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,713
-Yes.
-Gosh.

496
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,839
It's for the best.

497
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,800
Si-hun was serious about her.

498
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,968
He's really serious.

499
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,429
-He's admirable.
-Yes.

500
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,358
Oh, dear.

501
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,402
It's all over now.

502
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,738
I want to go home.

503
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,115
-You want to go home?
-Yes.

504
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,827
That's what I've been thinking
the whole day today. "I want to go home."

505
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,455
Because of the conversation?

506
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:02,542
Right. She didn't say it directly,

507
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:06,129
but with all the hints
she gave me, I got the message.

508
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,091
Which is why I can give up now.

509
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,721
Today must be like hell for you.

510
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,181
Today is the worst.

511
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,098
It hurts.

512
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,726
It's not the hottest hell in the world.

513
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,396
-Right. This place hurts me.
-It's the most painful hell in the world.

514
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,522
It burns too.

515
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,111
Se-hoon knows how that feels.

516
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,405
Right. No one knows better than him.

517
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,865
They can relate to each other.

518
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,283
They totally can.

519
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,245
How many men are interested in Ji-a?

520
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,663
-Three.
-Three.

521
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,040
Ji-a must be flustered too.

522
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,918
-I bet she's uncomfortable too.
-Being too popular can be a problem too.

523
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,127
I guess so.

524
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:52,884
Today, the new participants,
Su-min, Min-ji, and Hyun-seung

525
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,136
will choose a person they like
and convey their feelings.

526
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,975
I wonder whom
the two new girls will choose.

527
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,352
I have no idea.

528
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,813
-Seriously, I have no idea.
-Me neither.

529
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,275
KIM SU-MIN

530
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,734
What's this?

531
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,868
MOON SE-HOON

532
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,161
Se-hoon.

533
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,001
MOON SE-HOON

534
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,670
-She chose Se-hoon.
-I hope both girls choose Se-hoon.

535
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,672
Please.

536
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,844
When I was having a hard time
fitting in because I was new,

537
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,514
he was very kind to me.
I appreciate his kindness,

538
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,725
and that's why I chose him.

539
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,769
SEONG MIN-JI

540
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,982
I feel like Min-ji will choose Se-hoon.

541
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,150
-Min-ji?
-Yes.

542
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,777
-I think you're getting two votes today.
-Me too. Two votes.

543
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,281
-Two votes.
-I decided not to expect anything.

544
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,994
-What's Min-ji's choice?
-I think she might choose Se-hoon too.

545
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,079
-There's a possibility.
-Yes.

546
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,962
MOON SE-HOON

547
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,547
You were right.

548
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,134
-Every dog has its day.
-Goodness. Now I've seen everything.

549
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,469
-Finally.
-Right.

550
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,512
On the yacht date…

551
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,514
I like hip-hop.

552
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,599
Hip-hop?

553
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,893
We talked a lot.

554
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,979
He was totally different from me,

555
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,148
so I was attracted to him.

556
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:34,110
I chose him
because I want to get to know him better.

557
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:40,742
CHA HYUN-SEUNG

558
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,577
He seemed really charming.

559
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,038
-He's so sexy.
-He's rather meek.

560
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,248
He seems hard to approach,
but after talking to him,

561
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,583
-I realized he's not.
-He's meek.

562
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,170
I suppose Hyun-seung will choose Ji-a.

563
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,505
I think so.

564
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,549
-Who is it?
-Of course.

565
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,426
He doesn't even hesitate.

566
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,096
SONG JI-A

567
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,556
I knew her already,

568
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,269
but I got to learn much more about her.

569
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,440
And I came to like her even more.

570
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,864
Gosh. It's already day six.

571
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,467
We should flip now.

572
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,640
The water is so clear today.

573
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,989
What should I do?

574
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,367
I don't know what I'm feeling.

575
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,495
It's hard, right?

576
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,165
What about you, Ji-a?
Did you make up your mind?

577
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,752
We still have some time left.
I wouldn't say I made up my mind.

578
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,755
So for now,
you're most attracted to Jin-taek?

579
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:22,051
After the two dates,
I was attracted to Jin-taek more.

580
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,928
Rather than Si-hun.

581
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,722
It was just more fun

582
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,557
- to hang out with him.
-I see.

583
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,017
-He's so personable.
-He is.

584
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,727
It's fun hanging out with him.

585
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,105
So I wanted to hit on him,

586
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,942
but So-yeon is really into Jin-taek.

587
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,653
Remember she said once

588
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,698
that she chose Si-hun
because she didn't want to go to Paradise.

589
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,950
-It's hard.
-Then why don't you talk to him?

590
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,453
-You think?
-Yes, if that's what you think.

591
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,664
I thought so too.
So I tried talking to him,

592
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,001
but since he went on a walk with So-yeon

593
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,544
after our date in Paradise,

594
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,798
he's not talking to me at all.

595
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,924
So I feel like

596
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,594
maybe I'm just being a third wheel.

597
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,762
That's how I feel.

598
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,679
I see.

599
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,390
Okay.

600
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,186
That means Jin-taek didn't talk
with Ji-yeon at all

601
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,230
since he went for a walk with So-yeon.

602
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,982
It looks like nothing really happened
since their date in Paradise.

603
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,317
-Looks like it.
-Right?

604
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,320
-How interesting.
-I wonder what Jin-taek is thinking.

605
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,030
Jin-taek is upsetting so many women now.

606
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:27,367
I'm curious to know what Ji-a
and Jin-taek might be thinking now.

607
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,827
-Me too.
-They're so mysterious.

608
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,914
I feel like
whom they're going to Paradise with

609
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,334
-will decide a lot of things.
-Right.

610
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,294
-They're exactly halfway through.
-Right.

611
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,884
Participants, please come to the beach.

612
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,682
Will they fight in there?

613
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,685
This has got to be a game for the men.

614
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,188
This is going to be a physical fight.

615
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,045
-It's mud.
-What?

616
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,677
This looks exciting.

617
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,430
What are we doing here?

618
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:45,570
Today, male participants will
play a game for dates in Paradise.

619
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,698
So the prize is a date?

620
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,533
A MEN'S GAME FOR DATES IN PARADISE

621
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,910
A date in Paradise?

622
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,331
Paradise?

623
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:01,377
Only the top three players

624
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,963
will get to go on dates in Paradise.

625
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,424
ONLY THE TOP THREE
GET TO GO ON DATES IN PARADISE

626
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,718
Top three players?

627
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,219
So we're not voting.

628
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,105
-My gosh.
-My gosh. That didn't cross my mind.

629
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,774
I'm getting nervous.

630
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,858
Me too.

631
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,818
Let me explain the game rules.

632
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,072
All male participants
will go into the arena

633
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:34,661
and push each other out
when the whistle blows.

634
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,081
Those with both legs
pushed out of the arena will be eliminated

635
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:42,251
and the one who stays inside the arena
until the end will be the winner.

636
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:47,507
Now, male participants,
please enter the arena.

637
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,851
This is going to break their friendship.

638
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,853
I know. What should they do now?

639
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,030
-This is all about physical strength.
-Yes, it is.

640
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,117
-Their pride is on the line.
-Right.

641
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,883
Let's do this.

642
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,595
Now that we've become friends,
it's harder to compete.

643
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,939
Look at Hyeon-joong and Hyun-seung.

644
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,734
They're not moving.

645
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,618
No way.

646
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,245
Move.

647
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,539
Go on and fight.

648
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,707
Go on and fight.

649
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,503
-Oh, no.
-But if this happens…

650
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,559
-Oh no!
-He got him!

651
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,561
He got him!

652
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,948
Hyeon-joong has been eliminated.

653
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,624
This is war.

654
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,169
You're all dead.

655
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,754
You're all dead!

656
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,787
You don't want to be standing up.
It's dangerous.

657
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,127
Gosh.

658
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,838
I might end up like Hyeon-joong,
so I can't attack anyone.

659
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,312
Jin-taek!

660
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,065
Jin-taek!

661
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,917
You don't want to attack me.

662
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,588
He defended against the attack.

663
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,923
How did he defend against four guys?

664
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,300
-Seriously.
-I'm impressed.

665
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,720
-That's unbelievable.
-Why are you attacking him only?

666
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,602
Why am I so nervous
when I'm just watching them?

667
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,936
My gosh.

668
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,730
Gosh. This is savage.

669
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,046
You're so dead.

670
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,299
You're all dead now.

671
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,717
You're all dead.

672
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,638
-Isn't that from Rustic Period?
-You're Kwon Sang-woo today.

673
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,014
-Rustic Period?
-Kwon Sang-woo.

674
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,499
Si-hun has been eliminated.

675
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,339
He's athletic.

676
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,548
Se-hoon is strong.

677
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,427
-It was Se-hoon.
-He's athletic.

678
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,887
Right. He's so agile.

679
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,514
Right. He won the last game too.

680
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,396
Two of Ji-a's men have been eliminated.

681
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,814
-Right.
-Right.

682
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,316
Now, only one of them will be eliminated.

683
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,135
My goodness.

684
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,723
Jun-sik has been eliminated.

685
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,311
-My gosh.
-That was brutal.

686
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,166
It's game over for you.

687
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,762
Jin-taek has been eliminated.

688
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,601
-I'm so nervous.
-I'm scared.

689
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,523
-Their pride is on the line.
-My gosh. The strongest two are left now.

690
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,817
Se-hoon is going to Paradise either way!

691
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,612
-I know! He's finally going to Paradise.
-Finally.

692
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,655
-I'm happy for him.
-Go, Se-hoon.

693
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,621
I wonder who's the strongest.

694
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,998
This is a one-on-one fight.

695
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,583
They're both quite exhausted.

696
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,501
Right.

697
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,975
Damn, you're really strong.

698
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,864
Gosh, his strength
beat his athletic talent.

699
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,351
-Oh, no.
-He can't fight back!

700
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,477
What's happening?

701
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,315
That was smooth.

702
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,526
Se-hoon has been eliminated.

703
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,158
Gosh. That was amazing.

704
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,409
He's too strong.

705
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,580
-This is really hard.
-I know.

706
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,844
Are you okay?

707
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:26,442
The winner of the game
for a date in Paradise is Hyun-seung.

708
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,820
In second place, Se-hoon,
and in third place, Jin-taek.

709
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,325
The top three players will choose

710
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:38,871
their partners
to go to Paradise with in the evening.

711
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,372
Thanks for your hard work, everyone.

712
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,416
-Good work, everyone.
-Good work.

713
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,961
When the men played in the arena,

714
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:50,591
Hyun-seung showed us
a different side of his,

715
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,259
and everyone found him very sexy.

716
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:56,889
After that game,
Hyun-seung seems so attractive.

717
00:41:56,972 --> 00:42:01,894
I feel like I might be swayed.

718
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,606
Watching them made me so nervous.

719
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,441
-I even got a stomachache.
-I was so nervous.

720
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,193
-I think I was too tense.
-Me too.

721
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,153
I got really nervous too. I was surprised.

722
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,947
Everyone's eyes were…

723
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,825
-I knew Hyun-seung would be good.
-Hyun-seung. Right.

724
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,035
-Hyun-seung?
-You know.

725
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,495
He won the game.

726
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,871
I could just feel it.

727
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,123
As soon as the game started,
Hyeon-joong attacked Si-hun.

728
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,834
-I did not see that coming.
-I didn't know he'd do that.

729
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,878
Maybe it's because he was in front.

730
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,048
-No, it's because of Ji-a.
-You're right. I had no idea.

731
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,341
He came at him because of Ji-a.

732
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,468
Right. I thought it was
because he found him weak.

733
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,595
I'm curious though.

734
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,056
I wonder who Se-hoon will choose.

735
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,016
Me too. I wonder who he'll choose.

736
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,434
-I bet he'll choose her.
-Me too.

737
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,561
You think?

738
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,563
-You rode the yacht together?
-What did you do?

739
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,022
-Yes, we did.
-Oh, I see.

740
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,024
Finally…

741
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,944
-Finally.
-Finally, Se-hoon is going to Paradise.

742
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,407
-We never know who he might choose.
-I'm curious.

743
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:58,951
Su-min also…

744
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,744
Su-min is also
interested in Se-hoon, right?

745
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,704
-Yes.
-She is.

746
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,539
She's interested in Se-hoon.

747
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,628
Se-hoon, are you still torn?

748
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,755
Me? Yes.

749
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,675
I wonder who you'll choose.

750
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,719
Me too.

751
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,810
Hyun-seung, what about you?
Have you decided?

752
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,895
I'm torn between two.

753
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,606
Unless something huge happens…

754
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,649
You know who you're choosing?

755
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:42,244
How about we all talk to Hyun-seung

756
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,079
one by one?

757
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,248
-Sounds good.
-One by one.

758
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,916
Why don't we let the new girls

759
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,877
-talk to him first.
-Yes. Let's do that.

760
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:54,423
Let's go to their lodging and tell them
we'd like to talk to him one by one.

761
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,301
Yes.

762
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,304
-Hyun-seung?
-Yes.

763
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,306
Could you come out for a second?

764
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,433
Sure.

765
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,115
Looks like you're getting along well.

766
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,493
-With the people?
-Yes. With everyone.

767
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,869
Everyone here is so nice.

768
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,121
Wasn't it confusing at first?

769
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,499
They asked us to pick
our partners as soon as we arrived.

770
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:29,667
I was told to pick one.

771
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,335
-And…
-Yes?

772
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,087
you chose Se-hoon, right?

773
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,881
Yes, I did.

774
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,719
Was it because you liked
his appearance the most?

775
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,391
I'm attracted to people with pretty noses.

776
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,768
-And I thought he had a pretty nose.
-His nose.

777
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,228
That's why I chose him.

778
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,896
-He had the prettiest nose?
-Yes.

779
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,069
What about the others?

780
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,077
It's not so far away,
but we need to walk a bit.

781
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,414
So it's called the cooling zone?

782
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,748
Yes. It's up there.

783
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:11,917
Oh, Ji-yeon too.

784
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,968
-We had a voting session yesterday.
-Right.

785
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,678
-Did you choose well?
-Me?

786
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:23,637
Yes.

787
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,055
Yes.

788
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,017
-I see.
-I chose you.

789
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,769
-Me?
-Yes.

790
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,522
-Are you allowed to tell me?
-No.

791
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,859
No, it's okay. You can say it.

792
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,780
This place is really interesting.

793
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,204
There should be some ice left, right?

794
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,291
-There is.
-There is?

795
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,460
-That's great.
-It's a relief, right?

796
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,546
-That's a relief.
-There's a lot.

797
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,438
You said you voted for me,

798
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,648
but I had no idea.

799
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,276
When I first came here,

800
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,320
I was…

801
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,823
totally lost. I didn't know what to do.

802
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,702
And you helped me a lot.

803
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,289
I really appreciated it. I almost cried.

804
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,709
Really? You were so thankful
you almost cried?

805
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,421
Yes. Seriously, I had no idea

806
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,631
what I had to do.

807
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,346
I didn't know what to do.

808
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,224
-No one told me what to do.
-Right.

809
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,935
So I couldn't do anything.

810
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,936
Of course.

811
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,528
Isn't that Min-ji?

812
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,330
Is she coming to get some iced water?

813
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,123
I guess she wants to talk.

814
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,292
You've come a long way.

815
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,086
It's so hard to get here.

816
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,838
-Sorry?
-Did you talk with him all right?

817
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:22,756
Yes.

818
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,508
My gosh, I'm exhausted.

819
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,176
Have a seat.

820
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,179
-Do you want some?
-Yes.

821
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,574
I can't believe
this is happening to Se-hoon.

822
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,201
-He must feel like he's dreaming.
-He must be so torn.

823
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,328
-I know. Can you believe this?
-Se-hoon…

824
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,706
Is it Se-hoon's birthday or what?

825
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,124
Seriously.

826
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,127
You were so cool at the game earlier.

827
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,753
-At the game?
-You really surprised me.

828
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,630
I knew you would win.

829
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,758
I could just feel it.
You know what I mean.

830
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,890
Can I ask you something?
What's your ideal type?

831
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:14,850
-Me?
-Yes.

832
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,562
Appearance-wise, I'm attracted
to women with beautiful smiles.

833
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,940
-Appearance-wise. Okay.
-Women who have nice smiles.

834
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,570
I get that a lot.

835
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,950
-She's so cute.
-She's so cute.

836
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,410
My gosh. She's so lovely.

837
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,164
I get that a lot.

838
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,878
I'm serious.

839
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,588
I'm not lying.

840
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,426
-You seem very positive.
-I do?

841
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,887
Do you like water?

842
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,974
Right. I heard you love water activities.

843
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,810
-I really love water.
-Really?

844
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:02,105
I was a swimmer when I was little,

845
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,732
so I love water.

846
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,777
So I really wanted to talk to you.
I love anything that has to do with water.

847
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,446
I love all water-related activities.

848
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,575
What's your favorite water activity?

849
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,535
I love freediving.

850
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,454
I haven't done that.
I've always wanted to try.

851
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,705
I also love wakesurfing.

852
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,916
I love that too. I really love it.

853
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,250
I love it so much.

854
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,544
-I finally met someone who likes it.
-I know.

855
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,964
I love swimming in hotel pools too.
Just so you know.

856
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,260
Was I being too straightforward?

857
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,472
-I thought so.
-You have really big eyes.

858
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,683
-I do?
-Yes.

859
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,102
-My eyes?
-Or is it your pupils?

860
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,979
Your eyes go like this when you smile.

861
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,527
Right.

862
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,904
I've never seen Yea-won smile so broadly.

863
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:52,656
-Me neither.
-Since coming to Inferno.

864
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,158
-She's so charming.
-She is.

865
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:02,249
Right. Are you saying
my eyes are big or small?

866
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,667
I'm saying your eyes are big.

867
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,671
Anyway…

868
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,423
You know what I heard?

869
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,340
What?

870
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,550
-Well…
-Yea-won.

871
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,510
-Yes?
-So-yeon says time's up.

872
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,137
-Your turn's over.
-Already?

873
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,013
No! I'm not done flirting with him.

874
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,684
See you later then.

875
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,521
-I'm next.
-Talk to you later.

876
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,023
-Should we talk here?
-Hey, take it easy.

877
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,525
-Take it easy?
-Take it easy.

878
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,526
She's telling me to…

879
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,655
-Can I just sit here?
-So funny.

880
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,614
Yes.

881
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,742
We're taking turns showing our charms.

882
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,579
All right, then. Have fun, you guys.

883
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,416
-He keeps looking at her.
-His eyes are fixed on her.

884
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,375
Oh, my.

885
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,797
I'm so happy I can finally

886
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,174
go to Paradise today.

887
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,178
What food do you miss the most?

888
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,347
-Bingsu.
-Bingsu?

889
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:00,849
-How about you?
-Bingsu?

890
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,143
-Because it's so hot.
-I could use a drink.

891
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,269
A drink?

892
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,940
-I've been saying that since yesterday.
-Right.

893
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,278
What food do you want to eat, Su-min?

894
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,571
-Food?
-Yes.

895
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,574
-Naengmyeon.
-What do you like? Naengmyeon.

896
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,035
Yes. Because it's cold. It's so hot here.

897
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,206
What about you?

898
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,250
Pork belly.

899
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,460
Pork belly.

900
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:32,214
Seriously. I really miss somaek too.

901
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,340
Somaek.

902
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:38,887
Seriously.

903
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,985
-It's too hot, right?
-Yes.

904
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,237
Shall we go down?

905
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,154
Let's go.

906
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,950
Talk to the people
you'd like to talk with.

907
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,953
Don't you want to talk to Se-hoon?

908
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,330
I've always thought that I should.

909
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:08,583
But I thought it'd be better
to talk with him after he comes back

910
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,751
-from Paradise.
-I see.

911
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,003
Because he must have
a lot on his mind right now.

912
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,255
-And if I--
-I get it.

913
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,589
-You know what I mean?
-I do.

914
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,883
-I don't want him to think
-He might get the wrong idea.

915
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,593
that I'm talking to him to go to Paradise.

916
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,178
So I'm just waiting for the right time.

917
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,180
I was thinking I should talk
to him at some point.

918
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,306
I see.

919
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,724
Take your time.

920
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,978
Right. I feel bad for him too.
I'm a human, after all.

921
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,367
Gosh, I'm really torn.

922
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,120
I feel like this might be

923
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,748
my first and last chance
to go to Paradise.

924
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,667
Paradise?

925
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:55,589
So I want to make the best out of it.

926
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,844
But I'm not sure what I should do…

927
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,847
to make the best out of it.

928
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,684
This is hard.

929
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,730
To be honest, I want to go there.

930
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:12,689
Let's go there then.

931
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,482
-Is it okay to go there?
-Yes, let's go.

932
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,652
Do you like the ocean and the sky?

933
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:21,573
Yes. I love the ocean
and the sky. I love nature.

934
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,038
Yea-won was really funny.

935
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,539
-Yea-won is the funniest.
-I see.

936
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,625
-She's funny.
-She's really pleasant.

937
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,001
She really is.

938
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,882
Seriously, I find her really charming.

939
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,133
Right.

940
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,469
I'm not sure
if I can put it this way, but…

941
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,513
How should I put it?

942
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,767
-Don't tell her, okay?
-Okay.

943
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,893
She's so…

944
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,899
She's so pretty and charming.

945
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,655
My first impression of her was…

946
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,781
-What is it?
-I mean,

947
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:06,326
before we even talked, she said this to me

948
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,912
when we were climbing the stairs.

949
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,622
"Hey, hurry up."

950
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,332
So I said, "Oh, okay."

951
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,668
Really?

952
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,378
I thought, "She's really something."

953
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,422
-"Hurry up."
-She's so charming.

954
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,430
It is now time
to decide who will go to Paradise.

955
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,933
Participants, please go
back to your lodgings.

956
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,309
I guess this is it.

957
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,940
I think you should just follow your heart.

958
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,199
That was really fun.

959
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,703
-He's so much more fun than Jun-sik.
-Really?

960
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,704
Yes.

961
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,290
Oh, my gosh.

962
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,917
Seriously.

963
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,627
-He's so charming.
-Right?

964
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,586
He's so charming.

965
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,715
How was it?

966
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,800
Does he talk all right?

967
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,385
Yes, he does.

968
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,722
-He was actually more fun than I thought.
-You think?

969
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:13,393
-I guess he's getting used to this place.
-I think he's interested in you.

970
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,477
Really?

971
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:20,191
I think I did nothing but laugh
when I was talking with Yea-won.

972
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,651
-She's fun.
-She's so funny.

973
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,862
-She's a little wacky.
-That's Yea-won's thing.

974
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:24,904
Yes. She's a bit wacky.

975
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,449
Seriously, she's so charming.

976
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,409
I wonder how chaotic it will be today.

977
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,955
Hyun-seung's choice
will be very important now.

978
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,458
-Anyway, he's the first to vote.
-Right.

979
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:39,461
-And he's obviously into Yea-won.
-Yes.

980
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:44,507
Hyeon-joong asked Hyun-seung earlier
if he was interested in anyone.

981
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:48,845
Then he said he would go for one person
unless something huge happens.

982
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,597
-I thought that person was Ji-a.
-Yes.

983
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,475
-But I feel like he's changed his mind.
-He has. He definitely has.

984
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,809
Because something huge happened.

985
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,561
Something huge happened.

986
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,189
And Se-hoon came in second place.

987
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,316
He must be one
of the most confused ones there.

988
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,360
He's trying hard to choose

989
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,071
the person he really likes.

990
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,281
The two new girls are
so different from each other.

991
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:13,328
One is a mature and healthy type

992
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,746
while the other is more of a feisty type.

993
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,706
-Right.
-She's a little sister type.

994
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,833
And I could see the difference clearly
when they were sitting together.

995
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:19,751
Yes.

996
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:25,090
Se-hoon is supposed to look very happy,

997
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,008
-I know.
-but he looks the opposite.

998
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,594
-He's torn.
-It means he has a lot on his mind.

999
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,810
At least you girls have a chance.

1000
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,478
-Some people don't have any…
-But…

1001
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,855
-I don't have a chance.
-We never know.

1002
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,858
-You flirted with him earlier.
-We never know.

1003
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,443
-We never know.
-It's not happening.

1004
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,779
-We all talked to him once.
-Can you believe that girl?

1005
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,988
-You're pretty today.
-Really?

1006
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,782
I thought the same.
You're like a celebrity.

1007
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,783
You looked so pretty.

1008
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,034
-Stop it.
-Seriously.

1009
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,662
I wonder who you'll take to Paradise.

1010
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,872
I'm still thinking.

1011
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:58,790
I see.

1012
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,629
Se-hoon, did you make up your mind?

1013
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:05,755
I'm still thinking.

1014
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,340
-Still? Among three?
-No, between two.

1015
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:08,299
Two?

1016
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,927
Gosh, this is painful.

1017
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,888
I'm going to think of a plan C.

1018
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,391
Just in case.

1019
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,517
-My gosh.
-Plan C?

1020
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,145
In case your plan B leaves you?

1021
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,063
Plan C?

1022
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,359
I thought Jin-taek was a loyal type,
but he's not like that at all.

1023
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,404
Come on. He's the third to go.

1024
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:36,786
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1025
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,373
The winners of the game
who earned tickets to Paradise,

1026
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,501
Hyun-seung, Se-hoon, and Jin-taek,

1027
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,336
may now come to the campfire.

1028
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,629
All together?

1029
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,131
-See you.
-Have fun.

1030
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,090
-Bye.
-You can do it.

1031
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,633
-See you tomorrow.
-You can do it.

1032
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,634
See you later.

1033
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,903
CHA HYUN-SEUNG

1034
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,405
MOON SE-HOON

1035
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,908
OH JIN-TAEK

1036
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:19,704
Hyun-seung, you're the winner of the game.

1037
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:24,042
Please choose the person you'd
like to go on a date with in Paradise.

1038
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,044
I choose…

1039
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,423
The person Cha Hyun-seung chose is…

1040
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,468
Are they just telling us like this?

1041
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,095
The person Cha Hyun-seung chose is…

1042
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,555
They're telling us right away.

1043
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,432
Ji-a.

1044
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,683
It's got to be Ji-a.

1045
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,269
-We never know.
-I think he'll choose her.

1046
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,230
-I'm 95 percent sure.
-I'm 100 percent sure.

1047
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,484
I choose…

1048
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,244
Who will it be?

1049
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:02,872
Yea-won?

1050
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,832
-Yea-won.
-Yea-won.

1051
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,501
I choose…

1052
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,296
Song Ji-a.

1053
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,048
What?

1054
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,384
Really?

1055
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,678
This is her third time going to Paradise.

1056
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,430
I choose Song Ji-a.

1057
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,185
…Song Ji-a.

1058
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,937
Ji-a, please come outside…

1059
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,730
-…Song Ji-a.
-My gosh.

1060
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,691
Ji-a, please come outside

1061
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:30,650
-and leave for Paradise
-Oh, my gosh.

1062
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,860
-with Hyun-seung.
-I'll see you girls later.

1063
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:33,903
Seriously?

1064
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,284
-I can't believe this.
-I got goosebumps.

1065
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:41,661
Oh, my gosh.

1066
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,122
What about Hyeon-joong?

1067
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,626
…Song Ji-a.

1068
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,587
-Ji-a, please come outside
-Told you.

1069
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,673
-I'm not surprised.
-and leave for Paradise with Hyun-seung.

1070
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,151
Shall we?

1071
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,450
Where do we go? I don't know the way.

1072
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,869
-Follow me.
-Okay.

1073
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,163
-You must be tired.
-Me?

1074
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,248
-You wrestled today.
-It's okay.

1075
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,383
You look calm. You're really strong.

1076
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,718
-Me?
-Yes.

1077
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,136
It doesn't feel great, of course.

1078
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:47,894
To be honest, I was worried.
Even I think he's cool,

1079
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,063
and he's a good friend of mine.

1080
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,648
So I was a little worried.

1081
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,986
Next up is the runner-up, Se-hoon.

1082
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,698
Please choose the person
you'd like to go on a date with

1083
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,991
in Paradise.

1084
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,621
I choose…

1085
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,124
-I can't wait to hear what he'll say.
-Me too.

1086
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,793
Me too.

1087
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,679
I think he might choose her.

1088
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,223
I don't think so. I can assure you.

1089
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,767
You never know.

1090
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,812
-I'm so curious.
-I think it'll be her.

1091
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,150
I choose…

1092
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,236
-Me? Okay.
-Yes.

1093
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,114
I hate video games.

1094
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,702
I don't even have any accounts.
I'll go learn what tier is and all.

1095
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:48,246
-Okay.
-Other guys should know it.

1096
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,958
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is Se-hoon.

1097
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,128
We were so different.
I want to find what we have in common

1098
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,630
and have a long conversation with him.

1099
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,515
-I feel like he'll choose Su-min.
-I hope she stays here tonight.

1100
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,101
-Why?
-I wanted to talk to her.

1101
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,480
We're simmering the rice.

1102
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,483
This is the egg soup we're making,
and that's pajeon.

1103
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,654
I feel bad.

1104
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,489
I chose you.

1105
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,699
-Me?
-Yes.

1106
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,200
I really appreciated it.

1107
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,910
I almost cried.

1108
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,164
I don't know if he'll choose me.

1109
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,207
But whoever he chooses,

1110
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,959
it's his choice.

1111
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,170
I'm worried and excited at the same time.

1112
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,217
I'm torn…

1113
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,429
between two people.

1114
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,023
Who do I want to go to Paradise with?

1115
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,650
I've made up my mind.

1116
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,989
I choose…

1117
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,246
I choose…

1118
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,126
Shin Ji-yeon.

1119
01:03:56,457 --> 01:04:01,462
