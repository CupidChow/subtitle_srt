Today is the last day to go on free dates
before the final decision tomorrow.

16
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:08,193
Please enjoy your date until the end
so that you won't regret it.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,945
Excuse me.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,906
See you.

19
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,908
Go tell her.

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,913
-Jin-young left first.
-I see.

21
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:20,830
He was a step ahead.

22
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,875
Jong-woo came out right after.

23
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,169
Jin-young went to talk to her?

24
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,379
-Yes, Jin-young went to talk to her.
-Okay.

25
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,340
-So after…
-I should wait then.

26
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,719
I'm also going to talk to her briefly.

27
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,181
Well, you spent
a lot of time with her, so…

28
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,349
-Right.
-Yes.

29
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,767
We were together the whole time.

30
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,101
Dong-woo too?

31
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,271
-"You spent a lot of time with her."
-You hear them?

32
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,565
Dong-woo also has eyes only for Seul-ki.

33
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,068
She puts on makeup like this.

34
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,987
Who are you looking for?

35
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,906
Over there.

36
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,449
In the dressing room.

37
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,712
I'll go meet him
when they're done talking.

38
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,924
-Why didn't you ask him first?
-Is this…

39
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,929
But the expression on his face looked so…

40
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,015
It's okay.

41
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,350
-It's a fly.
-Is it?

42
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,102
-Right?
-It's okay.

43
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,610
I'm doing my hair.

44
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,903
That was natural.

45
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,780
-Anytime.
-Seul-ki?

46
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,907
-Yes?
-Yes, thank you.

47
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,534
Yes.

48
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,536
You're going out, right?

49
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,331
I'll be back. Wait just a second.

50
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,131
-Did you find her?
-I did.

51
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,551
-Jong-woo, I'm in a hurry today, so…
-Yes. Got it.

52
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,094
-Let me talk to her first.
-Okay.

53
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,053
We…

54
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,306
-I feel a little anxious now.
-I see.

55
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,390
We're in line.

56
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,850
I see. You're in line?

57
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,560
-Yes.
-Dong-woo, you too?

58
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,645
-I joined too.
-You guys, don't fight.

59
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,939
-You go ahead.
-Does it matter who goes first?

60
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,359
I won't take long. Not too long.

61
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,743
Let's go get water today, Seul-ki.

62
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,870
Okay. I'm good at that.

63
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,496
Lead the way to the water.

64
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,207
-I don't know how to get there.
-Follow me.

65
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,085
-Okay.
-You went to Paradise four times,

66
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,796
so you don't know how things work here.

67
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,883
Inferno kind of feels
like Paradise for me now.

68
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,344
Inferno's really amazing.

69
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,305
These two have good chemistry as well.

70
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,264
Yes.

71
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,852
How was it yesterday?

72
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,062
-Yesterday?
-Yes.

73
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,606
-Yesterday--
-I heard it was a lot of fun.

74
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,650
-Nadine said she had a lot of fun?
-Yes.

75
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,154
Well, you're supposed to have fun there.

76
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,739
You can't be depressed, right?

77
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,579
Why does it feel like it's been so long
since we went to Paradise?

78
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,958
Jin-young, don't you think
you're too busy?

79
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,585
But, Seul-ki,
you're always going places too.

80
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,215
You and Jong-woo
seemed to be having a great time, no?

81
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,595
-This is nice.
-It's nice we're all back.

82
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,763
Let's have fun.

83
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,141
-Talking one-on-one is too much for me.
-Even with me?

84
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,268
-You?
-Yes.

85
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,895
-Do you want to talk one-on-one?
-No. Let's stop.

86
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,190
-Jong-woo, you've changed.
-Right.

87
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,025
-He's changed.
-After going to Paradise.

88
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,151
You punk.

89
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,611
-No, I learned a lot.
-For sure.

90
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,154
-This guy…
-He's relaxed.

91
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,155
-Not really.
-Yes.

92
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,366
I can't relax just yet.

93
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,951
-Relaxed.
-There are many hyenas.

94
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,744
Where's Seul-ki right now?

95
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,997
Seul-ki went to talk with Jin-young

96
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,417
and to get water.
He said he's never done it before.

97
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,796
Go stand over there.
I'll take one of you next to the ocean.

98
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,755
Okay.

99
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,719
That's nice. Really nice.

100
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,890
Three, two, one.

101
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,104
I feel awkward. Why is taking pictures so…

102
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,898
-Let's take one together.
-Okay.

103
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,943
First with the water in the background.

104
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,113
Three, two, one.

105
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,410
What is this?

106
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,203
-That's a nice picture.
-Is it?

107
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,790
I think it's full now.

108
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,043
-It's full, right?
-Yes.

109
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,713
Is it heavy? It is, right?

110
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,007
No, I don't care if it's heavy, but…

111
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,926
-Can you carry this alone?
-I got this.

112
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,221
The guys couldn't carry it
by themselves, so I had to help.

113
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,307
I'm different, okay?

114
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,142
I'm different, Seul-ki.

115
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,394
-Lead the way.
-Let's go.

116
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,525
This is nice.

117
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,653
I'll take one of you.

118
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,740
Why would you
take a picture of me like this?

119
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,578
How did it come out?

120
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,455
-You look really good.
-Really?

121
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,666
Jin-young, you're good-looking.

122
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,294
Good-looking…

123
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,047
Hurry up, Seul-ki.

124
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,515
Jin-young keeps going to Seul-ki.

125
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,850
What are you going to do?

126
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,979
Well, I'm going to keep doing
what I've been doing so far.

127
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,022
I see.

128
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,108
I'm still very anxious.

129
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,570
Because even though it was very nice
when we went to Paradise,

130
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,531
it could have been nice only for me.

131
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,283
She might not have felt that way.

132
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:54,664
But Seul-ki appeared to have enjoyed it.

133
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,166
My heart fluttered
for the first time in a while.

134
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,084
Really?

135
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,879
-Yes, my heart was pounding.
-I'm jealous.

136
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,674
-I couldn't look her in the eye.
-Good for you, though.

137
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,218
I'm glad you were able to feel that way.

138
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,388
What's taking them so long?
They're going to talk all day?

139
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,390
I think they're going to talk all day.

140
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,981
I don't think I'll be able
to figure out how Jin-young feels.

141
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,818
I went with him yesterday,
but I'm not sure.

142
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,531
It would be nice if Jin-young and I
could just switch places, right?

143
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,200
-Since you want to talk to Jin-young more.
-Yes.

144
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,953
Gosh, this is nice.

145
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:50,386
Whenever we try to talk, we have
a hard time starting a conversation.

146
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,805
-Right?
-Yes.

147
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,640
I wonder why that is.

148
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,354
Did I tell you?

149
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,650
-About the pit battle. Did I tell you?
-What?

150
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,736
That you looked really cool.

151
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,906
-No.
-Did I tell you?

152
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,159
You said I looked cool,
but you didn't say I looked really cool.

153
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,913
I guess I did.

154
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,873
But you just said I looked cool.

155
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,875
-I shouldn't have.
-You should've kept going.

156
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,543
You're very proud now.

157
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,962
-Gosh, no. I'm…
-No, I'm going to stop talking.

158
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,507
I'm not like that. I'm a humble person.

159
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,386
But you really did look cool. Wait.

160
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,514
-I looked cool?
-No.

161
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,355
-See? Seul-ki's heart is with Jin-young.
-Let's stop watching this.

162
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,066
She's only awkward when she's with him.

163
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,025
-Yes.
-Right.

164
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,153
What happened to the confident Seul-ki?

165
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,197
Who'd you cheer for?

166
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,409
Can I be honest?

167
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,702
Be honest.

168
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,622
-Be honest.
-Honestly,

169
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,334
at the time, I hoped Jong-woo would win.

170
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,128
But the thing is…

171
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,425
I think my eyes were on you…

172
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,263
the whole time.

173
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,070
I was watching
you do Korean wrestling too.

174
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,491
Gosh, I wonder how funny I looked.

175
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,909
Who did you cheer for?

176
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,286
-Me?
-Yes.

177
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,913
I cheered for you.

178
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,672
What did you say is most important
in a potential romantic partner?

179
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,841
-Me?
-Yes.

180
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,261
Someone with a pretty smile?

181
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,305
-Yes.
-Someone who smiles with his eyes?

182
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,764
-Yes.
-Right.

183
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,101
What about personality?
What did you say about that?

184
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,645
Someone like you?

185
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,069
It's over.

186
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,864
Who else is like Jin-young on the inside?

187
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,993
-Right?
-She's just saying she likes him.

188
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,412
It sounds
like her final confession to him.

189
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,541
Someone like you?

190
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,464
Someone like me? What kind of person am I?

191
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,345
-What?
-Kind of…

192
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,350
Like, someone who's on my mind?

193
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:01,827
Talking about you and Jong-woo…
Even though I like Jong-woo a lot,

194
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,206
I kind of hated seeing you with Jong-woo.

195
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:07,833
I'm being honest.

196
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:13,673
When we went to Paradise yesterday,
I had to wait because I came in third.

197
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,050
I didn't want to look at you two.

198
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,139
So how do you feel?

199
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,267
Have you figured things out?

200
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,648
Yes.

201
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,403
Have you decided?

202
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,239
Me? No, I haven't yet.

203
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,699
I don't think…

204
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,911
…it's over yet,

205
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,288
I'll have to see how things go.

206
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,708
-I see.
-Yes.

207
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,715
-Seriously?
-Gosh, until the very end.

208
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,844
He has her wrapped around his finger.

209
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,387
He's the best I've ever seen.

210
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,390
-He keeps staying out of her reach.
-Seriously.

211
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,308
When she tries to reach out to him…

212
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,104
-I see.
-Yes.

213
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,857
I'm also worried about some things.

214
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,816
Right.

215
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,153
Like what?

216
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,949
Honestly, I don't think my job is…

217
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:27,121
I don't think I've settled down
after being discharged,

218
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,375
which is why I thought
that I wanted to meet someone

219
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:36,464
who had a stable life before coming here.

220
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,133
Because I'm busy

221
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,845
taking care of myself right now.

222
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,518
If it comes down to having
to care for myself and my girlfriend,

223
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,353
I don't think I'll be able to do it well.

224
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,273
I'm only human.

225
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:00,154
I think I wanted to be with someone

226
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:05,117
whom I simply like
and to whom my heart leans toward.

227
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,828
Which is why my mind
is all over the place right now.

228
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:20,007
If you think about it too much,
you could become even more conflicted.

229
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,636
Just do your best and trust your feelings.

230
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:31,936
I came here hoping to meet someone
I could really connect with.

231
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,358
That's why I have a lot on my mind.

232
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,320
KIM JIN-YOUNG

233
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,615
The aspect I was concerned about
was her occupation.

234
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,367
She's still a student.

235
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:52,081
She probably has a long way ahead of her,
probably has many things she wants to do.

236
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:58,295
I thought I might not be able
to be by her side during those times,

237
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,838
so I'm conflicted about that.

238
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:07,429
-Both Seul-ki and Nadine are students.
-Right.

239
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,141
So it's possible that he thinks

240
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,520
they might not have
enough time for each other.

241
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:18,649
I think there were many reasons
why he had those thoughts.

242
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,359
But Jin-young is saying…

243
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,318
It feels like

244
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,446
-he's here to find a marriage partner.
-Exactly.

245
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,783
It's just dating,
but he's taking this really seriously.

246
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,872
It feels like he's taking the future
into consideration when meeting someone.

247
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,708
In a way, he might be thinking ahead,

248
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,918
-in terms of the future.
-Because he's not stable.

249
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,670
-About himself.
-He seems worried

250
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:44,049
that if his girlfriend wants
to lean on him or get support,

251
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,594
he won't be able to do that for her.

252
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,971
-He's getting ahead of himself.
-You're right.

253
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,683
From Seul-ki's perspective,
she's like, "What is he talking about?"

254
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,768
I think it might be difficult for her.

255
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,480
From where Seul-ki stands,
she could take it as a sign of rejection.

256
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,067
I have this hope that
maybe Seul-ki will choose Jong-woo…

257
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,904
-I mean…
-Are we not letting go of that hope?

258
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,864
-But Jin-young…
-She could.

259
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,993
…wasn't conflicted about who to choose.

260
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,371
He was concerned
about possible future issues with Seul-ki.

261
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,581
But she could've thought…

262
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,540
Yes?

263
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,418
…he was conflicted about whom to choose.

264
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:23,505
But what's for sure is that
Seul-ki is completely different

265
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,716
when she's with Jin-young compared to when

266
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,968
she's with Jong-woo,
Dong-woo, or anyone else.

267
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,346
-Right.
-I think she's totally different.

268
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,014
-I can feel she's in love.
-Right.

269
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:32,973
Right.

270
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,066
It feels like time goes by
the slowest when I'm waiting.

271
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,278
We should relax.

272
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,532
It's difficult to watch them and relax.

273
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,495
Try watching them
once every five or ten minutes.

274
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,623
Well, we'll be able to see them come down.

275
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,000
I can see people coming over here,

276
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,128
so I'll make sure that
we'll be able to get to them first.

277
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,925
-These two are also waiting for them?
-Right.

278
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,843
-Yes.
-There are two teams waiting?

279
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,054
-Yes.
-There's a waiting list.

280
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,475
There's something
I'm upset with you about.

281
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,978
Are you upset with me all of a sudden?

282
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,604
-Yes.
-Why?

283
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,356
-I mean…
-Yes?

284
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,191
It's nothing.

285
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,945
-What? Finish what you were saying…
-Just know there's something.

286
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,698
They're walking down.

287
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,658
Let's go, then.

288
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,909
-Go now?
-Yes.

289
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,999
Why won't you tell me?

290
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,460
Why are you making me feel uncomfortable?

291
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,837
-Why?
-It's just…

292
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,548
You're such a tease, Seul-ki.

293
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,675
You're the tease, Jin-young.

294
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,721
Seul-ki, you're really good
at confusing people and their feelings.

295
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,183
-What are you doing here?
-Why are you walking so slowly?

296
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,978
What are they doing together?

297
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,690
-Let's just wait here.
-Okay.

298
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,316
-Stop walking.
-Okay.

299
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,277
-"Stop walking"? That's funny.
-Yes.

300
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,114
Stop walking. Let's just relax.

301
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,116
It's already funny.

302
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,162
You walk so slowly.
I thought you were a turtle.

303
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:23,250
-Why don't we switch up partners?
-Okay.

304
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,878
Hey, they left.

305
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,047
-Where?
-They're not in their seats.

306
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,007
-Dong-woo.
-Dong-woo.

307
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,175
Dong-woo and Seul-ki.

308
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,428
-No, it's not.
-It's Min-su and Jin-young.

309
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,346
They got intercepted.

310
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,850
It's like when you're waiting for a taxi,

311
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,313
but someone in front of you
gets in first and leaves.

312
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,775
-It's the same feeling.
-Like when you're waiting…

313
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,361
Then you go, "We should've
gone further down the street."

314
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,073
Or, "We should've stood in front of them."

315
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,539
Oh, gosh. Seul-ki must be tired.

316
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,500
So much talking.

317
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,794
Oh, dear.

318
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,090
Missed you after spending
two nights together, then being away.

319
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,341
Really?

320
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,759
-Seriously?
-Yes.

321
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,845
You're coming on strong
all of a sudden, Min-su.

322
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,680
-Min-su.
-What?

323
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,349
What was that?

324
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,102
I was taken off guard just now.
What was that?

325
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,020
I'm so shocked right now.

326
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,273
Have a seat.

327
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,276
I think I've seen this somewhere.

328
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,280
There's ice in there.

329
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,618
Okay, Seul-ki.
Let's just talk comfortably.

330
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,953
All right.

331
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,752
How are you?
Did you have a good time in Paradise?

332
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,881
Yes. I had a good time in Paradise.
I talked with Jong-woo, and it was fun.

333
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,300
I'm curious to know what you did.

334
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,013
How was it for you?

335
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,975
-Has it been nine days? Eight days?
-Yes.

336
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,853
Do you think time went quickly or slowly?

337
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,231
It just feels like a blur.

338
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,901
The last time we went to Paradise
is a blur because it feels long ago.

339
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,865
Now that I think about it,
it feels like time flew by.

340
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,242
Right, at first I thought

341
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:25,038
time was going by too slowly,
but it's already our last night here.

342
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,794
Well, I think that I'm going to stick

343
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:36,300
to the path I chose in the beginning
when we first came here.

344
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,970
I'm not sure if you'll choose me,

345
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,890
but I'll respect your decision.

346
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:49,730
I want you to always be happy,
and I hope everything works out well.

347
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,402
I feel the same way.

348
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,074
Dong-woo also
only has eyes for one person.

349
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,534
Dong-woo…

350
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,955
-He's a doctor, good-looking, fit…
-He's not the type to get rejected.

351
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,874
Women would be lining up for him.

352
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,169
But look how he is here.
Look at how dejected he is.

353
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,964
I don't know if you remember,
but Dong-woo couldn't believe it

354
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,425
when Seul-ki didn't show
any interest in him.

355
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,551
-Right.
-His face…

356
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,428
-Right.
-I remember. It got progressively…

357
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,930
-"What's this?"
-"What's going on?"

358
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,097
-"What's happening?"
-Yes.

359
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,392
This island is a place
that makes people humble.

360
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,561
He's going to leave feeling very humbled.

361
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,146
-And reflect on himself.
-Yes.

362
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,276
So did you have fun yesterday?
Did you talk a lot with other people?

363
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,528
Yes, I talked a lot with other people.

364
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:44,993
Yesterday, I had a lot on my mind,
so I was in the lodge,

365
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,329
but I kept thinking about you then too.

366
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,791
-Really?
-It hasn't been easy for me.

367
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,543
-I see.
-It just made me realize that

368
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,295
-we had a good time.
-Right.

369
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,421
-We did.
-Yes.

370
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:03,720
Since that day, I'd been worried
about things being weird between us.

371
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,765
"Will I be able to talk
to you comfortably until we leave?"

372
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,392
-I thought about that.
-Right.

373
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,397
No matter what happens,
I had a lot of great experiences here.

374
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,523
-Right.
-And I…

375
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,442
And I really enjoyed
the time I spent with you.

376
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,319
I'm so thankful for that.

377
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:24,700
And I think the reason why I didn't
feel uncomfortable when I got here

378
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,952
-is also thanks to you.
-Really?

379
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,537
So thank you for that.

380
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,082
I just wanted to tell you that.

381
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,004
-I'm so thankful. It's been nice.
-It's been nice for me too.

382
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,054
Nadine.

383
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,557
-Seo-eun.
-Dinner.

384
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,434
I'm so torn right now.

385
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,611
I don't know what to do.

386
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:07,367
Jin-young went to Seul-ki first this time.

387
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,203
And now Min-su went to Jin-young.

388
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,747
Then I'm going to go.

389
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,502
It's so complicated,
and Min-su really likes Jin-young.

390
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,921
Min-su is 100% Jin-young.

391
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,256
I think so too.

392
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,634
I think Min-su
just had a mental breakdown.

393
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,557
I didn't know it was that bad.

394
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,893
So I…

395
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,020
I don't know.

396
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,274
I don't know.

397
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:45,947
It really won't be easy for Nadine
to go to Jin-young in that situation.

398
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,992
Nadine has made a lot of courageous moves,

399
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,119
-but she's not used to it.
-Right.

400
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,997
Nadine wants things to be natural…

401
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,458
-Right.
-…'cause she's not good at those things.

402
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,503
But she has to fight and be courageous,
that makes it hard for her.

403
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,254
-Yes.
-Right.

404
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,134
-Hi.
-Where are you going?

405
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,636
I was on my way to you.

406
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,595
Is that so?

407
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,640
Yes. Would you like to have a chat?

408
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,974
Shall we?

409
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,644
-Let's go to the beach.
-Okay. The beach sounds good.

410
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,939
What'd you do yesterday?
It must've been fun.

411
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:19,856
Yesterday?

412
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,566
Did you eat a lot?

413
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,361
I had hangover soup for breakfast.

414
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,196
You heard we had chicken yesterday?

415
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,197
-Yes.
-Raw chicken.

416
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:32,244
-I was so shocked.
-I heard you prepared everything so well.

417
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,287
Yes, and the sauce
Se-jeong made was amazing.

418
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,498
Se-jeong's cooking skills
have improved so much.

419
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,918
Right? That's why I feel
slightly threatened by her.

420
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,630
-I'm a little anxious.
-Stay on your toes.

421
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,840
-Mr. Chef.
-The last day.

422
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,883
Wait. You know, right?

423
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,511
-Of course. Why are you trying to hide it?
-I was so close.

424
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,055
Why do you feel awkward
around me all of a sudden?

425
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,391
-I was hiding it from everyone.
-What?

426
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,643
Aren't you taking it
a little too seriously?

427
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,736
It's complicated.

428
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,698
It's complicated.

429
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,000
All through life,

430
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,421
I thought of myself
as an unemotional person.

431
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,258
But thanks to you, Seo-eun,

432
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,761
I realized that I do have emotions.

433
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,476
I want you to be happy.
That's how I feel right now.

434
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,899
All I felt was just that
I wanted you to be happy.

435
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,819
That's all. I don't know how
to describe this feeling exactly, but…

436
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:52,991
I didn't really try to do anything.
I just cheered for you.

437
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,119
I think this was my way
of dealing with things.

438
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,497
So it was really nice.
I made great memories.

439
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,174
It's our last day.
How did you feel about everything?

440
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,928
Do you think you had a meaningful time?

441
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,099
I had a lot of fun, thanks to you.

442
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,352
-That's good.
-I was happy

443
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,688
and thankful
and just grateful for everything.

444
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,441
That's all I feel and…

445
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,279
Then that's enough.

446
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,576
Just that.

447
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,746
I'm grateful you think about me like that.

448
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,676
-Why is love such a big deal?
-Right?

449
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,847
I think Min-su's tears
are from having to let go.

450
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,931
I think so too.

451
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:26,394
I think Han-bin's smile means
"I understand. I respect your decision."

452
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,898
-A smile that shows that he understands.
-Han-bin's such a great guy.

453
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:30,940
-Yes.
-Right?

454
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,109
The way he expressed his feelings for her

455
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,988
in an honest way
without pressuring her was just…

456
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,499
I just got used to this place,
but now we have to leave.

457
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,834
-It's the last night.
-It really is.

458
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,503
It's really over.

459
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,004
I know.

460
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,968
It's soda today. They gave us soda.

461
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,015
-Should I sit here?
-Yes.

462
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,611
-It's the last night.
-It's the last night.

463
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,321
-Let's have fun.
-It's so sad, though.

464
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,739
-Cheers, all.
-The last night.

465
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,865
-Cheers, you guys.
-Okay.

466
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,034
-Let's say cheers.
-Cheers.

467
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,160
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

468
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,079
-It's been great, guys.
-Cheers.

469
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,128
This isn't real.

470
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,255
Really feels like it's coming to an end.

471
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,257
Only a few hours left.

472
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,469
I can't believe it's over already.

473
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,765
-No, no. It's okay.
-I just feel so sad.

474
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,352
It's our last day here.

475
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,773
When else can we reveal our jobs and age?

476
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,526
I'm really curious.

477
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,194
I'm excited.

478
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,738
Nobody knows about you.

479
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,157
Yes, I'm a mysterious woman.

480
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,201
I'm 26 years old,

481
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,914
and I'm currently working
as a model for an agency.

482
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,211
I'm a model.

483
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,882
I'm currently working
as a commercial model.

484
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:24,095
I've been in Sony and BMW ads.

485
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,099
I started working as a model

486
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,227
because I like clothes
and taking pictures,

487
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,271
so this line of work came naturally.

488
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:37,984
PARK SE-JEONG
26, MODEL

489
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,492
I'll tell you how old I am.

490
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,619
I'm so curious about this.

491
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,122
I'm 32 years old.

492
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,585
No wonder
he gave off an older brother vibe.

493
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,711
I get it now.

494
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,421
-No wonder.
-You're 32?

495
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,174
And I'm a plastic surgeon.

496
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,802
-Wait, what?
-That's insane!

497
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,220
I knew he was a doctor.

498
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,433
No wonder he tried not to get hurt
when we played games.

499
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,185
-He's a doctor.
-I was going easy on you.

500
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,479
-I was worried you'd get hurt.
-But you can treat us.

501
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,314
-Going easy on you.
-"You can treat us."

502
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,817
This is so much fun.

503
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,859
During the game…

504
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,402
-That's cool.
-That's amazing.

505
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,404
-It's my turn now.
-Yes.

506
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,408
-I'm really curious.
-Your age first.

507
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,161
-I am--
-You're 29.

508
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,038
-I think you're 25.
-You think I'm 25 or 29?

509
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,748
I'm 24 years old.

510
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,837
-He's younger than you.
-You're 24?

511
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,505
-Wait. Sorry.
-You're 24?

512
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,799
Wait. You're eight years younger than me?

513
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:43,883
Yes, you're older.

514
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,718
She's in shock.

515
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,678
Are you okay?

516
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,513
-Your jaw's about to drop.
-This is…

517
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,973
-Really?
-Oh, my God.

518
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,015
Yes.

519
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,395
-Your face is pale.
-What's wrong, Jong-woo?

520
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,772
I treated Han-bin like an older brother.

521
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,482
-Really?
-Yes.

522
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,193
-Jong-woo thought he was the youngest.
-Really?

523
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,404
My apologies.

524
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,447
-So I'm older?
-He's younger than you, Jong-woo.

525
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,366
It still feels like you're older than me.

526
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,952
-It still seems that way.
-Jong-woo's shocked.

527
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:11,995
He's shocked.

528
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,872
There's a lot to learn
from someone younger.

529
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,998
Bridge the generation gap.

530
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,126
-How old are you, Yoong-jae?
-How old are you, Yoong-jae?

531
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,752
I'm…

532
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,753
Are you 28?

533
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,338
I'm really curious.

534
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,965
-I think he's young.
-I'm so curious.

535
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,800
-He's in his twenties.
-So curious.

536
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,094
-I'm curious.
-I'm really curious.

537
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,888
-He's in his twenties.
-So curious.

538
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,347
I'm 32.

539
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,182
-What?
-What?

540
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,225
I'm 32.

541
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,435
-What?
-What?

542
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,770
-Really?
-He's the same age as Dong-woo.

543
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,065
-You're 32?
-That's insane.

544
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,776
-Gosh.
-This was unexpected in a different way.

545
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,194
I'm currently working

546
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,781
as a stockbroker
at a securities firm in Yeouido.

547
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,116
-Gosh!
-I got it right!

548
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,911
We got it right, though.

549
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,787
-Nadine.
-Nadine.

550
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,456
-Nadine.
-Nadine.

551
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,416
I wonder how old you are.

552
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,461
-I'm 23 years old.
-What?

553
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:02,962
-Baby.
-Born in 2000.

554
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,005
-Born in 2000.
-Right.

555
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,465
-She's a baby.
-We're the same age.

556
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,507
"The same age"?

557
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,595
I'm currently
a university student in the US.

558
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,596
-I see.
-Yes.

559
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,639
What university?

560
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,265
-Is it okay to say it?
-Tell us.

561
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:18,269
-I study at Harvard University.
-Harvard?

562
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,438
-Harvard?
-Gosh.

563
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,400
Nadine, I'm sorry
for treating you disrespectfully.

564
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,611
I didn't know you were
that kind of person.

565
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:31,074
In the future, when we leave here,
please don't think of me in a bad way.

566
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,492
No worries. I won't.

567
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,869
My apologies.

568
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:35,787
Unbelievable.

569
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,373
He was so shocked.

570
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,333
I like Se-jun's personality.

571
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,542
-Yes.
-He's funny.

572
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,962
Can I ask a question to Yoong-jae?

573
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,466
Who did you pick
for the best-first-impression vote?

574
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,218
We can talk about it now.

575
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,556
For the best-first-impression vote,
I picked Se-jeong.

576
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,183
-Yes.
-I see.

577
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,143
I sat right next to her,

578
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,982
so I voted for one of the people
I talked to at the time.

579
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:05,942
I see.

580
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,945
If we can talk about this,
should we take turns?

581
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,990
-What were your thoughts, Jin-young?
-Your first impression.

582
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,784
Well, for me…

583
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,795
I chose Seul-ki.
She was the closest to my ideal type.

584
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,046
-I see.
-I see.

585
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,256
Straight to the point.

586
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,055
Jong-woo.

587
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,599
I picked Seul-ki.

588
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,767
-I see.
-I see.

589
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,728
Ever since we made our entrance.

590
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,271
He's true to his heart.

591
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,692
So that's why I chose her.

592
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:53,781
I think Seul-ki will be one of the stars
tomorrow, so I'll ask her.

593
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,329
Have you decided on your choice
for tomorrow?

594
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,303
Yes.

595
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,929
I see.

596
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,692
I've a question for Jin-young.

597
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,239
During the pit battle…

598
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,995
Remember how you and I fought one-on-one?

599
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,538
At the time…

600
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,377
were you playing the game
for the same reason as me?

601
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,343
I just want to know what you have to say.

602
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,193
Definitely.

603
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,571
Definitely?

604
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,086
This is intense.

605
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,965
But we don't have to say that
because we felt it

606
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,467
-when we fought each other.
-Yes.

607
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,138
We communicated
with each other with our heads.

608
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,728
I'll ask Seul-ki a question as well.

609
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,779
Did you like Paradise
when you went with me,

610
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,198
or did you like it
when you went with Jong-woo?

611
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,408
That's savage.

612
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,618
Oh, my!

613
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,245
-This is brutal.
-Gosh.

614
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,831
-My gosh.
-What is this?

615
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,877
-They started out having fun, but now…
-I know.

616
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,298
It's getting hot here.

617
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,858
Sorry, but I'm going to have to
pass on this.

618
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,694
-Right.
-Let me keep this to myself.

619
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,374
As the oldest of the girls,
I'd like to say…

620
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,419
-Seo-eun.
-…it was so nice being here with you all.

621
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,256
I don't think I'll ever forget
the time we had here.

622
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,845
I'm very grateful to have been able
to spend our days here in our prime,

623
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,597
and I hope we'll keep in touch.

624
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,849
Me too.

625
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:15,066
Well, our time here together was too short
to get to know each other well.

626
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,360
We've all lived separate lives.

627
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,655
So I hope that even
after we leave this place,

628
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,532
we'll get to know each other more

629
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,620
and develop our relationships.

630
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,247
Thanks for everything, guys.

631
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:38,756
I'm still young
and don't have a lot of dating experience.

632
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:45,888
But I think I learned how
to express my feelings more honestly.

633
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,099
So I think…

634
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,269
I think it was a really nice experience.

635
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,610
Well, for me,

636
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:07,410
I didn't really
feel excited in everyday life.

637
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:14,667
But it was good to feel the emotions
that were hidden deep down inside me.

638
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,420
And I'm not good at expressing myself,

639
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:23,384
but I really felt like
I got to be honest with how I felt.

640
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,719
So…

641
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,099
I'm very…

642
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,315
I'm so thankful and just…

643
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,153
Jong-woo.

644
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,739
-Jong-woo, are you crying?
-Are you crying?

645
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,991
Are you crying?

646
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,617
-Don't cry.
-It's okay.

647
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,166
It's okay.

648
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,870
Why do I feel so sad when a man cries?

649
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,413
I understand how Jong-woo feels.

650
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,664
-It's sad.
-It is sad.

651
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,084
I feel so sad.

652
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,961
There's something about Jong-woo
that makes you

653
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,590
-cry with him.
-Right. Jong-woo is young,

654
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,259
and it seems like
he's experiencing pure love.

655
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,053
-I get what you mean.
-Right.

656
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,722
-And I think Seul-ki feels that too.
-Yes.

657
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,016
What's amazing is that Jin-young

658
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,311
asked who she liked being
in Paradise with better.

659
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,522
And Seul-ki passed on the question.

660
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,441
To me, her refusing to answer

661
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:06,570
-means it was Jin-young.
-Yes, that's right.

662
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,614
-She was being considerate of Jong-woo.
-Yes.

663
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,033
-She was being considerate of Jong-woo?
-Yes.

664
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,119
Gosh, why is this so sad?

665
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,397
The hottest inferno in the world,
Single's Inferno.

666
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,357
Today is the last day.

667
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,279
You will now make your final decision.

668
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,200
LIM MIN-SU

669
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,327
The women are already waiting

670
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,872
for the men
at the final decision locations.

671
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,457
LEE NADINE

672
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,045
SHIN SEUL-KI

673
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,381
LEE SO-E

674
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,928
PARK SE-JEONG

675
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,849
CHOI SEO-EUN

676
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:09,151
Gentlemen, please go to the location
where the woman you've chosen is waiting.

677
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,614
Ladies, if the man who approaches you

678
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,785
is the same man whom you've chosen,
then you two will become a couple.

679
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,125
I think certain people
will get multiple votes.

680
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,753
-Seul-ki will get three votes.
-Yes.

681
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,548
Jong-woo, Dong-woo,
and Jin-young will go to her.

682
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:34,218
-Yes.
-And then Jin-young will get many votes.

683
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,261
Yes.

684
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:39,557
Seul-ki, Nadine, Min-su, and Se-jeong.

685
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,935
They'll probably get many votes,
we don't know what will happen.

686
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:48,440
Hanhae, do you think Seul-ki
and Jin-young will end up together? Or…

687
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,234
It'll be Jin-young.

688
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,569
-I see.
-Yes.

689
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,279
-She's following her heart.
-Yes.

690
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,072
We're all thinking the same thing.

691
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,866
-I think it will be Seul-ki and Jong-woo.
-Really?

692
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,035
-You still haven't let go of that hope.
-I mean…

693
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,036
Still?

694
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,747
-It could be possible.
-You won't change your mind.

695
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,334
-What about Se-jun and So-e?
-Right.

696
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,503
I think they'll become a couple.

697
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:14,508
I'm not sure if she just feels grateful
or if she's romantically attracted to him.

698
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,343
-She'll say, "I'm sorry."
-Right.

699
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,513
-I'm really curious.
-I think some people got multiple votes.

700
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,480
Han-bin, please go first.

701
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,358
-See you.
-See you later.

702
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,874
Han-bin will go to Seo-eun?

703
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,875
-Right. Seo-eun.
-Okay.

704
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,252
-He told her how he felt the day before.
-Yes.

705
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,421
So-e!

706
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,008
You really are…

707
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,096
the most important person
to me on Single's Inferno.

708
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,598
Thanks. I feel the same about you.

709
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,017
-You got this.
-Okay.

710
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,774
I wanted the person
whom I like to just be happy

711
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,610
and not be stressed about anything,
so I didn't approach her.

712
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:20,532
But since this is the end, I think it'd
be okay for me to go with my decision.

713
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,497
You're wearing blue.

714
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,458
Blue is my favorite color.

715
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,460
-Aren't you cold?
-You're wearing blue.

716
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,670
-No.
-Are you okay?

717
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,171
-Yes. I'm fine.
-Really?

718
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,507
That looks good on you.

719
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,638
The weather's amazing.

720
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,722
It is.

721
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,104
Jong-woo, please make your way.

722
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,190
See you later.

723
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,161
Jong-woo has a long way to go.

724
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:07,996
Right.

725
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:22,219
I've had feelings
for her since the beginning.

726
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:29,893
Hello.

727
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,274
-Are you nervous?
-Yes, I'm very nervous.

728
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:46,702
Being on Inferno with Seul-ki
really felt like Paradise.

729
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,829
Let's take one together.

730
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,164
-How?
-In selfie-mode.

731
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,708
Three, two, one.

732
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,547
Yun Seul-ki.

733
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,132
Sorry. That was lame.

734
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,385
-I like it.
-Yes. Yun Seul-ki.

735
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,099
Every single moment here was a happy one.

736
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,393
I liked everything about it.

737
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,570
-I had fun.
-I had fun.

738
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,906
I had the most fun
when I talked with you, Nadine.

739
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,240
Me too.

740
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,950
-Bye.
-Okay.

741
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,246
You got this.

742
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,425
Seul-ki is the only one in my heart,

743
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,346
so I will choose Seul-ki,
regardless of what happens.

744
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,143
Gosh…

745
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,979
-He has his sights set on only her.
-Right.

746
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,689
He only has eyes for one person.

747
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,566
That's admirable.

748
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,324
You must be cold.

749
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:08,867
No, I'm okay.

750
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:09,993
-You're okay?
-Yes.

751
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,416
It was a long way here, right?

752
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,210
Yes, it was farther away than I thought.

753
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,518
Yoong-jae, please make your way.

754
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:49,741
When I'm with her,
we keep talking nonstop.

755
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:56,665
I think we talked a lot,
but it still wasn't enough for me.

756
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:01,086
So I want to see her
even after the summer ends.

757
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:06,091
It's So-e, then Se-jeong, then Seo-eun.

758
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,094
He's going toward the beach.
That's so cruel.

759
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,012
It is.

760
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:32,075
You were so brave and cool.
Thanks for everything.

761
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,160
Thanks. Bye.

762
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,681
This suddenly feels real to me.

763
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,310
The three of us will be having a chat.

764
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,526
This is…

765
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,041
Se-jun, please make your way.

766
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,136
Something about her
makes me think about her a lot.

767
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:39,601
Regardless of the outcome, I want
to make her happy when we leave Inferno.

768
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,020
Think he's going to go to So-e.

769
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:43,855
I have a feeling.

770
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,961
-It's such a relief that So-e has Se-jun.
-Right.

771
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,296
No matter what decision she makes.

772
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,349
Dong-woo, please make your way.

773
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,862
So there's Min-su,

774
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,864
-Nadine, Seul-ki.
-Nadine, Seul-ki.

775
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:38,452
So he has to stop there.
He has to go past Nadine, then to Seul-ki.

776
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,537
-Over there…
-Chaotic like a tornado.

777
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,748
That tornado seems very chaotic.

778
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,962
I want to take care of her
and joke around with her.

779
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:52,132
She crept into my heart,
so I wanted to treat her well.

780
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,218
But I felt like I missed my opportunity,
so I was very disappointed.

781
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,888
But I think I should
stay true to my heart.

782
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:01,141
With that in mind,
I'm going to try my best.

783
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,738
Nadine.

784
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:16,990
Yes.

785
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,399
-Hi.
-Hi.

786
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,651
You're here.

787
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,968
Jin-young, please make your way.

788
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:29,437
I'm curious as to whether
he'll go down or go up.

789
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,941
He's popular, so it's complicated.

790
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,276
This is hard.

791
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,489
He joined late, but he brought
more intensity than anyone.

792
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,740
Yes.

793
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,118
I wonder who Jin-young will choose.

794
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,369
-Me too.
-Yes.

795
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,622
It's hard to know what he's thinking.

796
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,231
He has to pass by Min-su no matter what.

797
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,457
Let's talk more when we leave Inferno.

798
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,793
Thanks for everything.

799
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,170
I had fun.

800
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,632
-You're not crying, are you?
-No, I'm not.

801
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,635
See you when we get out of here.

802
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,607
The last guy will be here now.

803
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:01,404
I think he'll choose Seul-ki.

804
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,199
Now this is…

805
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,661
Will it be Nadine or Seul-ki?

806
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:13,959
I strongly believe in how I feel,
and I trust my intuition,

807
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:17,796
so I don't think I've made
many bad decisions so far.

808
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,654
-You look nice today.
-Thanks.

809
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,242
-What?
-What?

810
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,577
-Is he staying?
-What?

811
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,330
I think he stopped there.

812
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,172
What?

813
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,675
What is it?

814
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,343
What?

815
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,053
Is he standing next to her?

816
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,596
No, wait. Is this real?

817
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,601
-I had fun.
-Right.

818
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,311
-I had a good time.
-Same.

819
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:20,233
I'll always support you
until your dreams come true.

820
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,318
Okay. Thanks.

821
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:26,823
Thanks.

822
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,209
-Jeez.
-What? I mean…

823
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,007
-He stood next to her, so I thought…
-Yes. Me too.

824
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,351
When I see a woman, it takes me
just three seconds to feel a spark.

825
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,271
The person who impressed me
from beginning to end,

826
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,565
and with whom I felt
the strongest connection

827
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:03,193
is the person I enjoyed
my time here with the most.

828
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,362
And that person is Seul-ki.

829
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:19,959
This is nice.

830
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,506
We're all here in the end.

831
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:27,884
Hey.

832
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:43,608
You were there for a while,
so I thought you weren't coming.

833
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,526
I see.

834
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,320
Didn't go around, did you?

835
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,155
-Around the whole island?
-No.

836
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,718
-It was as expected.
-I know.

837
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,637
They came to one place.

838
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,014
The women just need
to make their decisions.

839
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:19,936
If the woman's final choice matches
one of the men who has chosen her,

840
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:23,189
she will take his hand
and leave Inferno with him.

841
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,693
But if her choice has already been
matched with someone else,

842
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,486
then they'll stay on Inferno.

843
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,294
You're always on my mind,

844
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:50,467
and I feel rather nervous
when you're not around.

845
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:54,304
I chose you because I couldn't deny
that I have feelings for you.

846
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,310
To be honest, before you came here,

847
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:05,565
I was very discouraged and exhausted.

848
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,904
I'm so thankful
that you rescued me from that.

849
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,466
-Will she choose…
-She has to choose,

850
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:32,425
-right?
-Yes.

851
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,638
He could be someone whom she appreciates,
but not someone she likes.

852
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,316
Let's go.

853
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:49,275
Yes, let's go.

854
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,321
-Let's go!
-What?

855
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,656
Really?

856
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,993
-My gosh.
-Until the very end…

857
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,746
Thanks for everything, So-e.

858
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,081
Thank you, Se-jun.

859
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,207
Thanks.

860
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,419
So-e and Se-jun left. They're going.

861
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,506
-The two of them are wearing white.
-I know.

862
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,133
I'm really going to visit.

863
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,343
Please do.

864
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,096
I think it would be cool
and look cool too.

865
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,932
-Me?
-No.

866
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,601
I meant where you work.

867
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,186
Not me?

868
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,396
-No.
-I see.

869
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,024
You're cool too,
but I was talking about your job.

870
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,986
I fell yesterday.

871
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,279
Where?

872
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,072
Where? Hey, where did you fall?

873
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,115
There.

874
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,241
Jeez.

875
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,368
I told you to be careful.

876
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:43,079
I wondered why
I hadn't hurt myself up until then.

877
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,624
This is why I get worried
when you're not around.

878
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:50,795
This is why I get anxious
when you're not around.

879
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,130
-Jeez.
-Okay.

880
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,384
-Sounds like a line from a script.
-Yes. It does.

881
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,969
It's what they say at the end.

882
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,387
It's like Lovers in Paris.

883
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,348
It's like, "Let's go, baby."

884
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,059
-We finally got a couple.
-Seriously.

885
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,858
It feels different
to leave on this path with you.

886
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,033
I'm nervous.

887
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,576
Very.

888
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:36,674
No matter what you decide,

889
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,012
it'll be the right choice,
and I'll support your decision.

890
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:51,648
Seo-eun, leave Inferno with me.

891
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:07,622
At first,
we just happened to start talking.

892
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:12,835
And I was thankful
that we got to make so many memories.

893
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,046
I felt happy while I was here.

894
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,887
Thank you for always putting others first

895
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:27,183
and for always having
such positive energy.

896
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:31,813
I really support you, Han-bin,
just as you support my decision.

897
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,440
And I think you'll always shine.

898
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,161
So…

899
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,331
So…

900
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,002
Shall we go?

901
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,343
The weather's nice.

902
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,264
-Are your feet okay?
-Yes.

903
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,516
Weren't you standing there for a while?

904
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,726
-I was, but…
-Yes?

905
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,270
It's so weird.

906
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,896
-What is?
-This…

907
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:15,690
Why am I nervous?

908
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:20,737
It feels weird to hold hands as we walk.

909
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,655
It's exciting and nice.

910
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,991
Same.

911
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,033
This is nice.

912
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,161
-Yes, very.
-This is nice.

913
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:32,373
They're just holding hands and walking,
but it feels like they're really dating.

914
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,880
We should go get some good food
when we leave here.

915
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,923
-All right.
-When we get out, we'll have sashimi.

916
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:41,966
All right.

917
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,926
I was going to give you my number.

918
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:48,097
-We have our phones now.
-Yes.

919
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,517
It really feels weird.

920
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:53,936
-Right?
-Yes.

921
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,410
They're so serious here. Gosh.

922
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,579
Jeez. I wonder what'll happen.

923
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,080
Gosh.

924
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:31,849
Seul-ki.

925
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:36,103
Thank you for making exciting memories
that made my heart race.

926
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,944
The reason why I chose Seul-ki

927
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:46,656
is because Seul-ki
was the only one who moved my heart.

928
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,302
Seul-ki.

929
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:15,017
I think I like you.

930
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,524
That was a simple way
of telling her how he felt.

931
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:27,280
He makes your heart flutter, right?
Simple and straight to the point.

932
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,786
I think I like you.

933
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:42,879
When I was with her,

934
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:45,923
I realized, once again,
that I'm not good at expressing myself

935
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:52,263
and I'm sorry if she ever got stressed
or went through a hard time because of me.

936
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,181
When we get out of here,

937
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,768
I want to take her out for dinner.

938
01:04:58,936 --> 01:04:59,937
Yes.

939
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:03,149
I'm going to try and express
how I feel about her some more.

940
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:23,628
Seul-ki…

941
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,091
Would you like to have coffee with me?

942
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:37,975
I thought I had expressed
my feelings in my own way,

943
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:43,606
but if that didn't fully reach her heart,
I still tried my very best.

944
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:50,905
I think I'd feel quite hurt,
but I'd still respect her decision.

945
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:23,312
Firstly, thank you for being so brave.

946
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:31,862
I'll support you
as much as you support me.

947
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,291
Thank you

948
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:49,422
for being sincere with me
from beginning to end.

949
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:00,433
Remember how I told you

950
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,978
that no matter what you decide to do,
I want you to follow your heart?

951
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,606
Thank you for choosing me.

952
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:14,739
And I want you to know
that you really are an awesome person.

953
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:28,544
The person I would like
to leave Inferno with is…

954
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,731
Jong-woo.

955
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,275
Jong-woo.

956
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:00,910
-See, I told you!
-My gosh.

957
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,252
-My gosh.
-Is this real?

958
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,798
My gosh.

959
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,559
No, but wait…

960
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,645
We know how Jong-woo feels all too well.

961
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:31,732
-Keep playing it.
-No, no. I'm okay.

962
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,860
Oh, my gosh.

963
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,660
Jong-woo.

964
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,502
Jong-woo.

965
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,678
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

966
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:06,559
Let's go get coffee.

967
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,734
Gosh.

968
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:21,448
I feel really numb.
My hands are so sweaty.

969
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,492
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

970
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,035
Let me wipe it off first.

971
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,497
Aren't you glad you kept going?

972
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:32,334
I'm relieved
you were able to feel how I feel.

973
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:37,256
We'll have coffee for dessert.

974
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,676
-Let's go to a nice restaurant first.
-Sounds good.

975
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:43,512
Did you know or not?

976
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,431
-About what?
-That I'd choose you.

977
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,599
I had no idea.

978
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,893
I was so nervous…

979
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:52,062
-I know.
-…that my lips were trembling.

980
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:55,733
You said you made your decision yesterday.

981
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:57,359
-Yes.
-Is that true?

982
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,820
-Yes.
-I see.

983
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,198
If I choose guys based on

984
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,408
whether I want to be
with a guy whom I like

985
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:09,246
or whether I want to be
with a guy who likes me,

986
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,583
I think I've always
dated people whom I liked.

987
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,168
But…

988
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:20,132
Jong-woo's been very sincere with me
from the very beginning to the end.

989
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:24,845
And the feelings that
he expressed to me felt very earnest.

990
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,890
So I think Jong-woo is the person

991
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:31,185
who broke the standards
I had set for myself.

992
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:36,440
I feel that someone who's like a friend
and someone who makes me feel relaxed

993
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:42,363
could be the person to whom
I can finally show my real self.

994
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:44,990
He always approached me first.

995
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:51,497
So now, I want to tell him
that I want to approach him first.

996
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:57,419
In the end, I lost both the game
and my love to Jong-woo.

997
01:10:58,045 --> 01:10:59,380
I lost in everything.

998
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,840
Jong-woo completely defeated me.

999
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:06,887
Let's escape. We're leaving.

1000
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:09,890
I'm really leaving with you.

1001
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,480
It feels like a dream to me,
I wonder how Jong-woo would feel.

1002
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:18,148
-Even we can't believe it.
-Yes.

1003
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,068
Gosh.

1004
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,070
My hands keep sweating.

1005
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:26,031
My hands usually don't tend to sweat.

1006
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,325
But they're sweating.

1007
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,411
-I like it.
-Really?

1008
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:39,128
We really witnessed how you can succeed

1009
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,546
-if you don't give up.
-Right.

1010
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,673
-Exactly.
-But why did you cry like that?

1011
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:46,927
-What made you tear up?
-The way Jong-woo

1012
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,723
made himself vulnerable
and endlessly waited

1013
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,976
-made me want to support him.
-I see.

1014
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:57,396
I didn't expect this at all,
but then this happened and…

1015
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:01,066
-You two were bawling.
-For me, it was about how

1016
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:05,529
when you get older
and you've lived your life to an extent,

1017
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:08,490
it's hard to love someone
just for who they are.

1018
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:11,535
When you're young, you just go all in.

1019
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:13,787
But as you get older,

1020
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:17,374
you can't help but consider
your partner's circumstances.

1021
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,418
Watching Jong-woo right now,

1022
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:26,175
his unconditional love
and how he only had eyes for Seul-ki

1023
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:28,010
was something I really wanted to cheer.

1024
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:31,180
There was a time
when I was like that when I was younger,

1025
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:33,432
but I'd forgotten about it.

1026
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,310
Then Jong-woo reminded me of it again,

1027
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:38,896
which is why I wanted
to cheer for him even more.

1028
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:41,148
This was a happy ending, so…

1029
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:42,983
I'm sure we're not
the only ones who cried.

1030
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,152
-I'm sure others did.
-All drowning in tears.

1031
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:49,907
Jong-woo's steady and quiet love
changed Seul-ki's values.

1032
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:50,824
-Yes.
-Exactly.

1033
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:54,578
-Sincerity is the key to the heart.
-It truly is the key.
