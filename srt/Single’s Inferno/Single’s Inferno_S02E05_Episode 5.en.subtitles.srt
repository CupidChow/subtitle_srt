SINGLE'S INFERNO

12
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,631
In the last episode
when the couples were in Paradise,

13
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,759
two people were left behind in Inferno.

14
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,635
One was So-e, who chose Yoong-jae

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,180
and the other was Yoong-jae,
who never chose So-e.

16
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,973
It was so sad to watch.

17
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,601
So-e mustered up her courage
and told him how she felt.

18
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,353
Do you remember the look
So-e had on her face last time?

19
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,024
So I'll let you know how I feel
before it's too late.

20
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,321
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

21
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,369
She was smiling,
but she seemed sad in the end.

22
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,330
I couldn't get it out of my head all week.

23
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,748
-It was sad.
-Right.

24
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,209
Yes. Her smile turned bitter.

25
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:30,298
Their conversation felt very mature to me.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,967
I thought So-e was just adorable.

27
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,094
But she expressed her feelings

28
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,139
toward Yoong-jae
without adding or hiding anything.

29
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,975
So I felt that So-e is
a strong-minded person.

30
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,727
-Hanhae.
-Yes?

31
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,856
If a woman you don't have feelings
for spoke to you bravely like So-e,

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,942
would you see her differently?

33
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,861
That conversation made her
seem more attractive.

34
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,866
-I thought she'd have a chance.
-I felt the same.

35
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,743
-Right.
-And Yoong-jae said

36
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,664
he'd give her an answer
as quickly as possible.

37
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,667
Yoong-jae's decision is important,

38
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,212
but I don't think So-e will have
any regrets about her actions.

39
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,506
-Right.
-Even if Yoong-jae rejects her.

40
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:16,553
This couple is one thing,
but we also have to talk about Jin-young.

41
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,720
-He's funny.
-Yes.

42
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,765
He went straight to Paradise
within a few hours of arriving.

43
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,683
Yes.

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,519
-Well…
-Yes?

45
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,979
Can you carry this for me?

46
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,772
-You want me to carry that?
-Yes.

47
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,441
-I'll carry it for you.
-Oh, no. I can carry it.

48
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,860
Okay, carry it.

49
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,322
You saw how he just told her
to carry her bag

50
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,324
when she said she could do it, right?

51
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,660
-Yes.
-He's very firm about things.

52
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,787
-He's amazing.
-Just who is he?

53
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,540
He's charming in an unusual way.

54
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,083
So I'm also curious

55
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,836
about how he'll be
when he's with Seul-ki in Paradise.

56
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,837
I'm very curious.

57
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,674
Right. A clean-cut Seul-ki saw
a disheveled Jin-young and thought,

58
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,634
-"Hey, what's this?"
-Exactly.

59
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,887
That's how she ended up liking him.

60
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,306
I'm curious as to
what will happen in Paradise.

61
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,557
-I'm curious.
-Me too.

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,142
-Let's hurry and watch.
-Okay.

63
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,438
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND SEUL-KI

64
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,157
-It's amazing, right?
-Gosh.

65
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,742
-This is the door?
-Yes.

66
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,743
-Really?
-Yes.

67
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,582
-What kind of door looks like that?
-I know, right?

68
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,709
This is our room.

69
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,048
It's great, right?

70
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,301
Here's the pool.

71
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,599
The pool is amazing. I'm honestly shocked.

72
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,311
Seriously? Is this real?

73
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,695
How about room service?

74
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,157
-Yeah. Let's order room service first.
-Okay.

75
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,743
What should we eat?

76
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,298
-Do you usually have trouble deciding?
-No.

77
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,717
-Are you letting me decide?
-Yes.

78
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,220
-I was waiting for you.
-Me too.

79
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,471
Then well…

80
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,973
Okay.

81
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,644
Do you prefer rice or noodles?

82
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,021
Which do you like better?

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,690
-I like rice.
-Rice?

84
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,816
-Yes.
-Rice.

85
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,110
-We should order a rice dish then.
-Okay.

86
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,612
Do you want something to drink?

87
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,447
How much can you drink?

88
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,574
I don't really drink.

89
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,994
You don't drink at all?

90
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,328
-Well,
-But…

91
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,539
then I won't drink either.

92
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,999
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

93
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,419
Are you sure you won't regret it?

94
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,378
Why would I?

95
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,172
You can drink if you want.

96
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,173
-What?
-Yes.

97
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,134
Let's see what they have.

98
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,093
Here.

99
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,137
Then I'll have a cold beer.

100
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,263
-Okay.
-Okay.

101
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,308
-Let's order quickly and wash up.
-Okay.

102
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,738
Jin-young.

103
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,325
-It's adorable when he's like that.
-He's adorable. My gosh.

104
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,504
He's messing with the lights.

105
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,556
-He's going through everything.
-He's the first to open drawers.

106
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,641
-Why is he doing that?
-He's cute.

107
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,560
I do that sometimes at a hotel too.

108
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,563
I get curious
when there are a lot of drawers.

109
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,319
Let's go eat.

110
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,364
PARADISE
HAN-BIN AND SEO-EUN

111
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,282
What is this?

112
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,617
-It's very…
-What is it?

113
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,120
-What is all this?
-Wait a second.

114
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,165
What is all this?

115
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,834
It's an amusement park.

116
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,753
-Wait.
-They even have bumper cars.

117
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,923
Wait, did they rent the whole place?
There's no one here.

118
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,508
Maybe you're right.

119
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,802
Wait, so all of this is…

120
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,471
-They rented out the whole place.
-Right.

121
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,518
It's my first time
at a rented-out theme park.

122
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,353
It's so pretty.

123
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,146
-Everything's colorful.
-Exactly.

124
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,483
-Let's go. Let's ride that one first.
-Okay.

125
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,070
-We're going up!
-We're flying.

126
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,532
-We're flying a lot today.
-Right.

127
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,077
Wait, this is fast!

128
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,038
-This is exciting.
-It's faster than I thought.

129
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,084
-It's going up high.
-What if it goes through the ceiling?

130
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:04,090
-This is so fun.
-This is fun.

131
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,342
-This is fun.
-It's more fun together.

132
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,301
I agree.

133
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,639
-It's going faster.
-What kind of ride is this?

134
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,933
-It's going faster.
-What is this thing?

135
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,310
-It's amazing.
-Wait!

136
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,062
-It's turning upside down.
-My gosh!

137
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,522
I didn't expect this.

138
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,481
Your hair!

139
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,941
You look like a pineapple.

140
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,569
A pineapple?

141
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,032
-It's a carousel.
-Yes.

142
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,452
-You're supposed to take pictures here.
-Right.

143
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,912
-The carousel--
-The carousel?

144
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,872
How about a ride?

145
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,250
Right, that's it.

146
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,503
I'll take that. Thank you.

147
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,463
Let's go.

148
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,683
-This is nice.
-I feel like a kid again.

149
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,767
Me too.

150
00:07:58,936 --> 00:07:59,896
A carousel…

151
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,484
-This is nice.
-Yes.

152
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,194
I feel relaxed all of a sudden.

153
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,862
Look at me.

154
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,073
Your hair looks natural,
going up and down.

155
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,284
-Yes, Mr. Hair Stylist.
-Yes.

156
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,331
-I can't believe they rented this out.
-I know.

157
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,834
I never would've imagined this.

158
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,419
I know, right? This is a gift.

159
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,592
It's romantic how they're on the carousel,
and no one else is there.

160
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,427
-Right.
-Yes.

161
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,309
I can't believe they filled this table
with all these.

162
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,227
Me neither.

163
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,022
-I can't believe we're eating this.
-Me too.

164
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,815
We should eat a lot.

165
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,946
-It's good.
-Ribs.

166
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,492
It's good.

167
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,745
I think I can definitely guess your age.

168
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,540
Twenties or thirties?

169
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,084
-Twenties.
-Twenties?

170
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,669
Twenty

171
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,504
two?

172
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,215
-Twenty-eight.
-Twenty-eight?

173
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,300
You're really young.

174
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,262
I'm 24.

175
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,351
What?

176
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,436
Gosh.

177
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,772
What?

178
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,149
He's 24?

179
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,193
-He's four years younger?
-Yes.

180
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,071
But Han-bin kind of looks mature.

181
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,072
-Yes.
-Right.

182
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,076
This is crazy.

183
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,913
I thought you were around my age.

184
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,040
Twenty-seven? Twenty-eight?

185
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,834
-That was my guess.
-Right.

186
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,212
I'm about your age.
I'm only four years younger.

187
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,132
-That's true.
-Yes.

188
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,136
Shall we talk about our jobs now?

189
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,222
Painting.

190
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,728
A painter?

191
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,814
Well…

192
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,399
I do art, yes.

193
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,610
It suits you.

194
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,613
You kind of have the eyes of a painter.

195
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,616
Wait, I know why.
You drew your eyebrows very nicely.

196
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,118
Seriously.

197
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,454
You drew your eyebrows very nicely.

198
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,706
Did I prove my skills?

199
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,291
You really are a painter.

200
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,501
No wonder Yoong-jae said

201
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,671
-he was surprised again in the morning.
-Why?

202
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,965
He kept thinking about
how you're an artist.

203
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,800
-After hearing what I do?
-Yes.

204
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,720
No wonder he was so surprised.

205
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,764
Your eyebrows are on point.

206
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,058
Guess what I do?

207
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,352
It might be hard to guess.

208
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,687
-You'll never guess.
-A chef?

209
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,481
You guessed it right.

210
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,238
-What?
-Really?

211
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,448
He's a chef?

212
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,325
-That's why he's good at cooking.
-Really?

213
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,284
No wonder.

214
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,663
I'm a chef.

215
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,999
I won the grand prize in 2018

216
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,585
at the Korea International
Cooking Competition

217
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,380
organized by the Korean Cooks Federation

218
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,299
and Director of Organization Award
in 2019.

219
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,512
I have certifications in Korean,
Western, and Chinese cuisine.

220
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,931
I'm also certified
in food safety management

221
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,809
by the US National Restaurant Association.

222
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,019
He's so talented.

223
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,650
I started cooking about seven years ago.

224
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,404
I enjoy the cooking process.

225
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,116
I take pride in myself as a chef.

226
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,660
KIM HAN-BIN, AGE 24, CHEF

227
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,619
That's so cool.

228
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,540
So I've been participating
in competitions.

229
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,834
You deserve a round of applause.

230
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:54,130
I told you when we were
preparing dinner on the first day

231
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,716
that you were really good
at handling the knife.

232
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,804
You were cutting
the ingredients really well.

233
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,683
-You're really good at this.
-No, I'm not.

234
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,353
But you kept denying it
and said it's because you live alone.

235
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,730
I had to be serious about cooking.

236
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,274
I see.

237
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,114
So why did you choose me?

238
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,200
-I actually wanted to talk about this.
-Okay.

239
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,160
So…

240
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,121
In the end, after you and I talked,

241
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,583
you said, "Don't feel pressured.
I'm not trying to pressure you."

242
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,084
When you said that I felt…

243
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,045
You see…

244
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,339
Almost since the beginning…

245
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,468
No. Right from the beginning, I've kept…

246
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,596
feeling this way.

247
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,055
I see.

248
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,851
I'm just letting you know that
I wanted to talk to you the most.

249
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,772
I thought

250
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:58,152
you came in with a heavy heart.

251
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,238
It felt like you mustered up the courage

252
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,158
-to tell me.
-I see.

253
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,285
You seemed like a very nice guy,

254
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,538
but there weren't
a lot of opportunities to talk to you.

255
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,998
-I felt--
-Yes?

256
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,957
We didn't

257
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,627
have a chance to talk to each other.

258
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,214
On the second day, I was fine.
But when I woke up this morning

259
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,132
I felt anxious all of a sudden.

260
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,052
I didn't know if it was okay for me

261
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,054
to just sit back and do nothing.

262
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,972
So I wanted to talk to you quickly.

263
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,015
-I see.
-So…

264
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,311
Anyway, you found the time to do that.

265
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,771
I was…

266
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,066
surprised, but I liked it.

267
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,150
That's a relief.

268
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,661
It feels like
after they revealed their age,

269
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,163
something's kind of…

270
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,792
Seo-eun is usually a good listener
and keeps the conversation going.

271
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,337
But I can't help but wonder
if something has happened.

272
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,090
-I agree. She's older than him.
-Right.

273
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,134
But for some reason, it feels like
she became his older sister.

274
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,388
-Her attitude suddenly changed.
-Right.

275
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,974
-Age isn't important,
-That's right.

276
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,142
but it feels like at some point,

277
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,272
Seo-eun started seeing him
more as a younger brother.

278
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,231
-Right.
-I agree.

279
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,276
Here we are.

280
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,152
PARADISE
DONG-WOO AND NADINE

281
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,032
This is delicious.

282
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,957
We're eating really fast right now.

283
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,876
It's weird.

284
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,421
I didn't enjoy the food
this much yesterday.

285
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,717
Maybe you weren't feeling well yesterday.

286
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,178
-Maybe.
-Yes.

287
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,349
I thought I would never come here.

288
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,726
Why?

289
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,729
Because I'm bad at expressing myself

290
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,149
in situations or places like this.

291
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,402
Because of cultural
and linguistic differences?

292
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,361
Yes.

293
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,198
Then do you feel
more comfortable speaking English?

294
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,451
Can you answer in English?

295
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,078
I'll try my best.

296
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,706
I'm a little scared to speak English.

297
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,375
People say I sound different
when I speak English.

298
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,419
I'm more curious
now that you've said that.

299
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,563
His English is good. I knew it.

300
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,524
He's more charming now
compared to when he was with Seul-ki.

301
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,311
They sound like Americans
having a conversation.

302
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,021
Because it's in English, right?

303
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,565
They look so good together.

304
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,485
Do all doctors speak English fluently?

305
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,489
Do you ever feel this way?

306
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,284
You could have multiple people
you're curious about.

307
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,943
I wonder how old you are.

308
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,069
Take a guess.

309
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,029
Twenty-seven.

310
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm 32.

311
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,578
Korean age.

312
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,879
My international age is 22.

313
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,756
-So your Korean age is 23?
-Yes. I'm 23.

314
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,763
Oh, my gosh.

315
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,933
I should go back to speaking formally.

316
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,351
No, just speak casually.

317
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,937
There's no difference in English.

318
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,189
We're all friends.

319
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,065
Okay.

320
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,863
But you really seem younger.

321
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,949
I mean, you do.

322
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,827
She said, "You really seem younger."

323
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,038
She's adorable.

324
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,873
But I really couldn't tell

325
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,083
-that there's a big age gap.
-Right.

326
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,835
-It felt natural.
-Age is really…

327
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,588
Do you think it's a huge age difference?

328
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:19,218
No. Not huge,
but it's bigger than I had expected.

329
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,637
Age isn't that important to me.

330
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,265
For me, jobs are important.

331
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,558
In what way?

332
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,810
Because of time.

333
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,065
So are you saying
you don't like busy people?

334
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,401
No, I think I would respect them
if they are busy.

335
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,655
So you would respect someone
who leads a busy life?

336
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,200
Yes. Someone who is
passionate about their job.

337
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,369
I think that's cool.

338
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,164
Wait. Let me guess
what you do for a living.

339
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,586
I think you're a student.

340
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,880
Yes, I'm a student.

341
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,590
A student? I see.

342
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,218
-So what do you study?
-I…

343
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,069
-Harvard University?
-Harvard?

344
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:57,357
LEE NADINE, AGE 23, HARVARD UNIVERSITY
NEUROSCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJOR

345
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,817
She's so cool.

346
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,194
It's the temporal lobe, but the frontal.

347
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,698
Harvard?

348
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,080
Really? That's interesting.

349
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,251
I'm a doctor.

350
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,587
-What?
-I'm a doctor.

351
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,970
So, honestly, when you said "pre-med…"

352
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:27,929
Yes.

353
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,474
-I was surprised.
-I see.

354
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,769
What do you specialize in?

355
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,104
Dermatology?

356
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,024
You're close.

357
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,233
-Plastic surgery?
-Yes.

358
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,110
You're a plastic surgeon?

359
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,737
That's crazy.

360
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,323
I also want to specialize
in plastic surgery.

361
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,409
-He can be a mentor.
-Right.

362
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,661
She met someone in the same field.

363
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,873
I also want to pursue plastic surgery.

364
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:02,464
But why did you want to specialize
in plastic surgery?

365
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,216
And not anything else?

366
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,093
Well,

367
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,719
I enjoyed performing surgery.

368
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,138
-It suited me. But you have to decide…
-I see.

369
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,933
…whether you want to pursue
surgery or not.

370
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:13,892
Right.

371
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,815
Because it's my dream.

372
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:25,737
I've dreamed of becoming a doctor
since I was six-years-old.

373
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,696
I see.

374
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,158
I was really sick once.

375
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,204
I was hospitalized for a long time,
and the doctors back then

376
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,289
seemed so cool to me.

377
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,710
It's not easy for a person to pursue
the same dream for such a long time.

378
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,546
Right, and that's why…

379
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,133
-You have to become a doctor.
-I really want to.

380
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,928
I really want to go to med school,
become a doctor, and perform surgery.

381
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,557
You're going to be very busy.

382
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,604
Is this your last break before that?

383
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,772
Yes, it is.

384
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,191
-I see.
-Right.

385
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,739
But if you meet someone here,

386
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,367
you have to go back.

387
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,910
I see.

388
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,523
He's basically drawing the line.

389
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,276
This feels like a therapy session,

390
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,945
-not a date.
-Yes. It feels that way.

391
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,197
When Dong-woo was with Seul-ki,

392
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,908
he was very restless.

393
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,202
The conversation didn't go as smoothly

394
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,954
-as it went right now.
-Yes.

395
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,416
But you know the kind
of suffocating anxiety that guys feel.

396
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,834
-The feeling you get
-Yes.

397
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,127
-when you like someone.
-Yes.

398
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,879
But to the viewers,

399
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,590
-it was uncomfortable and not smooth.
-Right.

400
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,009
That was how it was, but now,

401
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,553
-the conversation is going so well.
-Yes.

402
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:22,599
Yet it seems like
Dong-woo is feeling down.

403
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,643
-We know how he is when he's happy.
-Yes.

404
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,480
We know. We've seen him.

405
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,523
But he's so different right now.

406
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,610
Maybe he doesn't like the fact that

407
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,446
Nadine will also be working
in the same field as him.

408
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,950
Dong-woo clearly expressed his feelings
and drew the line.

409
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,702
-Right.
-When he said that,

410
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,247
Nadine's face suddenly became somber.

411
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,291
She probably understood.

412
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,876
But Nadine was

413
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,420
also interested in Jin-young as well.

414
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,423
-Right.
-So we don't know how Nadine feels yet.

415
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,758
The conversations they have

416
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,386
after coming back
from Paradise will be important.

417
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,972
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND SEUL-KI

418
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,474
This looks good.

419
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,268
This looks so good.

420
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,228
I know, right?

421
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,070
Is there a bottle opener?

422
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,238
A bottle opener?

423
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,949
It's right here.

424
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,123
What?

425
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,000
Right. Jin-young can't just open it.

426
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,252
That's his style.

427
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:35,296
I've never seen someone open
sparkling water with a spoon.

428
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,106
Do you need help?

429
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,066
No. But how do you do it?

430
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,777
-You put it here and eat, no?
-Isn't it for your head?

431
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,737
-Your head?
-Yes.

432
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,823
What do you mean it's for your head?

433
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,662
I'm not really used to any of this.

434
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,621
Okay.

435
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,498
I hope you can be understanding.

436
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,918
I'll teach you.
I have more experience than you.

437
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,714
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

438
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,768
It's so refreshing, right?

439
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,810
It really is.

440
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,979
Don't you feel better now?

441
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,568
You never laughed like this before.
I've never seen you like this.

442
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,695
This is nice.

443
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,364
It is. But I… Never mind.

444
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,742
-What is it?
-Why am I being so awkward?

445
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,955
-She's so different.
-Gosh, Seul-ki is

446
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,583
acting like how Dong-woo acted yesterday.

447
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,132
Do you like this sauce?

448
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,511
No, I'll eat it on my own.

449
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,470
Okay.

450
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,889
You're so independent.

451
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,016
I think

452
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,894
I become more independent around you.

453
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,020
-Around me?
-Yes.

454
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:19,692
I thought that being overly kind

455
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,237
-could make you feel uncomfortable.
-I see.

456
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,280
I could try to be kind,

457
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,157
-but you might take it the wrong way.
-Yes.

458
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:29,285
That's why I try
not to step over the line.

459
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,998
-Well…
-Yes?

460
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,796
I forgot what I was going to say.

461
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,972
Why am I so nervous?

462
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,391
What?

463
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,642
I mean,

464
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,895
it's hard for me to start a conversation.

465
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,814
-When you're with me?
-Yes.

466
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,233
Is that a bad thing?

467
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,362
-I'm not sure.
-I see.

468
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,789
-We can talk about everything here, right?
-Right.

469
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,624
How old are you?

470
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,627
-Do you want to take a guess?
-Your age?

471
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,838
It seems like you're about my age.

472
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,674
-Am I wrong?
-Oh, really?

473
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,676
Why? What about you?

474
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,303
Twenty-eight?

475
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,889
You're right.

476
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,265
-Really?
-Yes.

477
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,100
I'm 25.

478
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,435
-You're 25?
-Yes.

479
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,769
I see.

480
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,816
Then what should I call you?

481
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,738
So then, just…

482
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,450
"Hey" is fine. Call me whatever you want.

483
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,661
Okay.

484
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,079
Hey.

485
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,717
It kind of feels like
he's really not interested in her,

486
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,636
-but he makes your heart flutter.
-The mood is

487
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,762
-very odd.
-It is.

488
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,846
I don't get it.

489
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,019
What does your tattoo mean?

490
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,064
It's not a fake sleeve, right?

491
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:27,195
It means warrior.

492
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,363
I see.

493
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,198
That's what it means.

494
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,159
Are you religious?

495
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,327
-Religion?
-Yes.

496
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,536
I don't have a religion.

497
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,372
-I see.
-Yes.

498
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,498
Then why an angel?

499
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,375
Warrior.

500
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,876
Oh, you meant warrior.

501
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,712
I see. Warrior.

502
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,465
I was a soldier…

503
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,800
-I see.
-…before.

504
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,845
That really suits you.

505
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,683
I was in the UDT for four years.

506
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,601
-Really?
-Yes. Then I was discharged.

507
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,479
That's amazing.

508
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,693
-That's a tough job.
-Right.

509
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,071
So I got UDT inked on my arm.

510
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,073
These are bullets.

511
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,325
They're in the shape of a bullet.

512
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,120
So what do you do now?

513
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,914
I am a YouTuber.

514
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,124
I see.

515
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,460
After I was discharged from the UDT,
the Navy special forces,

516
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,963
I became a content creator.

517
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,466
I create various content.

518
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,094
But since I'm confident

519
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,013
in tactics and shooting,

520
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,723
Shoot straight forward.

521
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,766
I'm going to make use of my expertise

522
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,853
and make military content in the future.

523
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:47,150
KIM JIN-YOUNG, AGE 28, CONTENT CREATOR

524
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,485
How difficult is the UDT?

525
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,987
There are many special forces,

526
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,448
but among those,
if you say you served in UDT,

527
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,824
-people acknowledge you.
-Yes.

528
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,993
-It's hard and requires patience.
-Really?

529
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,121
That's why when he played that game,

530
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,707
-he reached his flag at once.
-No wonder.

531
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,083
-Right.
-Right.

532
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,168
He's super manly.

533
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,253
That was a piece of cake for him.

534
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,339
What do you do?

535
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,968
I'm a university student.

536
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,595
-You are?
-Yes.

537
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,222
What major?

538
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,683
I'm a piano major

539
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,227
-at Seoul National University.
-Piano? Really?

540
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,023
So what year are you in right now?

541
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,274
I'm a senior.

542
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,400
-You're a senior?
-Yes.

543
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,693
I'm in my first semester.

544
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,322
I didn't go to college,
so I don't know much about it.

545
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,449
That's understandable.

546
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,620
We finally know more about each other now.

547
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:48,127
That's so interesting.
I've never met a former UDT before.

548
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,213
I've never met a pianist before, either.

549
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,553
-They're so different.
-Very.

550
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,098
I'm getting a strange vibe.

551
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,560
Can I ask you something?

552
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,938
Did you think I'd come out?

553
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:09,982
No.

554
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,612
I also didn't expect it,
so I was really surprised.

555
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,823
I was also surprised.

556
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,826
I really didn't think you'd come out.

557
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,579
-During lunch earlier, do you remember…
-Yes?

558
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,582
…how we talked about
who we're attracted to?

559
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,669
I like someone who is joyful.

560
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,966
I immediately thought, "I'm not her type."

561
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,594
So I didn't expect you to come out at all.

562
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,764
I knew you wouldn't choose me.

563
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,767
But I thought it'd be more embarrassing
to choose someone else

564
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,602
out of fear that you might not choose me.

565
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,854
So I stayed true to myself.

566
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,772
I see.

567
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,777
When I had to make up my mind today,

568
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,028
I just…

569
00:35:56,112 --> 00:36:01,284
I didn't know whether I should choose
someone who likes me

570
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,077
or choose someone whom I like…

571
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,037
Wait a second.

572
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,541
I wondered if I should
choose someone I'm curious about.

573
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,251
I thought about it for a while.

574
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:16,424
But I just followed my heart.

575
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,217
I just thought that

576
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,762
I could still have fun in Inferno
even if things don't work out.

577
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,723
So I just made my choice.

578
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,601
But I was so surprised when you came out.

579
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,898
Same here.

580
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,568
I think we had the same thought.

581
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,619
You know how you won the game?

582
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,037
Yes.

583
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,331
-That was really cool.
-I see.

584
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,668
But you don't really

585
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,672
seem to express yourself, in my opinion.

586
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,550
-You don't--
-I don't like being expressive.

587
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,803
That is, I don't really like
to show my emotions.

588
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,140
-When I express my feelings…
-Yes.

589
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,685
…I feel embarrassed.

590
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,563
As if others can see your thoughts?

591
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,774
-Yes. Exactly.
-Got it.

592
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,153
This is exciting.

593
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,407
-We're talking about our feelings here.
-Right.

594
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,328
It would be nice
if there's someone like that.

595
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,465
How is it?

596
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,218
It's good.

597
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,346
Did you just express
that it's really good?

598
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,139
Right. It's good.

599
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,976
I think we're starting
to get to know each other.

600
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,939
-Right.
-Yes. It's nice.

601
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,820
I think it takes some time
for me to warm up to people.

602
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,862
I see.

603
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,365
I tend to put my guard up at first.

604
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,496
-But I'm nice once I get to know them.
-Right.

605
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,956
-I joke around.
-Okay.

606
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,418
I'll be patient.

607
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,426
I'll be patient.

608
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,435
-I think you're a bit playful too.
-I joke around a lot.

609
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,273
But you don't like it
when someone oversteps boundaries.

610
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,232
-Me?
-Yes.

611
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,525
I'm okay with it.

612
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,322
Then is it okay if I do?

613
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,333
-Look at him laughing. He's so cute!
-He's disarmed now.

614
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,250
He fell for her.

615
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,252
-He's adorable!
-Even his ears are red.

616
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,879
-He's disarmed.
-He's adorable.

617
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,672
Jin-young laughed.

618
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,215
-He fell for her.
-Those two.

619
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,092
I want to make Jin-young laugh too.

620
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,927
Why is my heart fluttering?

621
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,512
-It's happening to me too.
-Right?

622
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,723
-It's like a line from a movie.
-She's cute.

623
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,267
-What she said is amazing.
-There's another side to him.

624
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,519
Then is it okay if I do?

625
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,989
I see how it is.

626
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,874
Are you afraid of water?

627
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,001
-No.
-You're not?

628
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,169
Yes.

629
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,837
Then let's go in the water.

630
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,423
-The water?
-Yes.

631
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,092
If you don't want to, it's okay.

632
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,845
Do you want to go in?

633
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,098
I'll watch you.

634
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,266
You're going to watch?

635
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,436
-I don't mind either way.
-Okay.

636
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,985
I mean, Seul-ki and Dong-woo
were going at different speeds.

637
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,279
But these two are like
pacemakers in a marathon.

638
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,572
-Right.
-Like this.

639
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,824
-They're both slow.
-Yes.

640
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,035
-But they get each other.
-She said she'll wait for him.

641
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,371
But when she asked him
if she can cross the line

642
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,082
I think she clearly told him how she felt.

643
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,125
-Don't you think?
-Yes.

644
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,084
-Exactly.
-I mean,

645
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,129
how would you feel if a woman you like
asks you that?

646
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,423
It would blow my mind away.

647
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,341
I'm a woman, but my heart is…

648
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,094
Jin-young also laughed when she asked, so…

649
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:34,140
Seul-ki has probably
always been this pretty

650
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,475
and men probably
always tried to win her heart.

651
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,520
She was always treated like that,

652
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,896
but when she met Jin-young

653
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,190
who doesn't express
his feelings, is blunt,

654
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,360
and doesn't even carry her bag for her.

655
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,739
I think she became more curious about him
because he's so different.

656
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,784
It's obvious that
she's so curious about him.

657
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,911
-She's very curious.
-Yes. She is.

658
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,874
They reminded me of Titanic.

659
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:00,833
It's like,

660
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:04,587
he's the disheveled Leonardo DiCaprio,
and she's like a princess.

661
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,382
But they're oddly attracted to each other.

662
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,301
She's expressing her feelings

663
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,720
and that makes her seem more charming.

664
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,431
I feel like I'm watching a woman

665
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,016
-who's falling in love
-Me too.

666
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,352
-Seul-ki is just so lovely.
-She is.

667
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,729
This is so exciting.

668
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,316
PARADISE
HAN-BIN AND SEO-EUN

669
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,912
What are you doing?

670
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,873
I was just mindlessly…

671
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,249
Were you drawing?

672
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,210
You're really good.

673
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,336
No, I'm not.

674
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,254
-Do you want me to draw you?
-Yes.

675
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,380
Wait.

676
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,883
I should've asked you to draw me
when I had makeup on.

677
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,635
This is so embarrassing.

678
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,137
You're really good.

679
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,058
Okay.

680
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,074
You're so focused.

681
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,370
I did really well, right?

682
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,252
This is the absolute best that I can do
when drawing a person.

683
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,338
Goodness, thank you.

684
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,881
I'll put a facial mask on you.

685
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,177
Here we go. It's going to be cold.

686
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,723
Wait a second.

687
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,808
Just trust me.

688
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,726
Wait.

689
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,979
The mask is too big for your face.

690
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,359
It's cold, but it's refreshing too.

691
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,694
Hang in there.

692
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:56,865
Like this.

693
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,661
There.

694
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:07,960
-Is it that bad?
-No.

695
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,129
-Wait, I'll help you.
-I look like a panda.

696
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,880
-Here…
-But this is…

697
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,425
-Let me tell you what it is.
-It's tear-shaped…

698
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,468
Don't move.

699
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,179
-If you do--
-It keeps falling off since I'm laughing.

700
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,934
It's like a teardrop.

701
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,103
INFERNO

702
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,272
Let's take turns asking questions.

703
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,356
Okay.

704
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,318
I have to ask Yoong-jae something.

705
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,861
-Me?
-Yes.

706
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,446
You can ask me…

707
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:37,823
anything you want.

708
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,743
Did your feelings change
based on what happened today?

709
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,421
I won't make the same choice I made today.

710
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:54,882
Why?

711
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,677
I don't think it'll work.

712
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,803
I see.

713
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,472
I think I made the wrong choice.

714
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,265
I see.

715
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,852
I understand.

716
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,150
You said you thought about
what decision to make today.

717
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,109
Right.

718
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,197
Did you consider
either of these two women?

719
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,367
Yes.

720
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,749
I'm curious.

721
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,711
I have a question too.

722
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,923
How many times did you change your mind
after your first choice?

723
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:37,925
It hasn't changed.

724
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,551
-This whole time?
-Yes.

725
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,512
-Really?
-Not even once?

726
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,638
Not even once.

727
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,474
So you only have eyes for one person.

728
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,811
I want to get to know the person,
so I haven't changed my mind.

729
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,979
Then after today,

730
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,649
do you think you'll change your mind?

731
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,111
No. For now, I don't think so.

732
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,865
First, I want to get to know
the person I'm interested in.

733
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,451
But if that person pushes me away

734
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,245
or rejects me, then maybe.

735
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,579
Then…

736
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,084
if she comes back tomorrow,

737
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,838
and you don't get chosen again,

738
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:20,634
even after expressing your feelings,

739
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:21,885
what will you do?

740
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,680
If it's the same result
even after we talk?

741
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,849
-Yes.
-Even after you talk to her seriously.

742
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,143
-Again?
-Yes. If he doesn't get chosen again.

743
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,564
If I don't get chosen again?

744
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,817
I would cry.

745
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,864
If I get rejected again…

746
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,577
She's already gone with two men.

747
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,538
-If she goes again, that would be three.
-Yes.

748
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,581
Right?

749
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,377
-Then I still have a chance.
-Okay.

750
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,130
-So…
-So you'll still choose her?

751
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,383
-You'll choose her no matter what?
-I think I'll try to talk

752
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,969
-to her again until the day we decide.
-You should.

753
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,054
It'll take some time.

754
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,808
She might not know how you feel

755
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,394
even if you think she does.

756
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:17,024
You could be right.
I'm not really good at this.

757
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,194
I'm cheering for you.

758
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:21,778
Same here.

759
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,032
-I support you.
-Thanks for being honest.

760
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:25,991
Really?

761
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,204
I think I'll stick with my first choice.

762
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,039
-Good for you.
-I won't back down.

763
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,165
For now.

764
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:40,422
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND SEUL-KI

765
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,725
It's been a while since I last swam.

766
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,541
You're such a good swimmer.

767
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,211
You're having fun, right?

768
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,380
I am, but it feels awkward.

769
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,554
You look really nice right now.

770
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,931
What?

771
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,058
You look innocent, but you're all ripped.

772
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:36,895
You look nice.

773
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,654
Is it warm?

774
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,907
-It's like a hot spring. I'm serious.
-Really?

775
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,410
Should I dip my feet in the water?

776
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,497
The water's fine. It's nice.

777
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,541
-Really?
-Yes. It's really warm.

778
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,795
-I think you'll regret it if you don't.
-Right?

779
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,341
Okay. I'll go get changed then.

780
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,385
-My gosh.
-What?

781
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,637
My goodness.

782
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,556
-This is just…
-Really?

783
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,765
This is the power of love.

784
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,435
-Dong-woo shouldn't watch this.
-Dong-woo…

785
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,527
I feel so shy.

786
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:30,741
I don't know what to do.

787
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,172
-It really is warm.
-I told you, right?

788
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,131
Right.

789
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,679
-It was the right decision.
-Right?

790
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,609
But really…

791
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:06,735
Yes?

792
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,404
I didn't get to swim yesterday.

793
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,822
-Yesterday?
-Yes.

794
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,157
Why?

795
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,369
The situation was a bit…

796
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,578
I see.

797
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,539
Well, you are today.

798
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,874
I know.

799
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,626
It's interesting.

800
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,548
Is that a mosquito bite?

801
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,966
Where?

802
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,510
Is it a bruise?

803
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,761
-This?
-Yes.

804
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:33,845
It's a birthmark.

805
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,931
-Really?
-Yeah.

806
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,683
How did you notice it?

807
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,310
I notice things like that really well.

808
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,897
I mean, kind of.

809
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,904
Do you feel relaxed now?

810
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:53,407
Yes, I do. I feel really good.

811
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,872
So the women played a game,

812
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,333
and then the men played a game today.

813
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,460
And yesterday…

814
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,636
-What?
-What is that?

815
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,887
Oh, my.

816
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,725
And yesterday…

817
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,906
What kind of game do you think we'd play

818
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,117
if the men and women
were to play together?

819
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,453
Men and women together?

820
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,138
Why are you trembling?

821
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,150
I thought of a game
they might make us play.

822
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,658
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

823
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,868
Right? I can tell.

824
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,495
I kind of…

825
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,955
I'm just saying.

826
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,515
I have another question.

827
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,516
What is it?

828
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,643
What's your type when it comes to looks?

829
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,145
-Can you tell me?
-You.

830
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,232
-Really?
-Yes.

831
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,985
Cute and sexy.

832
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:03,245
That's why I asked you
to have lunch with me today.

833
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,879
Wait, when did we stop using honorifics?

834
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,422
Hey, you're right.

835
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,591
Right? We started talking casually
at some point.

836
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,176
Maybe because we're comfortable?

837
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:19,845
Maybe.

838
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,938
It didn't get on your face, right?

839
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,906
We should go to bed now.

840
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,500
You had fun, right?

841
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,045
I appreciate that you came in.

842
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,428
Wait just a moment.

843
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,688
Come on up.

844
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:14,900
-Like this?
-Yes.

845
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:19,905
Thanks.

846
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,345
I mean, what is up with that guy?

847
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,430
Seriously. Who is he?

848
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,140
This is like a movie.

849
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,059
He does things that drives women crazy.

850
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,727
-Exactly.
-He does.

851
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:51,895
-Those eyes…
-He's making

852
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,147
-her heart melt.
-Everyone would fall for him.

853
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,024
The way they held hands was so natural.

854
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,401
Asking for her hand
could've made her uncomfortable.

855
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,820
-Yes. He did this.
-So he wrapped his finger.

856
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,282
-He likes--
-He didn't even tell her to come in.

857
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:07,077
-He somehow lured her in.
-She decided to get changed

858
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,745
-and went in.
-He's mesmerizing.

859
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,206
Seul-ki didn't know if she should go in.

860
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,084
But before she knew it,

861
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,419
-he was already leading her.
-He just led her.

862
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,214
I think Seul-ki let down her guard

863
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,924
around Jin-young.

864
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:24,260
I can see sparks flying

865
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:28,181
between the two of them.

866
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,140
Exactly.

867
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,060
But isn't Seul-ki different
from how she was on her date

868
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,770
-with Dong-woo?
-Obviously.

869
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:38,066
Who is Jin-young? Who is this man?

870
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,736
We don't know. That's why he's attractive.

871
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,863
-He's mysterious.
-Yes, he is.

872
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:55,602
PARADISE
JIN-YOUNG AND SEUL-KI

873
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,481
Jin-young.

874
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,441
-Can I come in for a second?
-Sure.

875
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,693
-Come on in.
-Okay.

876
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,528
What's up?

877
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,864
Do you know how to style hair?

878
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,741
-I'm not really good at it.
-Really?

879
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,700
Yes.

880
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,328
-Do you need help?
-Yes.

881
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,205
This is my first time
doing a woman's hair.

882
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,456
-Really?
-Yes.

883
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,503
Like this?

884
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,545
-Right?
-Yes.

885
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,632
Press this part down?

886
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,762
I should press this part down a bit more.

887
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,348
Here. Right here.

888
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,167
Are you sure it's okay?

889
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,211
-It is.
-Really?

890
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,170
Yes.

891
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,173
I just need to work on this part.

892
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,800
-Okay.
-This is…

893
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:12,095
-Does it need more volume?
-Yes.

894
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,778
Hey, wait a minute.

895
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,029
No. Sit down.

896
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,614
What are you doing?

897
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,574
This is…

898
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,993
-Sit down.
-My gosh.

899
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,327
Do you have hairspray?

900
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,330
-Wait. Sit down. Let me fix it.
-It's weird, right?

901
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,958
No, it's not weird. Wait.

902
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,877
One final touch, and it'll be perfect.

903
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,212
No, wait. Seriously.

904
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:47,881
What are you doing?

905
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,090
Are you always…

906
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,010
-Seul-ki really likes him.
-Yes.

907
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,553
Because in a situation like that,

908
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,680
it doesn't matter who does your hair.

909
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:58,558
-You'd say, "What did you do?"
-Right.

910
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,976
She just likes him.

911
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,102
Right.

912
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,563
Let's keep our spirits up.

913
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,689
-We got this.
-We got this.

914
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,733
-I really need to keep my spirits up.
-Right.

915
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,027
I think today will be quite tough.

916
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,198
-I was like that yesterday.
-What?

917
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,283
-I was like that yesterday.
-Really?

918
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:16,868
Jong-woo.

919
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,078
-That's sad.
-Jong-woo.

920
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,914
When I came back with my bag.

921
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,790
Yes. That feels…

922
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,417
I can relate.

923
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,462
-Doesn't the bag feel heavier?
-Right.

924
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,671
My bag felt really heavy.

925
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,424
-I felt the same thing yesterday.
-You get it, right?

926
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,383
Yes.

927
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,012
-It's okay.
-It's so…

928
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,013
It's okay.

929
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,474
If something good happens when you're sad,

930
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:41,684
-you'll feel better.
-It'll feel way better.

931
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:42,727
Right.

932
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:45,396
What if things work out for Jong-woo,

933
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,981
and he cries over there?

934
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:51,110
He'll be like, "I can finally leave!"

935
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,196
I think he might.

936
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:56,032
It could happen
under the right circumstances.

937
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,702
But don't cry in front of the fire.
It will really feel like hell.

938
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,164
Like a fiery hell.

939
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,416
I don't think I'll be able
to control myself.

940
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,335
-I think it would be nice.
-Yes.

941
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,967
I'm curious how things will be
once they're back.

942
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:14,926
-Me too.
-Same.

943
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,803
I want to know who she went with.

944
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:17,845
-Right.
-Me too.

945
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,598
-They'll come in together.
-Run to her and carry her bag.

946
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,060
What if the guy is carrying it,
do I snatch it from him?

947
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,895
-Yes. Just snatch it.
-Yes?

948
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,981
-No.
-That's too much.

949
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:32,485
-We have a lot of time.
-Right. There's still time.

950
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,659
But Seul-ki is really into
Jin-young right now.

951
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,414
-We're back.
-We're back.

952
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,915
Watch your step.

953
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:46,916
Be careful.

954
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,085
Watch your step, Seo-eun.

955
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,214
Are we too far away?

956
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,718
-It's fine.
-It's fine. We have our own pace.

957
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,596
Right. Go slowly at your own pace.

958
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,098
We have our own pace.

959
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,435
Do you hear them?

960
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,645
Do you hear them coming?

961
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,315
Shall we go out?

962
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,735
We're back.

963
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,111
We're back!

964
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,530
Oh, my gosh.

965
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,165
Those two are slow coming back.

966
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:30,835
Did you have fun?

967
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:33,129
-Yes, we're back.
-Hi.

968
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,964
-Hello.
-Hello.

969
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,676
Did you get a good rest?

970
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:40,970
Yes, of course.

971
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,058
-Hi.
-Hello.

972
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,517
-Did you have fun?
-Yes.

973
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,560
Yes.

974
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,937
Are you guys wearing matching outfits?

975
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,065
-No.
-No, he copied me.

976
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,484
-He copied you?
-No, she did.

977
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,488
Did you have fun?

978
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,530
I'm back.

979
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,368
Shall we head inside to listen, then?

980
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,578
About how it was.

981
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,831
Listen to what exactly?

982
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,918
How were your dates?

983
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,837
We had a lot of fun.

984
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,631
I think they would have been loud.

985
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,550
We just talked nonsense.

986
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,053
But it was really fun.

987
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,639
It was fun, and we had
a deep conversation as well.

988
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,475
And I was actually surprised.

989
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,895
-We went to an amusement park.
-Really?

990
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,355
-There was one there?
-Yes.

991
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,356
-Really?
-I mean,

992
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,149
it went up like this,

993
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,318
-then it suddenly flipped and turned.
-Really?

994
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,403
It turned like this.

995
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,447
But then there's this thing,

996
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,949
that goes like this.

997
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:46,119
-I can't do that. I have to hold on.
-Really?

998
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,499
I think Dong-woo
might've done something active.

999
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:55,670
-What did you do?
-I think I know what that smile means.

1000
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,631
It's something about
Nadine's personal information…

1001
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,092
-It's something surprising. Honestly.
-I knew it.

1002
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,427
It's really…

1003
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,636
Is it that surprising?

1004
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,556
I thought she was really amazing.

1005
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,851
-She's truly amazing.
-I'm getting so curious.

1006
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,061
I think it's crazy.

1007
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,606
-How was it? Did you have fun?
-I did.

1008
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,400
-Did you talk in English?
-Yes.

1009
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,695
-That's cool.
-We talked in English.

1010
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:23,322
Since we were speaking English,
I just said everything.

1011
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,908
-That's nice.
-That must've relieved some frustration.

1012
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,119
Yes. He understood everything.

1013
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,372
-That's a plus.
-He seemed

1014
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,458
-confident.
-Confident?

1015
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,460
-Confidence.
-Confidence.

1016
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,253
-He has confidence.
-He's very confident.

1017
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:42,633
So you had a good time.
And Seul-ki, I'm so curious.

1018
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,469
-Right.
-Look at her face.

1019
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,804
-No, please.
-I love watching people's faces.

1020
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,097
-Really?
-You seem different.

1021
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,891
Did you swim yesterday?

1022
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:50,850
Yes.

1023
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,980
Were there a lot of
surprising things about him?

1024
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:59,776
Yes, some things were unexpected.

1025
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,778
How did you feel when he told you his job?

1026
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:06,282
I wasn't too surprised,
but it was still unexpected.

1027
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,575
I see.

1028
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,786
What about his age?

1029
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,206
He was about the age I expected him to be.

1030
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,334
You guessed pretty well.

1031
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,293
Yes.

1032
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,005
Jin-young was different
from what I had expected.

1033
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,758
The person you were with
wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1034
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,761
-Same.
-I was totally off on that.

1035
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,307
So did you two have fun?

1036
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:35,019
Yeah. I mean, it was my first time there,

1037
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,021
so it was interesting.

1038
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,105
Did you talk a lot?

1039
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,275
Talk? Well…

1040
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,155
I think I talked a lot more
than when I was here.

1041
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,908
How do you feel,
now that you know her better?

1042
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,867
Know her better?

1043
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:53,287
Well, I got to know
her personal information,

1044
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,998
but I don't think much has changed.

1045
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,334
Did anything about her
make you like her more?

1046
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,669
No. I don't think so.

1047
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:02,255
-So you're just getting to know her.
-Yes.

1048
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,006
It was your first day anyway.

1049
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:08,219
But you still talk a lot on the first day
when you go to Paradise.

1050
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:10,638
-That's true.
-Yes, we did get to talk a lot.

1051
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,474
-Everyone's curious right now.
-Yes.

1052
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,809
Of course, they are.

1053
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:18,020
-Dong-woo and Jong-woo.
-I thought it was a hearing or something.

1054
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:23,818
Single's Inferno is
the hottest inferno in the world.

1055
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,572
Today, you will be going on dates
in Inferno at your discretion.

1056
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:35,246
Take some time today to get to know
the person you're interested in.

1057
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,087
-You're going to talk to Seo-eun, right?
-Yes.

1058
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,255
-Yoong-jae.
-Yoong-jae.

1059
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:45,423
What?

1060
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:47,383
-He's running.
-What?

1061
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:51,596
-You're going to talk to Seo-eun, right?
-Yes.

1062
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:53,931
-Let me know when you're done.
-Will do.

1063
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,604
Gosh, Yoong-jae.

1064
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,480
That was cool.

1065
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,440
He just took off.

1066
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,779
It must be Seo-eun, right?

1067
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,740
Gosh. Just give me a second.

1068
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,533
-So-e will be there, though.
-What?

1069
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,249
Can I come inside for a second?

1070
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,208
What?

1071
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:22,835
He's here already.

1072
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,182
Seo-eun, do you have a moment?

1073
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,102
Yes, I think I do.

1074
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,772
Yes, I think I do.

1075
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:46,108
-Do you want to step outside for a second?
-No, I don't have time.

1076
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,194
Seul-ki, do you have a minute?

1077
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,237
-Yes.
-Nope.

1078
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,864
-No.
-I don't have time.

1079
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:52,823
No.

1080
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,002
Did someone spray cologne?

1081
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:06,837
That would be me.

1082
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,172
-Did you?
-Yes.

1083
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,342
I thought it smelled familiar.
