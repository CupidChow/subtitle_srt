We will now have our newest members,
Se-jun and Min-su, choose

16
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:01,019
who they would like
to go to Paradise with.

SE-JUN AND MIN-SU PARADISE COUPLE MATCHING

00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,231
SE-JUN

19
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,155
MIN-SU

20
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,667
On my first day, I was interested in…

21
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,627
SE-JUN

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,129
The person whom I felt the most
for was Se-jeong.

23
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,340
Are you naturally positive?

24
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,383
-Sort of?
-I think I tend to be.

25
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,677
There's a saying,
"Man proposes, God disposes."

26
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,513
-I'm the same way.
-I see.

27
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,515
-Interesting. We have similar values.
-Yes.

28
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,891
I'm curious about her.

29
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,936
If we get to talk more,
we might find a lot in common.

30
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,230
That's what I was thinking at the time.

31
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,606
I had a lot on my mind

32
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,484
because I was about 70% sure

33
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,278
that I was going to go with Se-jeong.

34
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,533
But that somewhat changed after talking.

35
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,537
5 HOURS EARLIER

36
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,247
Se-jun and Min-su.

37
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,292
Please take some time
with every member of the opposite sex

38
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,378
and get to know each other.

39
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,756
After having conversations with everyone,

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,259
there were some who were memorable.

41
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,304
The more I talk, the more unsure I become.

42
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,975
She's constantly on my mind,
and she keeps catching my eye.

43
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,604
To be honest, I felt really torn
because of these emotions.

44
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,441
So they did get to talk to each other.

45
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,526
HANHAE, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

46
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,069
I see. They were given time.

47
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,946
-He must feel conflicted…
-Yes.

48
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,489
-…about who to go with.
-Right?

49
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,581
Do you have any idea about
who Se-jun would choose?

50
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,832
I think it's either

51
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,085
Se-jeong or Nadine.

52
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,753
-Me too.
-Because he said…

53
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,798
-I got the feeling.
-…he was most curious about Nadine

54
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,259
when he talked to me.

55
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,344
-What? No way.
-And--

56
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,265
And he said
he felt comfortable with Se-jeong.

57
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,808
'Cause they talked yesterday.

58
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,228
-Right.
-But I asked Se-jun too.

59
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,231
He said he'd choose someone
who's been on his mind.

60
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,941
That's a unique way to put it.

61
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,318
Someone on his mind?

62
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,904
Someone who's been on his mind.

63
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,572
The way he worded it is exciting.

64
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,869
The person I would like to go
to Paradise with is…

65
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:28,124
The person Se-jun
would like to go to Paradise with is…

66
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,424
I choose

67
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,718
So-e.

68
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,349
So-e?

69
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,393
That person is So-e.

70
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,730
-So-e, pack your belongings for Paradise.
-What?

71
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,814
That person is So-e.

72
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,235
-So-e, pack your things for Paradise…
-What?

73
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,403
…and come out to the campfire.

74
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,988
-So-e?
-So-e?

75
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,989
So-e?

76
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,867
Really?

77
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,499
-That was unexpected.
-Truly.

78
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,417
His type is someone who looks sharp.

79
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,128
-She's the opposite.
-He picked the complete opposite.

80
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,339
-This is amazing.
-So-e!

81
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,176
-Let's go.
-Paradise, let's go.

82
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,178
-So-e.
-Have a good time.

83
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,390
-You're going to Paradise.
-Have fun!

84
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,724
Have a good time, So-e.

85
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,518
Eat lots of delicious food.

86
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,727
Bye.

87
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,687
-Bye.
-Bye.

88
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,989
-Se-jeong…
-Things aren't going well for her.

89
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,282
I think she…

90
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,908
She was hoping it would be her.

91
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,103
-Do we go this way?
-Yes, I think this is the way out.

92
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,939
You look nice.

93
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,775
You…

94
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,863
I chose you for two reasons.

95
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,948
-Okay.
-But I'll tell you later.

96
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,200
Okay. Yes, all right.

97
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,828
-Do you need help with your bag?
-You mean this?

98
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,498
-Do you need help?
-Do you need help?

99
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,334
Gosh, So-e.

100
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,046
-She's bewildered.
-She's like, "Should I be happy or not?"

101
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,756
I think that's how she feels.

102
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,051
So-e expressed her feelings
to Yoong-jae in such detail.

103
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,762
But now that she's going
with someone else,

104
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,805
for her to say, "Yay!" would be a bit…

105
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,474
-It would be a bit much.
-Right.

106
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,434
-Yes, that would've been weird.
-"Yay!"

107
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,777
My first impression of Yoong-jae was good.

108
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,114
So I was thinking that I wanted to go
with Yoong-jae even before talking to him.

109
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,410
But after talking with all five men,
I changed my mind.

110
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,662
The person I want to go with now is

111
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,998
someone who I thought
wouldn't be compatible with me

112
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,125
based on first impressions.

113
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,754
But after talking to him,
we connected well unexpectedly.

114
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,965
So I thought we might have fun
after getting to know each other.

115
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,009
That's why I chose him.

116
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,305
The person I would like to go
to Paradise with is…

117
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,058
Jong-woo or Han-bin.

118
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,392
-Han-bin.
-Yes.

119
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,150
Something tells me
it's going to be Jin-young.

120
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:47,198
The person Min-su would like to go
to Paradise with is…

121
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,080
Jin-young.

122
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,835
Jin-young.

123
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,840
Jin-young, pack your things for Paradise
and come out to the campfire.

124
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,134
I mean…

125
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,511
Have a good time.

126
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,304
You said you'd cook for us today.

127
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,850
-Gosh, that's strange.
-As soon as you got here.

128
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,685
What is it about him that women like?

129
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,729
-Gosh.
-He's Mr. Popular.

130
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,273
Jin-young is just…

131
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,358
I mean, all he does is go to Paradise.

132
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,526
He's really popular.

133
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,569
Seriously.

134
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,257
It feels like I have
sandbags attached to my feet.

135
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,510
-I couldn't put my shoes on.
-Because they get stuck?

136
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,554
-So…
-Yes?

137
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,974
I really didn't imagine this.

138
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,059
I don't think anyone
could've imagined this.

139
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,311
-Seriously.
-Right.

140
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,397
-How was the reaction inside?
-Inside?

141
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,524
I didn't know it would be
publicly announced.

142
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,984
The reaction inside was…

143
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,777
-Yes?
-Of course, everyone was…

144
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,071
-pretty surprised.
-Okay.

145
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,740
I was surprised too.

146
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:14,952
Are you okay?

147
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:15,912
Yes.

148
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,333
This is actually
making me feel more contemplative?

149
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:24,420
It's really nice to take a step back
and think about things again.

150
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,132
I think if Jin-young goes to Paradise,

151
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,468
and doesn't hit it off with her…

152
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,386
-We'll see.
-It could be good.

153
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,596
Right.

154
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,599
He said it before
when he went to Paradise with Seul-ki.

155
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,976
Were you there, Seul-ki?

156
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,814
-Wait, do you not know this?
-What?

157
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,862
Jin-young said that
when he went to Paradise with Seul-ki--

158
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,657
-It was impactful?
-Yes, impactful. Did you hear?

159
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,450
-No.
-That it was…

160
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,409
You didn't know?

161
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,453
-The impact was…
-Seul-ki wasn't there.

162
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,082
The impact was so huge that

163
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,001
-unless someone exceeds it--
-Unless someone exceeds it…

164
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,712
-His feelings won't change.
-They won't change.

165
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,298
Gosh.

166
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,009
-When?
-When was this?

167
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,512
-Wasn't it when we were here?
-Yes, that's right.

168
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,598
-Right? I remember.
-But he told me that

169
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,978
whenever he was asked questions like that
he'd just say, "It was fine."

170
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,855
He said that too.
But then that other talk came out.

171
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,023
Really?

172
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,239
-Impact.
-Can I say another important thing?

173
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,241
Yes.

174
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:39,996
Last night when we were
all drinking together, he said,

175
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,416
"To be honest, I thought
the impact was so strong

176
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:48,004
that my mind wouldn't change
unless someone exceeds that impact."

177
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,339
"But now that I think about it,

178
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,300
if little things keep piling up,

179
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,429
I think that could also
have a huge impact on me."

180
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:04,061
I thought that was a significant point
in how things play out from now on.

181
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,315
-What does he mean?
-No idea.

182
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,316
What's he thinking?

183
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,817
-He's just so…
-It's so hard

184
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,069
-to tell what he's thinking.
-I don't know.

185
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,404
I just can't figure him out.

186
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,989
What do you think?

187
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,490
This is war.

188
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,201
She said that with a smile.

189
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,495
She's saying it's war
with a smile on her face.

190
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,372
This is crazy.

191
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,375
This is fun.

192
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,169
-Right.
-It's really fun.

193
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,174
I'm actually glad.

194
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,301
I'm actually glad.

195
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,263
One's gone, and she's still here.

196
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,473
-Right.
-Really.

197
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:45,061
I mean, so even if I was
chosen to go and Seul-ki stayed,

198
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,771
and if they stayed behind together,

199
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,981
-we would've grown even further apart.
-I see.

200
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,943
It's bad enough
that there's not much time left.

201
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,280
I feel like everything
could be taken away from me,

202
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,865
so I'm really anxious.

203
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,786
I'm actually quite relieved.

204
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,996
What are your plans for today?

205
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,081
Me?

206
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,624
I'm going to take good care of her.

207
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,667
Take good care of her?

208
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,169
That's right.

209
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,421
-This is an opportunity for him.
-It really is.

210
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,798
He's so devoted to her.

211
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,760
Yes. But while Jong-woo
is thinking about Seul-ki,

212
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,012
Seul-ki is saying, "This is war."

213
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,097
I know, right?

214
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,015
And he doesn't know that.

215
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,809
-Oh, dear.
-Hard to figure out emotions.

216
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,522
It's so pretty.

217
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,606
You two got here early.

218
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,383
Did he hold her hand?

219
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,676
-What?
-Yes.

220
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,942
-He's so natural at this.
-Right?

221
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,152
The other two are startled.

222
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,821
-Jin-young was startled.
-Jin-young's startled.

223
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,742
PARADISE

224
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,578
It's so nice.

225
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,537
It really is.

226
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,706
What is this place?

227
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,126
Look at this. This is crazy.

228
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,169
SAUNA

229
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,628
This is unreal.

230
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,422
It's so nice.

231
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,048
This is very nice.

232
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,383
-Right?
-Yes.

233
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,804
-This must be the pool.
-Yes.

234
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,016
I'm so happy.

235
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,437
I found it.

236
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:52,980
That looks so good.

237
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,357
Order everything.

238
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,444
I'm a bit giddy.

239
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,655
It's something the girls told me about.

240
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,449
-What is it?
-I think it was this.

241
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,409
-They said this is good.
-Okay.

242
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,952
-Lamb chops?
-Sounds good.

243
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,746
-And this.
-I heard this is good.

244
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,748
I heard the sashimi's good.

245
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,958
They said I had to try this.

246
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,418
-Oh, the--
-Did you know?

247
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,587
-Yes.
-That they've been to Paradise?

248
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,088
Really? I see.

249
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,757
Can I look at the desserts?

250
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,092
I can eat a lot of desserts.

251
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,178
-Me too. Then should we order these two?
-Okay.

252
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,888
-Should we order these two?
-Yes.

253
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,599
-Should we try number 63 too? Yes.
-Number 63?

254
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,892
Sure. Let's order them all.

255
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,270
So-e looks so happy.

256
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,231
So-e finally got what she wanted.

257
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,775
Se-jun looks like he owns the place.

258
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,860
He looks like the hotel owner's son.

259
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,819
He does.

260
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,030
I've never seen anyone like Se-jun before.

261
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,698
PARADISE
MIN-SU AND JIN-YOUNG

262
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,617
-Shall we talk while we eat?
-Okay.

263
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,702
-I'm hungry.
-Enjoy your meal.

264
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,247
Nicely done today.

265
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,414
Thank you.

266
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,668
I don't think
I've done anything yet, though.

267
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,837
Cheers.

268
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,140
Oh, my.

269
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,350
You just downed it.

270
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,143
-Is this wrong?
-You just chugged it.

271
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,688
-I've only had soju, so…
-It's okay. It's good.

272
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,773
-No, I just…
-It's okay.

273
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,484
Even I thought,
"Am I doing this right?"

274
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,112
In terms of drinking etiquette.

275
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,197
-Sorry.
-That was a first.

276
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,198
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

277
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,367
-It's my first time.
-Do whatever.

278
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,368
Okay.

279
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,911
You downed it fast.

280
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,705
-It's my first time.
-Got it.

281
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,207
-You take shots of alcohol, so…
-You're funny.

282
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,166
I see.

283
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,090
So how should we eat this?

284
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,675
-This?
-We have to assemble it.

285
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,468
I'll do it for you.

286
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,314
Thank you.

287
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,988
You enjoying the burger?
Want another bite?

288
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,531
-Do you want some more?
-Yes.

289
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,075
It was good from the first bite.

290
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,502
So what do you do?

291
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,254
I've been really curious.

292
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,589
-I am…
-Yes?

293
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:28,260
-Well, I used to be a career soldier.
-Really?

294
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,597
I used to be in the UDT.
Have you heard of it?

295
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,640
Yes, I have.

296
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,350
So I served and was discharged.

297
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,644
And now I'm a YouTuber.

298
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,437
-Really?
-Yes.

299
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,522
-That's what I do.
-Didn't expect that at all.

300
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,565
-Really?
-Yes.

301
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,566
So…

302
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,277
What about you?

303
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,197
I recently started an online shopping site

304
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,698
that I'm running right now.

305
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,991
And I'm also a model.

306
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,451
-Really?
-Yes.

307
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,874
I'm the CEO of an online clothing store
and work as a freelance model as well.

308
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,293
I am 26 years old.

309
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,464
From start to finish, I'm in charge
of everything regarding my online store.

310
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:10,386
I choose the outfits myself, model them,
take pictures, and upload them online.

311
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:15,015
LIM MIN-SU, 26
ONLINE CLOTHING STORE CEO, FREELANCE MODEL

312
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,184
That's amazing.

313
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,520
-CEO of an online store at 26?
-Yes.

314
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,772
Yes, I guess you can say that.

315
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,363
So what I was
really curious about was why…

316
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,949
-Did I choose you?
-Yes.

317
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,244
-Can you tell me?
-I really did think about it a lot.

318
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,204
I wasn't torn between many people.

319
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,372
I see.

320
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,834
I thought I should choose and focus
because I don't have time,

321
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:46,255
and if matches were about to take place,
I thought I should choose quickly.

322
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,674
-There's no time.
-Yes.

323
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,801
There aren't that many opportunities.

324
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,471
So right now,
which woman are you closest to?

325
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,514
-Me?
-Yes.

326
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,141
-Close to?
-Yes.

327
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,602
Do you mean "close" as in comfortable, or…

328
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,439
The person you feel like
you know a decent amount about.

329
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,357
Relatively speaking.

330
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,818
-Then it's probably Seul-ki.
-I see.

331
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,488
I guess I could say
I'm the closest to Seul-ki.

332
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,616
I see.

333
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,123
Do you prefer mild or salty food?

334
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,458
I tend to eat salty food.

335
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,796
-How is it?
-Tastes like water.

336
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,800
Maybe because it's cold.

337
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,302
It just tastes like water.

338
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,845
There's something wrong here.

339
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,221
I'll make it right.

340
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,347
You're so funny.

341
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,349
-Why?
-The way you talk makes me laugh.

342
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,436
-I should make this right.
-Let's do it.

343
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,898
Something's wrong with this.

344
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,694
PARADISE
SE-JUN AND SO-E

345
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,363
-Let's eat.
-This looks great.

346
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,200
-Enjoy your meal.
-Gosh.

347
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,744
This looks great.

348
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,370
-Eat this.
-Okay.

349
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,998
Start with this.
It won't take long to cut this up.

350
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,836
So the thing that
I'm most curious about is

351
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,089
-your age.
-My age?

352
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,423
-Yes.
-Take a guess.

353
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,009
After I have a bite of this first.

354
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,597
-Okay.
-After I have a bite, I'll ask you again.

355
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,890
Okay.

356
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,975
I'll answer after eating this.

357
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,689
-This is really good.
-It is.

358
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,609
This is amazing.

359
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,361
It's so good that I feel tingles.

360
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,574
-Shall we guess each other's ages?
-Yes. Let's guess our ages.

361
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,494
-Can I take a guess first?
-Yes.

362
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,121
Twenty-seven?

363
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,126
That's correct.

364
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,085
-Really?
-Yes.

365
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,586
-Really?
-Yes.

366
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,798
You totally got it. How did you know?

367
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,633
I have good instincts.

368
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,344
People usually don't know.
They really can't guess.

369
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,887
-Really?
-Yes.

370
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,264
Right. So how old are you?

371
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,683
Are you 25?

372
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,642
No.

373
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,185
Twenty-three?

374
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,229
Twenty-three?

375
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,944
Am I too young?

376
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,237
You're so young.

377
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,490
Why? We're only four years apart.

378
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,909
I have lots of friends
who were born in 1996.

379
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,123
If you're 23,
then you must be a university student.

380
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,125
Yes, I'm a senior.

381
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,879
What school? Is it in Seoul?

382
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,755
-Hanyang University.
-Hanyang University?

383
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,552
I'm an acting major at Hanyang University.

384
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,511
Really?

385
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,054
You should really be careful.

386
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,975
At first, I went into theater
and film studies out of curiosity.

387
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:50,522
But I fell in love with the process
of getting to know a character

388
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:56,528
as well as the whole atmosphere
while on set with people.

389
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:01,742
LEE SO-E, 23,
HANYANG UNIVERSITY, THEATER AND FILM MAJOR

390
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,287
-No wonder.
-Right, the way she talked…

391
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,831
-She was sensitive.
-…her expressions were…

392
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,250
-They were really nice.
-It makes sense now.

393
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,919
-I see.
-That's what I do.

394
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,878
That's cool.

395
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,839
-I think it suits you.
-Really?

396
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,798
Yes.

397
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:22,179
Se-jun, you seem
to have good taste in fashion.

398
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,848
So do you work in the clothing industry?

399
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,225
I'm a tailor.

400
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,809
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

401
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,895
-Wait, like Jin-taek?
-A tailor?

402
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,231
-Jin-taek all over again.
-Jin-taek's here.

403
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,816
There's another tailor contestant
on the show.

404
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,276
1 YEAR AGO

405
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,527
Is this Jin-taek's shop?

406
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,822
OH JIN-TAEK AND KIM SE-JUN

407
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,115
Wait, that was Se-jun?

408
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,451
-He used to have long hair?
-Really?

409
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,954
-Is that really Jin-taek?
-He works at Jin-taek's?

410
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,706
-The long-haired guy from the shop?
-The long-haired guy…

411
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,749
Is that really him?

412
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,004
I work as a garment cutter
at a tailor shop.

413
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,052
I think I look and feel
the best when I wear a suit.

414
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,808
So I thought about making suits myself.

415
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,352
That's how I came to be a garment cutter.

416
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,607
KIM SE-JUN, 27, TAILOR

417
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,694
No wonder.
What he wore earlier suited him.

418
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,153
It wasn't an ordinary suit.

419
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,655
-Right.
-This is interesting.

420
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,365
I didn't expect that.

421
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,658
-Yes?
-But it suits you.

422
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,201
-Does it?
-Your job suits you.

423
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,497
Then are the clothes that you wear
all made from there?

424
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,456
Yes.

425
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,542
That's so cool.

426
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,086
I cut some cloth,
made a few things to wear here.

427
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,379
-Really?
-Yes.

428
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,755
That's really cool.

429
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,799
I see.

430
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,969
-Right. I wanted to ask you something.
-What?

431
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,681
Why did you choose me?

432
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:54,855
Well, in the beginning at the cafeteria,

433
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,107
I thought you were nice.

434
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,569
You were cute and really kind.

435
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,655
Did you find your way here okay?

436
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,658
It took longer than I expected.

437
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,702
If you need any help, just ask me.

438
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,870
Okay. Thank you.

439
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,957
You came up to me all of a sudden
and said you'd take care of me.

440
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:19,504
And I liked that you were adorable
and cheerful all the time.

441
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,301
After talking to you, I just thought…

442
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,598
it would be fun to go with you.

443
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,353
You were talking and…

444
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,272
-Right now…
-Yes?

445
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,567
I'm just friends with everyone here.

446
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,196
-So I was kind of sad about it at first.
-Right.

447
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,575
I don't think it's all that bad,
but I'm still a bit sad.

448
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:56,083
You said you became friends with everyone
and that they all treat you comfortably.

449
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,127
At first, you said
you were a bit sad about it.

450
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,712
Right.

451
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,174
So I brought you because I wanted
to show you that I don't feel that way.

452
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,219
-Really?
-Yes.

453
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,261
I'm touched.

454
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,348
Oh, goodness.

455
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,642
-Se-jun is adorable.
-Yes.

456
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,769
-Never seen him like this.
-Talks shyly.

457
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,728
Right.

458
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,315
-How was it before I joined?
-Yes?

459
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,777
How was it? Was there someone you liked?

460
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,279
-Or maybe someone you…
-Well…

461
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:32,202
-I think I should be honest.
-Yes?

462
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,459
-Originally, I had…
-Yes.

463
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,216
So we were able to choose
a few times, right?

464
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,968
-Right.
-But my choice never changed.

465
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:48,927
Right.

466
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,015
Because once I feel a certain way,

467
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,810
I don't tend to change my mind.

468
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:57,769
Okay.

469
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:05,569
But there was an incident
that kind of settled things.

470
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,736
Something like that.

471
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,698
I expressed
how I felt about him at the moment.

472
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,199
-Right.
-But he said,

473
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,204
"Sorry, but I don't think
I can accept that."

474
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,248
So I just became friends with everyone.

475
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,001
Right, but that…

476
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,004
doesn't matter, though.

477
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,549
Okay.

478
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,968
None of that matters to me.

479
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,220
I was just curious.

480
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,658
-After we eat…
-Yes?

481
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,369
After we eat?

482
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,206
Have you heard
from people who've been here?

483
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,499
Did you ask what they did here?

484
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,001
I heard about an amusement park…

485
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,295
-They went to an amusement park?
-Yes.

486
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,131
Or they went swimming
or talked and went straight to sleep.

487
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,592
But that's such a shame.

488
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,095
I want to enjoy this whole place
even if I have to stay up all night.

489
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,807
-Do you have the energy?
-Yes. Whatever you want.

490
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,101
Anything you want.

491
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,311
-Nice!
-Yes.

492
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,729
I'll do whatever you want.

493
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,357
Okay? Just enjoy everything.

494
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,858
-We'll go everywhere.
-Great.

495
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,908
I think Se-jun's a bit nervous.

496
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,743
-Right.
-For now, it seems like

497
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:40,038
So-e is having a good time with Se-jun.

498
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:45,418
Earlier, when she left for Paradise,
I thought she didn't look quite happy.

499
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,129
But seeing her talking to him
once getting there,

500
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:54,427
I think something good
could result for these two.

501
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,722
It doesn't seem like
So-e has feelings for him at the moment.

502
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,977
But Se-jun surprisingly
seems more nervous.

503
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,894
Right.

504
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:07,607
His anxiety and shyness
are actually making me feel nervous.

505
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,651
PARADISE
MIN-SU AND JIN-YOUNG

506
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,403
Have you been to a place like this?

507
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,445
No, of course not.

508
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,703
This is amazing.

509
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,037
Are my eyes deceiving me?

510
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,206
And there's no one here.

511
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,167
-It's like we--
-It's like we rented this place.

512
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,045
-This is amazing.
-It really is.

513
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,423
What?

514
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,507
Should we go in?

515
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,508
-Yes.
-Wait.

516
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,593
-Hey, it's--
-It's deeper than I thought.

517
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,558
Slowly. Take it easy.

518
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,729
-You're like a swimming instructor.
-Please come this way.

519
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,688
I'm swimming.

520
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,357
This place is nice.

521
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,944
Do you know how to swim?

522
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,155
Just the basics.

523
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,197
Reach out your arm.

524
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,575
Let's start our lesson.

525
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,993
-You trust me, right?
-Yes.

526
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,786
Relax your body. Good.

527
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,121
Yes, that's good.

528
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,457
-Don't let go.
-Good job. Keep going.

529
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,674
-You're doing well.
-This is my first time.

530
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,302
Okay, now stop.

531
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,015
-Hey, you're really good. I'm not lying.
-Really?

532
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,642
I'm officially certified, you know.

533
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,811
Leisure Sport Instructor
Level 2 certification.

534
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,896
That's right.

535
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,232
-Should I give it a go?
-Sure.

536
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,841
They're both laughing a lot.

537
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,970
They just look like good friends.

538
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:05,100
To me, it seems
that Min-su really likes Jin-young.

539
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,267
Laughs at everything.

540
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,936
-And she made it clear.
-Right.

541
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:12,357
She said there's no time,
so she has to hurry and choose a person.

542
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,526
-She made it clear from the start.
-Yes.

543
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,570
-I didn't feel any chemistry.
-It didn't feel that way.

544
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,863
That's how I honestly feel.

545
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,825
Also, Jin-young and Min-su
had a pool date.

546
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,786
But it feels different
from his pool date with Seul-ki.

547
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,121
Right. Before it was…

548
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,289
-Sexy.
-…like a scene from a movie.

549
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,999
Both were pool dates, but…

550
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,501
Do you know why?

551
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,461
The look in his eyes is different.

552
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:38,133
When Jin-young was swimming with Seul-ki,
he looked at her very intimately.

553
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,719
-But he's all over the place here.
-Right.

554
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,805
-Showing off his skills.
-Having fun.

555
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,640
They just seem friendly.

556
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,309
-It's like two close friends hanging out.
-Right.

557
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,145
INFERNO

558
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,813
I'm curious about everything.

559
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,857
Shall we take turns and ask…

560
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,400
Some questions?

561
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,068
-Yes or no. O, X.
-Okay.

562
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,407
-Should I go first?
-Yes.

563
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,327
Let's go back to the beginning.
Is there someone you like?

564
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,168
Is there someone you're curious about?

565
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,586
Yes. O.

566
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,837
What are you curious about?

567
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,216
If that person is curious about me too.

568
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,051
I see.

569
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,345
-Okay then.
-Yes?

570
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,513
Why are you curious?

571
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,683
There must be a reason. What triggered it?

572
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,978
What got you interested?

573
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,980
It was really fun when we talked.

574
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,486
Are you going to actively pursue…

575
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,029
Are you going to try?

576
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,114
Yeah, I'm kind of doing that right now.

577
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,743
I'm not having fun at the moment.

578
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:48,870
It's just…

579
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,291
I feel like I have to do something.

580
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,335
When are you going to take action?

581
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,878
What do you mean?

582
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,340
When are you going to act on trying
to make things fun for yourself?

583
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,967
-Soon.
-Really?

584
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,678
-Yes.
-This is going to be so much fun.

585
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,263
I'm curious.

586
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,519
-Seul-ki shouldn't find this fun.
-Right?

587
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,104
She really liked Jin-young a lot.

588
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,231
-Right.
-Yes.

589
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,524
And then there's Nadine.

590
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,777
-That means three people like Jin-young.
-Right.

591
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,861
He's Mr. Popular.

592
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,156
Any questions for Seul-ki?

593
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,494
-Is there anything to ask?
-There's a lot to ask you, Seul-ki.

594
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,040
-Should be a lot of fun questions.
-Right.

595
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,417
Is there one person?

596
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,127
One person

597
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,004
who's on your mind?

598
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,800
Yes, no, maybe.

599
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,593
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

600
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,641
Is the person you're interested in
currently on Inferno, right now?

601
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,688
What?

602
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,147
Is the person you're interested in

603
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,482
-currently on Inferno?
-Yes.

604
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,571
I see.

605
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:13,705
If you know you have feelings for someone,
do you tend to express them?

606
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,083
Yes.

607
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:24,632
I have a tendency
to go straight toward something

608
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,927
if I get hooked on it.

609
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,055
But I haven't felt that yet.

610
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,557
I see.

611
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,603
Then do you think

612
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,856
you'll be drawn to someone
who's nicer to you?

613
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,815
No.

614
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,402
-You have to feel something.
-Yes.

615
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,239
-So Seul-ki…
-Yes?

616
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:52,827
You're trying to choose someone
whom you have more feelings for.

617
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,496
Have you…

618
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,250
-almost made a decision?
-No.

619
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,920
I see. Okay.

620
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,505
Okay.

621
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,506
Let's go!

622
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,800
-Don't wanna play anymore.
-That was honest.

623
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,886
-I'm just going to watch.
-No, it's okay.

624
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,641
-This is really hard.
-They're going back and forth.

625
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,808
It's too hard.

626
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,102
But I was surprised by Seul-ki.

627
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,647
When Nadine asked
if she was interested in one person,

628
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,523
she said maybe.

629
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,985
And when asked if the person
she's interested in was on Inferno,

630
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,111
she said yes.

631
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,615
Isn't this a big deal for Jong-woo?

632
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,991
Seul-ki felt

633
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,496
-a lot of pressure from Dong-woo.
-Yes.

634
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,040
But reacted positively
towards Jong-woo's kindness.

635
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:39,999
-Right?
-Right.

636
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,585
So I think she's aware of how he feels,

637
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,756
and I think Seul-ki also
has good feelings towards Jong-woo.

638
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,341
But what's important is

639
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,636
when she was asked if she wanted someone
to express his feelings more,

640
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,096
she said no.

641
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:57,225
-So then, Jong-woo is like, "Should I?"
-Right.

642
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,726
"Do I approach her or what?"

643
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,311
I think he's confused now.

644
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,648
Jong-woo was going back and forth
in that one-minute conversation.

645
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,416
This place is charming in its own way.

646
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,293
Can we come in?

647
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,504
-Yes.
-Of course.

648
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,006
Yes, of course.

649
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,009
-Can I sit here?
-Sure.

650
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,677
Sit right here.

651
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,597
-You can sit.
-Okay.

652
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,397
They should be back soon.

653
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,442
You're right.

654
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,444
How should we greet them?

655
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,404
Let's not greet them.

656
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,697
And not look them in the eye.

657
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,824
I'm curious about how they'll look.

658
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,660
-I'm most curious about So-e's feelings.
-I know, right?

659
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,829
-Did something change?
-I wonder how it was.

660
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,122
-With So-e?
-Right?

661
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,170
-You've all talked to Min-su.
-Yes.

662
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,505
What did you think of her personality?

663
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,968
She said her heart flutters more
when she feels comfortable.

664
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,762
When she's with a guy,

665
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,431
and she's able to talk to him
because of good chemistry,

666
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,642
she starts feeling comfortable.
That's when her heart races.

667
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,812
So after they left, I thought about it

668
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,066
and felt that Jin-young
would be a good match for her.

669
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,901
I think they'd be comfortable.

670
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,860
-Right.
-You're right.

671
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,070
-That's how I felt.
-Really?

672
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,450
After I came back
from Paradise with Jin-young,

673
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,537
I felt a bit closer to him the next day.

674
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,415
So if he hadn't gone to Paradise,

675
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,210
maybe we could have
spent more time together?

676
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:51,214
I'd be lying if I said
that I'm not disappointed at all.

677
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,551
But just because I'm disappointed
doesn't mean

678
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,846
that I wish I could change
the situation or anything like that.

679
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:08,856
It's so warm.

680
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,713
-That's the book Jong-woo gave her.
-Right.

681
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,427
DON'T GET TOO NERVOUS
WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE

682
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,721
IF YOU KEEP TENSING UP
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD

683
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,932
SO STOP TRYING SO HARD
THINGS WILL WORK OUT EVENTUALLY

684
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,598
-It's…
-In any case,

685
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,559
if she's tearing up
after reading Jong-woo's book…

686
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,561
-That's a great sign, right?
-Yes.

687
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,647
But I think she interpreted it
differently from how Jong-woo feels.

688
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,066
She didn't read it
as his feelings toward her.

689
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,904
The whole reason as to why
Jong-woo gifted her the book

690
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,324
was because he wanted her to know
how he felt about her.

691
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,994
But I think
she interpreted it by applying those words

692
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,455
toward Jin-young, so it's a bit sad.

693
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,291
Well, there's no way
to know why she cried.

694
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,876
-The context hints at it.
-Yes.

695
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,503
-That's how Jong-woo feels.
-Right.

696
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,715
But maybe Seul-ki thinks
it reflects her feelings too.

697
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,674
You're right.

698
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,720
-It's suddenly humid.
-Humid?

699
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,139
-Yes, I felt it as soon as we got here.
-Right.

700
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,059
Min-su, be careful.

701
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,064
It hit me as soon as you let it go.

702
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,152
-I guess it was all for nothing.
-Thanks anyway.

703
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,994
Why is it so quiet?

704
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,041
-Thanks for everything.
-Thank you.

705
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,254
-See you later.
-Okay. I had fun, by the way.

706
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,838
Yes. I had fun too.

707
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,223
Who is it?

708
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,643
Look who it is.

709
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,602
So-e, did you

710
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,521
-have a good time in Paradise?
-Welcome back.

711
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,605
How about you, Min-su?

712
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,820
What's that jacket?
Haven't seen it before.

713
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,154
-What is it?
-I just bought it.

714
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,615
-Really? You went shopping?
-Is it Se-jun's?

715
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,658
Yes, it's Se-jun's.

716
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,869
-I'm curious.
-How was it?

717
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,955
-You look so happy.
-Yes.

718
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,499
I slept comfortably, so…

719
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:19,547
And we both like dessert so much
that we ate three cakes.

720
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,257
And we had fruit.

721
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,259
-Did and ate everything.
-I really did.

722
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,011
-You both really like desserts.
-We do.

723
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:25,970
Yes.

724
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,722
It was comfortable.

725
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,310
-The bed was soft.
-Right? It's like sleeping on a cloud.

726
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,229
Did you develop more feelings?

727
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,355
A bit more.

728
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,609
We were close here, too, so…

729
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,111
You've only been here a day…

730
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,195
We just hung out.

731
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,032
It was just comfortable
and fun while I was with her.

732
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,199
-I see.
-Yes.

733
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,286
We talked a lot, and since I got back,

734
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:56,625
I think I feel a lot more comfortable
about being here on Inferno.

735
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,338
-And that's it.
-Good for you.

736
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,965
Why are we clapping?

737
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,260
Now it's Min-su's turn.

738
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,890
I feel the same way.
It was a comfortable and fun time.

739
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,810
We ate, and we swam.
We came back and talked.

740
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,146
Did you talk a lot?

741
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,566
I think we did. We just kept talking.

742
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,111
What was the most memorable moment?

743
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,280
I think the swimming pool.

744
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,991
Or the moment you were most excited?

745
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,993
Aren't they the same thing?

746
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,537
-So the swimming pool?
-I see.

747
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,875
-Did you go swimming?
-Yes, we did. We swam for a while.

748
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,710
You didn't actually swim, did you?

749
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,711
I did a little.

750
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,296
-You did?
-He would've swum properly.

751
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,297
Hardcore swimming.

752
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,675
What did you do yesterday?

753
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,011
-Yesterday?
-Yes, I'm more curious about that.

754
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,096
It's a secret.

755
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,766
-Not telling you.
-What did you do?

756
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,184
You went to Paradise, so…

757
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,812
We'll tell you if you don't go
to Paradise today.

758
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,272
You saw
each other's chemistry with the guys.

759
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,732
So how do you think it was?

760
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,527
-Or what about your own chemistry?
-Almost nothing, no?

761
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,697
When we first went, I could tell
that the two of them felt awkward.

762
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,535
But on our way back, I could see
that they had gotten very close.

763
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,287
It looked like he was taking care of her.

764
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:16,997
I could tell.

765
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,254
Hold on. Wait a second.
Se-jun and I shared lots of information.

766
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,463
You guys should too.

767
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,924
-Sorry. This is how it goes.
-Come on!

768
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,843
-Don't go.
-Tell Paradise stories.

769
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,178
-Don't go to Paradise.
-You went on a good date.

770
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,556
Come on. You guys went and came back.

771
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,974
And you smell nice too.

772
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,851
-Is this how it's going to be then?
-Okay.

773
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,145
And you're dressed
in white for the occasion.

774
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,480
What?

775
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,900
The hottest inferno in the world,
Single's Inferno.

776
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:50,030
In a moment, you will play a game
to win an opportunity to go to Paradise.

777
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,491
Participants, please come to the beach.

778
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,743
Let's go, everyone.

779
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,036
This is it.

780
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,706
-I really don't feel confident.
-This is it.

781
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,584
-I really want to win.
-Me too.

782
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,752
I really want to win.

783
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,753
Se-jeong…

784
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,255
-She deserves a win.
-Please.

785
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,214
Please.

786
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,300
Se-jeong, you got this.

787
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,726
We must be doing something similar.

788
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,186
One for women, one for men.

789
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,812
But how is this all connected?

790
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,316
What is all this?

791
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,776
What do you think it'll be?

792
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,944
-I'm curious.
-Right?

793
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,488
There's water here, and here…

794
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,906
It's sand.

795
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,574
-Maybe it's a pushing game.
-Just now…

796
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,784
A duel in the mud.

797
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,077
More like a bloody duel.

798
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,964
I've tried so many things
since coming here.

799
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,174
Since coming here?

800
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,262
We will now begin
the female participants' game

801
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,681
to win a date in Paradise.

802
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,974
FEMALE CONTESTANTS GAME

803
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,476
-What?
-Female participants' game?

804
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,019
Female participants' game.

805
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,271
It's not coed? Just the women?

806
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,148
Didn't expect this
to be just for the women.

807
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:10,569
Only the top three winners of the game

808
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,949
can choose a male participant
they would like to go to Paradise with.

809
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,825
Three of us can go on a date?

810
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,495
-What if we overlap?
-If we overlap, we can't go?

811
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,788
-We can't choose.
-We can't go?

812
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,332
First place gets to choose first.

813
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,921
What if you come in second place,
but your crush is already gone?

814
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:29,964
Then what happens?

815
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,006
Choose another.

816
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,509
-Choose another.
-Do you just go with anyone?

817
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:34,677
-But still…
-So then

818
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,178
the next person you like?

819
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,098
-The one you want to get to know.
-The one you're interested in.

820
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,516
Today's game

821
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,560
is Korean wrestling.

822
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,728
-Gosh.
-Korean wrestling?

823
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:45,771
Korean wrestling.

824
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:47,856
-Gosh.
-Korean wrestling?

825
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,025
-Oh, my gosh.
-I've never done it before.

826
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,026
Oh, dear.

827
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,653
-I've never done it.
-Me too.

828
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,446
Korean wrestling?

829
00:42:55,197 --> 00:43:00,494
First, the female participants will each
choose a ball from the black box.

830
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,540
Those who choose the same-colored ball
will duel each other.

831
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,916
-Gosh.
-That's tough.

832
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,504
-So it's random.
-I want either So-e or Seul-ki.

833
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:18,137
The rule of the game
is if any part of your body above the knee

834
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,889
hits the ground
before your opponent's, you lose.

835
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:28,939
The fastest wins will determine
first, second, and third place.

836
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,402
The person who wins the fastest
gets first place.

837
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,070
Just end the match quickly.

838
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,114
You have to be aggressive.

839
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,992
Now please choose your ball.

840
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,246
Size is going to matter
at the beginning of this game.

841
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,956
Physically speaking,

842
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,042
wouldn't Seo-eun or Nadine
have an advantage?

843
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,209
Wait, also Se-jeong.

844
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,628
-Yes, Se-jeong.
-Se-jeong.

845
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,172
She'll go at it hard this time, right?

846
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,635
-Gosh, I'm nervous.
-My gosh.

847
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,516
-Red.
-I'm nervous.

848
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,396
Hey, it's red!

849
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,232
-Gosh.
-It's a weight-class match.

850
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,734
It really is a weight-class match.

851
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,110
They match in size.

852
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,403
-What do we do?
-What do we do?

853
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,155
We have to do it among ourselves.

854
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:20,991
I'm so nervous.

855
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,249
-Green.
-Both are green!

856
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,209
What?

857
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,336
Wait, what?

858
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,254
-Both of them are green!
-Choose!

859
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,255
Together?

860
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,215
-Yes.
-Together.

861
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,054
-I'm going to lose again.
-How did that happen again?

862
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,515
-This'll be interesting.
-How is that possible?

863
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,767
This is really amazing.

864
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,812
-How did they match up so well?
-Right?

865
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,772
Probably their first time wrestling.

866
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,440
-Right.
-Why wouldn't it be?

867
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,151
People don't do this
after elementary school, right?

868
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,987
It's embarrassing to do
in front of the guy you like.

869
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,532
-But still they should.
-They could win a trip to Paradise.

870
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,617
They've got to work
to go with who they want.

871
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,077
Are you strong?

872
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,121
-I'm scared.
-I've never done it, so I don't know.

873
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,416
This is just…

874
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,042
Wait, Nadine. I'm scared.

875
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,877
I'm scared.

876
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:18,173
I want to go to Paradise.
I've only been there once.

877
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,093
Let's go. Come on.

878
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,428
I'm so nervous. My gosh.

879
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,513
You're both lucky.

880
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,681
You're both really lucky.

881
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,017
You almost had to face the tall people.

882
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:34,523
Seul-ki and So-e both chose the red ball.

883
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,025
Please step inside the ring.

884
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,779
I'm nervous
because I'm not the one doing it.

885
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,281
-I know, right?
-It's weird.

886
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,033
Nerve-racking to watch others play.

887
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,286
-It is.
-Why am I so nervous?

888
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,333
-Gosh, I can't breathe.
-Gosh.

889
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,334
Wait a second.

890
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,337
My gosh.

891
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,755
They must be so nervous.

892
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,048
They both look grim.

893
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,051
Look. They really look grim.

894
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,721
-What will they do now?
-That's how you take hold.

895
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,639
They have to get in a good position.

896
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,517
My gosh.

897
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,395
You can do this.

898
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,063
-You can do this.
-You got this!

899
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,565
-You got this!
-You got this!

900
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,192
-Don't be nervous.
-You got this!

901
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,906
Ready.

902
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,160
-It's already intense.
-They're an even match.

903
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,162
They're already tense.

904
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,462
-Jeez, I don't think I can watch.
-My gosh.

905
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,982
Hey, look!

906
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,067
An outer leg sweep.

907
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,109
An outer leg sweep.

908
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,283
-She's tough.
-What's going on?

909
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,202
Gosh, she's holding out.

910
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,995
-So-e's not going over.
-She's not.

911
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,456
-So-e did well at chicken fighting too.
-Right.

912
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,673
Gosh, she's holding out.

913
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:23,799
Gosh, wait a second.

914
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,593
Gosh, wait a second.

915
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,179
-Wait a second.
-Wait, what?

916
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,266
-Gosh, wait a second.
-Wait, what?

917
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,771
-Wait a second.
-Wait, what?

918
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,694
-Gosh, wait a second.
-Wait, what?

919
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,155
-Look!
-My gosh, look!

920
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,574
-So-e won?
-So-e won.

921
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,533
Oh, dear.

922
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,412
-She lost her balance trying to trip her.
-Yes.

923
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,663
-Seul-ki tried.
-She pushed.

924
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,665
-She tried her best, but…
-My gosh.

925
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:57,666
Are you okay?

926
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,418
-So-e wins.
-You okay?

927
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,920
Her time is 6.40 seconds.

928
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,423
So-e was just…

929
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:07,050
-Gosh, So-e.
-So-e is unreal.

930
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,510
-Good job.
-You did well.

931
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,388
-So-e is strong.
-So-e's really strong.

932
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,265
She really didn't give in, did she?

933
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,267
-Right?
-So-e wouldn't give in at all.

934
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,645
The second match is between

935
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:22,441
Min-su and Se-jeong
who chose the green ball.

936
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,818
Please step inside the ring.

937
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,236
It's like the final match.

938
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,326
I want Se-jeong to win
since she hasn't been to Paradise yet.

939
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,162
I want to root for her.

940
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,413
-For Se-jeong.
-Right.

941
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,206
I want her to go at least once.

942
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,459
Se-jeong's expression is just…

943
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,586
Neither one is playing around.

944
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,963
-They're determined.
-Gosh.

945
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,965
It's a big match.

946
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,889
-You got this!
-You got this!

947
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,599
-You got this!
-Don't be nervous.

948
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,103
-I think they're nervous.
-Yes, you can totally tell.

949
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,690
-They both have a good grip.
-Okay!

950
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,150
They're rather aggressive.

951
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,413
They're strong.

952
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,760
No, Se-jeong…

953
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:32,844
-Wait, no…
-Se-jeong.

954
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,763
-Se-jeong.
-Se-jeong, just this once.

955
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,306
-You got this!
-Let's go!

956
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,155
Bring her down, and…

957
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,910
It's been five seconds already.

958
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,581
-Bring her down.
-Five seconds already.

959
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,417
-My gosh!
-Oh, dear!

960
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,335
Oh, dear.

961
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,879
Oh, dear.

962
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,007
I can't watch.

963
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,718
-I'm going to cry.
-My gosh.

964
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,678
Why won't things work out for her?

965
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,305
Min-su wins. Her time is 7.24 seconds.

966
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,808
You did so well. It's a shame.

967
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,771
It's ironic that all who worked hard lost.

968
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,189
I know, right?

969
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,526
Well, Min-su and So-e slept well
at the hotel last night.

970
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,488
Se-jeong was on Inferno
for six days straight.

971
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,740
You're right.

972
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,950
-Don't get hurt.
-Just do your best.

973
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:41,663
The last match is between Seo-eun
and Nadine who chose the yellow ball.

974
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,040
Please step inside the ring.

975
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,084
-Let's go!
-You got this!

976
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,003
-You got this!
-Don't get hurt.

977
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,046
Come on. You got this.

978
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,340
Don't get hurt. Be careful.

979
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,189
Seo-eun is good at this.

980
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,357
Her center of gravity is definitely good.

981
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,737
I think Nadine plays a lot of sports.

982
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,115
-I see.
-She may look thin, but she can be strong.

983
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,118
But Seo-eun's center of gravity shows.

984
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,455
Yoong-jae says Seo-eun's doing well
when she hasn't done anything.

985
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,541
That's really cute.

986
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,380
-I think she'll pick her up.
-Right.

987
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,590
Ready.

988
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,968
-She got up at once.
-I'm excited. This is different.

989
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,480
Look at her hold out.

990
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,774
-Nadine's tall.
-She's the tallest one there.

991
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:51,817
That's right.

992
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,828
Gosh, Nadine.

993
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:04,996
Gosh, Nadine.

994
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:07,833
My gosh.

995
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,669
Is that a skill?

996
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,587
Is that a skill?

997
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,966
What was that?

998
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,311
Who won?

999
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,354
Who won this?

1000
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,856
What happened?

1001
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,025
-Seo-eun was first to…
-I hit the ground first.

1002
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,237
Nadine wins. Her time is 7.68 seconds.

1003
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,241
-What? I won?
-I fell first getting up.

1004
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,159
-Nadine wins.
-Good job!

1005
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,619
-My gosh!
-Great job!

1006
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,664
Great job!

1007
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,249
Gosh, this was a great match.

1008
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,459
Great match. Like real Korean wrestling.

1009
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,715
-Good job.
-Good job.

1010
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,009
-So strong. You're so strong.
-Your legs.

1011
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:03,471
Here's the results of the game
to win an opportunity to go to Paradise.

1012
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,767
First place is So-e at 6.40 seconds.

1013
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:11,938
She won again.

1014
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,108
Second place is Min-su at 7.24 seconds.

1015
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,193
She's going again.

1016
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:21,865
Third place is Nadine at 7.68 seconds.
Congratulations.

1017
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,534
Gosh, that's so cool.

1018
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,288
I think there will be an overlap…

1019
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,415
No, there is an overlap.

1020
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,418
Min-su and Nadine both like Jin-young.

1021
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:36,171
-Right.
-Right. That's what we predict.

1022
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,214
Min-su will go for Jin-young again.

1023
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,257
I think they'll go.

1024
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,467
-Yeah?
-They're going.

1025
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,509
Really?

1026
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,054
-But the rest--
-Wait a second. About So-e…

1027
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,556
-So-e…
-She won't choose Yoong-jae, right?

1028
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,058
I mean, I'm really worried.

1029
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,225
That would be very…

1030
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,937
-I'm serious.
-The So-e I know will choose Yoong-jae.

1031
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,855
-No, but…
-I mean, really though.

1032
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:57,067
-The old So-e would have chosen Yoong-jae.
-Yes.

1033
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,276
But she got over him.

1034
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,402
-Yes.
-Right.

1035
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,864
But So-e might want
to talk to him in a nice place

1036
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,659
with a good atmosphere, like Paradise.

1037
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,494
-I think she would.
-Yes.

1038
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,621
-I think she would!
-You know I'm right!

1039
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,081
-Think about it.
-She wouldn't.

1040
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,040
-No?
-No.

1041
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,500
There's no other choice.

1042
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,709
No.

1043
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,505
Have you all decided
who you're going with?

1044
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,424
I hate this.

1045
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,010
-Why? Too many options?
-I really hate this.

1046
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,221
-Or that you have to choose?
-Yes.

1047
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:29,015
-Because I have more options.
-Right.

1048
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:35,105
But we just got back
and now we're going again, so…

1049
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,773
Will you make the same choice?

1050
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,233
-I don't know…
-Will you?

1051
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,275
Will I?

1052
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,902
-Will you?
-I'm not sure.

1053
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,448
This is important.

1054
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,076
This is important to Nadine.

1055
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,412
-It's important to Seul-ki too.
-Yes.

1056
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,371
Yes.

1057
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,625
I'm going to have to think about it more.

1058
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,877
Did you say there are people
you haven't spoken to?

1059
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,962
Yes, that's right.

1060
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:02,465
-People I haven't spoken with.
-That's also something I thought of.

1061
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:06,094
-Someone I haven't talked to at all.
-And someone I'm curious about?

1062
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,053
-I see.
-I see.

1063
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,055
That's the whole point
of going to Paradise.

1064
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,142
-Right.
-It's to get to know them better.

1065
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,518
-Really.
-A good opportunity.

1066
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:14,894
You could go.

1067
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,984
They keep encouraging
the people in front of them.

1068
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,152
Go with someone else.

1069
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,737
-Right. Go with someone else.
-Yes.

1070
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,321
That's cute.

1071
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:30,785
For some reason, I think today
there might be something like…

1072
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,745
Like…

1073
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,414
You can't go with the same person
you went with yesterday.

1074
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,041
Or if you've already been--

1075
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,167
-No.
-No, I don't think so.

1076
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,168
None at all.

1077
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,504
-Because this was won through a game.
-It's like a rule.

1078
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,798
-It's a rule.
-I think Jin-young will go.

1079
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,345
But I want to stay here today.

1080
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,309
You been too many times?

1081
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,853
No. It's not because I think
that I'll get chosen.

1082
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:00,315
-There's this specific vibe here.
-Right.

1083
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,234
But I keep going to this place,
everything's set up perfectly.

1084
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,903
That could be psychologically--

1085
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:08,740
That kind of stuff is actually hard
for someone like me.

1086
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,499
What's up?

1087
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,961
I have a lot to talk about.

1088
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:23,963
-With me?
-Yes.

1089
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,049
-Shall we? Right now?
-Yes.

1090
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,634
Do you want to talk for a bit?

1091
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,512
Is she going to talk about Yoong-jae?

1092
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,055
It's about Yoong-jae.

1093
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,598
-Please stop.
-No way.

1094
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,226
What do you mean "no way"?
You all know what'll happen.

1095
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:45,401
Right now… I'm torn between two choices.

1096
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,322
One is someone I appreciate.

1097
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:55,120
And the other is a way
to let go of lingering feelings.

1098
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,664
I don't know what to do.

1099
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,375
But you're wise, so I want your advice.

1100
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:03,419
-I'm wise?
-Yes.

1101
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,347
-You went yesterday too.
-Yes.

1102
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:18,518
How did yesterday's Paradise feel to you?

1103
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,395
How did it feel? How did you choose?

1104
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:26,359
Se-jun and I had fun,
and I enjoyed our time.

1105
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,862
-I really felt so much better…
-Right.

1106
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,739
…while talking to him.

1107
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,452
But somehow, I feel
more grateful than anything.

1108
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,411
That kind of feeling?

1109
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:40,123
I mean, while I was feeling so lost,

1110
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,750
-he did take me to Paradise.
-Right.

1111
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:48,923
But then if I go with the other choice,

1112
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,802
I know that my chances
are very slim with him.

1113
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,013
If I make this other choice, that is.

1114
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,811
But to be honest…

1115
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:09,277
when you think about it,
the time spent in Paradise should be fun.

1116
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,236
Yes.

1117
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:17,869
If it were me,
I would maybe want to gift myself

1118
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:22,332
a different Paradise than yesterday.

1119
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,337
-Because it's something you earned.
-Yes.

1120
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,671
It's an opportunity.

1121
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,216
-Nobody can tell you otherwise.
-Right.

1122
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,175
Right?

1123
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,179
I think you're right.

1124
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,183
It's like a gift to myself.

1125
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,143
This phrase just sounds right.

1126
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,478
Yes.

1127
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,111
This situation is ironic.

1128
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,655
So-e will feel encouraged.

1129
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:54,697
-Right.
-Yes.

1130
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,617
But if I take someone
who doesn't have feelings for me,

1131
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,079
will that place
really be a gift to myself?

1132
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:04,165
The time spent there
won't be a gift to myself.

1133
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,460
But she still
has a lot of lingering feelings,

1134
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,254
so she needs to get rid of them.

1135
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,880
If that's the case,

1136
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:14,008
she's just going there
to check repeatedly how he feels.

1137
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,761
Does she plan on doing that for two days?

1138
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,889
Wouldn't that be cruel to herself?

1139
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,015
-But--
-But I think

1140
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:24,477
So-e saying she's going
to get rid of lingering feelings is a lie.

1141
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,688
-Right.
-It's just an excuse to go.

1142
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:27,647
Right.

1143
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,526
I don't think I'll be able to watch
Yoong-jae's face when he's there.

1144
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,903
-It's hard.
-I think Seo-eun is so relaxed.

1145
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,238
-Why is she so relaxed?
-Right?

1146
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,490
-She knows.
-She's just that kind of person.

1147
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,618
If I were Seo-eun,
I'd say, "Sure, do whatever you want."

1148
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,370
-"Go ahead."
-Right.

1149
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,748
If So-e is the type to express
her feelings to that extent,

1150
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,167
-I'd just tell her, "Go with Yoong-jae."
-Yes.

1151
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,127
"Just go."

1152
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,337
-"Go ahead, So-e."
-Because we all know

1153
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,089
-So-e had the hardest time.
-Yes.

1154
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,382
Go swim.

1155
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,425
-Do whatever.
-No.

1156
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,509
So-e, no.

1157
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,468
No.

1158
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,970
No, I'd like them to go.

1159
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,096
-So-e, no.
-They have to.

1160
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,764
-No, So-e. Just go.
-Go.

1161
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,808
-Going is good…
-Do whatever you want.

1162
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,437
-Nadine.
-Yes?

1163
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,314
Is there someone you have in mind?

1164
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,190
-Yes.
-You've decided?

1165
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,859
-Yes.
-Really?

1166
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,864
I'm not sure if I should go
with the person I'm sure about

1167
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,699
or if I should try someone else.

1168
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,576
This is hard.

1169
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:24,954
It's too early.

1170
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,915
You kind of came during, like midway.

1171
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:32,170
Since you came later,
getting to know other people isn't bad.

1172
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,341
I'm going to go bring a jacket.

1173
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:37,842
Are you cold?

1174
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,385
-No.
-Are you sure?

1175
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,974
Nadine is so cute.

1176
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,643
-So cute.
-So cute.

1177
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,769
I like Nadine.

1178
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,979
Trying to get Min-su to take someone else.

1179
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:52,857
Wanna play cubes?

1180
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,233
-What?
-Wanna play cubes?

1181
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,193
-Cubes.
-Count me out.

1182
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,778
-Count you out?
-Yes.

1183
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,196
I have too much on my mind.

1184
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,656
-Really?
-Yes.

1185
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,616
I don't know what to do.

1186
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,410
I needed to win first place.

1187
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,205
I should've gotten first place.

1188
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:11,959
So I guess
you have everybody ranked in your mind?

1189
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:17,215
I mean, I want to go
with someone whom I really like.

1190
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,257
Right.

1191
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,511
-But that might not be possible.
-Right.

1192
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,970
So I'm a bit worried.

1193
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,181
-Because he could leave first.
-Yes.

1194
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,309
Actually, I'm very worried.

1195
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,193
So is this Seul-ki's spot?

1196
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,779
-That's Seul-ki's spot.
-I see.

1197
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,489
Hey, she must've read the book.

1198
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,825
Maybe she didn't read it.

1199
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,243
-I think she did.
-She did.

1200
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,494
-She did?
-She did.

1201
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,578
She did?

1202
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,498
-That's good.
-You're so happy.

1203
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,457
No, I'm not.

1204
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,294
She said she didn't read it the first day.

1205
01:01:56,003 --> 01:02:00,717
Jong-woo, are your feelings
for one person usually so strong?

1206
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,634
Yes, I don't--

1207
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,302
-You don't get swayed?
-I don't.

1208
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,598
I think everyone tries to be like that.

1209
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:12,186
I think I can try
and be a little braver while I'm here.

1210
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:21,529
-Sorry.
-Hi.

1211
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:22,488
Is he still in?

1212
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,531
Yes, I think so.

1213
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,783
I haven't seen him come out yet.

1214
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:27,660
Why?

1215
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,496
I want to talk to Jin-young.

1216
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,290
What should I do?

1217
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,381
-What should I do?
-Why is this so funny?

1218
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,382
Should I wait?

1219
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,888
-Gosh, what should I do?
-What else can you do, but wait?

1220
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,806
Should I just talk to him?
What should I do?

1221
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,183
I'll go in with you.

1222
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:53,186
-Hi.
-No, that's not it.

1223
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,562
-For everything to go well--
-Hi.

1224
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,441
-Those things we get from temples.
-Right.

1225
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,155
Do you want to go get water?

1226
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,407
-Okay.
-Maybe the both of you?

1227
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,791
Se-jeong was also trying.

1228
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,376
-He's so popular.
-Seriously.

1229
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,253
-Four people like Jin-young?
-Yes.

1230
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,047
Things aren't working out.

1231
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,007
Everything is too complicated.

1232
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,718
Jin-young really shook things up.

1233
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:26,928
-Seriously.
-Right?

1234
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,270
It's been a while since we last talked.

1235
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,690
-Thank you for coming.
-Sure.

1236
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,067
Thank you.

1237
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,490
How was Paradise yesterday?

1238
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,616
Paradise? Yesterday?

1239
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:51,369
-Well, I think Paradise is just…
-Yes.

1240
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,496
-Always nice?
-It's a nice place.

1241
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:54,789
A nice place.

1242
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,334
How do you feel?

1243
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,794
I feel…

1244
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,673
It wasn't completely comfortable there.

1245
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,509
-I think that's how it was.
-I see.

1246
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,429
I think the flow of everything
gets interrupted

1247
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,890
whenever I go somewhere like that.

1248
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:17,353
People weren't like this at first.

1249
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,522
It became like this once you got here.

1250
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,606
-Really?
-Yes.

1251
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:27,029
People actively go outside now.
Like us right now.

1252
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:31,117
So the flow gets interrupted
while people are talking.

1253
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,160
You kind of mixed everything up.

1254
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,705
You just mixed it all up.

1255
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,416
-It's hard.
-That sounds difficult.

1256
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,376
It's really difficult.

1257
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:42,044
So difficult.

1258
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:50,052
Things were pretty simple
for me here this whole time.

1259
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,805
I was having fun with friends.

1260
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,770
But now, I feel like
it shouldn't be so simple.

1261
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,273
Especially today.

1262
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,525
I think it started today.

1263
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,153
The change in the way I feel.

1264
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:12,199
I think the situation
is more complicated than I thought.

1265
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,743
-Here, I mean.
-The situation?

1266
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,540
It's not complicated for you, is it?

1267
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,709
It's complicated for me too.

1268
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,544
-Really?
-Yes, it is.

1269
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,380
What's complicated? Can you tell me?

1270
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,843
Whenever I talk to new people,

1271
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,721
the feelings I get
are all a bit different.

1272
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:34,764
So I don't know

1273
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:39,477
if it means
that I like a person who makes me curious,

1274
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,897
or if I like a person
who makes my heart race,

1275
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,609
or if I like a person who I have fun with.

1276
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,529
I don't think I've set the standards yet.

1277
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,575
So this means you like three people?

1278
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,083
I'm curious.

1279
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:08,255
Nadine, you're someone I'm curious about.

1280
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,009
-Me?
-Yes.

1281
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,559
And I think you're charming as well.

1282
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,238
The ocean's so nice.

1283
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,075
The weather is a bit not good, but…

1284
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,538
Yes, water is just…

1285
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,498
Do you know the movie Jurassic World?

1286
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:45,292
-Jurassic World?
-Yes, Jurassic World.

1287
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:46,252
Look behind you.

1288
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,170
It's totally like Jurassic World.

1289
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:51,090
Hey, you're right!

1290
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,175
It's that kind of vibe.

1291
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,639
Have you heard of the movie If Only?

1292
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:00,933
-Yes.
-No.

1293
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:01,976
You don't know it?

1294
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:03,644
Kind of like, how should I put this?

1295
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,438
It's like a melodrama, but…

1296
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,023
I like melodramas.

1297
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,941
Romance and melodrama are different.

1298
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:09,984
-Different?
-Yes.

1299
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,570
How so? I'm not sure
what the difference is.

1300
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,405
Melodrama is like…

1301
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,074
Romance and melodrama?

1302
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,993
Really? Is melo a romance?

1303
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:25,583
Hello.

1304
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,879
-Welcome.
-It's so cold.

1305
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,430
-Aren't you cold? Take my blanket.
-No, I'm fine.

1306
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,223
-You look cold too.
-Use it. Gotta go.

1307
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,850
-Leaving?
-There's one right here.

1308
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:44,185
-There's one more.
-It's okay.

1309
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:45,144
I'm going to run.

1310
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,026
You're here.

1311
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,694
Yes. Have you heard?

1312
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:54,653
Min-su.

1313
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,035
Nadine.

1314
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,995
Where have you been?

1315
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,664
Me? Beach.

1316
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,209
-Beach.
-Gosh, it's warm.

1317
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,627
Where's Jin-young?

1318
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,213
He's talking to Min-su.

1319
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,506
He went to talk to her?

1320
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:14,757
He thought it was nice.

1321
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,510
Min-su came by.

1322
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,430
-Were you talking to Jin-young?
-Yes.

1323
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,474
With Jin-young.

1324
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:33,359
To be honest,
I don't know what Jin-young is thinking

1325
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,069
or what…

1326
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:38,280
I just have no idea what he's thinking!

1327
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,075
I can't figure him out at all.

1328
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:45,913
I can't figure him out,
and I think he's confusing me,

1329
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,792
so my feelings are a bit complicated.

1330
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,294
I think they became
more complicated at the time.

1331
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,506
-She must have been really frustrated.
-Yes.

1332
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:57,883
Hey, this means Jong-woo has a chance.

1333
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,678
This is really Jong-woo's chance.

1334
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:02,012
It really is.

1335
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,307
Jong-woo.

1336
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,643
Can we talk for a bit?

1337
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:10,563
I heard you read the book.

1338
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,023
-Yes.
-Nadine told me.

1339
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,445
I opened it yesterday and today.

1340
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:21,490
-You opened it just like this?
-Yes, but…

1341
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:25,411
But I read this side today,

1342
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:31,083
-and it got me thinking a lot.
-I see.

1343
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:45,097
Well, first, let's wipe away your tears.

1344
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:51,187
Wet wipes…

1345
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,772
Why would you give me wet wipes
when I'm crying?

1346
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,191
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1347
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:58,903
I was just thinking he should've given
her tissues, not wet wipes.

1348
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,696
That's Jong-woo's charm.

1349
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,866
-That's his charm.
-That's Jong-woo's charm.

1350
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,495
Why would you give me wet wipes
when I'm crying?

1351
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:09,747
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1352
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:13,125
I mean, now I'm flustered too.

1353
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:16,879
Again?

1354
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,255
Here you go.

1355
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,299
You can talk to the mirror.

1356
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,469
I'll hold it up.

1357
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,721
We can't have your makeup
get all messed up.

1358
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,983
To be honest, ever since we got here,

1359
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,361
I haven't had a lot of hard moments.

1360
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:41,820
But I think

1361
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,658
today was the first time it felt hard.

1362
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,330
All my life,

1363
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,876
I've always done whatever I wanted to do.

1364
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,586
And all the things I've wanted,

1365
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:02,091
I've always accomplished
through my hard work and will.

1366
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:03,217
-Right.
-I lived…

1367
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,843
I accomplished them.

1368
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,929
-Right.
-After coming here, I've experienced

1369
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,139
what it's like when things don't work out.

1370
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:14,561
Then I thought of you, Jong-woo.

1371
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,690
I think it must have been…

1372
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,486
really hard for you.

1373
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,905
More than I could've thought.

1374
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,740
-I see.
-Right.

1375
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,747
To be honest, Jong-woo,
I can see the effort

1376
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:36,625
you're making with me.

1377
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,086
-Right. You can see it.
-I would be

1378
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,338
lying if I say I don't feel it.

1379
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,298
Yes.

1380
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,258
Just because I try hard

1381
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:47,636
doesn't mean that I expect
anything in return.

1382
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:53,475
I'm just following my heart
and doing what it tells me to do.

1383
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:56,854
From the beginning,

1384
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,816
I just kept choosing you.

1385
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,610
I couldn't see anyone else.

1386
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,992
I don't know why.
It's just that feeling, you know.

1387
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,414
You doing that from the beginning

1388
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,500
is a bit surprising.

1389
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,878
-I just…
-Gosh.

1390
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,797
I kept wanting to go with you,

1391
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,718
so it was very hard, but…

1392
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,184
Here. Take this.

1393
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:38,979
Hold on.

1394
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:41,857
It's gone.

1395
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:46,528
-Don't cry anymore.
-I wanted to work hard on my own

1396
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,781
and with that opportunity…

1397
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:52,910
-Yes.
-…I wanted to use it on you.

1398
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:56,163
Today…

1399
01:12:57,581 --> 01:13:00,584
I really wanted to go with you, Jong-woo.

1400
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,379
-Really?
-When we wrestled earlier.

1401
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:09,927
If I cry here, it'll be weird,

1402
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:12,679
so I'm going to hold it in
because I tend to cry.

1403
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,015
I'm very sensitive, you know.

1404
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,144
-Let's just cry here together.
-Shall we?

1405
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,272
My gosh.

1406
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:26,610
I'll win the next game. I promise.

1407
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:30,406
All right? I'll win no matter what.

1408
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:40,207
But if you get chosen,
just go and have fun for me.

1409
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,335
I'm not sure that's possible.

1410
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:44,795
-I'd be anxious.
-It's okay.

1411
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,967
I want to go with you, Seul-ki,
so I don't think I could do that.

1412
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:52,970
I really can't do that.

1413
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:57,808
I'm grateful that you told me this.

1414
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,727
This is the happiest I've been
since coming here.

1415
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,521
-Really?
-It's like my face…

1416
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:08,277
-My face can't catch up with my emotions.
-Really?

1417
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,236
Yes. Anyway…

1418
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:13,949
Did you finish your book?

1419
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:16,243
Yes. I finished all I brought.

1420
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:17,953
-I read them all, but--
-You did?

1421
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:18,954
-All of them?
-Yes…

1422
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:20,706
You came here and…

1423
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:21,957
All I do is read here.

1424
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:26,503
I read a lot of books,
build a lot of fires,

1425
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:28,839
and just wait for you.

1426
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:30,424
Yes.

1427
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:31,925
When you come back,

1428
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:35,429
I get curious about what you did,
so I ask you questions.

1429
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:36,388
Right.

1430
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,224
I want to go on a date
with you really soon.

1431
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:46,899
Jong-woo will be perfectly okay
even if he doesn't go to Paradise.

1432
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:52,529
But Seul-ki read the book
and said that today was the hardest day.

1433
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,282
All the circumstantial things and feelings

1434
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:57,534
-were felt in that passage.
-Right.

1435
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,703
When a person goes through a hard time,

1436
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:04,333
thoughts about dating
and such could change a bit.

1437
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:07,044
Jong-woo is by Seul-ki's side
no matter what.

1438
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:10,005
-He was there for her from the beginning.
-Yes.

1439
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:11,715
-He's always there.
-The way I see it,

1440
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:15,677
Seul-ki didn't tell Jong-woo
that she likes him or loves him.

1441
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:19,348
She just said, "I really wanted
to go to Paradise with you this time."

1442
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:22,643
I think we should just take it
how it is and nothing more.

1443
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:25,187
Want to know the truths
and falsehoods of all this?

1444
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,272
-What are they?
-The moment Jin-young

1445
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,775
expresses his feelings to Seul-ki again,

1446
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,193
-this will all fall--
-It ends?

1447
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:32,277
-It'll fall apart.
-Right.

1448
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,862
-The thing about…
-What?

1449
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,447
…the passage, tears and everything.

1450
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,949
Holding a mirror up for her

1451
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,117
-and wiping away tears.
-Right.

1452
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,494
-This will be gone?
-Wouldn't it?

1453
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:43,121
-No.
-I think she'll be able to feel it.

1454
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,164
Right?

1455
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:46,750
I think it's possible
for something to form.

1456
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,546
You'll be going again today.

1457
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:53,674
Two days in a row.
Isn't that some sort of record?

1458
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,225
So do you want to get to know the others?

1459
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:10,566
I think that's why I'm trying
to talk to everyone before I choose.

1460
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,944
But this is a rare opportunity.

1461
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,114
You should probably think things through.

1462
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,201
I think I'm just torn.

1463
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:24,871
-That's why…
-So…

1464
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:28,834
…I have to talk to a lot of people too.

1465
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:33,255
So do you want to talk
to different people now?

1466
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:35,382
Well…

1467
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:38,927
Yes, I suppose.

1468
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:42,556
I didn't have many chances
to do so compared to other people.

1469
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:47,227
-I have to think about things carefully.
-Right.

1470
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:48,395
Well.

1471
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,029
-At this point, Min-su…
-Then Min-su…

1472
01:16:57,112 --> 01:17:00,741
-It might be hard for her to choose him.
-Right.

1473
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:03,994
But when I ask myself
who Min-su would choose

1474
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:05,787
instead of Jin-young,

1475
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,665
-there's no one who comes to mind.
-No one.

1476
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:12,085
-Nadine's choice depends on Min-su's pick.
-Right.

1477
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:15,422
But I have a strong feeling
that Min-su will choose Jin-young.

1478
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:17,090
-I'm very curious.
-Min-su will?

1479
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,467
-Yes.
-How will this turn out?

1480
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:19,509
It seems like So-e

1481
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:24,097
will most likely choose Yoong-jae.

1482
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,683
-I know you want to deny it, Jin-kyung.
-Right.

1483
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,352
But you know that'll happen.

1484
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:29,353
Yes.

1485
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:35,942
Now, we're going to match the couples

1486
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:38,487
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1487
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:41,698
The ones who won the chance
to go to Paradise are

1488
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:45,369
So-e, Min-su, and Nadine.

1489
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,245
Please come out to the campfire.

1490
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:53,126
What if I haven't decided yet?

1491
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,962
I haven't decided yet, either.

1492
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:58,840
I wonder who Nadine will choose.

1493
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:00,467
Nadine will choose--

1494
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,677
-Jin-young?
-Jin-young.

1495
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,096
-Me?
-But there's Min-su.

1496
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,014
Min-su might choose Jin-young again.

1497
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:09,518
-Since there's an order…
-Yeah, then it might get weird.

1498
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,826
LEE SO-E

1499
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:28,620
LIM MIN-SU

1500
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,331
LEE NADINE

1501
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,878
First-place winner, So-e, will choose

1502
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:41,007
the person she wants
to go to Paradise with.

1503
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:53,729
To be honest, I haven't decided yet

1504
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:59,359
because Yoong-jae
is the person I was curious about,

1505
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:02,612
and Se-jun is the person I am grateful to.

1506
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:06,158
But when the situation came up
where all of a sudden, I had to choose,

1507
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,994
it felt a bit burdensome.

1508
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,377
What should I do?

1509
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:27,220
Se-jun, go get your jacket.

1510
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,222
No, I really don't think it's me.

1511
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:32,058
Seriously.

1512
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,397
I think it'll be someone unexpected.

1513
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,191
Unexpected?

1514
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:40,484
Unexpected.

1515
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,701
-You can do this.
-I'm sorry.

1516
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:54,498
Do whatever you want, So-e.

1517
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,714
-She can't seem to say it.
-I know.

1518
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,383
She should still follow her heart.

1519
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,929
Will it be gratitude or heart flutters?

1520
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:18,104
Is she deciding?
Why isn't she saying anything?

1521
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,494
The person I would like
to go to Paradise with is…
