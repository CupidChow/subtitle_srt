00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,103
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,312
Shall we eat?

3
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,313
Sure.

4
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,151
What are you doing?
I thought we were going to eat.

5
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,737
-Take a seat. This is my last set.
-Really?

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,739
Can I sit here, then?

7
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,449
Go ahead.

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,616
-Can you do it?
-Yes.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,617
You're lying.

10
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,205
See? You can't do it. I almost fell over.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,584
Hey, you're really heavy.

12
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,753
I can only handle up to 60 kg.

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,589
That's my limit.

14
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,841
-I missed them.
-A spear versus a spear.

15
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,885
HANHAE, KIM JIN-YOUNG,
HONG JIN-KYUNG, LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,471
-They're like newlyweds.
-It's like they're married.

17
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,514
They're fun people.

18
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,932
-I love them.
-For real.

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,313
We have an important game to play
before we start drinking.

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,358
-What?
-A game to decide who sleeps where.

21
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,402
What game are we playing?

22
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,863
Is that really necessary?

23
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,824
-Is this 2 Days and 1 Night?
-This is a first in Paradise.

24
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,826
-He's so persistent.
-This is new.

25
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,373
-The winner picks where the loser sleeps.
-That's the rule?

26
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,084
-Okay.
-For example,

27
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,545
if I told you to sleep next to me,
that's where you'd have to sleep.

28
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,298
Or I could even tell you

29
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,301
-Yes?
-to sleep on the sofa tonight.

30
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,469
Sure, that's fine.

31
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,097
Or even by my feet
on that thing from before.

32
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,850
-Okay, fine.
-You said it was comfortable.

33
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,768
I know.

34
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,854
The person who initiates
the game always loses.

35
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,022
No, I've never lost.

36
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,816
-Really? What are we playing?
-Yes.

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,734
Then…

38
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,279
See these almonds? I'll grab a few,

39
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,949
and you have to guess
if it's an even or odd number.

40
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,369
I feel like you're only doing this
to get what you want.

41
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,620
Should I close my eyes?

42
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,877
You can open them now.

43
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,799
There's either an odd
or even number of almonds in here.

44
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,262
You can't see it in the mirror.

45
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,221
MIRROR

46
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,806
I can't. And I have bad eyesight.

47
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,349
I can barely see my face from here.

48
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,560
Okay, then. Guess.

49
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,686
I'll go with even.

50
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,728
-Even?
-Yes.

51
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,022
-You can change your mind if you want.
-No.

52
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,858
-This is your chance.
-No.

53
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:36,906
Count them.

54
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,076
This is so annoying.

55
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,578
Odd.

56
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,079
Even.

57
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,455
Odd.

58
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,499
You had two chances to change your mind.

59
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,544
Oh, well. So where do I sleep?

60
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,296
Well…

61
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,048
I'll sleep in the bed.

62
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,509
Meanwhile, you can sleep by my feet,

63
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,845
and keep them nice and safe.
What do you say?

64
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,306
-Seriously?
-How does that sound?

65
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,516
Oh, no.

66
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,977
-Gosh.
-Oh, dear.

67
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,022
But doesn't that mean he wants her
to sleep in the same bed?

68
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,149
You're right. He's teasing her,

69
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,360
-but he wants her to be in the same space.
-Right.

70
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,739
-Seriously?
-How does that sound?

71
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,619
Okay, fine. Your wish is my command.

72
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,205
I've never stayed
in such a nice room before,

73
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,626
and I can't believe I have to sleep
with a view of your feet.

74
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,879
I'll make sure to wash them
before going to bed.

75
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,547
Isn't that a given?

76
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,799
Those feet just came from Inferno.

77
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,304
This is going to be
a memorable experience.

78
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,222
Right.

YU SI-EUN & SON WON-IK

80
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,436
-Aren't you hungry?
-I am.

81
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,063
I'm looking forward to this.

82
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,523
-Yes, me too.
-Right.

83
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,609
This painting is so pretty.

84
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,780
It matches your shirt.

85
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,491
You're right.

86
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,910
Is this the pink shirt you told me about?

87
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:04,953
Yes.

88
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,581
-I think you have cool-toned skin.
-Me?

89
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,582
-Yes.
-You think so?

90
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,085
I bet you look nice in light pink.

91
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,795
I actually brought a pink shirt.

92
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,963
Really?

93
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,507
-I'll show you next time.
-Okay. I look forward to it.

94
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,592
I'll wear it on an important day.

95
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,635
Yes, you should.

96
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,136
Dress in pink.

97
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,555
He threw her a hint.

98
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,224
So they talked about it before.

99
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,184
Yeah, they did.

100
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,687
Won-ik is implying
it's an important day for him.

101
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,231
-Really?
-What do you think?

102
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,816
-Does pink suit me?
-Totally.

103
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,609
It looks great on you.

104
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,860
You look great.

105
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,321
-Really?
-Yes.

106
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,907
I'm so curious about your job.

107
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,200
-My job?
-Yes.

108
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,243
Here's a hint.

109
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,703
Assets.

110
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,122
Assets?

111
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,331
Real estate?

112
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,418
Is that it?

113
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,919
A realtor?

114
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,671
-A realtor?
-Yes.

115
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,756
You're right. I'm a realtor.

116
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,049
-Really?
-Yes.

117
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,093
-You're a realtor? I see.
-Yes, I am.

118
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,887
Really? So you sell houses for people?

119
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,347
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

120
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,724
You handle transactions.

121
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,517
-Yes, that's right.
-That's so cool.

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,437
I'm a realtor,

123
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,480
and I am 31 years old.

124
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,398
Wow.

125
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,110
I didn't know real estate agencies
were so fancy nowadays.

126
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,612
The job looks so much cooler now.

127
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,240
As a realtor,

128
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,660
my job is to act as a broker
for buildings and premium properties.

129
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,121
I currently work in the Pent Team,

130
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,583
which is a team
that provides real estate consulting

131
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,627
for premium properties
in the Cheongdam and Hannam areas.

SON WON-IK, AGE 31
REALTOR

133
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,675
Look at him all dressed up
in a suit like that.

134
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,011
He looks like a totally different person.

135
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,387
-It's alluring.
-Yes.

136
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,308
Do you think you can guess my job?

137
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,394
A violinist.

138
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,066
Really? What makes you think so?

139
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,109
Do I look like I'd play the violin?

140
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,779
It's just something about your wavy hair.

141
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,908
I can easily picture you
playing the violin. Did I get it wrong?

142
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,077
Yes, I'm a freelance model.

143
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,994
I see.

144
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,665
Currently, I work as a freelance model.

145
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,211
I'm 27 years old.

146
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,172
I do various types of modeling

147
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,008
in the wedding, fashion,
and beauty industry.

148
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,261
What's really satisfying about my job

149
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,223
is that I get to try on
all kinds of beautiful dresses.

150
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,394
YU SI-EUN, AGE 27
FREELANCE MODEL

151
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,145
-That's cool.
-Is it?

152
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:41,526
But your tone and the way you speak
are similar to that of an anchor.

153
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,779
So I deliberated between the two guesses.

154
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,031
-An anchor?
-Yes, you have that vibe.

155
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,075
That's what I thought.

156
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:49,992
Really?

How about a drinking game?

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,791
-Let's play Truth or Drink.
-Okay.

160
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,710
If you don't want to answer, you drink.
What do you say?

161
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,295
All right.

162
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,967
You've gotten to know four guys,
including me and Min-kyu.

163
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,846
Among the four, is there anyone
you'd like to spend more time with?

164
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,891
Or are you more curious
about the people you haven't met yet?

165
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,310
Now that I've met you and Min-young,

166
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,980
I'd say I'm 60% curious,
and the rest is 40%.

167
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,189
You're 60% curious?

168
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,567
-I'd also be curious if I were you.
-Right.

169
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,445
So you're more curious
to meet everyone else?

170
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,362
A little.

171
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,782
What about you? You've met everyone.

172
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,950
Yes, I have.

173
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,452
-But actually,
-Yes?

174
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,246
there's one person I'd like to talk to.

175
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,998
There's one.

176
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,624
Who?

177
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,586
You haven't met her yet.

178
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,130
-Someone I haven't met?
-Yes.

179
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,923
Her name is Gyu-ri.

180
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,176
I didn't get a chance
to talk to her at all.

181
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:49,927
So…

182
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,471
-Really?
-Yes.

183
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,057
So I'd like a chance to talk with her.

184
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,646
What? Things were going so well.

185
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,649
But I don't think he's joking.

186
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,860
-Gwan-hee's an honest guy.
-Right.

187
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,904
-I think Ha-jeong's upset.
-Yes.

188
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,281
-Really?
-Yes.

189
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,534
So I'd like a chance to talk with her.

190
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,792
-Is it my turn to ask now?
-Sure, go ahead.

191
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,297
You've been to Paradise with two guys.

192
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,507
Including you.

193
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,676
Yes, yesterday and today.
You've come here twice.

194
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,514
Let's say that tomorrow,
Min-kyu and I are told

195
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,935
to wait separately in our cars
in front of the lobby.

196
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,395
So we're both waiting for you in our cars.

197
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,231
-Okay.
-If that was the scenario,

198
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,733
whose car would you get into?

199
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,910
-You can drink instead of answering.
-I can't tell you that.

200
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,453
It'll take the fun out of it.

201
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,165
Well… If you can't answer, then you drink.

202
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,875
Come on, that's not fair.

203
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,754
-You still have more guys to meet anyway.
-Just hypothetically?

204
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:11,217
We'll constantly be put in a situation
where we have to make a choice.

205
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,177
It's just one of those situations.

206
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,889
Just drink.

207
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,559
-Why?
-I'd prefer that.

208
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,602
-Don't you want to hear my answer?
-Not anymore.

209
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,938
-What? He's suddenly so cold.
-Is he upset?

210
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,191
-Why is he upset?
-He could be disappointed.

211
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,651
Why is he sulking?

212
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,237
-Why?
-I'd prefer that.

213
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,573
-Don't you want to hear my answer?
-Not anymore.

214
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,408
If you don't want to hear it--

215
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,743
Even if you choose me now,
I'll still be offended.

216
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,953
-Why?
-So just drink.

217
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,288
-Why?
-It's too late.

218
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,872
How come?

219
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,626
Love is all about timing.

220
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,673
That brief hesitation is going to
make me think that you chose me

221
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,968
-just to make me feel better.
-It's not that I'm torn.

222
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,848
I was just unsure
if it was okay to say something like this.

223
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,225
Why wouldn't that be okay?

224
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,103
Well, I mean…

225
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,023
I don't want to hear your answer.

226
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,609
Really? Then, you drink.

227
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,528
I can give you my answer right now.

228
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,446
It's too late.

229
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,032
That doesn't matter.
I can answer the question.

230
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,492
It's not like
there's a time limit on this.

231
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,995
-Okay, I'll drink.
-Okay.

232
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,247
I'm drinking because I'm upset.

233
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,669
Why are they fighting over this?
This is no big deal.

234
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:34,342
I mean, he upset her earlier by saying
that he was curious about another woman.

235
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,844
"I'm curious
about a girl you haven't met."

236
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,263
-That was way more hurtful.
-Right.

237
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,516
I think Gwan-hee was
a bit disappointed just now.

238
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,478
Maybe he didn't want to seem
like a petty jerk by telling her why.

239
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,271
-Like a guy who's uncharitable.
-Right.

240
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,273
-A petty guy.
-Uncharitable.

241
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,692
-Is that too harsh?
-Let's not forget Da-hee's here.

242
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,694
Right, let's go with narrow-minded.

243
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,280
-But he did take it too far.
-Yes.

244
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,201
Why are you upset?

245
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,497
Then, was I supposed to
answer the question right away?

246
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,794
Forget it.

247
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,128
What's with you?

248
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,507
Why are you getting all upset?

249
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:17,968
I mean…

250
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,727
Shall we go to bed?

251
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,529
Gwan-hee, are you upset?

252
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,489
No. Why?

253
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,699
I can tell.

254
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,784
-Not at all.
-I can totally tell.

255
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,203
To be honest,

256
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,416
I would've liked it if you said,
"You, since we're here together."

257
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,461
-But you--
-Was I supposed to say that right away?

258
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,213
As soon as you asked?

259
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,966
I could've answered your question,

260
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,594
but I was just trying
to figure out how to word it.

261
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,972
I was organizing my thoughts.

262
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,726
I'm usually not the type

263
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,938
to give long-winded speeches.

264
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,316
When I like someone,
I don't go on and on about why.

265
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,735
I just say I like him.

266
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,989
Do I need a reason?

267
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,077
That's just how I am.

268
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,621
Okay.

269
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,960
If I'm drawn to someone, I say I like him.

270
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,421
That's just how it is for me.

271
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,717
Okay.

272
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,392
-She did a good job of calming him down.
-Yes.

273
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,060
-I can tell he feels better.
-Yes.

274
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,647
I think Ha-jeong is the only woman
who can handle Gwan-hee.

275
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,984
She definitely likes him.
She tells him what he wants to hear.

276
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,530
Why aren't you lying down?

277
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,032
You want me to sleep here?

278
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,242
How about I sleep here?

279
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,160
No, sleep here.

280
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,788
Come on. You can't go back on your word.

281
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,957
But it wasn't settled that I'd sleep here.

282
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,418
-Is this enough?
-Can I at least get a blanket?

283
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,296
Can I get a pillow?

284
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,800
Okay, it's the least I can do.

285
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,427
Is she really sleeping there?

286
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,848
He'll eventually tell her
to sleep in the bed.

287
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,099
-I'm sure he will.
-Right?

288
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,810
-I think Ha-jeong is…
-He wouldn't.

289
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,353
Seriously, right by his feet?

290
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,729
Let's see what happens.

291
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,148
-There's no way.
-That can't be where she sleeps.

292
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,902
Do you snore when you sleep?

293
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,279
I'll snore loudly out of spite.

294
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,616
I'll even grind my teeth.

295
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,787
Here. Apply some of this.

296
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,746
What is it?

297
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,956
-Where?
-Your hand.

298
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,167
What is it good for?

299
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,421
Do this and rub it
on the back of your neck.

300
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,757
On the nape.

301
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,887
-It'll help you sleep.
-I figured.

302
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,389
I feel…

303
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,100
Lie down. I'll tuck you in.

304
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,810
Lie down where?

305
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,563
Here?

306
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:21,151
I wonder what we're
getting ourselves into tomorrow.

307
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,031
Are you excited? I'm not excited anymore.

308
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,157
Worried?

309
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,909
-What?
-Really?

310
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,327
-For real?
-Really?

311
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,037
-She's really lying down.
-Where is she?

312
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,831
The thing by the foot of the bed.

313
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,499
-Kind of like a sofa.
-Seriously?

314
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,876
Yes, right by his feet.

315
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,627
-No way.
-If she really sleeps there,

316
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,879
I'd say he has issues.

317
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,005
Seriously.

318
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,132
I'm surprised she's going along with it.

319
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,094
-We should sleep now.
-Yes, you get the lights.

320
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,265
Whoever is the closest
should turn them off.

321
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,351
No, it's whoever's still up
that needs to hit the lights.

322
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,479
-In my town, it's whoever's closer.
-We go with whoever's up.

323
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,982
-Then…
-I would appreciate it if you did it.

324
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,818
-I'm going to sleep.
-Fine, I'll get them.

325
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,071
-I'll hit the lights and sleep outside.
-Why?

326
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,948
-I can't sleep here with you.
-Why?

327
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,117
I sleep with the lights on.

328
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,369
-Really?
-Yes.

329
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,246
-What?
-What?

330
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,164
What?

331
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,416
What?

332
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,627
Is he serious right now?

333
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,544
What…

334
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,464
You sleep here. I'll sleep outside.

335
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,049
-Seriously?
-Yes.

336
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,092
Why are you suddenly leaving?

337
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,011
-Sleep tight.
-This is so out of the blue.

338
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,472
I'll be back in five minutes
to check on you.

339
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,682
No, forget it. It's too late for that.

340
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,725
Sleep on the floor.

341
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,477
No, I was going to sleep here, but…

342
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,354
-No, I'm going to check later.
-No.

343
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,189
-I'll be back.
-No, sleep outside.

344
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,168
Does he really sleep with the lights on?
What's going on?

345
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,712
Does he wear an eye mask
with all the lights on?

346
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,506
-What…
-Maybe he's being considerate.

347
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,883
I don't get what's going on.
Do you get it?

348
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,884
Is it just me?

349
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,970
-Let's try to make sense of this.
-Okay.

350
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,055
It may feel awkward

351
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:17,393
for two people who just met
to sleep in the same room.

352
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,479
So maybe he left the room
out of consideration.

353
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,815
-I don't think that's it.
-If that was the case,

354
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,483
shouldn't he have said,

355
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,361
"Don't sleep there.
Sleep comfortably in the bed."

356
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,654
"I'll sleep outside"?

357
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,864
-But that's not who he is.
-Exactly.

358
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,200
-That's not like him.
-He likes to joke around,

359
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,119
so he's being nice in his own way.

360
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,122
This is so hard to understand.

361
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,373
What? Seriously?

362
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,668
-Actually, I agree with Kyuhyun.
-Really?

363
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,294
I think Gwan-hee is the type

364
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:48,132
who's pretty strict about following rules
when it comes to playing games.

365
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,969
Ha-jeong went along with it,
and I think that made him happy.

366
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,054
-He liked it.
-So he let her off the hook.

367
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,348
-He let her sleep comfortably.
-That must be it.

368
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,727
-Sure, let's put it that way.
-I'm sure that's it.

369
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,354
I think this incident might make Ha-jeong…

370
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,440
-She might change her mind.
-I agree.

371
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,858
-I don't think so.
-No?

372
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,317
-Me neither.
-I think she'll

373
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,653
continue to play along and like him.

374
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,655
They'll repeatedly fight and make up.

375
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,658
-I think that's how it's going to be.
-That's possible.

376
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,661
What are these? Roses?

377
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,121
PARADISE
YU SI-EUN & SON WON-IK

378
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,748
I think they're roses.

379
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,416
-Right?
-Yes.

380
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,046
If we were still in Inferno right now,

381
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,883
-I wonder what we'd be doing.
-Right?

382
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,761
This one looks like a heart.
Isn't it cute?

383
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,637
Yes, that's cute.

384
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,099
It's so pretty.

385
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,825
-Do you want to play a game?
-Sure, what game?

386
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,578
-How about the word chain game?
-Okay.

387
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,955
-Seriously?
-Come on.

388
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,665
It's a classic. Let's go, Won-ik.

389
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,751
Are you kidding me?

390
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,128
-How about the word chain game?
-Okay.

391
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:13,050
The loser has to say one thing
they like about the other person,

392
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,178
whether it's looks or personality.

393
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,889
-So we have to be honest?
-Yes.

394
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:23,477
But shouldn't we just talk about it
instead of making it a penalty?

395
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,400
Then, how about we each say one?

396
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,318
Sure.

397
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,572
As I already mentioned earlier,

398
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:41,495
you are pretty much my ideal type
in terms of looks.

399
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,165
But I found you
more attractive as we talked.

400
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,875
I may not know you enough,

401
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,922
but I felt that you're
a thoughtful person.

402
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,259
Those are the things

403
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,471
that made me feel attracted to you.

404
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,519
It feels easy to talk to you.

405
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,690
I like guys who are cute,
and I think you're cute in many ways.

406
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,443
I think I've opened up to you a lot.

407
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,446
When did you start opening up?

408
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,574
I guess after we came here.

409
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,202
I see.

410
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:26,874
Thanks.

411
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,461
-Oh, no.
-This is hard to watch.

412
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,507
-Thanks.
-Why are you so…

413
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,550
What?

414
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,010
You sound like a robot.

415
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,929
-Why? I just wanted to thank you.
-You sound like a robot.

416
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,140
Who says "thank you"
after a 30-second pause?

417
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,057
-Really?
-Yes.

418
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:44,975
Okay.

419
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,603
What's so funny?

420
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,897
I've never met someone shier than I am.

421
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,814
-Really?
-Yes.

422
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,566
I'm not that shy.

423
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,484
Come on, really?

424
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,904
Let's be honest, starting now.

425
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,988
-Okay.
-Pinky promise.

426
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,239
Promise.

427
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,617
Okay, it's sealed now.

428
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,035
-Can I count on you?
-Okay.

429
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,497
I hope we get to
go swimming together again.

430
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,957
-Me too.
-What do you think?

431
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,502
Do you want to go swimming with me?

432
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,715
-Does it have to be swimming?
-It doesn't have to be.

433
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,969
It could be something else,
like going to a nice restaurant.

434
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,056
I guess it doesn't have to be swimming.

435
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,974
A nice restaurant sounds good.

436
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,811
-I see. Are you sure?
-It'll be nicer if you act more naturally.

437
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,854
-Really?
-Yes.

438
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,357
Okay.

439
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,530
He's pretending not to be shy, but he is.

440
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:46,453
I really loved seeing Won-ik's confidence

441
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:50,958
as we watched him work as a realtor.

442
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,961
But suggesting the word chain game
in the bathtub was

443
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,712
-a bit disappointing.
-It's called a spa.

444
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,880
Oh, bathtub…

445
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,758
-You made it sound like…
-Right.

446
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,761
I've been cringing
ever since he brought up that game.

447
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:06,223
Si-eun told him that it'd be nicer
if he acted more naturally.

448
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,684
She hit the nail on the head
when she said that.

449
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,936
-Si-eun is usually quite shy too.
-Right.

450
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,231
But she had to lead the conversation
since he was shier than her.

451
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,148
That's right.

452
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:20,279
I think her feelings would've grown
if Won-ik had led it.

453
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,239
-I think so too.
-So that's a shame.

454
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,866
-We're in the same boat.
-But it's not that simple.

455
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,909
In that situation,

456
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,579
being too shy is a turnoff
from the woman's perspective,

457
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,541
-but so is leading too skillfully.
-Right.

458
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,668
So what is the guy supposed to do?

459
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,254
Women like guys who aren't too shy

460
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,797
-and can lead just enough.
-Right.

461
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,549
-They want balance.
-It's not easy.

462
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,634
-Won-ik made an effort.
-But it's hard.

463
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,262
He suggested a game,
but that went out the window.

464
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,514
And so did the suggestion about swimming.

465
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,599
-He's out of stuff to say.
-You're right.

466
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,065
PARADISE
YUN HA-JEONG & LEE GWAN-HEE

467
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,608
-Gwan-hee.
-Yes?

468
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,776
What are you up to?

469
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,238
How are you feeling?

470
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,325
I slept well, no thanks to you.

471
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,493
You could've gotten up during the night

472
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,080
to come and check on me
and covered me with a blanket.

473
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,499
You got to sleep comfortably by yourself

474
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,169
-Come on.
-in this huge room.

475
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,921
Don't you remember what I said last night?

476
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,601
Are you asleep?

477
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,145
Why are you sleeping out here?

478
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,688
-What?
-Why are you out here?

479
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,649
Just come sleep inside.

480
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,862
-But you'll feel uncomfortable.
-That's why you're here?

481
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,448
I'm seriously fine.

482
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,742
There are two huge beds.

483
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,370
I'm going to sleep here for your sake.

484
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,372
I'm seriously fine.

485
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,541
I made myself clear that I'm fine.

486
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,960
But sleep here if that's what you want.

487
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,670
Just do as you please.

488
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,255
Good night.

489
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,808
He was being considerate.

490
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,976
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

491
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,062
Gwan-hee's probably thinking to himself,

492
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,313
-"I'm so cool."
-Right.

493
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,231
Exactly.

494
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,690
I would know.

495
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,192
-Right.
-"I would know."

496
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,443
I would know.

497
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,362
I clearly told you I was fine.

498
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,867
So you can't come to me
and complain about it now.

499
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,121
Let's go and eat.

500
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,501
Bon appétit.

501
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,756
This combination is really good.

502
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,009
-Is it strawberry jam?
-Strawberry jam and butter.

503
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,513
Is my face puffy?

504
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,597
It is, isn't it?

505
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,809
It's not?

506
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:56,726
It's the same.

507
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,021
-It was puffy yesterday too.
-Really?

508
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,152
He's totally unpredictable.

509
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,863
Gwan-hee.

510
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,322
-I love this.
-Gosh.

511
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,492
Jin-kyung is getting tired of this.

512
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,078
-Are you okay?
-I would've smacked him.

513
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,623
Ha-jeong is completely immune to it now.

514
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,708
Totally.

515
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,042
It no longer bothers her.

516
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,712
-She doesn't even care.
-Right.

517
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,552
-The hottest Inferno in the world,
-I'm nervous. Aren't you?

518
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,220
-Single's Inferno.
-I'm scared.

519
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,680
Starting from today,

520
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,725
the two Infernos will merge into one.

521
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,103
This is so cool.

522
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,193
The day has come.

523
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,403
Ha-jeong seems so happy about it.

524
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,321
Right.

525
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,907
It's an all-out war from now on.

526
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,701
You think so?

527
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,460
-Are your ears okay?
-Yes.

528
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,724
Sleep on my shoulder.

529
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,610
-They're like an actual couple.
-I told you she likes him.

530
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,748
-Gosh.
-What was that?

531
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,666
What?

532
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,585
That says it all.
What happens in the chopper is real.

533
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,547
-They held hands so naturally.
-The choppers bring out a lot.

534
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,839
The rides are important.

535
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,889
It's okay.

536
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:10,610
INFERNO

537
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,533
-This is exciting.
-I know.

538
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,457
Hello.

539
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,711
-Hello.
-Hello.

540
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,421
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

541
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,089
-Hi.
-Hi.

542
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,090
Hello.

543
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:35,760
Hello.

544
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,227
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

545
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,818
Hey, what's this?

546
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,278
She's glad to see Jin-seok.

547
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,786
It was so funny when I saw him.

548
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,999
He kept making eye contact
with a grin on his face.

549
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,336
I didn't want people to notice,
but I wasn't sure I could hide it,

550
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,920
so I tried not to look at him.

551
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,341
There's no one here.

552
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,636
We must be the first ones here.

553
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,847
-You said you could swim in the ocean.
-The ocean?

554
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,932
-When will you show me?
-Maybe later today?

555
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,185
Not me. I'm just going to watch.

556
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,521
I could end up drifting away.

557
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,065
-You think so? This way.
-Yes.

558
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,359
-Hold my hand.
-Hold your hand?

559
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,818
-Yes.
-Okay.

560
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,782
-Oh, my.
-I love this.

561
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,991
I love them so much.

562
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,912
-I hope things work out for them.
-I love them. I really hope they make it.

563
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,622
They're like an old couple.

564
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,831
-Please.
-Seriously.

565
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,167
-Hold my hand.
-Hold your hand?

566
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,710
-Yes.
-Okay.

567
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,508
We're here.

568
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,051
I wonder what they're up to.

569
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,470
You'll get to meet new people.

570
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,765
I think I can hear them talking.

571
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,227
Hello.

572
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,771
-Hello.
-Hello.

573
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,939
-Welcome back.
-Hello.

574
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,315
-Hello.
-Hello.

575
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,569
Hello.

576
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,447
They're all people we haven't met.

577
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:20,907
Hello.

578
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,037
-Hello.
-This is so…

579
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,122
Hello.

580
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,542
-Hello.
-Hello.

581
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,127
-Hello.
-Hello.

582
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:42,429
Si-eun really stood out
in terms of first impressions.

583
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,181
We'll be spending time together
from here on out,

584
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,434
so I hope we can get closer.

585
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,395
Min-woo really caught my attention

586
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:54,691
because he looks like my type
and seems like a gentle soul.

587
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,026
It'd be nice to get a chance
to talk with him.

588
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,291
Hello.

589
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,252
-Hello.
-The table is longer now.

590
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,087
-Hello.
-Hello.

591
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,633
Hello.

592
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,432
He walked in with her so naturally

593
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,018
and didn't even bother
to make eye contact with me.

594
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,606
A part of me was mad at him,
and another part of me was jealous.

595
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,233
I stayed in Inferno last night
and had ramyeon.

596
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:41,070
So to think that he must've become close
to someone new

597
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,363
sort of bothered me.

598
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,117
-Hello.
-Hello.

599
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,369
Long time no see.

600
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,370
Hi.

601
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,122
It's been a while.

602
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,583
Was Paradise fun?

603
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,168
It was all right.

604
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,754
I see.

605
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,218
They're exchanging glances.

606
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,970
-My goodness.
-This is already so intense.

607
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,432
Did you have blueberry pie again?

608
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,020
Yes, I did.

609
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,230
I had some.

610
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,148
You seem so happy.

611
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,068
-I slept quite well.
-Did you?

612
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,320
That day, I didn't sleep very well.

613
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,363
I see.

614
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:29,118
Were you guys here all along?

615
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,246
I'm not going to tell you.

616
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:43,508
When we arrived,
Hye-seon seemed interested in Gwan-hee.

617
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,176
Call it a woman's intuition.

618
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,471
It did bother me a little.

619
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,933
-They're here.
-Here they come.

620
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,101
Hey, guys.

621
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,645
Hello.

622
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,273
-Hello.
-Hello.

623
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,650
Hello.

624
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,652
Hello.

625
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,738
-Where…
-You can sit there.

626
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,990
I'll sit over here.

627
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,825
Maybe I should move.

628
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,791
-Hello.
-You made it back alive.

629
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,959
I did, indeed.

630
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,382
-How have you been?
-I've been well.

631
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,634
-Did you have some pie?
-I did.

632
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:45,278
Min-kyu got to go to Paradise
with the person I'm interested in,

633
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:49,240
so I think he could be
my competition going forward.

634
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,409
It fired me up a bit too.

635
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:56,122
I thought things would get
really interesting starting today.

636
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,587
Instinctively, I scanned
all the women first.

637
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,758
Then I looked around
and checked out the guys.

638
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:11,888
None of the girls really stood out to me.

639
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,350
I don't think of anyone as my competition.

640
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,019
I think my charm is pretty much unrivaled.

641
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,688
I think they rival me.

642
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,066
I think I check all the right boxes.

643
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,611
It's like Show Me The Money.

644
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,237
It's getting tense, isn't it?

645
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:32,408
When they were all gathered,
didn't you feel some kind of tension?

646
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,035
-Totally.
-Everyone looked so…

647
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,996
-I held my breath the entire time.
-This is so fun.

648
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,209
How was Paradise?

649
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,086
It's hard to say.

650
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,921
It's fun to be with him,

651
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,923
but I'm not sure if I'm attracted.

652
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,257
-I felt the same.
-Right?

653
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,344
-I told you he felt like a brother.
-But it wasn't like that for me.

654
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,261
Really?

655
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,889
If it was, I would've
at least felt comfortable.

656
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,474
We joked around a lot.

657
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,727
-I don't think he's that type.
-He even carried me on his back.

658
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,812
-What?
-A piggyback ride.

659
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,355
Right, you told us yesterday.

660
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,148
We didn't dare to do something like that.

661
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,317
-We just picked at flower petals.
-Really?

662
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,820
-Even that made him too shy.
-That's cute.

663
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,530
This is hilarious.

664
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,699
To be honest, it was all a bit confusing.

665
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,784
So I'm not sure.

666
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,454
I had a better time than I'd expected.

667
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,666
I wasn't looking forward to Paradise much,

668
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,626
but it was so nice there.

669
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,836
I know, right?

670
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,382
How was it? Was the first guy
different from the second guy?

671
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,717
Totally different.

672
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,928
-Even their vibes?
-Yes, their vibes too.

673
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,138
It was so different.

674
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,559
Are you curious
about anyone from this island?

675
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,229
What's Min-woo like?

676
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,314
Min-woo?

677
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,608
He's a very nice person.

678
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,778
-I think he's a good guy.
-But not your type?

679
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,321
-What?
-He's not your type, is he?

680
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,699
In terms of appearance…

681
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,744
-He's your type out of the three?
-Yes.

682
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,746
But when we talked, we didn't really…

683
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,539
-Hit it off?
-No.

684
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,292
-With Min-woo?
-Yes.

685
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,501
But I'm not sure

686
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,256
if that was due to the limitations here

687
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,342
or if that's just how he is.

688
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:19,182
Now, you'll play a couples' game
to win a chance to have a special meal.

689
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,476
Please change into your swimsuits

690
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,311
-and come to the beach.
-Swimsuits!

691
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,687
A couples' game?

692
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,731
-A couples' game.
-It's time to tussle.

693
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,358
This is their chance to win some hearts.

694
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,945
I'm excited. I wonder what it'll be.

695
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,073
What's that?

696
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,866
What is it?

697
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,535
-I guess we pick from the box.
-Right.

698
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,465
-You look really fit.
-Oh, my.

699
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,758
I shouldn't do this.

700
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,301
Oh, gosh.

701
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,514
-I couldn't help it.
-They're all so fit.

702
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,890
Oh, my.

703
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,573
I don't know where to look.

704
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,879
You will be paired up before the game.

705
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:37,051
Those who pick the same colored balls
from the box will become a couple.

706
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,053
THOSE WHO PICK THE SAME COLORED BALL
WILL BECOME A COUPLE

707
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,181
However, the male participant
who picks the black ball

708
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,851
will not be able to participate
in the game.

709
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,018
Damn.

710
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,771
That's harsh.

711
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,276
We will now begin the draw.

712
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,319
Here it is.

713
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,446
I got a white one.

714
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,949
YUN HA-JEONG, RED BALL

715
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,076
-Which color did you get?
-Red.

716
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,203
AN MIN-YOUNG, GREEN BALL

717
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,330
Mine's blue.

718
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,332
KIM GYU-RI, YELLOW BALL

719
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:15,381
Now, male participants,
please pick out a ball in turn.

720
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,395
Didn't Min-woo and Gyu-ri
have a bit of a thing going on?

721
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,023
-But Si-eun is also interested in him.
-Right.

722
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,995
Oh, no. Come on!

723
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,538
-No, Min-woo.
-Seriously.

724
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,583
-His black trunks were a bad omen.
-How can he be so unlucky?

725
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,754
CHOI MIN-WOO IS BARRED
FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE COUPLES' GAME

726
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,756
-Seriously.
-The black ball?

727
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,720
-Jeez.
-Seriously.

728
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,432
-He picked the black ball.
-No way.

729
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,100
That's really unfortunate.

730
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,520
What are the odds?

731
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,482
-Man.
-Unbelievable.

732
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:15,983
No way.

733
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,074
The odds were less than 20%.

734
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,700
This is just wrong.

735
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,869
How could the first one be black?

736
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,502
An Min-young and Park Min-kyu
have picked the green ball.

737
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,673
Yun Ha-jeong and Son Won-ik
have picked the red ball.

738
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,178
Choi Hye-seon and Lee Gwan-hee
have picked the blue ball.

739
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,179
We meet again.

740
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,932
CHOI HYE-SEON & LEE GWAN-HEE

741
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,477
Yu Si-eun and Yun Ha-bin
have picked the white ball.

742
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,603
YU SI-EUN & YUN HA-BIN

743
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,272
He's the only one left.

744
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,108
Kim Gyu-ri and Lee Jin-seok
have picked the yellow ball.

745
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,069
Don't you think I'm set to win?

746
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,030
We've got this, right?

747
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,283
Yes, we'll do great.

748
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,285
-Hello.
-Hello.

749
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,452
Hi.

750
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,580
We now have five couples.

751
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,547
The game of the day
is to do squats as a couple.

752
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,050
…to do squats as a couple.

753
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,303
-I'm sorry.
-You can do it.

754
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,220
It's fine.

755
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,348
The men must carry the women

756
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,560
and do squats at the signals.

757
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,395
If the woman falls

758
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:39,608
or the man fails to do a squat on signal,
the couple will be eliminated.

759
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,402
I'm counting on you.

760
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,195
We have to win no matter what.

761
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,780
Are you confident?

762
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:45,698
Not at all.

763
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,828
The couple that comes in first
will be awarded

764
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,749
with lobsters and cold beer.

765
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,751
-Beer?
-Should I massage your legs?

766
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,254
How much can you lift?

767
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,881
Do you think you can lift me?

768
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,216
-I like red.
-Grit your teeth.

769
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,719
This is a matter of pride.

770
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,971
I think Jin-seok will be good at this.

771
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,184
Men, please lift up the women.

772
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,519
I'm sorry.

773
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,407
No one would want to drop out first.

774
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,160
-Jin-seok is too strong.
-Show us what you've got.

775
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,329
Ready.

776
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,217
-You got this.
-I can do this.

777
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,221
-Is it okay if I do this?
-Yes.

778
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,267
Your heart is racing.

779
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,685
-It's pounding, right?
-Yes.

780
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,606
Are you tired already?

781
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,857
It's tough, but I'm fine.

782
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,909
I'm not sure anymore.

783
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,211
It's okay if you don't do well.

784
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,299
-It's getting faster.
-You're struggling.

785
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,934
Why is everyone so good at this?

786
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,229
Gosh, you can put me down if you want.

787
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:46,944
How many have we done?

788
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,824
OVER 40 SQUATS

789
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,701
-Over 40?
-They did over 40?

790
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,077
-Gosh.
-That's amazing.

791
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,079
That's insane.

792
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,958
But Jin-seok still seems fine.
I bet he could do many more.

793
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,877
I'm getting tired just hanging on.

794
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,838
How long will this go on?

795
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,340
-I think I might drop you.
-What? No.

796
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,842
No.

797
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,554
-Hold on tight.
-Okay.

798
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,139
-Hold on tight.
-Okay.

799
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,395
Yu Si-eun and Yun Ha-bin
have been eliminated.

800
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,981
YU SI-EUN & YUN HA-BIN
ELIMINATED AFTER 44 SQUATS

801
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,316
-Well done.
-You did good too.

802
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,364
Sorry, Min-young.

803
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,408
I'm worried I might drop you. Sorry.

804
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,913
An Min-young and Park Min-kyu
have been eliminated.

805
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,216
We can't beat them.
Put me down if you're tired.

806
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,553
You can stop if you're tired. Really.

807
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,651
Are you tired?

808
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,486
Do you want to stop?

809
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,071
No.

810
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,575
I feel like a sack of potatoes.

811
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,834
OVER 70 SQUATS

812
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:26,919
Are you tired?

813
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,546
-Seventy squats?
-What?

814
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,214
-What?
-They did 70?

815
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,050
-I didn't expect Won-ik to do so well.
-I know.

816
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,886
-Won-ik is a fighter.
-Right.

817
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,472
He's not a professional athlete.
He's a realtor.

818
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,515
Seriously.

819
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,935
-They're lasting for a really long time.
-I know.

820
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:47,982
That's insane.

821
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,613
Good job.

822
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,031
You did great.

823
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,701
Choi Hye-seon and Lee Gwan-hee
have been eliminated.

824
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,119
ELIMINATED AFTER 74 SQUATS

825
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,145
Great form.

826
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,607
-He looks so cool.
-They're no joke.

827
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,568
-All right!
-That's crazy.

828
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:35,988
Let's go!

829
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:36,905
You can do it.

830
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,575
You guys look so cool.

831
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,494
I want to stop.

832
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,955
This is unbelievable.

833
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,042
-They're at their limits.
-Won-ik might actually win this.

834
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,589
I think I might fall.

835
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,090
Keep your grip.

836
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,468
They're barely hanging on.

837
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,719
Use your arms.

838
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,012
I can't watch this.

839
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,597
I can't do it.

840
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,806
No, it can't be.

841
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,308
-Really?
-Jin-seok?

842
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:12,983
I can't do it.

843
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,529
I can't do it.

844
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,450
-No way!
-No way!

845
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,911
Kim Gyu-ri and Lee Jin-seok
have been eliminated.

846
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:24,828
You did great.

847
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,997
YUN HA-JEONG & SON WON-IK WON

848
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,207
Great job.

849
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,088
-That's insane.
-Seriously?

850
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,047
No way.

851
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,757
I didn't see this coming.

852
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,426
Won-ik is amazing. I can't believe this.

853
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,804
-You're so cool. Great job.
-No way.

854
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,892
-That was crazy.
-That's unexpected.

855
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,811
-Incredible.
-You're so good at this.

856
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,814
As the winners of the couples' game,

857
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:58,237
Son Won-ik and Yun Ha-jeong
will receive a special meal.

858
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,739
High five. Great job.

859
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,910
I thought Won-ik would be
the first to drop out,

860
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:08,205
but he won the game.
I did not see that coming at all.

861
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,959
I was so shocked that I barely had time
to admire him. He was so…

862
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,210
I loved it.

863
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:17,923
This game made me see him in a new light.

864
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,051
Today, the couples
that played the game together

865
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,346
will go on a one-on-one lunch date.

866
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,810
Then, what about Min-woo?

867
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,229
Things aren't working out for him.

868
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:37,526
-We're having lobster, thanks to you.
-Come on. I did nothing.

869
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,737
I take no credit.

870
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,823
-Isn't this our first time eating here?
-I know.

871
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:43,991
I seriously…

872
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:45,909
-Insane.
-Shall we?

873
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:46,869
It looks so good.

874
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,537
-What's this?
-What is all this?

875
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,830
There's so much food.

876
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,750
Why is it so big?

877
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,960
It's so nice here.

878
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,463
-Cheers?
-Sure.

879
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,381
-Great job today.
-You too.

880
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,053
What's that?

881
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,473
That must be the special meal.

882
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,475
We can have that stuff whenever.

883
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,477
-We don't need it.
-My gosh.

884
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,937
-Are your legs okay?
-Yes.

885
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,190
-Are your arms tired?
-A bit.

886
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,441
I bet they're tired.

887
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,194
You must've had a lot of ramyeon.
You were heavy.

888
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,030
I thought I was dying.

889
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,156
Jeez.

890
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,033
I also did my best to hang on.

891
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,077
I realized something
as we were playing the game.

892
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,622
I realized that it was also difficult

893
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,124
-for the women.
-Right? I had to hold on tight

894
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,834
to take some weight off your arms.

895
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,586
Is that it?

896
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,963
I bet we're having sweet potatoes.

897
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,381
The view is nice, though.

898
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,343
What a view to have sweet potatoes.

899
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,303
It's not too bad.

900
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,766
At least we get some carbs today.

901
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,522
Here you go.

902
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,106
Thank you.

903
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,151
-It's okay to eat the peel, right?
-Yes.

904
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,861
How macho.

905
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,491
How was it yesterday?

906
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,451
-Yesterday?
-Yes.

907
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,661
Well…

908
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,913
It was pretty fun.

909
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,797
Did you ask her for a one-on-one chat?

910
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,093
No, that's not what happened.

911
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,763
After you left, I was also about to leave

912
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,849
when Ha-jeong came to my car.

913
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,685
That's how we met.

914
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,603
We talked a lot.

915
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,606
Then, I guess you found out
what was going on in the car.

916
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,941
-Yes.
-So Ha-jeong told you?

917
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,527
-You must've been surprised too.
-Yes.

918
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,320
I thought of you then.

919
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,573
If we heard about it together,

920
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,658
you would've had a huge reaction to it.

921
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,994
I could imagine how you'd react.

922
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,414
I was so shocked
that my eyebrows were up here.

923
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,008
I thought you'd definitely go
to Paradise again.

924
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,764
There wasn't anyone I wanted to go with.

925
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,142
-Really?
-Yes.

926
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,397
I see.

927
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:26,945
You know, when I saw you again

928
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,742
after having spent some time apart,
it felt really awkward.

929
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:36,580
But talking to you again like this
reminds me

930
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,416
of the time we spent together.

931
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,590
-He's so different with her.
-I know, right?

932
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,635
-Gwan-hee seems comfortable with her.
-He does.

933
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,720
Are these two a better match?

934
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:56,099
When we ate together that day,

935
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,019
I ate a lot more than I did yesterday.

936
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,520
Yesterday, I barely ate.

937
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,438
Why?

938
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,023
You didn't like the food?

939
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,233
It wasn't that.

940
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:06,985
It was…

941
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,154
How should I put it?

942
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,822
I think it was the mood.

943
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,782
-Really?
-Yes.

944
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,117
Plus, I was pretty tired.

945
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,454
It felt good.

946
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,415
I liked that he thought of me
when we were apart,

947
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,751
and how he told me what he liked about me.

948
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,962
It made me think that he may have

949
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,631
enjoyed my company
more than he enjoyed Ha-jeong's.

950
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,633
That made me feel pretty good.

951
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:34,471
What do you think your strong suit is
compared to the other women?

952
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,099
Did he really just ask that?

953
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,059
"My strong suit is…"

954
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,270
Isn't that a question
for his basketball teammates?

955
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,398
-"What's your strong suit?"
-I know, right?

956
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,774
"Shooting and passing."

957
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:50,070
"My strong suits are dribbling,
speed and three-pointers."

958
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,114
He's hilarious.

959
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:57,744
What do you think your strong suit is
compared to the other women?

960
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,623
I think I have the best physique
and body proportion.

961
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,755
Then, what do you think my strong suit is?

962
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,673
You?

963
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,553
You're good-looking.

964
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,891
And what? The others are not?

965
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,101
The rest are not.

966
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,145
The rest are not.

967
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,860
-It's the perfect answer.
-Gwan-hee loves to hear compliments.

968
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,695
"And what? The others are not?"

969
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,905
-Did you see him smile after that?
-Yes.

970
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,366
I'd like to point something out here.

971
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,410
Unlike Ha-jeong, she didn't hesitate.

972
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,414
-You're right.
-Gwan-hee doesn't like that.

973
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,999
-This is what he wanted.
-Good catch.

974
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,083
Right.

975
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,002
And what? The others are not?

976
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,170
The rest are not.

977
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,590
Do you only care about looks?

978
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,092
Honestly, the height matters the most.

979
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,177
-The height.
-The height?

980
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,095
I am the tallest one here.

981
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:00,432
-Yes.
-Yes, I'm the tallest.

982
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,941
When I asked what she liked about me,

983
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,402
Ha-jeong tried to avoid giving an answer.

984
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:17,074
Meanwhile, Hye-seon answered
the question without hesitation,

985
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:21,036
and she was more expressive
about how she felt about me.

986
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,538
The difference in their attitudes

987
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,792
made me feel more attracted
to Hye-seon than Ha-jeong.

988
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,962
-He was right.
-He's good.

989
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,631
-Hanhae!
-You're sharp.

990
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,591
-Jeez.
-You know what?

991
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,967
I'm a little surprised

992
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:40,388
that Gwan-hee also has
a serious side to him.

993
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:44,017
He's a lot more calm
when he's with Hye-seon.

994
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,103
He doesn't just joke around,

995
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,438
he seems to open up about himself more.

996
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,565
-That took me by surprise.
-Gwan-hee teased her

997
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,360
asking if she ate
a lot of ramyeon the day before.

998
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,279
If it were Ha-jeong,
she would've thrown a comeback.

999
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,615
But Hye-seon just laughed along with him.

1000
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:02,452
Then, Gwan-hee started to make
fewer jokes and be more serious.

1001
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,538
He changes depending on who he's with.

1002
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,497
You're right.

1003
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,459
So Hye-seon might be a better match,
but from a viewer's perspective,

1004
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,711
he and Ha-jeong are more intriguing.

1005
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,255
We deserve entertainment.

1006
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,132
They're fun to watch.

1007
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,634
But why are we all gathered here?

1008
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,428
Right. Should we just go and rest?

1009
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,680
I'd like…

1010
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,017
to talk to Si-eun for a bit.

1011
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,230
-What?
-He wants to talk to Si-eun?

1012
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,234
I'd like to talk to Si-eun for a bit.

1013
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,494
I'm going to have a chat with Min-young.

1014
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,037
All right.

1015
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,333
Hold on. Can I go grab my parasol?

1016
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,460
-A parasol? Go ahead.
-Okay.

1017
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,592
Did you get a chance to look around?

1018
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,927
No, not aside from the brief tour earlier.

1019
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:01,928
-I see.
-Yes.

1020
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,264
What about lunch? Did you eat alone?

1021
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,265
Yes, at the table.

1022
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,767
Really? You must've been lonely.

1023
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,020
1 HOUR AGO

1024
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,855
How was your Inferno?

1025
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,649
I think this place is much better.

1026
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,029
-That's what everyone's been saying.
-The terrain was so uneven.

1027
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,156
It was really hard to walk on.

1028
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,742
-Really?
-Yes.

1029
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,913
-Watch your step.
-Okay.

1030
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,043
-Thanks.
-Sure.

1031
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,857
Were you surprised
that I wanted to talk to you?

1032
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,359
Yes, a little.

1033
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,653
-You didn't see it coming?
-No, I didn't.

1034
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,196
You didn't?

1035
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,323
-I didn't at all.
-Really?

1036
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:08,119
It's just that you seemed
like the silent type.

1037
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,204
Is that so?

1038
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,833
When I first saw you,

1039
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,378
I thought you were quite shy.

1040
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,296
-When you first saw me?
-Yes.

1041
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,216
-I am pretty shy at first.
-I see.

1042
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:24,511
But I think
I'm getting used to things now.

1043
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,389
There are people I haven't met,

1044
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,599
-so I wanted a chance to talk.
-Right.

1045
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,768
And I was curious about you.

1046
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,353
How do I seem to you?

1047
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,814
You seem very calm.

1048
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,899
You seem very composed.

1049
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,651
Really? I see.

1050
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:40,944
That's just my guess.

1051
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,696
I change once we get close.

1052
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,406
Do you become the opposite?

1053
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,033
-I become very playful.
-I see.

1054
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:51,413
-I become pretty cheerful.
-Cheerful?

1055
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,999
Yes, I think those two sides
coexist inside me.

1056
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,710
-They coexist?
-I'm charming in various ways.

1057
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,338
I get chattier around people

1058
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,090
-I'm close with.
-Yes, I'll bet.

1059
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,092
For me, it depends on the other person.

1060
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:07,595
If the other person is shy,
I also get really shy.

1061
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,932
Then it just becomes
two timid people in the scene.

1062
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:15,312
Rather than acting the opposite way,
you mirror the other person?

1063
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:20,150
Usually, I take on the style
of whoever I'm with.

1064
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,068
Really?

1065
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,071
-Goodness.
-She's much more cheerful.

1066
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:25,989
You're right.

1067
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,783
She's not the same as
when she was with Won-ik.

1068
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:33,163
Min-woo also tends to be shy
and takes time to warm up to people,

1069
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:36,624
-but Si-eun is putting him at ease.
-Right, he's usually shy.

1070
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,542
Right?

1071
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,919
But Min-woo and Won-ik
have different vibes.

1072
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,671
-They do.
-Won-ik couldn't even

1073
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,548
-look her in the eyes.
-Yes.

1074
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:47,218
But Min-woo still says his piece
amid all that shyness.

1075
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,554
-Right.
-I think that's why Si-eun is more…

1076
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,556
I think Min-woo has a dreamy gaze.

1077
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,350
-He does.
-He has a way of looking at her.

1078
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,102
-Right.
-Si-eun really came alive.

1079
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,815
What have you been up to?

1080
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,776
Me? I also had ramyeon.

1081
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,777
-Ramyeon?
-Yes.

1082
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,571
-That means you didn't go to Paradise.
-No.

1083
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,367
I actually enjoyed
chopping wood and stuff.

1084
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,660
-Me too. I loved it.
-It was fun.

1085
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,080
But it was so hard to start a fire.

1086
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,581
Was that the only hard part?

1087
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,959
It was hard not seeing you.

1088
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,588
-It took you a while to say it.
-I'm totally hooked.

1089
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,800
Great answer.

1090
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,551
He knows what to say.

1091
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,845
-With those dreamy eyes.
-"I'm totally hooked."

1092
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,556
It was hard not seeing you.

1093
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,227
-It took you a while to say it.
-I'm totally hooked.

1094
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:38,853
I'm in trouble.

1095
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,439
This is hilarious.

1096
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,733
I mean, I thought about you and stuff.

1097
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,193
I thought about you too.

1098
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,319
-Really?
-Yes.

1099
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,738
My heart aches.

1100
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,824
I told people I missed you.

1101
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,117
-You did?
-Yes.

1102
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,120
I'm pleased to hear that.

1103
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,455
But only a little bit.

1104
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,043
You're supposed to tell me
that you missed me a lot.

1105
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,837
Just a little.

1106
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,047
I'm still satisfied.

1107
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,090
-Are you?
-Yes.

1108
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,925
When I heard we were coming here,

1109
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,720
I thought I'd finally get to see you.

1110
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,763
-Really?
-Yes.

1111
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,598
I don't know if you mean it or not.

1112
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,516
Of course I do.

1113
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,518
Seriously, though.

1114
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,270
I really did miss you.

1115
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,312
I missed you too.

1116
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:25,358
First impressions matter the most to me.
That's the most important.

1117
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,446
What comes after that
is whether or not we click.

1118
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,490
-We had fun, didn't we?
-We did.

1119
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,659
But you met new people today. How is it?

1120
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:35,952
-I'm here with you.
-What?

1121
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,287
I'm with you right now.

1122
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,914
Maybe there's someone
you're curious about.

1123
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:41,833
-No?
-No.

1124
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,918
-Such a manly response.
-I am.

1125
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:48,673
I'm not the type to get curious
about multiple things at once.

1126
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,717
-I see.
-I think…

1127
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:57,265
Trying to focus on one thing
is hard enough, let alone two or three.

1128
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,017
So I should do my best and focus on one.

1129
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:00,977
Was that good?

1130
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,396
-That was pretty good.
-Write that one down.

1131
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,899
-That was a good one.
-I know.

1132
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,193
This is fun.

1133
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,611
I feel more at ease today.

1134
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,241
-I love what he said.
-He's so sincere.

1135
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,410
-He doesn't make a girl anxious.
-Right.

1136
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,870
He's a solid guy.

1137
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:21,164
I think it'll depend
on Min-young's decision.

1138
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,332
-Right.
-Yes.

1139
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,170
Come outside.

1140
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,296
-Me?
-Yes.

1141
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,714
"Come outside."

1142
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,175
-Here we go again.
-She called him out.

1143
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,677
-I'm so excited!
-Goodness.

1144
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,013
Where are we going?

1145
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,265
-I'll be back.
-We're going for a walk.

1146
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,725
-A walk? Okay.
-Yes, a walk.

1147
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,560
-You're going for a walk?
-Yes.

1148
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,397
-Let me get my glasses.
-We're going to take a walk.

1149
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,820
Where are we going?

1150
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,155
Let's go this way.

1151
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,657
It's pretty.

1152
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,659
It's like a forest in a fairy tale.

1153
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,496
-It is.
-I fit right in, don't you think?

1154
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,499
-Just say yes.
-Don't I fit in better?

1155
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,708
-Okay, sure.
-Good.

1156
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,086
This is nice.

1157
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,256
Did you bring anything?
You had a feast earlier.

1158
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,715
-What?
-No leftovers for me?

1159
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,344
-It was so good that I ate it all.
-Where's your loyalty?

1160
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:18,638
Empty your pockets.

1161
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,265
Nothing?

1162
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:23,893
Here, care for this?

1163
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:30,191
You met Min-kyu two days ago,
and you met him again today.

1164
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,026
-And you met me in between.
-Yes.

1165
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:32,944
How did it feel?

1166
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,571
-How did I feel?
-Yes.

1167
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,114
My feelings changed a bit.

1168
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,951
I felt a bit strange too.

1169
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,078
I think…

1170
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:46,666
I had completely forgotten about Hye-seon.

1171
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,419
But I remembered
what it was like to be with her.

1172
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,379
Was it like meeting an ex-girlfriend?

1173
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,256
An ex-girlfriend?

1174
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,217
-I guess.
-That's how it felt, right?

1175
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,552
-Kind of like that.
-Right?

1176
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:01,180
-You get what I mean, right?
-It kind of felt like cheating.

1177
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:04,392
-I see. Right.
-Yes.

1178
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:07,312
It's like that with everyone,
including you.

1179
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,063
When you spend time with someone,

1180
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:12,025
you get attached to them
whether you like it or not.

1181
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,569
-Right.
-I think that's what it is.

1182
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,820
Yes, I understand.

1183
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,031
Have you grown attached to me?

1184
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:28,499
I grew more attached to you than Hye-seon.

1185
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,420
-Really?
-Yes, a lot more.

1186
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:37,467
I felt a lot more comfortable
being with you than with her.

1187
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,474
I have a lot of fun when I'm with you.

1188
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:48,186
It's like an emotional roller-coaster.

1189
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:53,066
I get happy and upset repeatedly.
You drive me kind of crazy.

1190
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,859
But with Min-kyu,

1191
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:58,571
it was just nice throughout.

1192
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,990
-So it's a steady feeling?
-Yes.

1193
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,910
It's like a hotel bed
that's always comfortable.

1194
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,913
Yes, there are no ups and downs.

1195
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,706
What about me? Am I like a sofa?

1196
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,876
No, it's like I'm sleeping
right by someone's feet.

1197
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,587
Sleeping right by someone's feet
but in a hotel room?

1198
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,590
It's not like sleeping on a sofa,
but it's still comfy.

1199
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,801
It's not bad. I could still sleep there.

1200
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:22,762
It's nice and all,
but it still leaves me feeling puzzled.

1201
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:27,058
When I was with Min-woo earlier,

1202
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:30,895
and you came to talk to me,
you won yourself a brownie point.

1203
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,234
-What an honor. Thanks.
-Wouldn't you feel the same?

1204
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:39,445
If you were in that situation
and a guy came to you

1205
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,656
and asked if you'd like to talk first,

1206
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,325
-you'd become more interested in him.
-That's right.

1207
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,745
You should try talking to all the girls.

1208
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,498
You haven't talked to everyone yet.

1209
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:53,000
Right, I haven't talked to Gyu-ri yet.

1210
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,295
Go talk to her. These darn bugs.

1211
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,133
When Ha-jeong came
and asked to talk to me first,

1212
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,552
it made me feel

1213
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,430
a bit more attracted to her.

1214
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:06,889
Right now,

1215
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:12,770
I'm exactly 33% into Gyu-ri,

1216
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,814
then 33% into Ha-jeong,

1217
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,525
and 33% into Hye-seon.

1218
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:23,239
As for the remaining 1%,
I'll leave that open.

1219
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,200
-Leave it open?
-What is he saying?

1220
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,411
-What a character.
-A chance for someone else.

1221
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,329
He's hilarious.

1222
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,415
Gwan-hee can't seem to make up his mind.

1223
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,460
Who did you talk to earlier?

1224
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,087
-I only talked to Jin-seok.
-Really?

1225
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,255
That was kind of sad.

1226
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,299
Really? You should've just ended it early.

1227
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:45,011
I've been meaning to ask.
How was Paradise with Jin-seok?

1228
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,096
-It felt like we were siblings.
-Really?

1229
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,347
That's how I felt.

1230
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,476
But once I came to this Inferno,

1231
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,479
-I started to miss Jin-seok a little.
-Right.

1232
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,606
But now that I've met him again…

1233
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:57,899
You don't miss him anymore?

1234
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:00,193
We were laughing, and it was fun at first,

1235
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,111
-but it started dragging on.
-Right.

1236
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,614
It was really nice at first.

1237
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:08,826
He directly told me
that he'd missed me and stuff.

1238
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,412
-What? I didn't catch that.
-He told her he missed her.

1239
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:14,707
The other guys might begin to think
that you guys are a couple.

1240
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,210
Exactly, so it didn't feel great.

1241
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,837
So I want to get to know other people too.

1242
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,422
-I wasn't super excited.
-Right.

1243
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,757
I just had fun.

1244
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,300
-That's it?
-I've grown attached to him.

1245
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,595
I don't think the others will pick me.

1246
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,889
Who do you want to talk to the most?

1247
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,516
It's very confusing.

1248
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:36,354
It's easy to say yes or no
when it's just one person.

1249
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,941
But we have to consider
lots of people at once,

1250
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,692
and that's what makes it confusing.

1251
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,402
-Yes.
-It's hard to know how you feel.

1252
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,280
-Oh, my.
-I guess Min-young isn't so into him.

1253
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:49,158
When the guys and girls
are alone together,

1254
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:52,328
their conversations differ from the ones
they have with the other sex.

1255
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,288
-Right.
-Right? The vibe is different.

1256
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:57,250
They're more honest
with the same sex, so I feel bad.

1257
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,794
I don't think Min-young
has feelings for Jin-seok.

1258
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,129
-I'm quite certain.
-Is she tired of him already?

1259
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:05,883
I think she easily gets bored
when a guy just keeps saying sweet things.

1260
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,885
-Better to be like Gwan-hee?
-Good point.

1261
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:11,347
She'll become more desperate
if the guy was a tease like Gwan-hee.

1262
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,225
Let's not forget the absurd comment
that Gwan-hee made.

1263
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:17,603
He said he's equally attracted
to Ha-jeong, Hye-seon, and Gyu-ri.

1264
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,983
-He pretty much announced it to the world.
-He put it all in numbers.

1265
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:26,070
I would've been shocked
if any of the other guys said that.

1266
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:27,530
But with Gwan-hee, I'm not.

1267
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,948
-I agree.
-That just shows

1268
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,701
that we're getting used to
Gwan-hee's antics.

1269
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:33,160
We're getting used to him.

1270
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,954
We're all becoming like Ha-jeong.

1271
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,455
Gwan-hee pulled a Gwan-hee.

1272
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,957
But actually…

1273
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:45,882
In any case, it really looks like
Gwan-hee wants some time with Gyu-ri.

1274
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:46,883
Exactly.

1275
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,052
He'll keep thinking about her
until he gets to talk to her.

1276
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,722
-Yes, he needs to get to know her.
-He keeps wondering about her.

1277
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,808
I think it'll come down
to how much Ha-jeong and Hye-seon

1278
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,604
manage to take from Gyu-ri's 33%.
That'll determine Gwan-hee's choice.

1279
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,188
-Are they acquiring him?
-Yes.

1280
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,189
Acquiring Gwan-hee?

1281
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,025
Like mergers and acquisitions.

1282
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,028
Are we having pork belly?

1283
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,155
Hey, it's a barbecue.

1284
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,323
Let's start a fire.

1285
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,241
Are we building a fire?

1286
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:16,203
Let's grill the rest after this.

1287
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,247
That's an impressive fire.

1288
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:23,169
This reminds me
of a three-second barbecue I saw on TV.

1289
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,378
Totally.

1290
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:27,924
It's weird how the four of us
are so close now.

1291
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:28,925
I know, right?

1292
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,928
-It's the helicopter crew.
-We're so close.

1293
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,221
-Should we grill some more?
-The sausages are done.

1294
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,767
I'm going to try some too.

1295
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,477
Is it good?

1296
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,897
-Are there perilla leaves?
-Let's eat.

1297
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,025
-We grilled a lot of meat. Have some.
-There are three here.

1298
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,444
-I think that wrap is for him.
-Seriously?

1299
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:49,946
Will she seal the deal?

1300
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,490
She just saw Ha-jeong feeding him meat.

1301
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,742
I'm going to enjoy this meal.

1302
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:57,536
-It's a bit uncomfortable…
-You're already enjoying it.

1303
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,335
You like perilla leaves?

1304
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:05,836
I do.

1305
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:09,173
-Oh, my goodness.
-Look at her.

1306
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:10,633
-Look.
-Gosh.

1307
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,303
You like perilla leaves?

1308
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:15,888
I do.

1309
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:29,777
What is going on here? Seriously.

1310
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:34,281
-I love the mood right now.
-Totally.

1311
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,533
Why aren't you eating?

1312
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:36,993
Were you eating?

1313
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,536
-We were waiting.
-We were waiting.

1314
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,288
I think this is the kimchi
from our Inferno.

1315
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,126
-I didn't have any kimchi.
-We got it on the second day.

1316
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,962
-The kimchi is good.
-I should try it in a wrap.

1317
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,797
It's too far. Let's share this.

1318
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,301
How about napa cabbage?

1319
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:57,179
-Why aren't you eating? Aren't you hungry?
-Can we eat now?

1320
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,849
Yes, I heard they started eating.

1321
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:00,850
This is good.

1322
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,063
-Thank you.
-Bon appétit.

1323
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,064
Did you want this?

1324
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:08,858
I'll just have this one.

1325
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,363
Everything tastes even better here.

1326
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,824
-Isn't it good?
-Yes.

1327
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,827
I think they gave us nice food
because we got together today.

1328
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,454
So we can have a party?

1329
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,165
-It is a party.
-It is.

1330
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:25,791
It is.

1331
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,460
Dinner was great.

1332
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:28,878
Oh, jeez.

1333
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:34,425
You'll now choose the person
you are interested in.

1334
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,762
This place is going to give me
a heart attack.

1335
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,348
Please go to the mailboxes one by one

1336
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:44,435
and deliver a piece of candy
to the person you like.

1337
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:47,605
What?

1338
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:48,689
Candy?

1339
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:52,026
If you are interested in
more than one person,

1340
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,987
you may make multiple selections.

1341
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,572
MULTIPLE SELECTIONS ARE ALLOWED

1342
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:05,790
It is time to choose
the person you are interested in.

1343
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,294
This is their first time choosing

1344
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:12,880
since the two Infernos
were merged into one.

1345
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,590
Gwan-hee must've given out three.

1346
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:15,800
-Gyu-ri…
-Definitely.

1347
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:18,719
It could be three or even five.

1348
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:21,388
-Even Gwan-hee wouldn't go that far.
-Sorry about that.

1349
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:25,101
Who do you think will be
the most popular from each group?

1350
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,977
Who will get the most candies?

1351
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,146
-It's Gwan-hee.
-Among the men, it's Gwan-hee.

1352
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,816
Hye-seon and Ha-jeong
will definitely choose him.

1353
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,984
Among the women, maybe Gyu-ri.

1354
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:37,113
I don't think Gyu-ri will get
that many votes.

1355
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,323
She hasn't been taking an active stance,

1356
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:42,576
and she always stays guarded
to a certain degree.

1357
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:46,455
Guys may find that mysterious
in a positive way at first,

1358
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,749
but in a community setting like this,

1359
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:52,002
-it won't act in her favor.
-Really?

1360
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:56,257
WOMEN'S MAILBOXES

1361
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,552
It's Si-eun.

1362
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,522
-There's candy inside.
-Just one?

1363
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,607
-There are two.
-Two.

1364
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:14,525
Two pieces of candy.

1365
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,199
YU SI-EUN: 2 VOTES

1366
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:26,495
I think Won-ik might've given me one,
but I don't know who the other guy is.

1367
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,080
I wonder who it is.

1368
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,456
Maybe Won-ik and Min-woo?

1369
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,500
-Won-ik and Min-woo?
-Won-ik and Min-woo.

1370
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,504
I'm guessing one.

1371
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,590
-Yes, I think so too.
-One is my guess.

1372
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,887
-Nothing?
-What?

1373
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,307
-There is one.
-Yes, she got one.

1374
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:54,398
AN MIN-YOUNG: 1 VOTE

1375
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:57,067
She's so disappointed
even though she got one.

1376
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:59,862
-She knows who it's from.
-Yes, she knows it's Jin-seok.

1377
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:01,739
She should know the value of it.

1378
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:03,449
He's going to be heartbroken.

1379
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,373
-She must have gotten a lot.
-I guess so.

1380
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:12,625
Yes.

1381
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,542
CHOI HYE-SEON

1382
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,878
-She got three.
-Goodness.

1383
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:23,177
CHOI HYE-SEON: 3 VOTES

1384
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:31,393
I was really happy
that I got more candies than I'd expected.

1385
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:37,399
I think it was Gwan-hee,
Won-ik and Ha-bin.

1386
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,244
-Just one?
-That's odd.

1387
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,291
-It must be Gwan-hee.
-I'm sure it is.

1388
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:59,255
-She seems happy.
-Of course.

1389
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,051
YUN HA-JEONG: 1 VOTE

1390
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,386
I received one candy.

1391
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,681
I think it's from Gwan-hee.

1392
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,479
I saw this coming.

1393
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,564
Who do you think it was?

1394
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:19,692
Mr. Paradise?

1395
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,700
I wonder how many Gyu-ri got.

1396
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,702
I bet she got a lot.

1397
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,039
I think Gyu-ri got a lot.

1398
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,417
The way she responds
and makes eye contact…

1399
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,962
-I talked to Gyu-ri for a while earlier.
-I know.

1400
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:44,133
I was planning on talking with her,
but she left and never came back.

1401
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:46,093
Gyu-ri sure is popular.

1402
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:54,977
She received a lot.

1403
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,104
Why do I have four?

1404
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,690
-Four.
-There are four.

1405
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,943
Why do I have four?

1406
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,445
KIM GYU-RI: 4 VOTES

1407
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,155
Didn't she get the most?

1408
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:14,121
You see that?
Women don't need to take action.

1409
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:15,956
You just need to be pretty and mysterious.

1410
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,958
You got that, Jin-kyung?

1411
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,086
That monologue was awfully loud.

1412
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,963
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

1413
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,257
Sorry, I thought
I was at home for a moment.

1414
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,052
I was so startled.

1415
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,304
I was trying to catch a moth.

1416
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:31,555
Look at her hand.

1417
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:33,515
Did she carry in a fistful?

1418
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,476
-It's a fistful.
-Are they spilling out?

1419
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,020
-How many?
-I thought it was a moth.

1420
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,396
How many did you get?

1421
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:43,275
-You're rich.
-She's so popular.

1422
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,362
You won't have to worry about
running low on sugar.

1423
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:50,407
MEN'S MAILBOXES

1424
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:51,909
I'm curious about the men.

1425
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:55,245
It's Jin-seok.

1426
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:03,128
LEE JIN-SEOK

1427
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,507
He'll think it's from Min-young.

1428
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,466
Right. Of course.

1429
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,009
LEE JIN-SEOK: 1 VOTE

1430
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:13,597
Won-ik was the winner
of the squatting game.

1431
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,640
Please.

1432
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:18,102
Please.

1433
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:20,062
-Nothing?
-What?

1434
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:21,271
What?

1435
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,565
-It must be empty.
-I was nearly in shock.

1436
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:32,533
SON WON-IK: 2 VOTES

1437
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,954
I think Si-eun might give me one.

1438
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,081
It's Min-woo.

1439
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,707
I bet he got a lot.

1440
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,255
-Why's he taking it out like that?
-Just one?

1441
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:48,090
-What's he doing?
-What an odd method.

1442
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,383
It must be from Si-eun.

1443
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:51,885
CHOI MIN-WOO: 1 VOTE

1444
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:56,640
I think it was from Si-eun.

1445
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:01,353
I think mine will be empty.

1446
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,940
I left the worst first impression.

1447
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:08,193
My first impression was the worst.

1448
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:14,575
It's possible that you're not
anyone's top choice,

1449
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,870
but I bet you're everyone's second choice.

1450
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,246
-Second choice?
-Yes.

1451
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,170
Right. Let's wait for a plot twist.

1452
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,337
A runner-up?

1453
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,298
I hope he at least gets one.

1454
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:30,799
Please.

1455
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,730
-He got something.
-So he did.

1456
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,523
-I'm so glad.
-He got a lot.

1457
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,861
-What?
-Three?

1458
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:52,988
-What?
-Did he get four?

1459
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:56,742
-Gosh!
-What?

1460
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,285
-Five?
-Five?

1461
01:14:58,368 --> 01:14:59,703
Wait, this is…

1462
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,830
-He got everyone's votes.
-He did.

1463
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,707
-That's right.
-All five.

1464
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,375
He got one from everyone.

1465
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:09,796
YUN HA-BIN: 5 VOTES

1466
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:25,187
This means all the women voted for him.

1467
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,526
Welcome back.

1468
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,903
-We can take them?
-Is that allowed?

1469
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:33,820
I just did.

1470
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:36,907
-That sound tells me he got about three.
-I guess he got a lot.

1471
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:38,242
I heard the rustling.

1472
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:46,583
How many did you get?

1473
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,669
I got 20.

1474
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:51,755
How am I going to fake the sound
if I end up with nothing?

1475
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:55,342
Maybe I should bring
a plastic bag or something.

1476
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:04,935
LEE GWAN-HEE

1477
01:16:05,018 --> 01:16:06,103
He must have some.

1478
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:18,490
LEE GWAN-HEE: 2 VOTES

1479
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,826
-He got two.
-I just thought, "Serves you right."

1480
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:21,910
"Serves you right."

1481
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:24,246
Why are you so angry at him?

1482
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,957
I really thought that for a second.

1483
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:30,794
You're back so soon.

1484
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:32,004
-Right?
-Yes.

1485
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,257
-You have some in your pocket.
-My pocket?

1486
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:36,883
I can hear them rustling.

1487
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,178
That's good.

1488
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:43,390
-I don't feel that great, though.
-Why?

1489
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:45,142
I'm just bummed.

1490
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:47,394
We know you got a lot.

1491
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:48,812
Seriously, I feel bummed.

1492
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:50,439
I bet you got more than I did.

1493
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,483
Ha-bin is suddenly so laid back.

1494
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:54,860
He's making weird jokes.

1495
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:58,155
He shouldn't get
overly confident like that.

1496
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:01,033
-Min-kyu.
-It's Min-kyu.

1497
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:02,909
PARK MIN-KYU

1498
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:10,167
-Two. Okay.
-Min-kyu got two.

1499
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:17,466
PARK MIN-KYU: 2 VOTES

1500
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,677
Out of the women, Gyu-ri got four.

1501
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,596
And out of the men, Ha-bin got five.

1502
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,931
These two got the most.

1503
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:27,517
-The results were so unexpected.
-Right.

1504
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,604
But these results
clearly tell us something.

1505
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:32,981
-Gyu-ri and Ha-bin had the most, right?
-Yes.

1506
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:36,234
I think they voted for people
they were most curious about.

1507
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,237
I think most of them showed interest
in the two participants

1508
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,114
who seem to be the most mysterious.

1509
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,866
-Someone with more to discover?
-Yes.

1510
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,456
-What's that?
-It looks like alcohol.

1511
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:51,124
I can't wait to see what's there.

1512
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:53,210
There's really beer.

1513
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:54,169
Beer?

1514
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,588
Beer? That's amazing.

1515
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:58,548
There's soda too.

1516
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:01,593
-Did you get a lot?
-No.

1517
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,095
-Then what?
-Just the one from you.

1518
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:05,555
-Are you serious?
-I am.

1519
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,648
-There are sausages?
-No, there's soju.

1520
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:16,024
Oh, soju.

1521
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:20,237
The fire is coming this way.

1522
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,322
-The smoke is…
-It's coming this way.

1523
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:23,281
It is, right?

1524
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,451
-Come and sit here.
-I'll sit over there.

1525
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:27,953
It's fine. I'll go.

1526
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,919
It is pretty smoky here.

1527
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:37,838
-Is it bad?
-Yes, but it's fine.

1528
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:40,215
It's pretty bad over there.

1529
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:43,427
Then, naturally,
Gwan-hee sits next to Gyu-ri.

1530
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:46,763
-This is exactly what Gwan-hee wanted.
-You're right.

1531
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,599
Do you drink?

1532
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:52,394
Well, yes. I can drink,

1533
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,731
but I usually don't.
My face quickly turns red.

1534
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,357
I really craved this earlier.

1535
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,525
-Cola?
-Yes.

1536
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:03,947
How did you know?
I can't open it because of my nails.

1537
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:05,741
Thank you.

1538
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:09,995
How about a toast, everyone?

1539
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,496
One, two, three.

1540
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,039
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1541
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:16,126
I don't know if I should drink.

1542
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:17,961
Cheers.

1543
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:33,143
You're not drinking soju?

1544
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,813
I can't drink soju.

1545
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,607
-How about a game?
-Let's play a game.

1546
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,442
Can we play a game I like?

1547
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:42,277
If someone asks you a question,

1548
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,362
-you have to answer.
-Give an answer? Okay.

1549
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,865
-I'll ask a question first.
-Ask Ha-bin.

1550
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,784
-How many did you get?
-How many?

1551
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:50,410
How many did I get?

1552
01:19:59,836 --> 01:20:00,796
I'll just drink.

1553
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,720
-How macho.
-Yes, he really is.

1554
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:13,892
-Then, how many did you give out?
-How many?

1555
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:19,314
Are you going to drink again?

1556
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,943
Did you hear that? That was…

1557
01:20:24,402 --> 01:20:26,196
I think he just wants to drink.

1558
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,701
-I guess he likes to drink.
-Right.

1559
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,287
He won't answer anything.

1560
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,543
I don't think
I'll be able to sleep tonight.

1561
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:48,426
I didn't want to give any clues

1562
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:52,222
that would let people guess
who I voted for.

1563
01:20:57,185 --> 01:21:01,231
I gave candies
to Hye-seon, Gyu-ri and Ha-jeong.

1564
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:04,609
-Jin-seok, it's your turn to ask.
-Oh, right.

1565
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:08,864
Don't look at me.

1566
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:10,532
I've had enough.

1567
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:12,951
Go ahead.

1568
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:20,208
How many candies did you give out?

1569
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,251
-Me?
-Yes.

1570
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:22,168
I gave out one.

1571
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,388
Why do you ask?

1572
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:34,723
I was just curious.

1573
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:36,057
-You were curious?
-Yes.

1574
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,272
I gave a candy to Ha-bin.

1575
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:43,940
YUN HA-JEONG SELECTED YUN HA-BIN

1576
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:46,693
Q. WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE ONE TO GWAN-HEE?

1577
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:49,779
I had fun with him
when we were in Paradise,

1578
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:52,490
but seeing him here with everyone else

1579
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:57,913
made me feel like I was
just a backup to him.

1580
01:21:58,538 --> 01:22:01,791
And when the time came
to choose, I thought of Ha-bin.

1581
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,379
I'll ask the lady who's drinking cola.

1582
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,760
If the guy you gave the candy to
asked you to go to Paradise with him,

1583
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:12,802
would you go?

1584
01:22:16,389 --> 01:22:17,223
Yes.

1585
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,310
-Yes.
-I see.

1586
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:22,646
I didn't think she'd answer.

1587
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:24,522
Really?

1588
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:28,526
She said she only gave out one candy,

1589
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:30,987
and I received five.

1590
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:34,199
That means Ha-jeong chose me.

1591
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:37,327
So I wanted to know
how she really felt about me.

1592
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:40,997
He's pretty much asking
if she'd go with him.

1593
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:43,917
-Only those two know.
-Only they know.

1594
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,585
They're the only ones who know.

1595
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:48,713
Then…

1596
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,257
I have a question for you.

1597
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,843
How many did you give out?

1598
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:02,811
I gave out three.

1599
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:04,938
That's a lot.

1600
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,816
-You handed out a lot.
-Three?

1601
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:11,194
For my selection,

1602
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:13,697
I gave candies to Si-eun, Gyu-ri….

1603
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:17,325
…and Hye-seon.

1604
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,580
How many did you give out?

1605
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:25,792
How many did you give out?

1606
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,555
She's looking for a drink.

1607
01:23:38,638 --> 01:23:40,598
-Do I drink this?
-You're going to drink that?

1608
01:23:54,404 --> 01:24:00,243
I gave candies to Won-ik,
Ha-bin and Gwan-hee.

1609
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:03,079
I gave one to Gwan-hee

1610
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:06,374
because I'm the most attracted to him.

1611
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,293
As for Won-ik,

1612
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,837
I wanted to get to know him better.

1613
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:15,425
And I gave one to Ha-bin
because I had fun talking to him.

1614
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:19,721
-Question.
-Me. I have one.

1615
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:20,764
It's for Jin-seok.

1616
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,683
How many lemon candies did you give out?

1617
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,394
I gave out one.

1618
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:32,400
-He knows what he wants.
-Man, you're so cool.

1619
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:36,196
For my selection,

1620
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:38,490
I gave a candy to Min-young.

1621
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:39,699
LEE JIN-SEOK SELECTED AN MIN-YOUNG

1622
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:43,912
Have you decided to go all in
on the person you gave your candy to?

1623
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:49,292
Why not just ask him
if he wants to date her?

1624
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:52,087
-Just ask him if he wants to date her.
-No? Is that a no?

1625
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:55,673
I think so.

1626
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:04,641
This is for the lady leaning backward.

1627
01:25:04,724 --> 01:25:07,227
-Me? Okay.
-I have a question for Min-young.

1628
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,942
How many candies did you give out?

1629
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,156
Things are going to get weird
if she says two.

1630
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,451
It'll be trouble if she says two.

1631
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:25,411
Four.

1632
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:27,872
-Four?
-Four?

1633
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:30,041
How could you?

1634
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,669
It wasn't one? I can't believe this.

1635
01:25:32,752 --> 01:25:33,670
Four?

1636
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:35,171
That's good.

1637
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:39,008
I should be on my toes.

1638
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,015
We should talk in private.

1639
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:47,725
I don't want you to get hurt.

1640
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:48,685
I'm not hurt.

1641
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:51,855
I can't believe you chose four people.

1642
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:53,857
Seriously, that's harsh.

1643
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,234
-No, I just wanted…
-Okay.

1644
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:57,986
-She's honest.
-I wanted to talk…

1645
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:00,905
She's playing hard to get.

1646
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:03,199
I wanted to get to know everyone.

1647
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:07,328
She did what she had to do.

1648
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:08,371
-Yes.
-Right.

1649
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:11,124
Jin-seok needs to get on his toes.

1650
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:13,751
She changed everyone's fixed view
of them as a couple.

1651
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:17,046
I have a question for you.

1652
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:20,091
How many did you get?

1653
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:25,722
I got four.

1654
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:27,682
-Four?
-Yes.

1655
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:34,898
I have a question for Gwan-hee.

1656
01:26:34,981 --> 01:26:37,567
-How many candies did you give out?
-How many?

1657
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:47,619
I gave out just one.

1658
01:26:49,078 --> 01:26:50,038
-One?
-Yes.

1659
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:50,997
Just one?

1660
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:52,707
-What?
-What?

1661
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,044
I gave out just one.

1662
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:58,463
-One?
-Yes.

1663
01:26:58,546 --> 01:26:59,380
Just one?

1664
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:06,763
I have a question for Gwan-hee.

1665
01:27:08,681 --> 01:27:10,767
Who are you most interested in right now?

1666
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:15,897
Well, there are a few people

1667
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:18,942
I'm interested in right now,
but the thing is,

1668
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,693
I'm equally interested in them.

1669
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:22,612
-Equally?
-Yes.

1670
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:24,072
It's not just one person.

1671
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:25,365
Then, is it two people?

1672
01:27:25,448 --> 01:27:27,033
-It's three.
-Three people?

1673
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:28,284
Yes, three people.

1674
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:31,037
You sure have a big heart.

1675
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,373
-Three people?
-I'm attracted to three people.

1676
01:27:33,456 --> 01:27:35,500
You gave out one, but you like three?

1677
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:38,002
-Why did you give out only one?
-What did it mean?

1678
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:39,796
-Well…
-You weren't being honest.

1679
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:46,636
I gave it to the person
I was curious about.

1680
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:50,139
It was hard
because I wasn't sure of how I felt.

1681
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:57,230
LEE GWAN-HEE SELECTED KIM GYU-RI

1682
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:05,905
KIM GYU-RI

1683
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:08,992
Then, shouldn't he tell us
one of the three names, at least?

1684
01:28:09,075 --> 01:28:12,161
He should tell us all three
if he's equally interested.

1685
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,329
-You're right.
-Yes.

1686
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:20,420
He should tell us all three
if he's equally interested.

1687
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:24,590
-I don't think he should tell them.
-It's not a good idea.

1688
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:26,634
I don't think he should.

1689
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:29,929
He should tell us all three
if he's equally interested.

1690
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,389
-You're right.
-Yes.

1691
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:32,598
The three people?

1692
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,058
This one, that one, and this one.

1693
