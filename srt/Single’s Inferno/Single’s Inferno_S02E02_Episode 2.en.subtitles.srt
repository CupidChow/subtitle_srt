Let's see.

14
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,894
-How many are there?
-Wow. I knew it.

15
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,145
There are three, right?

16
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,192
-There are at least two.
-Are there two?

17
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,401
-What?
-Are there two?

18
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,319
There are two?

19
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,403
-So, two of them?
-Two?

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,709
THANK YOU FOR TAKING GOOD CARE OF ME
ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR DAY

21
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,257
-"Thanks for taking out my splinter."
-That's very obvious.

22
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,801
-That's from Se-jeong.
-Yes.

25
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,691
This is interesting.

26
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,539
-Wow.
-Dong-woo got two postcards.

27
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,839
LET'S GO GET WATER TOGETHER TOMORROW

28
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,133
-Someone said that earlier.
-"Let's go get water"?

29
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,763
PURPLE LOOKS GOOD ON YOU

30
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,764
Purple?

SHIN DONG-WOO: 2 POSTCARDS

32
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,868
You're back.

33
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,203
How was it?

34
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,081
Well, I'm a little confused.

35
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,750
Same.

36
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,378
We could be confused
about different things

37
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,589
or confused about the same thing.

38
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,266
I gave my postcard to Seo-eun.

39
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,183
KIM HAN-BIN

40
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,770
She worked really hard
when we were preparing dinner.

41
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,939
We talked while we were cooking,

42
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,441
and she laughed quite a lot.

43
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,942
So I chose her.

44
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,905
I gave my postcard to Jong-woo.

45
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,864
CHOI SEO-EUN

46
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,242
When we were eating,
I still felt kind of awkward,

47
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,994
so we didn't get to talk much.

48
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:27,582
But while he sat in front of me,
I saw him smile a lot.

49
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,209
I chose Seul-ki.

50
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,502
CHOI JONG-WOO

51
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,673
I think it's because she's rather close
to my ideal type

52
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:40,887
and has a kind of charm that makes me
want to get to know her better.

53
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,389
So that's why I chose Seul-ki.

54
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,018
I gave my postcard to Dong-woo.

55
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,519
SHIN SEUL-KI

56
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,690
We went to get water together yesterday,
and he seemed very calm.

57
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,985
And it felt like we had good chemistry.

58
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,779
So I think we became a bit close.

59
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,780
No, please.

60
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,700
I think Dong-woo would have
written me a postcard as well.

61
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,412
He kept talking to me

62
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,665
and I felt like he kept staring at me.

63
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,001
I think Dong-woo
would have given me a postcard.

64
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,130
I gave my first postcard
in Inferno to Nadine.

65
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,048
SHIN DONG-WOO

66
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,342
The way she was so awkward at first

67
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,636
and seemed a bit clumsy

68
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,265
brought out my protective side.

69
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,269
And the person
I would like to get to know better

70
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,521
is Seul-ki.

71
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,526
Seul-ki seems to have
a pure and innocent charm,

72
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,903
so I want to get to know her better.

73
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,949
I sent a postcard to Dong-woo.

74
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:43,992
LEE NADINE

75
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,952
In the beginning,

76
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,539
when we walked along the island,
that memory stayed with me.

77
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,374
I think he took care of me a lot.

78
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,418
And he asked me a lot of questions.

79
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,379
I think that's what I liked about him.

80
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,048
For my postcard to…

81
00:04:59,132 --> 00:04:59,966
PARK SE-JEONG

82
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,177
…Yoong-jae yesterday.

83
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,931
When we were touring the island together,

84
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,018
he was really friendly
and started lots of conversations.

85
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,604
He also tried hard
to lessen the awkwardness.

86
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,356
I think I have a splinter.

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,859
If it's all right with you, can I try?

88
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,901
Yes.

89
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,363
He was charming, so I chose Yoong-jae.

90
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,033
I'm guessing that maybe

91
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,826
Yoong-jae also gave me his postcard.

92
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,163
My first postcard…

93
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,080
JO YOONG-JAE

94
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,124
…went to Se-jeong.

95
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:38,129
I chose her
because I was attracted to her looks.

96
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:42,550
I also liked how she started conversations
when we were touring the island together.

97
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,219
So we had a good time talking.

98
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,846
Well…

99
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,764
LEE SO-E

100
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,975
…I gave my postcard to Yoong-jae.

101
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm a very shy person,
so I can't easily start conversations.

102
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:59,192
But I felt comfortable
when I talked to Yoong-jae yesterday,

103
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,820
and he seemed very mature.

104
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:07,909
So I just thought
that I would like to talk to him more.

105
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,954
So Han-bin chose Seo-eun,
but Seo-eun chose Jong-woo.

106
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,499
Jong-woo chose Seul-ki,

107
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,335
but Seul-ki chose Dong-woo,
and Dong-woo chose Nadine.

108
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,544
Nobody matched.

109
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,672
The lines are all crisscrossed.

110
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,468
So far, the people whose choices match

111
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,095
are Dong-woo and Nadine.

112
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,054
Yes.

113
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,348
And Yoong-jae and Se-jeong.

114
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,641
Two couples.

115
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,643
Only those two couples matched.

116
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,896
And unfortunately, Han-bin and So-e

117
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,148
didn't get any postcards.

118
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,692
So there's one person from each side.

119
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,654
But, as you know,
we don't know how this will change.

120
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,739
That's the beauty of Single's Inferno.

121
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,618
And even though Dong-woo
gave his postcard to Nadine,

122
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,829
he wanted to get to know Seul-ki better.

123
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,081
So this is just their first impression

124
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,041
from when they met in the beginning.

125
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,627
In Single's Inferno,
people's feelings change.

126
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,255
Another love triangle
has Yoong-jae in the middle.

127
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,758
So-e and Se-jeong both chose Yoong-jae.

128
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,177
But since Yoong-jae chose Se-jeong,

129
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,013
So-e got zero postcards.

130
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,226
Something tells me that So-e will be
expressing herself a lot more now.

131
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,271
-Right.
-I think her attitude would change a bit.

132
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,190
-After getting zero postcards.
-Right.

133
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,370
What are you reading?

134
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,915
I'm reading a report.

135
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,375
What kind of report?

136
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,377
Well…

137
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,338
-It's about alternative foods.
-Pardon?

138
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,092
Alternative foods.

139
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,888
It's something
I've been meaning to read about.

140
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,560
-It's new to me.
-It's boring, right?

141
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,561
-No.
-It's not?

142
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,521
God, no.

143
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,439
I was going to read a book.

144
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,108
But I thought a book might be too much.

145
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,238
Are you reading this report for research?

146
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,324
-No, it's just a personal…
-No?

147
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,951
Interest?

148
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,371
Yes. If I'm interested in something,
I have to look into it further.

149
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,622
That's amazing.

150
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,916
-I was writing in my journal.
-Your journal?

151
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,751
So how was it yesterday?

152
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,379
I was way too shy.

153
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,507
And awkward.

154
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,426
So I think I was a mixture of my real self

155
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,054
and other parts of myself
that I didn't recognize.

156
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,597
-Because you were nervous.
-Yes.

157
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,432
It was like that for me too.

158
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,894
Still, you're the one
I talked to the most yesterday.

159
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,062
Right.

160
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:27,400
I think it'll be fun once we talk more.

161
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,860
Let's get to know each other.

162
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,280
It's like destiny.

163
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,156
Right.

164
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,245
-She's being very straightforward.
-Yes.

165
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,874
-How tall are you?
-Guess.

166
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,424
-Maybe 158 cm?
-Yes.

167
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,926
-Is it 158 cm?
-I'm so short, right? It's so sad.

168
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,262
-I wish I were 160 cm.
-You're not short at all.

169
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,430
-Honestly.
-Really?

170
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,764
I'll guess your height.

171
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,058
Stand up for a second.

172
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,438
This would be…

173
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,691
This would be…

174
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,361
Maybe 100… Wait.

175
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,279
A hundred…

176
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,490
-Maybe 185 cm?
-Really?

177
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,868
You're right. I'm around 185 and 186.

178
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,369
Maybe even 187 cm.

179
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,163
Wow, you're really tall.

180
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,457
Can you give me 5 cm?

181
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,501
It's on its way.

182
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,799
He said, "It's on its way."

183
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,052
-I support this couple.
-"It's on its way."

184
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,804
-I find myself rooting for those two.
-Right? Me, too.

185
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,848
-It's like a romance comic.
-I like them.

186
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,308
I'm hungry.

187
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,853
-I'm so hungry.
-Let's see if breakfast will be cereal.

188
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,315
It's cereal, bread, milk, and juice.

189
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,401
Wait, I think I need juice first.

190
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,153
Drink some juice first, then.

191
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,279
Milk for me.

192
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,656
Hello.

193
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,199
Thanks for dinner last night.

194
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,159
-Wanna join in for a toast?
-Sure.

195
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,661
There's orange juice and milk.

196
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,496
-Which would you like?
-I'm here.

197
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,623
-Orange juice or milk?
-Orange juice, please.

198
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,582
Okay. Here you go.

199
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,546
-It's our first morning.
-Good morning.

200
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,924
Good morning.

201
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,809
They're drinking it
like it's a protein shake.

202
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,980
-Hello.
-Hello.

203
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,065
Did you sleep well?

204
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,858
-Sometimes I wonder…
-Hello.

205
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,819
There's fruit. This is great.

206
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,239
-Let me help you.
-Sounds good.

207
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,282
I'm pretty good at cutting up fruit.

208
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,577
Let me help.

209
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,080
This looks good.

210
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,665
Can I sit here?

211
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,166
-Yes, of course.
-Thanks.

212
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,087
What did you do in the morning?

213
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,256
-We put makeup on.
-Yes.

214
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,384
Well, you were the first one up,
so you're the most productive.

215
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,927
No, I woke up late.

216
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,138
-Actually, So-e woke up early.
-Really?

217
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,806
On my way to the restroom, I…

218
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,559
Wait. Were you wearing a navy blue hoodie?

219
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,770
-He's the one in the navy blue hoodie.
-It was me. Why?

220
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,147
I think I saw you earlier.

221
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,358
-Did the color stand out?
-Yes, it kind of stood out.

222
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,282
I said hi this morning,
but you just went scurrying by.

223
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,033
-Did I?
-Were you wearing makeup?

224
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,910
No. That's why I was hiding my face.

225
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,413
I don't think you'd look different
without makeup.

226
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,330
Really?

227
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,249
I'm surprised you recognized me.

228
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,043
Of course I recognized you.
There aren't many people here.

229
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,128
That's good.

230
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,095
Wow.

231
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,764
I can tell something is going on.

232
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,018
-Split this in half.
-Okay.

233
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,147
-Watch your hands.
-Okay.

234
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,274
Weren't you hungry before bed?

235
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,860
-We kept talking about how hungry we were.
-Right.

236
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,197
-Because we digest radish quickly.
-Right? I said that, too.

237
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,656
Really quickly.

238
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,492
I agree. Radish is very digestible.

239
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,591
Come eat.

240
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,427
-We feel bad seeing you standing.
-It's okay.

241
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,470
These are cut up.

242
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,597
-Here.
-Thank you.

243
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,515
No worries.

244
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,724
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

245
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,190
-Seul-ki, are you left-handed?
-How'd you know?

246
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,359
-You're eating with your left hand.
-Right.

247
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,444
-You're the only lefty.
-Am I the only one?

248
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,695
-I'm a lefty.
-Me, too.

249
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,863
-Really?
-Seriously?

250
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,782
-Wow.
-Left hand, left foot.

251
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,867
-Which foot do you use?
-My left foot too.

252
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,868
That's amazing.

253
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,413
Aren't lefties more artistic?

254
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,915
-They are.
-Right?

255
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,043
They have good artistic sense.
Yes, they do.

256
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,712
-Right?
-That's cool.

257
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,388
What do you need? Water?

258
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,431
-Apples.
-Okay, apples.

259
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,516
I want some.

260
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,899
Try some bread, too.

261
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,696
The weather's nice.

262
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,075
The view is really nice here,
but you can't see it.

263
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,411
-Really?
-Yes, it's really nice.

264
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,538
-You can sit on this side tomorrow.
-Right.

265
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,914
I'm a nice view too, right?

266
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,416
It's even better.

267
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,302
Why aren't you eating?

268
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,722
You're barely eating.

269
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,434
I want to go to Paradise
and eat really good food.

270
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,146
-We all feel the same way, right?
-I want meat.

271
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,024
She was looking at him when she said that.

272
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,192
Yes. She was like, "I want to go."

273
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,863
I think Se-jeong expresses herself
very clearly.

274
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,741
"I want to go to Paradise,"
and she looks straight at him.

275
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,284
"I want to go to Paradise."

276
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,996
I want to go to Paradise
and eat really good food.

277
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,750
-We all feel the same way, right?
-I want meat.

278
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,086
When did you all decide
to speak casually to one another?

279
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,297
Actually, we decided
to start this morning.

280
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,049
-But nobody's able to.
-Should we?

281
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,550
-All together.
-Okay.

282
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,344
-Okay. Hi!
-Okay.

283
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,555
-We're calling each other by name, then?
-Sure.

284
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,849
How's the food, Jong-woo?

285
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,853
Should we go back to speaking formally?

286
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,313
My heart just skipped a beat.

287
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,277
I want to take a walk.

288
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,613
-Shall we all go together?
-Yes.

289
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,281
-Eat, then go for a walk?
-Yes

290
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,450
Shall we split into groups?

291
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,160
-Let's go randomly.
-Okay.

292
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,995
-See you in a bit.
-See you.

293
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,293
I've never come out this far.

294
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,336
Same.

295
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,546
Hey, there's a really big clam.

296
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,008
Wanna see how I toss clams?

297
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,636
-Can you throw them high?
-Yes, like a boomerang.

298
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,595
Really?

299
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,222
-I want to see.
-I'll show you.

300
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,645
-Wow.
-Hey, that's amazing.

301
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,356
-But why isn't it coming back?
-What? Well, that's--

302
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,650
You said you could throw it
like a boomerang.

303
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,527
You know that quote?

304
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,029
-"Love comes back"?
-"Love comes back in the end."

305
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,865
I was really looking forward
to seeing it come back.

306
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,077
It just wasn't meant to be.
If it was, it would've come back.

307
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,039
Look at that view. Nature is amazing.

308
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,710
Hey. What are you doing?

309
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,212
-Are you fighting with your shoe?
-Yes.

310
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,506
-I'm trying not to get sand in it.
-Here.

311
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,425
Right, just like that.

312
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,052
Put it in.

313
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,723
-Thanks.
-Okay, let's go.

314
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,392
I wonder what the other group is doing?

315
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,105
-Shall we go up to where the water is?
-Let's do that.

316
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,815
It's hot.

317
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,694
Do you want to block the sun with this?

318
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,155
-What is that, though?
-I brought it to read.

319
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,991
-What is it?
-It's not a book.

320
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,368
-Is this some--
-It's just a report.

321
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,078
You're reading a report?

322
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,789
It's about alternative foods.

323
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,085
-You can use this.
-Are you sure?

324
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,920
-You can block the sunlight.
-Okay.

325
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,964
-I'm fine.
-This is pretty effective.

326
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,841
It's like having a hat on.

327
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,136
It's so cool here.

328
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,432
This place is just so…

329
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,935
-It's hard to find such a remote area.
-Right, an island.

330
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,980
Where was your most memorable
travel destination?

331
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,233
I've been to the Philippines
and Japan a number of times.

332
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,443
Wow, Japan.

333
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,321
There's a hot spring called Yufuin.

334
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,906
It was really nice.

335
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,116
That's where Kumamoto Castle is?

336
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,826
-So you know it well.
-He does.

337
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,245
-I went there on a school trip.
-I see.

338
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,707
-You went on a school trip overseas?
-I went to China for my school trip.

339
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,750
-Wow.
-Really?

340
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,252
We went to Beijing
to see the Great Wall of China.

341
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,924
But I do want to visit
a hot spring in Japan.

342
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,092
It's really good.

343
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,261
You can drink beer there
while it floats around in the water.

344
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,930
-That sounds great.
-That's amazing.

345
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,556
It'd be great to go as a couple.

346
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,391
-Right.
-I've never done it before.

347
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,102
Me neither. Never as a couple.

348
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,605
-Have you been?
-Where? No.

349
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,981
No, never.

350
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,362
-How about you?
-My most memorable trip?

351
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,615
-I think New York was nice.
-Right. I want to go to the US.

352
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,368
-Like Manhattan?
-I mean--

353
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,285
Or Brooklyn?

354
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,206
Brooklyn feels less like a city.

355
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,833
-It's kind of trendy.
-Right.

356
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,460
I've never been there.
I really want to go.

357
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,712
-Me too.
-So you haven't been to the US?

358
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,713
No, I haven't.

359
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,466
I thought I'd get
many opportunities to go,

360
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,218
so I intentionally put off going.

361
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,761
-But not yet?
-Still?

362
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,887
I still haven't yet.

363
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,097
You'll be going soon.

364
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,849
-Soon?
-Yes.

365
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,560
It feels like some kind of prophecy.

366
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,477
When do I go?

367
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,271
-When can I go?
-Let me see.

368
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,230
Tell me.

369
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,023
-Let's see…
-Is she a fortune teller?

370
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,233
-Maybe.
-She is.

371
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,234
Next February.

372
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,610
-Next February?
-Yes.

373
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,779
-Okay.
-Okay, you're going next February.

374
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,198
If I really do go, I'll call you.

375
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,577
-You could be going together.
-Right.

376
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,661
That's possible.

377
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,580
Is that what you meant by February?

378
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,540
Are you hoping to go in February?

379
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,833
Is that what it is?

380
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,918
-I'll think about it.
-Okay.

381
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,754
So you'll be going once we're done here?

382
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,592
It's all happening so fast.

383
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,720
I think it was good
Se-jeong brought up overseas traveling.

384
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,972
Talking about overseas traveling itself

385
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,891
already gets you excited.

386
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,393
And since he was picturing it,

387
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,396
Yoong-jae got into it and had so much fun.

388
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,565
I think it was that kind of vibe.

389
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,484
-Se-jeong is being really obvious.
-She's bold.

390
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,491
The hottest inferno in the world,
Single's Inferno.

391
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,954
Today, we're going to match the couples
who'll go on their first date in Paradise.

392
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,581
It's today.

393
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:11,752
Before that, you'll play a game
to win a chance to have a special meal.

394
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,088
Participants, please come to the beach.

395
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,092
Wow, a game?

396
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,603
-I wonder what kind of game it is.
-I know, I'm kind of nervous.

397
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,816
They're coming.

398
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,152
-I did not expect that.
-Wow.

399
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,659
Okay!

400
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,411
They're all very fit.

401
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,095
Today…

402
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,184
the women will play the game.

403
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,899
The winner will get a chance
to choose two men

404
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,734
to have a special meal with.

405
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,195
Today's special meal is

406
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,324
French toast and iced Americanos.

407
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,243
I want to drink an iced Americano.

408
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,786
-I want it.
-Me, too.

409
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,371
I really want it.

410
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,998
-I'm dying to have it.
-Me, too.

411
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,459
Today's game will be a chicken fight.

412
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,877
Chicken fight.

413
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,254
A chicken fight?

414
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,255
Here?

415
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,342
Once you hear the whistle,
grab and hold one foot in front of you…

416
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,260
WHILE HOLDING ONE FOOT FORWARD
AND START ATTACKING AT THE SAME TIME

417
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,178
…and start attacking at the same time.

418
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,390
If you lose your grip
or if both feet touch the ground…

419
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,433
ELIMINATED IF GRIP IS LOST ON FOOT
OR IF BOTH FEET TOUCH THE GROUND

420
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,019
…during the game,
you will be eliminated immediately.

421
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,813
It's a balancing game.

422
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,648
THE PERSON WHO SURVIVES UNTIL THE END
WINS A SPECIAL MEAL DATE

423
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,985
The person who survives until the end
will be the winner.

424
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,528
A chicken fight.

425
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,196
It sounds fun.

426
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,407
I'm kind of nervous.

427
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,783
This is nerve-wracking.

428
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,705
They're all nervous.

429
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,707
-Don't be nervous!
-You got this!

430
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,916
-You can do it!
-Yes!

431
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,765
You never know who'll win.

432
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,100
This is going to be so much fun.

433
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,477
You got this.

434
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,481
Ready.

435
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,363
I'm curious to see who'll win.

436
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,326
Look at Nadine.

437
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,329
Look at Nadine.

438
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,373
-Just like that?
-Nadine? I knew it.

439
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,378
Go, Nadine.

440
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,505
Nadine!

441
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,349
This is so hard!

442
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,145
Seul-ki is eliminated.

443
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,439
Man!

444
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,191
-What?
-Man!

445
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,822
-So-e is just standing still.
-She's strategic.

446
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,330
-What's going on?
-What is this?

447
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,332
We should wait.

448
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,084
-Let's wait.
-Just for a bit.

449
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,593
No!

450
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,274
-There they go!
-What's going on?

451
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,154
They fell.

452
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,364
They both fell.

453
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,078
Nadine and Seo-eun are eliminated.

454
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,755
Hey, what are they doing?

455
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,424
-Now what?
-It's just us two now.

456
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,595
What's happening?

457
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,346
But aren't these two rivals?

458
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,348
Of all people, it's down to these two.

459
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,517
The person who wins will choose Yoong-jae.

460
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,148
There's such a difference in size.

461
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,777
-My God…
-What?

462
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,036
-Dear…
-Look at So-e.

463
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,162
God…

464
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,795
Hey, you didn't fall.

465
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,297
This is so hard.

466
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,925
-Se-jeong can win by standing still.
-You see that?

467
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,219
-You see that?
-What happened?

468
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,096
-What is it?
-What happened?

469
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,848
This is so hard.

470
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,320
What just happened?

471
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,366
Se-jeong is eliminated.

472
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,161
-What just happened?
-My God!

473
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,704
I got goosebumps.

474
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,624
-Why is this so fascinating?
-I know.

475
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,169
-So-e got zero postcards yesterday.
-Right, so I rooted for her.

476
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,545
This is amazing.

477
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:52,050
The final winner
of the women's chicken fight is So-e.

478
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,009
Congratulations.

479
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,470
That was so unexpected!

480
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,099
I really didn't expect this result.

481
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,434
-That was so unexpected.
-It really was.

482
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,106
So-e can have a meal

483
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,650
with the two men she is interested in.

484
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,652
Please choose the two men

485
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,071
you would like to enjoy
the special meal with.

486
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,948
I choose…

487
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,457
I'm nervous.

488
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,712
Yoong-jae and Jong-woo.

489
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,965
Yoong-jae

490
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:37,429
and Jong-woo can enjoy
a special meal with So-e.

491
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,473
Great job, everyone.

492
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,019
Shall we go swimming?

493
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,648
-We get to play in the water now.
-Let's go!

494
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,407
The water is so cool!

495
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,406
-What are you doing?
-Hey, Seul-ki.

496
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,328
-Do you swim?
-Yes, I like swimming.

497
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,497
I like any kind of water activities.

498
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,041
-I like water sports.
-You do?

499
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,126
You know, like jet skiing.

500
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,921
I like waterskiing.

501
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:55,965
Waterskiing.

502
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,642
-I'm hungry.
-I'm sorry. It's too bad you didn't win.

503
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,353
You were like a shrimp
caught in a whale fight.

504
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,314
-You know what I mean?
-I was literally about to say that.

505
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,192
You would've looked
more like a shrimp in this red dress.

506
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,613
Anyway, it's just a figure of speech.

507
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,532
You just went flying.

508
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,743
But, well,

509
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,913
it's not like you lost without trying.

510
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,457
-How mean.
-You put up a good fight.

511
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,458
I'm going to go.

512
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,963
The shrimp is leaving.

513
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,925
My…

514
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,238
-She must be hot, waiting in this heat.
-Yes, probably.

515
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,574
Hi.

516
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,616
It's hot, right?

517
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,661
-You look good together.
-We ended up wearing matching outfits.

518
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,413
But you look good together.

519
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,333
-This looks good.
-It's amazing.

520
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,879
-It's an iced Americano.
-A meal with the winner.

521
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,589
I didn't think I would win.

522
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,674
-It was such a plot twist.
-Right.

523
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,676
I thought you would be eliminated first.

524
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,471
But you won, and everyone was shocked.

525
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,724
Staying still was my winning strategy.

526
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:31,269
-No, but you held out an attack.
-Right.

527
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,522
I was looking at your legs closely,
and you held your ground.

528
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,274
I really wanted to hold out.

529
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,444
-Did you see her eyes?
-I did.

530
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:43,198
-She said that while staring at Yoong-jae.
-"I really wanted to hold out."

531
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,159
-I really wanted to hold out.
-We get to eat, thanks to you.

532
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,160
Thank you.

533
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,370
Shall we eat? Have the iced Americano.

534
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,372
Cheers.

535
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,291
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

536
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,709
This is exciting.

537
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,342
I want to stay here.

538
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,636
Until the sun goes down.

539
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,804
This is so nice.

540
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,640
I might finish this in one gulp.
I should slow down.

541
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,517
Let's slow down.

542
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,019
-This looks so delicious.
-What should I eat first?

543
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,938
There's avocado and shrimp…

544
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,531
Those earrings look really nice on you.

545
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,490
-Like this.
-Really?

546
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,158
-They look great on you.
-Thanks.

547
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,077
-I wanted to try them out.
-Really?

548
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,330
I guess I noticed
that you switched your earrings.

549
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,499
-They look good, really.
-Thank you.

550
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,292
What were the ones before like?

551
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,461
I don't really remember,

552
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,588
but these go well with her outfit.

553
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,173
You're really observant.

554
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,633
Yes, he's the best.

555
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,680
Aren't detailed compliments nice?

556
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,724
-They are.
-It's about the little things.

557
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,562
-Hey, sweet potatoes!
-We have sweet potatoes.

558
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,105
Wait. Is that chicken breast?

559
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,942
-You want to sit here?
-Yes, I'll sit in the middle.

560
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,779
-This is my water.
-You never forget your water.

561
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,490
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

562
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,204
-This is delicious.
-Is it?

563
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,665
-It's good on its own.
-Really?

564
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,833
It's just good.

565
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,711
For now, let's use this.

566
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,255
You eat the skin, too, Seul-ki?

567
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,172
Yes.

568
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,216
-Really?
-I eat it with the skin.

569
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,217
Why?

570
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,053
-It's really good with the skin on.
-I agree.

571
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,681
I peel the skin off, no matter what.

572
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,308
-Me too.
-Shouldn't you peel it?

573
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,976
You should eat it with the skin.

574
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,896
There have been times
when I only ate the skin.

575
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,272
Should I try it, then?

576
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,909
Seeing you eat like that

577
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,828
reminds me of the old cartoon,
Black Rubber Shoes.

578
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,288
Black Rubber Shoes.

579
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,874
That's funny.

580
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,800
What kind of sweet potato
does everyone like?

581
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,807
Please don't tease me.

582
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,357
You're making me want to peel it for you.

583
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,317
How should I peel it?

584
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,277
-Just all at once.
-All at once?

585
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,404
And then you just squeeze the end.

586
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,031
-Like this?
-Then it comes out.

587
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,116
You still have to peel some more…

588
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,457
I think Dong-woo is very conflicted
between the two.

589
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,833
You're right.

590
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,920
And Seul-ki is keeping track
of what Dong-woo is doing.

591
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,590
Nadine seems to be good at unknowingly
drawing attention to herself.

592
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,549
Don't you think so?

593
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,344
Peeling the sweet potato
and making a mess.

594
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:59,268
It's really nice to hear
the sound of the waves when it's quiet.

595
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,146
-I was just thinking that.
-I love listening to it.

596
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,356
It's so nice.

597
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,401
-I want to stay here.
-Same.

598
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,613
We were talking
about who looks the youngest.

599
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,824
-And you're the one So-e chose.
-Me?

600
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,117
It wasn't me.

601
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,953
I thought you might be
older than expected.

602
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,581
-From the way you talk.
-The way I talk?

603
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,583
I think you're the youngest.

604
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,168
-Really?
-I can see it.

605
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,462
-You have this vibe.
-Is that so?

606
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,047
People give off certain vibes.

607
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,719
What are you like when you date?

608
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,761
-Me?
-Yes.

609
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,724
If I like someone,
I'm pretty clear about it.

610
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,851
-I see.
-You make it clear.

611
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,520
It's not like I intentionally do it,

612
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,689
but it's hard for me to hide my feelings.

613
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:50,236
If a few people like you,
then how do you think

614
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,821
you'll handle that situation?

615
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,656
If I have feelings for one of them,

616
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,035
then even if I feel bad for the others,

617
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,247
I think it's right that I express
my feelings exactly as they are.

618
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,542
I think that's the best way
to not feel bad about it.

619
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,794
For me,

620
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:11,382
I notice that I tend to drag things along
because I feel bad, so…

621
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,886
I've dragged things along
because I felt bad too.

622
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,180
-But I learned that's actually worse.
-Right.

623
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,432
-You're giving them false hope.
-Exactly.

624
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,143
So I just trust my instincts.

625
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,895
-You just go with your gut?
-Yes.

626
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,356
Is it mostly right?

627
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,524
Yes.

628
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,110
-I typically do have a standard.
-You do?

629
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,820
What's your standard?

630
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,991
My typical standard
is someone who's easy to talk to.

631
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,036
That's the most important thing, I think.

632
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,123
But here, I don't think
we have time to check all that.

633
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:48,002
So I think I'm just going
to go with my instincts like you.

634
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,671
-There's so little time.
-Exactly.

635
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,049
For me, I don't go by instinct.

636
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,302
I came here thinking that

637
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:00,389
I will find the right person for me

638
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,935
through having one-on-one conversations
and getting to know them.

639
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:07,730
I talked to you the most, So-e.
We talked a lot here, too.

640
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,482
And I spent a lot of personal time.

641
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,404
With Jong-woo,

642
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,615
it felt like
I was talking to someone my age.

643
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,783
LEE SO-E

644
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:23,371
And with Yoong-jae,
he seemed a lot more mature.

645
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,291
I usually go for people

646
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,502
who are mature.

647
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,844
I think Yoong-jae is a good listener.

648
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,303
A very good listener.

649
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,306
He has good manners with everyone.

650
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,894
Regardless of who it is,
he listens intently and asks questions.

651
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,437
He seems like that type.

652
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,732
So we now know for sure how So-e feels.

653
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,569
-Right.
-But I wonder how Yoong-jae feels.

654
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,863
-I'm curious.
-Yes, I'm curious.

655
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,365
-Here they come.
-Come on.

656
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,575
Hello.

657
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,952
-Did you enjoy the meal?
-Yes, it was good.

658
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,036
Really?

659
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,416
-You had chicken breast?
-Yes, sweet potatoes and chicken breast.

660
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,209
-You got sweet potatoes?
-Yes.

661
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,210
Your wish came true.

662
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,712
-Yes.
-Her wish came true?

663
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,338
It wasn't a wish.

664
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,340
You said you really like sweet potatoes.

665
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,887
-The color of your shirts is so--
-We're like a couple.

666
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,847
-You're--
-They're like a boy band.

667
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,557
-They're different.
-But similar.

668
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,601
-What?
-We match.

669
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,519
-Hey, we do.
-Right.

670
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,230
-It's the same color.
-It's such a bright blue.

671
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,150
Were you wearing this earlier?
Wait, it wasn't this one.

672
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,111
-You should include me too.
-You're right.

673
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,655
-The colors are so pretty.
-We're all matching.

674
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,408
-Everyone dressed in bright colors today.
-We did.

675
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,493
-You're right. Look at you guys.
-Right?

676
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,620
It's so pretty.

677
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,915
-I like this shade of blue.
-Se-jeong looks great in that color.

678
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,416
I like blue.

679
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,711
I really want to drink coffee.

680
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,795
Right?

681
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,381
We can't here, right?

682
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,801
You can in Paradise.

683
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,553
Paradise.

684
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,055
It was good.

685
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,641
-Bacon sounds good.
-Crispy.

686
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,559
-And thinly sliced.
-Totally.

687
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,063
-Thin and greasy.
-Isn't it too hot?

688
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,773
I'm okay.

689
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,443
-Did you see how she touched him?
-Yes.

690
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,905
-She touched him, and he was like this.
-Maybe he didn't feel it?

691
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,740
I'm curious, though.

692
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,826
What do you consider important
when it comes to guys?

693
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,537
-I want the person to be warm.
-Right.

694
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,456
There are guys who feel comfortable.

695
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,001
They make you feel comfortable
when you're with them.

696
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,255
-Friendly, gentle, and polite?
-Right.

697
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,008
Even if I don't say anything,
they just watch and take care of me.

698
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,469
And they have to be somewhat serious.

699
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,931
There needs to be a right balance
without overdoing it.

700
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,975
We all have similar tastes in this sense.

701
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,103
Did one guy
get all the postcards yesterday?

702
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,689
-Who?
-No way.

703
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,276
It's possible. It sounds like
you're talking about one guy.

704
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,279
I don't know who Yoong-jae will pick.

705
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:06,492
To be honest, unless you go to Paradise,
what you can talk about is limited here.

706
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,868
-Seriously.
-Right.

707
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,997
-You talked to Seul-ki earlier.
-Yes.

708
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,915
How was it when you talked?

709
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,126
Was it awkward?

710
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,087
-I think she's just cute.
-I see.

711
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:23,592
Are you conflicted between the person
you had in mind in the beginning and her?

712
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:28,097
I'm not sure if it's the person
I had in mind at first. But I'm confused.

713
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,933
-So I want to talk more.
-I understand.

714
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,853
I want to talk to everyone.

715
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,731
-But there's so little time.
-I know.

716
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,234
The way we have to choose
so suddenly like this--

717
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,111
-Right, it's hard.
-Too hard.

718
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:48,909
When I first meet guys,
I usually tease them a lot.

719
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,202
I'm kind of like that.

720
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,496
-You seem like you're playful.
-Yes.

721
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,999
-But for that to show--
-It takes time?

722
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,459
-I need time.
-Right.

723
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,170
So right now, I can't help
but feel awkward.

724
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,297
I just sit there and say, "Yes."

725
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,466
Look up and say, "Yes."

726
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,010
-You really did respond like that.
-You're right.

727
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,013
-I know I shouldn't.
-No, it's fine.

728
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:14,018
-That's just your personality.
-It'll get better as time goes by.

729
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,519
It's still so awkward.

730
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,022
Go try right now.

731
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,817
It's such a short period of time,
so I think we should take chances

732
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,986
and talk some more.

733
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,279
You're right.

734
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,739
I agree.

735
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,873
Hello.

736
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,542
-Do you want to go get water?
-Yes, sure.

737
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,628
-Are you thirsty?
-Yes, I am.

738
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,255
You came to me
right when I started feeling thirsty.

739
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,966
I saw you from afar and--

740
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,510
-Yes?
-Well…

741
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,678
-You looked pretty.
-I see.

742
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,347
So I thought, "Who is that?"

743
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,556
-Really?
-Yes.

744
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,101
It turned out to be you, Nadine.

745
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,021
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

746
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:03,109
Talking over water and not coffee…

747
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,444
-You're right.
-It's a new experience.

748
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,697
The reason I wanted to talk to you

749
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:15,955
is I appreciated how you asked me
a lot of questions on the first day.

750
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:19,667
But I think I acted too cold towards you.

751
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,794
Was your trip over here okay?

752
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,505
Yes.

753
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,757
Do you like sports?

754
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,050
Yes.

755
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,803
-Do you like to walk?
-Yes.

756
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,436
-You have to ask in English.
-I like it too.

757
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,146
-I'm sorry.
-Do you like walking?

758
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,900
-Your English is good.
-Right.

759
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,696
But your response is still the same
even if I ask in English.

760
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,490
-She gave short answers.
-She did.

761
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,617
-That's why she felt bad.
-Yes.

762
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,328
-Dong-woo really did put in effort.
-He did.

763
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,956
Dong-woo's fun. He's charming.

764
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,626
I see. But I understand
because you don't feel comfortable.

765
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,754
Yes. That's why…

766
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,550
"Maybe he took it the wrong way."
This is what I thought.

767
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,802
I mean, I understand.

768
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:16,682
I felt like I wanted to take care of you

769
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,811
after seeing you feel
uncomfortable with things.

770
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,943
I think that's how I felt.

771
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,028
But…

772
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,821
How are you doing here?

773
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,824
-Inferno's fun for me.
-It shouldn't be fun for you.

774
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,868
-But it is.
-You have to go to Paradise.

775
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,244
It's really fun.

776
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,290
When can I experience
staying on a deserted island like this?

777
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,920
But you should go to Paradise
and eat good food,

778
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,214
and also enjoy good vibes there.

779
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,800
For me, I'm not just focused
on going to Paradise.

780
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,887
Instead of thinking
about a nice bed or nice bathroom,

781
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,932
I want to go with someone
I really want to get to know.

782
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:04,688
Just someone I'm really interested in
and someone I like.

783
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,484
Right, what's important there
is that you can talk.

784
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,404
-Talk about everything.
-Right.

785
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,240
Do you ever feel this way?

786
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:17,409
You could have multiple people
you're curious about.

787
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:22,998
Actually, I want to get to know
one person one at a time.

788
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,252
If I'm interested in someone,

789
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,046
I only focus on that one person.

790
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:34,552
So rather than meeting multiple people
and talking to them,

791
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,220
I just…

792
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,936
Do you believe in love at first sight?

793
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,980
-No, not that.
-Not that?

794
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:46,981
Not that.

795
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,315
Never.

796
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,400
I just…

797
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:08,294
I'm curious, though. I want to have
more serious conversations.

798
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,297
I want to ask questions, but I can't.

799
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,426
We'll be able to talk more
in Paradise, right?

800
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,640
Did you finish your water?

801
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,225
I'm saving it.

802
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,394
Water is rare.

803
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:32,109
Singles. Please get ready
to go to Paradise.

804
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,028
-Let's go.
-It's time to choose.

805
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,448
Let's finish it now.

806
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,118
The color of your outfit
is really pretty today.

807
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,453
Thanks.

808
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,331
-Your outfit reminds me of Hawaii.
-Right.

809
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,875
Thank you.

810
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,296
-That was meaningful.
-I have a good feeling about them.

811
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,506
Dong-woo is charming when it's one-on-one.

812
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,967
-I think I saw some of his charms.
-Right.

813
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,510
He's very sincere.

814
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,388
Now I definitely get
why he got two postcards.

815
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,683
-And Nadine is very charming…
-Exactly.

816
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,144
…after seeing her talk.

817
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,176
Actually,

818
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,846
there are two people
I'd like to talk to more.

819
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,931
JO YOONG-JAE

820
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:47,518
But I'm not quite sure who I want…

821
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,938
to go to Paradise with.

822
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,732
I'm not sure yet.

823
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,696
-Yoong-jae looks conflicted.
-Right?

824
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,615
I think he's thinking.

825
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:05,744
Se-jeong and So-e gave him signs.

826
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,590
-Have you decided yet?
-It's harder than I thought.

827
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,763
-Do you have a lot on your mind?
-Me?

828
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:29,935
I did, but I should make
a decision right about now.

829
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,355
-What's your standard when choosing?
-My standard?

830
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,066
Maybe someone I'm still curious about?

831
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,112
You'll choose someone
you're curious about?

832
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,115
Do you have two separate people?

833
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,701
Someone you're curious about
and someone you like?

834
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,871
I want to choose her
because I'm really curious,

835
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,623
but I'm worried
she's not curious about me.

836
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,628
You're not worried about that?

837
00:45:56,712 --> 00:46:02,092
But it's not like I can change
how he feels by worrying about that.

838
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,970
I think it's important to follow my heart.

839
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,763
-I see.
-Yes.

840
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,599
You're very wise.

841
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,728
I mean, I worry a lot, too.

842
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,189
But this feels like the time

843
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,441
to be honest about how I feel.

844
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,865
So did my advice help at all?

845
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,617
You're really good at talking.

846
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,079
-Really?
-Yes.

847
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:35,250
-I didn't know that.
-You have a nice tone of voice, it's like…

848
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:39,463
Your job and…
Wait, we can't talk about it.

849
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,048
You're curious about my job?

850
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,509
Of course.

851
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,718
-You're curious?
-Yes.

852
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,553
What about me?

853
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,347
-I'm curious.
-You are?

854
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,556
Of course, I'm curious.

855
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:51,975
This is fun.

856
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,854
I agree. It's like we're just
getting started today.

857
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,899
-It's fun talking about this.
-Right?

858
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,025
It's fun.

859
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,611
It might just be me,

860
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,531
but Yoong-jae seems to get
more one-on-one conversations.

861
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,700
Yoong-jae looked like
he was just asking questions

862
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,370
when he was talking to Seo-eun.

863
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,455
-Really? But for Seo-eun--
-Right?

864
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,208
His questions came
from pure curiosity, don't you think?

865
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,086
-I agree.
-I think Seo-eun likes Yoong-jae.

866
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,088
Really?

867
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,716
If she does have feelings,
isn't she approaching him a bit too late?

868
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,427
I mean, it seems like she's interested.

869
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,428
-It does?
-Yes.

870
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,346
Really?

871
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,142
INFERNO
05:00 PM

872
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:45,988
Now, we're going to match the couples
who'll go on their first date in Paradise.

873
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,365
My heart is pounding.

874
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,535
I'm nervous all of a sudden.

875
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,912
What if our choices overlap?

876
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:54,913
God.

877
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,667
Please…

878
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:03,422
The male participants have already chosen
the female participants they like.

879
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,966
Really?

880
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,759
30 MINUTES EARLIER

881
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,011
Hey, here's the ticket.

882
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,221
We're supposed to take this with us.

883
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,389
I'm so conflicted.

884
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,946
Now, female participants,

885
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,365
please come out to the campfire one by one

886
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:34,911
and say the name of the male participant
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

887
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,956
So, we will be the ones to go out
and call their names?

888
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,041
I think so.

889
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:45,255
If the male participant you call out
has chosen you,

890
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:49,760
you can escape to Paradise together
and enjoy your date.

891
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,180
-Do you think you made the right choice?
-Yes.

892
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,683
I wanna see what happens.
Will anyone actually go?

893
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,894
-To Paradise?
-I'm curious too.

894
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,522
The first couple match to go
on a date in Paradise has finally begun.

895
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,983
-Is this method the same as before?
-Yes, it is.

896
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:09,071
The men have already chosen the women
they want to go to Paradise with.

897
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,032
And one by one, the women
will come out to the campfire

898
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,369
and say the name of the guy
they'd like to go to Paradise with.

899
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,996
However, both the man and the woman

900
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,583
must choose each other

901
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,001
in order to go to Paradise.

902
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:27,464
If they don't match, they stay in Inferno,
no matter how many postcards they get.

903
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:31,176
So over here, it's important
to feel the same way about each other.

904
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,470
-Right.
-Getting many postcards is meaningless.

905
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,640
So the question is,
will it be Se-jeong and Yoong-jae?

906
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,975
-Or So-e and Yoong-jae?
-I'm also curious.

907
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,269
I think many people
will be curious about this.

908
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:46,066
And on top of that,
Seo-eun approached Yoong-jae earlier

909
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,152
and perhaps expressed herself
by saying all those things.

910
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,364
But the conversation
between Seo-eun and Yoong-jae was…

911
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,199
There wasn't much substance, right?

912
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,493
-What? I disagree.
-Did it have meaning?

913
00:49:56,576 --> 00:50:00,414
I thought Seo-eun expressed her feelings
to Yoong-jae in her own way.

914
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,624
-I think she expressed herself.
-Yes, but--

915
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,253
So Seo-eun is not the type to show
her charming side in an obvious way

916
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,630
or be flirtatious.

917
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,215
-No, she's not.
-Right.

918
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,425
So to her,

919
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,052
she was being indirect and cool

920
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,596
about how she's developing feelings
for Yoong-jae.

921
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,390
-I think Yoong-jae got that.
-Really?

922
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,725
Let's guess.

923
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,727
-I want him to choose So-e.
-Okay.

924
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,812
-But I think he chose Se-jeong.
-Me too.

925
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,065
I think Yoong-jae
will choose Se-jeong this time.

926
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,609
And Dong-woo will choose Seul-ki.

927
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,527
What?

928
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,987
-Not Nadine?
-Not Nadine?

929
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,865
No, but I'm stuck on how he said

930
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,492
he wants to get to know Seul-ki.

931
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,871
So I think it'll be between those two.

932
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,831
Dong-woo will definitely choose Nadine.

933
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,541
-Nadine, this time?
-Yes.

934
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,669
-Let's hurry up and watch.
-Yes, I'm curious too.

935
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,007
-The first Paradise couple match.
-Yes.

936
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:55,510
MATCHING THE COUPLES TO GO TO PARADISE

937
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,763
Nadine will choose first.

938
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,225
-Let's all be happy.
-See you.

939
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,770
-See you.
-Bye.

940
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,773
-You're taking your plushie with you?
-No, I'm not.

941
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:21,995
LEE NADINE

942
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:41,473
The person I want to go to Paradise with…

943
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,101
-Why am I so nervous about this?
-I know.

944
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,020
I didn't think it would be this bad.

945
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,989
The person I want to go to Paradise with

946
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,325
is Dong-woo.

947
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,414
Will Dong-woo come out?

948
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,084
-Yes.
-I think he will,

949
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,877
'cause he wants to take care of her.

950
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,338
Right, they sent signals to each other.

951
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:25,267
Dong-woo, did you follow
your heart when making your choice?

952
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,977
-Yes.
-No hesitation?

953
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,271
Yes, I suppose.

954
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,822
Is there a reason you chose that person?

955
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,490
Is it someone you've talked to?

956
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,326
I did talk to her.

957
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,005
Dong-woo

958
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,801
did not choose Nadine.

959
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,679
He didn't come.

960
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,724
-Is it Seul-ki, then?
-Wow.

961
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,477
-I got chills.
-Seriously?

962
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,355
Why did he treat her so nicely
if he was going to do this?

963
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,607
They had great talks.

964
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,025
I didn't expect this.

965
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:20,322
Maybe he wanted to choose someone he likes
instead of someone who likes him?

966
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,073
But that's Nadine.

967
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,783
He must have liked Seul-ki.

968
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,369
I see. Okay.

969
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:30,582
-Dear…
-This is already not going well.

970
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,960
Nadine will not be going
to Paradise today.

971
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,921
Please return to your quarters.

972
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,149
Nadine.

973
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,737
No.

974
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,739
Food.

975
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,076
I don't know how I'm supposed to cook.

976
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,744
Look behind you.

977
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,622
-We put your baby to sleep.
-Nadine.

978
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:13,166
We told him to be quiet
because you were going.

979
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,461
I'm curious to see
who he'll be going with.

980
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:19,923
That's too…

981
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,385
-Cruel.
-That's cruel.

982
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,636
That's cruel.

983
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,472
It's harder than I thought it would be.

984
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,184
I asked Dong-woo

985
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:33,770
to have water with me and talk.

986
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,688
LEE NADINE

987
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:39,275
That was the first time in my life
I'd ever done something like that.

988
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,278
Asking a guy to have a talk

989
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,782
is like an expression of interest.

990
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,911
So I thought he would accept me.

991
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,207
I had a lot on my mind.

992
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,959
Q: WERE YOU UPSET?

993
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,003
I wouldn't say upset, but…

994
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,965
Yes, I was upset.

995
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:03,591
Yes.

996
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,262
SHIN SEUL-KI

997
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,029
The person I would like to go
to Paradise with

998
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,114
is Dong-woo.

999
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:27,824
I knew it.

1000
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,367
It's Dong-woo.

1001
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,077
-I think he'll come out.
-Right.

1002
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,246
If he doesn't, something's wrong.

1003
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,623
If he doesn't, he's someone
who hates Paradise.

1004
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,750
Exactly.

1005
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,084
He likes Inferno too much.

1006
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,086
-He likes it here.
-He hates Paradise.

1007
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,139
-What?
-Is he not coming out?

1008
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,989
-I knew it.
-It was Seul-ki.

1009
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,699
This time it was Seul-ki.

1010
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,160
He chose the girl
he wants to get to know better.

1011
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,037
He did say he's curious about her.

1012
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,319
Hi.

1013
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,658
Thanks.

1014
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,452
Thanks.

1015
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,579
Let's go.

1016
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,042
Shall we go to Paradise?

1017
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,460
Let's go.

1018
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,380
Isn't it heavy?

1019
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,382
-No. It's lighter than mine.
-Really?

1020
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,051
-Yes.
-I didn't pack a lot.

1021
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,763
-Do you have everything?
-Yes.

1022
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,766
-Did you pack your swimsuit?
-I did.

1023
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,857
Next, Se-jeong will come out and choose.

1024
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,567
-Okay.
-Bye.

1025
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,569
-See you.
-Bye.

1026
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:30,488
-Seul-ki left, just like that.
-She left?

1027
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,115
-I know.
-She left?

1028
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,950
-Goodbye.
-God…

1029
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,660
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1030
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,036
Have fun.

1031
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,915
I wonder who he left with.

1032
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,544
I think I can guess.
But at the same time, I can't.

1033
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,671
-Who do you think he left with?
-Nadine.

1034
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:50,008
Right, they would guess Nadine.

1035
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,093
The guys don't seem to know yet, either.

1036
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,722
If Jong-woo chose Seul-ki…

1037
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:59,893
I don't know.
I just chose who I felt like choosing.

1038
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:03,062
It'll hurt if I'm not chosen,

1039
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,231
but I should still try.

1040
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:10,403
PARK SE-JEONG

1041
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,917
The person who I want to go
to Paradise with is…

1042
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:34,677
LEE SO-E

1043
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:39,224
The person who I want to go
to Paradise with

1044
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:42,268
is Yoong-jae.

1045
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,395
Yoong-jae.

1046
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,084
Wait, what?

1047
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,253
-It's Seo-eun.
-Seo-eun.

1048
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,587
-It is.
-Really?

1049
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,339
Seo-eun.

1050
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:16,094
CHOI SEO-EUN

1051
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,559
The person I want to go to Paradise with

1052
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,603
is Yoong-jae.

1053
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,276
-I knew it.
-Wait, how many is that, then?

1054
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,277
Three.

1055
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,779
-Three.
-He was chosen by three?

1056
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,200
Yoong-jae.

1057
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,619
Yoong-jae.

1058
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,163
Yoong-jae.

1059
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,963
I didn't get
a strong impression from Yoong-jae…

1060
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:52,880
CHOI SEO-EUN

1061
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,966
…because we had spoken so little.

1062
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,552
But when we went to go get iced water…

1063
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,597
-What is that, though?
-I brought it to read.

1064
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,556
What is it?

1065
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,308
-Is this some--
-It's just a report.

1066
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,560
He was carrying a report with him.

1067
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:09,522
That was a very unexpected twist
to his character,

1068
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:13,651
so I got curious about him
and wanted to get to know him better.

1069
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,028
PARK SE-JEONG

1070
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:19,157
Yoong-jae was the sweetest
and started conversations with me a lot.

1071
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,075
-You're coming with, right?
-Yes.

1072
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,745
-I have to think about it.
-Okay.

1073
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,663
When do I go? When can I go?

1074
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,748
Let me see.

1075
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,166
-Tell me.
-Let's see…

1076
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:32,920
And the way he tried so hard
to lessen the awkwardness was charming,

1077
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,089
so I liked those things about him.

1078
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:38,843
LEE SO-E

1079
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:42,305
To be honest, I didn't have any issues
in deciding who to choose.

1080
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:46,184
My type has always been
someone who is mature.

1081
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:51,064
When I talked to Yoong-jae,
he seemed mature.

1082
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,651
The way he spoke
and behaved and things like that.

1083
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:58,363
There was a sort of mature vibe to him.

1084
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,624
NEXT EPISODE

1085
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,959
It's so nice.

1086
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,961
I bet Paradise is really fun.

1087
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,672
-I wonder what they're doing?
-They must be having fun.

1088
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:58,840
This is tough.

1089
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,550
I've got a lot on my mind.

1090
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,343
I'm so sad.

1091
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,386
Don't cry.

1092
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,974
-What if I'm too excited to sleep?
-That's possible.

1093
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,600
I should take a chance.

1094
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,352
I should get closer.

1095
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:15,440
I was interested, but it's not like
my feelings were serious.

1096
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,483
I was literally abandoned.

1097
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,861
-What?
-Someone's coming.

1098
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:21,320
Someone's coming.

1099
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,406
-Wait.
-They're coming like this?

1100
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,283
He was so cool.

1101
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,618
I want to talk to the new guy.

1102
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,371
For some reason, I'm excited…

1103
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,082
What if she's cold with me?
It could upset me.

1104
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:36,836
Honestly, I'm really conflicted.
