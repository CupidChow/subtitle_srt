CHOI SI-HUN

00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,986
AN YEA-WON

00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,696
SONG JI-A

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,156
OH JIN-TAEK

10
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:43,251
Last week, we finally had the first
matching session for Paradise.

11
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,253
There was a couple that bonded over veins,

12
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,338
-Ji-a and Hyeon-joong.
-Right.

13
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,424
They seemed to really click, didn't they?

14
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,842
They seemed very comfortable

15
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,886
-around each other, to begin with.
-Right.

16
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:57,390
They soon started to talk casually
and had drinks together.

17
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,810
Both of them seemed
very cool and straightforward.

18
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,854
So why did you choose me?

19
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,315
Because I like you.

20
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,691
Oh, that's why.

21
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,943
There's no reason?

22
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,403
I just like you the most.

23
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:11,988
I see.

24
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,740
Weren't you confused at all?

25
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,292
But that was only their first choice.
They might change their minds later.

26
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,418
-We never know.
-Right.

27
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,921
-They might end up hating each other.
-Right.

28
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,715
Jin-taek and So-yeon are

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,343
almost like newlyweds.

30
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,887
-I can be an older man,
-Yes?

31
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,431
a younger man,

32
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,017
or a man of your age.

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,102
Anyhow, this is a date.

34
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,354
-Right.
-Yes.

35
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,815
-But seriously, Jin-taek is
-Yes?

36
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,983
a one-woman man.

37
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,152
Right. He suddenly started
to talk casually.

38
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,403
He said, "You're the only one for me."

39
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,905
"You're the only one
I want to come here with."

40
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,782
-It made my heart flutter.
-Me too.

41
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,493
Are you going to come here
with another girl?

42
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,495
I said I'm coming here only with you.

43
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05,708
To be honest, the biggest twist
of the first matching session

44
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,085
was Ji-yeon's choice.

45
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,420
-Ji-yeon?
-Right.

46
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,382
She had iced Americano with Se-hoon
at the special meal zone…

47
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,675
-Right.
-Right.

48
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,760
…and then went to Paradise with Si-hun.

49
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,095
That was a bit…

50
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,513
I felt bad for Se-hoon.

51
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,265
They had a lot of intimate moments.

52
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,392
He put his arm on her shoulder
taking photos.

53
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,228
But if you think about it,

54
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,980
it was all one-sided.

55
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,356
-I agree.
-Ji-yeon

56
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,108
-didn't do it.
-Was it too one-sided?

57
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,985
If she had feelings for him, she would

58
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,611
-have done this.
-When it happened,

59
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,405
-she would've done this.
-Around his waist.

60
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,115
But Ji-yeon didn't do anything.

61
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,742
And it was Se-hoon
who invited her to the special meal.

62
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,911
-We don't know what she's thinking.
-Right.

63
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,831
INFERNO

64
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,883
Hello.

65
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,594
Hello.

66
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,519
Could you try that hat on?

67
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,272
I usually don't wear this kind of hat.

68
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,732
-You look really cute.
-Really?

69
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,703
-Look over there.
-Hey.

70
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,706
Where were you?

71
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,416
We were taking a walk over there.

72
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,542
It's getting late.

73
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,628
We were going
to hang out together all night.

74
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,755
Seriously, you should come and sleep here.

75
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,138
It looks like
the people left here are all good people.

76
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,933
Maybe I talked to her too much.

77
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,518
We'll have to make choices again.

78
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,520
I want to ask you this first.

79
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,522
Is there anyone else you're interested in?

80
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,274
-Anyone else I'm interested in?
-Yes.

81
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,817
-No.
-Then…

82
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,070
-You should give it another try.
-But I think…

83
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,365
I think you should give it another try.

84
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,159
When I won the race earlier…

85
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,119
I…

86
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,413
My first choice was Ji-yeon.

87
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,125
-Do you know why I chose Ji-a?
-No.

88
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,252
-You don't, right?
-No.

89
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,379
There was no special reason.

90
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,714
-Because they looked close?
-They looked so close.

91
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,509
-They put on makeup together this morning.
-Right. They did.

92
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,512
I was reminded of that

93
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,681
and thought it might be easier for her

94
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,475
-to open up when she feels comfortable.
-Right.

95
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,063
Let's help each other.

96
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,731
Okay. I'll help you too.

97
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,692
I get along well with girls.

98
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,277
I'll talk to them.

99
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,237
I'm counting on you guys.

100
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,077
PARADISE
CHOI SI-HUN AND SHIN JI-YEON

101
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,874
This looks delicious.

102
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,877
This is really nice.

103
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,379
We have meat.

104
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,132
We didn't get to eat any meat there.

105
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,771
It tastes so good.

106
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:18,067
-I haven't had meat in a very long time.
-Oh, wait. I had sausages.

107
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,569
Sausages? Right.

108
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,654
How was it then?

109
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,489
When he called your name.

110
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,491
-When he called my name,
-How did you feel?

111
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,995
I was very happy because
that meant I could have iced Americano.

112
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,749
-I was happy to have something cold.
-So it's the food you liked.

113
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,253
Well, it was also nice
that I could get to know someone better.

114
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,340
I see. That you could get
to know someone better?

115
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,217
We don't have much time
to get to know each other better.

116
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,886
-Right.
-So…

117
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,768
By the way, how old are you? I'm curious.

118
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,437
You look really young.

119
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,315
I'm 30.

120
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,109
-Yes.
-You look much younger

121
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,319
than I thought.

122
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,653
Thanks.

123
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,698
He's the same age as Jin-taek.

124
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,617
-He has such a baby face.
-That's right.

125
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,119
I thought you'd be much younger.

126
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,079
How about you?

127
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,164
I'm 25.

128
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,041
-You're 25?
-I was born in 1997. Yes.

129
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,298
I see. Is there anything else
you want to know about me?

130
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,259
What do you do for a living?

131
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,428
I run a fashion business.

132
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,640
-I just launched a brand.
-Really?

133
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,558
-Yes.
-So you're running

134
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,393
-your own business?
-I'm the CEO. Yes.

135
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,732
Puff your chest out. Okay.

136
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,317
Good.

137
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,612
I'm planning on launching a fashion brand,

138
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,364
and I'm working very hard on it.

139
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:52,203
From product planning to lookbook shoots,

140
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,914
I'm in charge of the whole process.

141
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,126
I'm the CEO of the business.

142
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,377
That's cool.

143
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,380
I see.

144
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,884
I want to know what you do
for a living too.

145
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,054
-Me? I'm a college student.
-A college student?

146
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,097
Yes, I'm a student.

147
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,932
Are you studying airline service?

148
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,058
-No.
-You're not?

149
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,768
I'm not studying airline service.

150
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,105
I'm studying the brain.
Neuroscience, to be precise.

151
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,273
-Neuroscience?
-Yes.

152
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,399
I see.

153
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,484
I'm studying neuroscience.

154
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,819
That's my major.

155
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,739
I'm a college student.

156
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,493
I'm studying life science
at the University of Toronto.

157
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,413
With all the fancy words
like neuroscience and Toronto,

158
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,206
she looks so cool all of a sudden.

159
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,333
-It's a good school.
-It's one of the top 20.

160
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,418
My gosh!

161
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,214
I chose to study this
because my grandfather is

162
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,757
suffering from Alzheimer's.

163
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,218
That's how I became interested
in this field.

164
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:55,808
I'm planning on getting a master's degree
in bioscience when I graduate.

165
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,976
SHIN JI-YEON, 25,
UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LIFE SCIENCE MAJOR

166
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,394
-My goodness.
-What?

167
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,647
-Seriously?
-And she's even pretty.

168
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,690
And so smart.

169
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,400
I had no idea.

170
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,780
Most people are surprised
to hear what I study.

171
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,574
It's hard to imagine.

172
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,326
-I see.
-Because it's unexpected.

173
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,368
-Is that so?
-Yes.

174
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,411
Really?

175
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:22,627
Now that we know how old we are,
how about we talk casually?

176
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,212
Can I just call you oppa?

177
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,964
-Sure.
-Okay.

178
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,928
What do you look for in a woman?

179
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,430
I think it's important for them
to know their charm.

180
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,389
I see.

181
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,935
That's all.

182
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,186
That's all?

183
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,982
If the woman you like says

184
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,069
that she likes someone else,
will you give her up?

185
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:52,573
I don't care who likes who, to begin with.

186
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,117
Isn't that the most important thing?

187
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,911
-Right.
-I don't care

188
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,996
if others like the person I like.

189
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,081
You're right.

190
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,250
I think I'm like that.

191
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,128
It may take a long time for me
to know whom I like,

192
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:11,717
but once I know, I'm all in.

193
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:27,024
It looks like they're starting
to like each other more.

194
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,361
This is the reason
why it's called Paradise.

195
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,571
It's heaven.

196
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,156
Well, the environment there
is like heaven, for sure,

197
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,158
but most importantly, they can be honest.

198
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,619
That makes them look even more attractive.

199
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,247
They can grab a drink there too.
With a bit of alcohol…

200
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,374
-A bit.
-With a bit of alcohol,

201
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,251
they can open up more easily.

202
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,335
Right.

203
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,696
Did you sleep well?

204
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,615
Yes. Did you?

205
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,367
-Go on and keep working out.
-I'm done.

206
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,077
Let's go for a walk.

207
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,539
This is already our third day here.

208
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,624
Time really flies.

209
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,583
Yes.

210
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,668
You know how people say
"midsummer memories"?

211
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,211
This feels like it.

212
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,632
It really does. Which do you prefer?
Summer or winter?

213
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,591
I prefer summer.

214
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,508
I see.

215
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,178
I don't like being cold.

216
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,095
Me neither.

217
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,680
I don't like cold weather.

218
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,890
Let's play a game.

219
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,059
Sashimi or meat. Choose one.

220
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,810
You can eat only one for life.

221
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,354
-This is tough.
-It is.

222
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,480
This is really tough.

223
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,856
Shall we answer at the same time?

224
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,317
-One, two, three. Meat.
-One, two, three. Meat.

225
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,904
-Of course, it's meat.
-Right? It has to be meat.

226
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,405
We have so much in common.

227
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,784
People who work out
usually have a lot in common.

228
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,663
Wait. I see what's going on.

229
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,458
When you talk to someone
and find you have something in common,

230
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,210
you let your guard down.

231
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:13,172
As I remember,
Yea-won's choice was Jun-sik.

232
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,508
To Yea-won, this is not Inferno.

233
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,927
-She's in Paradise now.
-She is.

234
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,909
You guys made my wish come true.

235
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,663
This is my first time getting a tan.

236
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,834
You know, you have to bear it
even though it's hot.

237
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,919
That's the beauty of it.

238
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,590
How about we go into the water after this?

239
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,384
-Sounds good.
-What do you think?

240
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,385
Shall we?

241
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:01,971
Come on!

242
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,583
We're back.

243
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,006
-I missed this island.
-We're back.

244
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,685
-I hear our fellow participants coming.
-They're coming.

245
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,645
-Hey.
-Welcome to hell.

246
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,647
-Did you have fun?
-I missed you.

247
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,107
-How are you?
-I missed you.

248
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,901
-Did you have fun?
-Did you have fun?

249
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,152
Did you have a good time?

250
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,155
-How was it?
-You all look so much better.

251
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,823
You all look much better now.

252
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,700
-You're back.
-Yea-won.

253
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,076
Yea-won.

254
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,996
-I missed you.
-Me too!

255
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,122
I missed you too!

256
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,999
-Did you have fun?
-I missed you.

257
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,376
What did you do?
What did you like the most?

258
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,212
-Why are your hands so cold?
-The restroom.

259
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,380
Right. The restroom.

260
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,257
-And the shower.
-The restroom.

261
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,842
You must've liked it.

262
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,636
-You use the restroom often.
-It was so nice.

263
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,763
It was a short stay,

264
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,264
but I could feel the difference

265
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,475
-between Paradise and Inferno.
-I know.

266
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,477
We rode a helicopter there.

267
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,062
-We waved to you.
-A helicopter.

268
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,813
-Didn't you see us waving?
-No, I didn't.

269
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,191
Why would they look at us up there?

270
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,402
-But you waved back to us.
-Oh, the two dots.

271
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,446
You were the two dots I saw.

272
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,448
-Two dots.
-Right. Those two dots were us.

273
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,574
I see.

274
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,576
Then did you sleep in different bedrooms?

275
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,578
-Yes. In different rooms.
-Separate rooms.

276
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,957
We could be open
about our ages and professions.

277
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,627
-You're right.
-We talked about that,

278
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,130
-and we were both really surprised.
-I see.

279
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,590
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

280
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,468
-I have no idea how old Jin-taek could be.
-I'm so curious.

281
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,845
Does that mean he's younger than we think?

282
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,058
Well, I can't tell you
what surprised me about him, but…

283
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,851
-It's his profession.
-His profession.

284
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,687
Maybe he's a florist.

285
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,272
Or maybe he's a nail technician.

286
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,024
-Really?
-Really?

287
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:19,984
No.

288
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,860
-Is it something feminine?
-I'm curious.

289
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,905
-Anyway, I found it very interesting.
-I see.

290
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,824
Overall, we had a great time together.

291
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,410
And we were surprised
by a few things about each other.

292
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,245
-Really?
-There were unexpected things?

293
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,540
-Both of you?
-I learned something I didn't expect too.

294
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,541
I'm sure you did.

295
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,003
But I don't really care
about one's profession and age.

296
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,462
So it didn't change anything.

297
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,258
But seriously,
you guys look much better now.

298
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,511
On the first day here,

299
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:52,141
Si-hun and I were on the same team,
and he seemed very proactive.

300
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,935
So I thought he was an enthusiastic type,

301
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,566
but yesterday, he was really calm
and not that enthusiastic.

302
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,403
He said he's actually
not that kind of type.

303
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,614
-Not so proactive?
-He doesn't seem that way.

304
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,198
Are you disappointed?

305
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,909
I'm not necessarily disappointed.

306
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,661
He's just a bit different
from my first impression.

307
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,414
I learned that we were
a lot more similar than I thought.

308
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,250
-Personality-wise?
-Yes. We're both particular and sensitive.

309
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,545
We're both a bit cold.
It's not good, but we were so similar.

310
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,173
-We give similar first impressions.
-You guys hit it off.

311
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,549
We both look quite cold.

312
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,510
Isn't it comfortable
to be around people like you?

313
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,804
It is. I felt comfortable.
We had good chemistry.

314
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,722
I see.

315
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,436
But when you give something,
you should get something back too, right?

316
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,687
Right.

317
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,272
I was hoping that would happen,

318
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,734
-but it was a bit…
-You're a bit disappointed.

319
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,653
You guys might not make the best couple.

320
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,323
She made me realize
I might be a nicer person than I thought.

321
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,867
I learned I could be considerate.

322
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,120
Right. I can see
you're much more considerate now.

323
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,080
Yes.

324
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,581
But they seemed to hit it off.

325
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,042
There's something
he didn't like about her.

326
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,628
-But Ji-a liked their date.
-Right.

327
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,051
Did you enjoy your dates in Paradise?

328
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,219
Yes.

329
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,638
-Yes.
-What do you say?

330
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,099
There will be
another matching session today.

331
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,433
-Already?
-Again?

332
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,936
-Right now? Today?
-However,

333
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,480
you cannot choose the person

334
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,858
-you chose yesterday.
-What? We can't?

335
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,028
-…the person you chose yesterday.
-My gosh.

336
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,322
-Gosh.
-I just got goosebumps.

337
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,700
I literally got goosebumps.
Can you see it?

338
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,951
-So?
-I'll look forward

339
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,411
to seeing new couples.

340
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,746
For real? What does that mean?

341
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,708
-They're giving all of us a chance
-I think so.

342
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,377
-to get to know everyone here.
-To get to know each other.

343
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,629
In the end, we're supposed
to choose one person.

344
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,923
-I think that's it.
-It's so hard.

345
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,133
We have to choose again?

346
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,802
Oh, no.

347
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,638
-They may say that,
-They might be liking it.

348
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,223
but they might actually be happy.

349
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,267
It might depend on the person though.

350
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,893
This can also help them realize

351
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,771
who they're actually interested in.

352
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,731
Let's say

353
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,525
your former partner is
matched with someone else,

354
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,694
and you feel upset about it.

355
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,821
Then you'll realize

356
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,698
that you're seriously into that person.

357
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,533
I think it's a good idea that they try

358
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,868
-different partners.
-Right.

359
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,620
This means the three couples
who went to Paradise yesterday

360
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,497
-can't go there again together.
-Right.

361
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,250
This is going to be really interesting.

362
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,835
This is so exciting.

363
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,336
Gosh.

364
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,594
Participants, please come to the beach.

365
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,222
Will there be another game for men?

366
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,810
I hope not.

367
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,437
I don't think I can win.

368
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,438
-Me neither.
-Right.

369
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,648
I don't think I can beat you guys.

370
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,484
I'm not playing any games.

371
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,945
-Why not? You were the winner.
-I'm not playing.

372
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,198
Se-hoon seems dispirited.

373
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,532
He's upset.

374
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,743
-His hard work didn't pay off.
-No.

375
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,541
They're all charming in their own ways.

376
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,542
They really are.

377
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,722
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

378
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,483
This is your third day in Inferno
and your second game.

379
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,528
Today, only the women will be playing.

380
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,489
The game is the same as yesterday.

381
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:39,076
Run as fast as you can toward the flags.

382
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,912
The one to pull out the last flag

383
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,747
will be the final winner.

384
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,709
Just like yesterday, the winner will
get a chance to choose two people

385
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,586
to have a special meal with.

386
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,257
The prize for the winner is
Pyeongyang naengmyeon, suyuk bossam,

387
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,509
and iced Americanos.

388
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,927
Suyuk bossam?

389
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,387
My gosh. I have to eat that.

390
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,639
I love Pyeongyang naengmyeon.

391
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,932
I love all those menus.

392
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,643
I'm super nervous right now.

393
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,061
You can do it!

394
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,604
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

395
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,484
I'm so nervous.

396
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,864
I can see who is most likely to win.

397
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,366
So-yeon almost looks
like an Olympic athlete.

398
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,665
Pyeongyang naengmyeon?

399
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,042
Let's see how it goes.

400
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,420
You can do it!

401
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:44,850
Wait.

402
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,476
Wait. The winner is obviously…

403
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,937
Wait.

404
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,397
Wait. The winner is obviously…

405
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,447
My gosh.

406
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,615
-She's so cool.
-She is.

407
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,408
She doesn't run like the others.

408
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,993
-But Yea-won also…
-That was cool.

409
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,413
My.

410
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,710
Ji-a and Ji-yeon
have been eliminated in this round.

411
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,630
This is so embarrassing.

412
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,589
My gosh.

413
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,799
This is embarrassing.

414
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,051
That was too easy.

415
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,431
"That was too easy."

416
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,267
It's fun to watch.

417
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,194
From here, I can see
their forms are different.

418
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,112
I think Yea-won will win.

419
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,991
I think So-yeon might. She's competitive.

420
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,786
Yea-won might win. We never know.

421
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,288
She was the only woman
left in Inferno yesterday.

422
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,832
To her, this is a do-or-die situation.

423
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,090
They're running neck and neck.

424
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,466
We never know.

425
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,890
No way.

426
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,143
Oh, my goodness.

427
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,145
-No way.
-She's…

428
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,147
-She's like an athlete.
-She's so fast.

429
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,234
-She's so fast.
-How do you beat that?

430
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,318
How is that possible?

431
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,486
Oh, my goodness.

432
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,155
She's unrivaled.

433
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,327
The winner of today's game is So-yeon.

434
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,495
Congratulations.

435
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,581
-She's like an athlete.
-She didn't even try hard.

436
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,959
-Oh, my.
-I think she'd beat us too.

437
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,962
Jin-taek seems very happy.

438
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,884
I can't wait to see
whom So-yeon will choose.

439
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,761
I think she'll still choose Jin-taek.

440
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,517
Thank you.

441
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,518
Enjoy.

442
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,436
Thank you.

443
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,980
I wanted to enjoy this good food together.

444
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:55,897
Enjoy.

445
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,065
Thank you.

446
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,109
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

447
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,485
-Jun-sik?
-What?

448
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,486
What?

449
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,238
-Jin-taek isn't there.
-It's Se-hoon and Jun-sik.

450
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,197
Se-hoon and Jun-sik?

451
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,825
-Oh, no.
-Oh, Jin-taek.

452
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:11,330
So-yeon, please choose
two male participants

453
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,415
you want to have the special meal with.

454
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:21,506
I want to have the meal with the two men
who were left in Inferno yesterday.

455
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,093
-I choose Jun-sik and Se-hoon.
-Thank you.

456
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,892
To be honest, I did not see that coming.

457
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,769
Since we're here as a group,

458
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:38,023
I got the feeling
that she cares about everyone.

459
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,151
If I were Jin-taek,

460
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,279
seeing that would have made me
like her more.

461
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,947
-Being considerate of others?
-Yes.

462
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,825
Those three are such
a weird combination though.

463
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,452
Actually, you know what?

464
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,871
Se-hoon was So-yeon's choice
on the first day.

465
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:53,997
-Right.
-What?

466
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,791
There was something between them too.

467
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,086
Wait. Se-hoon chose So-yeon too.

468
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,297
Do you remember Se-hoon was
in charge of cooking earlier?

469
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,175
-Yes.
-And So-yeon helped him out then.

470
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,427
-They made fried rice together.
-Right.

471
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,054
-I remember.
-There was something going on.

472
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,305
I forgot they had that.

473
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,264
Me too.

474
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,058
It's nice to be in the shade.

475
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,060
It is. This place has the best view.

476
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,104
-We have such a nice view here.
-We do.

477
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,614
This is insane. It's so good.

478
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,282
My gosh.

479
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,369
This is so good.

480
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,205
It really is. I'm so happy I won.

481
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,665
The ice looks delicious too.

482
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,376
We've never had
a long conversation like this.

483
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,460
-Right.
-I've only

484
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,338
been talking to those
who talked to me first

485
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,049
or those who were near me.

486
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,968
So I don't know how…

487
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,596
Is there anyone else
that you're curious about?

488
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,181
Besides us two.

489
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,518
You know, we went to Paradise
with our partners.

490
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,019
-You mean the other two?
-With the people we chose.

491
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:58,937
Right.

492
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:02,190
And now I feel like
I'm stealing someone else's man.

493
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,483
Stealing someone's man?

494
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,651
-Yes.
-I understand.

495
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,696
-You know what I mean?
-Well, you're not alone.

496
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,115
-We're all in the same situation.
-We feel the same.

497
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,117
You invited Ji-yeon to the special meal,

498
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,870
and you had to see her
going to the hotel with another guy.

499
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:15,787
-Right.
-Right.

500
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,998
Didn't it feel weird?

501
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,708
-Of course, it did.
-Right?

502
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,543
-Yes.
-Those things

503
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,546
don't seem like a big deal,
but it bothers you a lot.

504
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,714
Right.

505
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:31,595
By the way, Se-hoon,
I think you're really forthright.

506
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,305
You're very easy to read.

507
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,890
-I am?
-Yes.

508
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,516
-You can see that?
-Yes.

509
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,101
I can see that very clearly.

510
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,728
-Really?
-Yes.

511
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,022
I guess I should try harder
to hide my feelings.

512
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,440
No, it's a good thing.

513
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,278
I was hoping,

514
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,072
since Ji-yeon lost the game,

515
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:55,827
that I might get to talk
to her during lunchtime.

516
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,829
That was my plan,

517
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,708
but then I was invited
to the special meal,

518
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,085
and I thought I was so unlucky

519
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,422
with the timing again.

520
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,466
That's what I thought.

521
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,013
I feel like Jin-taek will choose Ji-a.

522
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,891
-I think Se-hoon will leave.
-Am I interrupting?

523
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,144
-Sorry, I'm sitting on your bed.
-No, it's okay. You can sit there.

524
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,438
Ji-yeon, would you like
to go for a walk with me?

525
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,481
-Me?
-Yes.

526
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,404
Se-hoon is really straightforward.

527
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,364
He is.

528
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,909
He seems to feel rushed.
He thinks he missed his chance.

529
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,869
He thinks he has to do something.

530
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,038
He must've had
a lot of thoughts all night.

531
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:44,251
-So how is it? We talked yesterday.
-Right.

532
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:49,047
And you went to the hotel in Paradise
with Si-hun and talked to him.

533
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,592
Do you feel like you got to know us more?

534
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,220
Well, it's hard to say
I got to know a lot.

535
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,013
-It was too short.
-Not long enough?

536
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,017
We talked for a couple of hours.
Yesterday, we talked for only 30 minutes.

537
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,936
-Right?
-Right. And it was so hot then.

538
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,271
-Right.
-That's not enough

539
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,939
-to get to know each other.
-Right.

540
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,361
-Se-hoon.
-Yes?

541
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,991
Aren't there others
you want to get to know better?

542
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:20,078
Well, let me be perfectly honest with you.

543
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,580
I just want to get to know you better.

544
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,543
There are so many things
I want to know about you.

545
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:30,380
I still haven't figured out
what kind of person you are.

546
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,339
Really?

547
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,259
-Yes. I have no idea.
-You mean, you don't know my disposition?

548
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,430
Yes, I feel like I know
what kind of personality you have,

549
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,348
-but not your disposition.
-Really?

550
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,766
I want to know what you like

551
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,352
-and what you don't like.
-That's what you want to know.

552
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,770
I want to know these things.

553
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,605
You're right.

554
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,442
We don't have many chances
to talk to each other.

555
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,235
-Right.
-It isn't easy to learn things

556
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,528
-about each other.
-Right.

557
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,863
Right.

558
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,947
Exactly.

559
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,826
I was just trying to say
that I want to get to know you better.

560
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:00,827
I see.

561
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:05,749
I'm still curious about you,
and I thought I should at least try

562
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,754
to make a chance
to get to know you better.

563
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,465
I thought it'd be a shame

564
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,134
-if I didn't even get to try.
-I see.

565
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,844
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

566
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,429
I see.

567
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,932
How was the helicopter ride?
Did you enjoy it?

568
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,352
It was a lot of fun.
It felt like an amusement ride.

569
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,853
-Really?
-It went like this.

570
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,438
Do you like amusement rides?

571
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,524
Not all rides.
I only like certain kinds of rides.

572
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,776
What are they?

573
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,902
Well…

574
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,403
Do you like merry-go-rounds?

575
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,821
-No, I don't.
-Then?

576
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,656
I like rollercoasters.

577
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,158
-Rollercoasters?
-Yes.

578
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,497
You seemed upset you didn't
get to swim. Do you like to swim?

579
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,459
I do, but I was told
that there would be another chance.

580
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,585
I see.

581
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,504
So I hope I can get to go swimming

582
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,755
sometime soon.

583
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,967
There are so many flies here.

584
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:58,885
Seriously.

585
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,235
He wants to ask her some questions,
but there are too many flies.

586
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:18,321
-Anyway, Se-hoon keeps asking questions
-Right.

587
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,198
-and Ji-yeon keeps answering.
-Right.

588
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,241
Yes.

589
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,827
Ji-yeon said this to Se-hoon earlier.

590
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,038
"Aren't there others
you want to get to know better?"

591
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:31,543
And I think that question
implies what Ji-yeon thinks.

592
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,881
It means, "Why don't you stop wondering
about me and get to know others too?"

593
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,009
Ji-yeon wants to talk to everyone equally.

594
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,679
On the other hand,
Se-hoon wants to talk to Ji-yeon only.

595
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,433
He's always there.

596
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,435
Like a doorkeeper.

597
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,687
Did you have a good conversation?

598
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,355
Yes. What are you doing, Jin-taek?

599
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,524
Did you agree
to talk casually with each other?

600
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,067
-We all agreed to do that.
-Yes.

601
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,902
-So you just call his name?
-Yes.

602
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,572
-You can talk casually with us too.
-You can do that.

603
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,740
Call me "Jin-taek".

604
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,116
-Seriously.
-Okay.

605
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,617
Maybe I should do that.

606
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,952
-Should we?
-Sure.

607
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,579
It's hot now.

608
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,832
Yea-won, you know
who you want to choose now, right?

609
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,292
-Me?
-Don't you?

610
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,003
Right. Well, I'm not sure.

611
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,379
The thing is…

612
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,550
So what do you think of the two?
Do you find them attractive?

613
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:26,848
-Well, I knew Jun-sik was a quiet type.
-Right.

614
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,019
But I didn't know Se-hoon was
a quiet type as well.

615
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,521
He was much nicer than I thought.

616
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,522
I see.

617
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,607
I see. Unexpectedly?

618
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,691
Exactly. So…

619
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,986
-Se-hoon is really nice.
-I'm curious.

620
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,446
Really.

621
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,283
What do you think of the other guys?
What do you think of Si-hun?

622
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,536
I don't know.
I didn't really get to talk to him.

623
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,498
We talked once
when we cooked the rice together,

624
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,374
but we haven't talked since.

625
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,459
-Really?
-Yes.

626
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:59,422
At first, I thought
Si-hun was really active,

627
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,591
but he's becoming quieter and quieter.

628
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,884
Right.

629
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,677
I really have no idea.

630
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,054
You must be so torn.

631
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,683
We just got back.
We didn't even get to talk.

632
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,060
-Right.
-Right.

633
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,354
It's not easy.

634
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,773
It's impossible to know.

635
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,776
-Jin-taek, did you make up your mind?
-I think you'll go to Paradise today.

636
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,277
Me? You think I'll go there?

637
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,239
-You know you will.
-What do you mean?

638
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,324
-I know who you're choosing. But I'm not…
-Ji-a?

639
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,285
-I wasn't going to say any names.
-What are you saying?

640
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,037
-No.
-You know you can leave tonight.

641
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,288
No, that's not true.

642
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,833
I know what you're thinking,
but that's not true.

643
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,418
I thought you might have a chance, but…

644
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,420
I think we all will go
to Paradise tonight.

645
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,756
No, I really have no one to go there with.

646
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,341
-You say that, but you'll go.
-No.

647
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,386
Seriously, I haven't even made
any eye contact with anyone.

648
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:52,433
Today, we can just choose
the ones we want to get to know better.

649
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,518
Right.

650
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,981
So I think everyone will feel
much less pressure than yesterday.

651
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:58,940
Right.

652
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,734
From what we saw just now,

653
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,947
Ji-yeon seemed a little jealous
regarding Si-hun.

654
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,991
Right. I also feel like
she's a bit jealous.

655
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,535
When she was with Se-hoon,
she only answered questions.

656
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,414
But here with Si-hun, she takes
the initiative in the conversation.

657
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,208
-Right. She's more active here.
-I can tell she's different.

658
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,629
She talks to Se-hoon
and Si-hun differently.

659
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,840
And there's one more thing
I can tell for sure.

660
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,675
Jin-taek is not interested in others.

661
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,262
He's almost like a doorkeeper there.

662
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,763
-Am I wrong?
-He's so cute.

663
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,181
He made up his mind,
so he feels comfortable.

664
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,768
-He's really cute.
-He decided to just stay in Inferno.

665
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:41,399
But if Jin-taek goes to Paradise
with someone else, that means…

666
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,026
Gosh, that means…

667
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,778
That means Jin-taek is a diligent man.

668
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,365
That means he's really diligent.
Because he's also a doorkeeper.

669
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,494
INFERNO

670
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,997
INFERNO

671
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,625
INFERNO

672
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,587
-This is all happening so fast.
-Things are happening so fast today.

673
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,547
-I just got back.
-Today is the fastest.

674
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,930
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

675
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,806
Who do we choose?

676
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,352
All male participants have
already decided.

677
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,353
Already?

678
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,856
30 MINUTES AGO

679
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,448
Female participants,
come out to the campfire one by one

680
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,867
and say the name of the person

681
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,869
you'd like to take to Paradise.

682
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,622
I have to go out there again. I'm nervous.

683
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,334
-We can't let our guards down, right?
-I think so.

684
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,962
Am I the only one who's nervous here?

685
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,924
This is hard.

686
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:48,841
Today's hard.

687
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,094
Did you eat when you arrived there?

688
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,722
We ordered room service
as soon as we got there.

689
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,231
He's excited to go there.

690
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,649
If he has to stay here again,

691
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,150
-he'll be so upset.
-Right.

692
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,444
I hope those
who stayed yesterday can go today.

693
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,155
The couple matching rule has changed.

694
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,241
They can't go with the ones
they chose before,

695
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,035
which means they need
to find a new partner.

696
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,079
That's why we can't tell how it'll go.

697
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,123
-I have no idea.
-Me neither.

698
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,505
I really hope Yea-won can go
to Paradise this time.

699
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,299
-Me too. I hope she can go there.
-Me too.

700
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,934
I want to go to Paradise…

701
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,072
I want to go to Paradise

702
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,034
with Jun-sik.

703
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,163
-She's such a one-man woman.
-Please, Jun-sik!

704
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,706
She's so adorable.

705
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,207
Jun-sik, she's the real deal.

706
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,876
-Jun-sik.
-Let's go today.

707
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,139
Jun-sik, you found your match.

708
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,187
-They've become a couple.
-He chose her too.

709
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,271
They chose each other.

710
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,650
-See you.
-What are you doing?

711
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,902
You don't have to bow.

712
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,445
-I'm leaving now.
-Nice.

713
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,571
-See you.
-Have fun.

714
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,240
-I'll see you guys there.
-Good luck and have fun.

715
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,034
-Bye.
-Bye.

716
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:38,951
See you.

717
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,172
Sorry I kept you waiting.

718
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,675
-Is this your bag?
-Yes.

719
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,386
-Sorry I kept you waiting.
-Do we just go? That's okay.

720
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,722
I was told to order room service
as soon as we get there.

721
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,183
-I heard the same thing.
-Good. And…

722
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,351
They gave me some tips.

723
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,437
Did Yea-won leave?

724
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,564
-She must have.
-I guess she did.

725
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,025
I think so too.
I heard she got along well with him.

726
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:16,781
Being left in Inferno
can actually be an opportunity.

727
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,492
-Right.
-Now, we only have Se-hoon left.

728
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,536
Right. I really wish
he can leave this time.

729
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,705
-I'm so happy for those two.
-I'm worried Se-hoon might get angry.

730
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,919
KANG SO-YEON

731
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,754
-That's So-yeon.
-Who would she choose?

732
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,048
-I can't wait to see whom she'll choose.
-Me too.

733
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:40,763
I want to go to Paradise…

734
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,774
with Se-hoon.

735
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,665
Is So-yeon leaving too?

736
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,126
Maybe she left.

737
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,919
She might have, really.

738
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,505
She's not coming back.

739
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,299
But with whom?

740
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,509
I wonder whom she left with.

741
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,139
I'm back.

742
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,686
-No, she came back.
-Of course.

743
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,104
He chose Ji-yeon.

744
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,856
This is going to be awkward.

745
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,024
I'm back.

746
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,839
SONG JI-A

747
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,217
I wonder whom Ji-a will choose.

748
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,885
-I'm so curious.
-It's Ji-a's turn.

749
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,138
If Jin-taek leaves, I'm going to put
all three beds together and sleep on them.

750
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,932
-I'm not going.
-It's a king-size bed.

751
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,558
You're so going there.

752
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,476
I am?

753
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,144
-You'd better get ready.
-For what?

754
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,479
-Be nice to Ji-a.
-For sure.

755
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,356
I'm 100 percent sure.

756
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,947
I want to go on a date…

757
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,999
I want to go on a date with Si-hun.

758
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,418
-What?
-Si-hun.

759
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,839
Si-hun showed some interest
in Ji-a at first.

760
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,007
-Remember?
-Yes, he did.

761
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,384
I wonder whom Si-hun chose.

762
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,690
Si-hun, you found your match.

763
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,987
-What?
-Did he choose her?

764
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,946
Really?

765
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,531
Si-hun is such a lucky guy.

766
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,741
-He must be happy.
-I wonder why she chose him.

767
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,159
He's sleeping in the suite for two nights.

768
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,287
He's spending more time in Paradise.

769
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,497
See? I knew this would happen.

770
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,916
This can't be true.

771
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,252
This doesn't make sense.

772
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,628
Have fun.

773
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,255
This can't be happening.

774
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,172
Bye, Si-hun.

775
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,882
I can't believe this.

776
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,759
I wonder who it is.

777
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,971
-This is crazy.
-Bye.

778
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,807
-We'll see who's left.
-Seriously, this is crazy.

779
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,267
Gosh.

780
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,524
I can't believe this.

781
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,361
Good to see you again.

782
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,949
-Thank you. Let me…
-I can't believe this actually worked.

783
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,868
Let me carry them.

784
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,787
-They're really heavy.
-I can carry them for you.

785
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,872
Just carry one for me.

786
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,124
-Your hand.
-It's okay. I didn't hurt it.

787
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,292
Then let me drag this.

788
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,501
No. It's okay.

789
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,962
I can't believe this.

790
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,340
I can't believe it either.

791
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,382
This can't be true.

792
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,386
I was 100 percent sure
I would be staying here today.

793
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,512
Why?

794
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,640
I thought you wouldn't choose me.

795
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,772
Seriously, this is nonsense.

796
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,940
-This is cool.
-This feels great.

797
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,650
I thought I'd stay too.

798
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,736
-It feels great? Why?
-Of course it does.

799
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,780
I was chosen.

800
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,199
Gosh, this is interesting.

801
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,410
So it's either one of the two. So-yeon or…

802
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,204
-It must be So-yeon.
-Ji-a.

803
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,747
Ji-a?

804
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,209
-No way.
-It has to be one of them.

805
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,212
Right. Because he left.

806
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,215
But So-yeon…

807
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,094
What do I do?

808
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,016
This is tiring.

809
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,741
This is hard.

810
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,376
Actually, Ji-yeon knows
how to go to Paradise.

811
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,586
I won't tell you how,

812
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,089
but she can definitely go there.

813
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,553
-Gosh.
-Did she choose him back?

814
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,057
-Wait. Jin-taek?
-Jin-taek chose Ji-yeon too?

815
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,476
Hyeon-joong chose Ji-yeon too.
They all chose her.

816
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,479
-And nobody chose her on the first day.
-Really?

817
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,608
-Three men.
-Now, it's all up to Ji-yeon.

818
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,819
Whoever she chooses,
she can go to Paradise.

819
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:50,990
-Right. She can definitely go there.
-She's definitely going to Paradise.

820
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,575
What matters is with whom.

821
00:40:53,576 --> 00:41:00,124
SHIN JI-YEON

822
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,640
I want to go to Paradise with…

823
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,100
Gosh, I'm so curious.

824
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,856
I hope it doesn't end up like yesterday.

825
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,107
We never know.

826
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,444
Yesterday was the worst.

827
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,257
-Who is it?
-Who is coming out?

828
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,139
-Who is it?
-Seriously?

829
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,724
-Someone's coming out.
-Who is it?

830
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,352
Se-hoon.

831
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,657
-Isn't he Jin-taek?
-It looks like Jin-taek.

832
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,367
-No way.
-That's Jin-taek's clothes.

833
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,869
I saw it.

834
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,995
-Jin-taek?
-That's Jin-taek's bag.

835
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,288
It's Jin-taek!

836
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,793
Shall we?

837
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,837
-I knew it. I was right.
-The shoes…

838
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,589
I got goosebumps.

839
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,592
-I'm really surprised.
-Me too.

840
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,053
I really thought
I'd have to stay here today.

841
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,181
-I was thinking the same.
-Seriously.

842
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,724
I wasn't expecting to go.

843
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,519
I was surprised when my name was called.

844
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,396
-Really?
-Yes.

845
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,856
I can't believe this worked out.

846
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,860
This is really amazing.

847
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,364
-Thank you.
-No, I should thank you.

848
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,908
What is this?

849
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,661
Wait. I feel bad for Se-hoon now.

850
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,162
Poor him.

851
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,043
I'm alone.
There's nothing I can do about it.

852
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,878
No.

853
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,047
I might end up
the only single person here.

854
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,549
-I'm serious.
-I doubt it.

855
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:24,184
The third couple matching is now over.

856
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,607
…couple matching is now over.

857
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,069
Yea-won, Ji-a.

858
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,199
How are you so sure that he chose Ji-a?

859
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,909
-What?
-Why are you sure it's Ji-a?

860
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,495
Right. It might be Ji-yeon.

861
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,290
-You're right.
-I have no idea.

862
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,533
I thought Jin-taek
would be left in Inferno.

863
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,746
I chose to vote for someone
who wouldn't vote for me

864
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,707
so that I could stay here.

865
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,711
And I thought he'd do the same.

866
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,673
I thought he'd like to stay with me.

867
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:39,134
And now I realize I was wrong.

868
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:45,349
I didn't know that was her plan.

869
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,477
She wanted to be left
in Inferno together with Jin-taek.

870
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,937
She couldn't choose him

871
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,647
-because of the rule.
-She chose someone else

872
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,273
because of the rule, but…

873
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,361
I think both Jin-taek
and Ji-yeon chose someone

874
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,655
-they thought would never choose them.
-Right.

875
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,823
-Right.
-They happened to…

876
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,324
-Is that it?
-They both seemed flustered.

877
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,659
-They seemed surprised.
-Right.

878
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:09,581
But didn't Jin-taek look
too happy from the back to say that?

879
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,919
But when he walked out of the lodging,
he looked like, "Wait. This isn't right."

880
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,087
Did he?

881
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,213
Shall we?

882
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,800
Actually, I'm more worried

883
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,053
-about Se-hoon.
-Please don't talk about him.

884
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,681
-I barely managed to forget him.
-What will happen to him?

885
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,850
His face in the end…

886
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,268
He looks so different from the first day.

887
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,686
-He seemed so shocked.
-Right.

888
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,606
He's usually a really popular man.

889
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,568
-He's hot and fit.
-I know.

890
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:41,071
I'm sure he has never experienced
something like this ever in his life.

891
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,448
I bet it's never happened.

892
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,324
Do you know what I'm worried about?

893
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,202
We might not get to know
what Se-hoon's profession is.

894
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,288
Until this show is over?

895
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,790
That's a good point.
That's actually possible.

896
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:55,836
I mean, I'm guessing he might be a chef,
but I'm not sure.

897
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,762
Who is it?

898
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,265
I'm used to this now.

899
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,558
Whose bag is that?

900
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,018
I'm used to this now.

901
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,984
Let's put on something comfortable.

902
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:20,736
I'm okay. This is comfortable.

903
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,113
Let's not get changed.
Let's just eat some food and rest.

904
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,576
I need to use the restroom.

905
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,661
-Okay.
-I'm glad we ate the naengmyeon today.

906
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,708
Let's have a nice meal.

907
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,838
Today is tougher than yesterday.

908
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,012
How about we make egg potato soup and…

909
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,555
How about this?

910
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,723
What?

911
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:52,601
We can stir-fry
the ingredients with a spicy sauce

912
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,436
and mix that with rice and fried eggs.

913
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,939
Okay. Then we should peel the onions and…

914
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,690
-Could you…
-I'll make the fire.

915
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,651
-Okay.
-Then I'll prepare the ingredients.

916
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,781
The people who left today
are good at this.

917
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:09,451
I knew Jun-sik
and Yea-won would be a match,

918
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,827
but the rest…

919
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,830
-Right? It's amazing.
-It's just so random.

920
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:14,831
I know.

921
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,754
Look at him. He became a cauldron.

922
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,428
He's wearing the same color.

923
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,930
He's wearing black.

924
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,140
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

925
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,351
My gosh.

926
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,813
-I'm not supposed to laugh, but…
-He's the true star of the day.

927
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,148
-Right.
-Stop it.

928
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,360
-Let's watch the whole thing.
-You need to hit the bottom to rise.

929
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,413
How about we make some potato soup?
We just need some potato, salt,

930
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,749
and sesame oil to make potato soup.

931
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,667
No. Forget it.

932
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,877
-Don't bother.
-I can make stir-fried potatoes.

933
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,548
-Don't bother. Let's eat this only.
-Stir-fried potatoes are tasty.

934
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,924
Let's do what Se-hoon wants.

935
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,218
I'll start cooking rice.

936
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,136
Okay.

937
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,679
What?

938
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,181
I cooked rice so many times here.

939
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:18,604
This place is making me
practice cooking with a cauldron.

940
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,399
Cooking was the last thing
I wanted to do here.

941
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,904
My gosh. Even the way he talks is funny.

942
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,157
He's cooking three days in a row.

943
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,329
If the heat is too high,
take out a few pieces of wood.

944
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,246
I just did.

945
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,167
Aren't you Inferno's master of fried rice?

946
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,382
I could play along with jokes yesterday.

947
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:51,011
Looks like I'm out of patience today.

948
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,638
-You're cracking me up.
-I can't do that today.

949
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,972
-He's not himself today.
-I mean it.

950
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,223
This is hilarious.

951
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,475
Gosh.

952
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,643
Look at him.

953
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,940
It's sizzling.

954
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:08,820
You see,

955
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,157
I told myself
I had no chance today anyway,

956
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,285
but seeing my partner
from yesterday leaving for the island,

957
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,704
-I don't feel comfortable.
-I know. Of course.

958
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,165
-This doesn't feel very nice.
-Still, you got to have

959
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,084
a nice conversation with Ji-a yesterday.

960
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,127
Actually, Ji-a was the only one

961
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,712
I could choose.

962
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,297
-You had no other choice.
-No.

963
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,967
I thought I should
get to know others better.

964
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:33,970
That looks delicious.

965
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,639
My gosh.

966
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,312
-What's with the sigh?
-What?

967
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,942
-Why would you sigh like that?
-I'm just hot and tired. That's why.

968
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,444
It's because I'm hot.

969
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,948
-Would you like some Coke?
-Sure. That would be nice.

970
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,952
Coke.

971
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:58,745
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

972
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,913
This is just Coke.

973
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,959
It tastes good.

974
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,086
-This is good.
-It's been a while indeed.

975
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,755
We don't have it on the deserted island.

976
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,135
We'll be able to tell from his face

977
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,469
-and the way he talks
-Yes.

978
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,471
whether he chose her because he liked her.

979
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,223
-Right.
-It's the same with Ji-yeon.

980
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,976
We'll soon know why they chose each other.

981
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,687
What's your ideal type?

982
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,439
-Me?
-Yes.

983
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,108
I'm attracted to those
who are trustworthy and…

984
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,985
-Trustworthy.
-Trustworthy and…

985
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,194
Trustworthy.

986
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,239
And manly. I'm attracted to manly types.

987
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,950
Men who have their own opinions.

988
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:40,162
Later, when you choose
a ice cream flavor, choose chocolate.

989
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,206
-Are you making a decision for me?
-Okay?

990
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,752
I'll make decisions for you.

991
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,462
And?

992
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:53,216
I'm attracted to those who are decisive,
but sweet at the same time.

993
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,093
-I see.
-I think I'm attracted to that.

994
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,928
Would you like
to have your steak well-done?

995
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,307
You know what I want.

996
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,475
You're quick-witted.

997
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:04,686
Jin-taek is flirting with her.

998
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,937
Jin-taek.

999
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,441
It might be that Jin-taek is actually
just feeling comfortable around her.

1000
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,610
I mean, as if he's around his friends.

1001
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,278
-He might be joking around.
-Right.

1002
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,738
We'll have to see.

1003
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,073
-What about you?
-Me?

1004
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,912
I think I'm often attracted to tall women.

1005
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,623
How tall?

1006
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,874
How tall are you?

1007
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,626
-I'm about 168 or 169cm tall.
-I see.

1008
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:28,877
About that tall.

1009
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,170
Is that so?

1010
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,422
I see.

1011
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,341
-Yes.
-Okay.

1012
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,718
What else besides height?

1013
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,637
Other than height…

1014
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,181
I feel like you'd be attracted to those

1015
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,059
-who are healthy and athletic.
-I am.

1016
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,187
I'm attracted to those who look healthy.

1017
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,438
I assumed so.

1018
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,773
Why?

1019
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,108
-I like healthy women.
-Healthy women.

1020
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,152
-And you look very healthy.
-Me?

1021
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,113
-I don't look that athletic though.
-Right.

1022
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,950
One doesn't need
to be athletic to be healthy.

1023
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,744
Some people just give off a healthy vibe.

1024
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,120
-Right.
-That's what I mean.

1025
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,416
Do you usually prefer
men who are older than you or…

1026
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,377
-I usually do.
-I see.

1027
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,254
And I asked myself why.

1028
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,923
I thought it might be because
they're more mature than me

1029
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,174
and there are many things

1030
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,134
-I can learn from them, but…
-Please. Sit comfortably.

1031
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,180
But I think I'm just attracted
to men who are older than me.

1032
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,348
-To older men.
-Yes.

1033
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,976
-Just like I'm attracted to tall women.
-Right.

1034
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,770
I don't think there's
a specific reason why.

1035
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:29,729
You're right.

1036
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,356
There are no specific reasons.

1037
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,276
By the way…

1038
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,781
is there a reason why you chose me?

1039
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:47,956
Well, we hung out together
in the lodging today.

1040
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,040
Right before we voted.

1041
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,208
Right.

1042
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,670
And I thought you were really funny.

1043
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:57,299
I don't know what to do.
We're not supposed to choose

1044
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,050
the one we chose yesterday.

1045
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,303
So I've been sending a signal to Jin-taek.

1046
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,932
-Because you want to go with him?
-Really?

1047
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,268
-Is that why?
-I didn't know that.

1048
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,562
When's your birthday?

1049
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,105
-I was born in May.
-May.

1050
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,565
I'm May Jin-taek.

1051
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,194
He's so funny. That's hilarious.

1052
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,405
I thought you were funny,

1053
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,323
Yes?

1054
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,535
so I wanted to talk to you.
I got curious about you.

1055
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,495
What about you?

1056
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:34,294
Actually, when we were
in the room together,

1057
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,465
I felt your gaze.

1058
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,091
-My gaze?
-Yes.

1059
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,134
Is that so?

1060
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,385
Or maybe I was mistaken.

1061
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,097
-What was it like?
-When we made eye contact.

1062
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,098
I see.

1063
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,352
Maybe it was one-sided.

1064
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,645
I see.

1065
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,234
-Why don't we talk casually?
-Let's do that.

1066
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,319
Okay.

1067
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,197
-I'll just talk casually then.
-Please. So I can do the same.

1068
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,490
Okay.

1069
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:04,658
I'm…

1070
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,036
-I'm really bad at talking casually.
-Too sudden?

1071
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:08,995
Really?

1072
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,790
I can't even talk casually
to my close friends.

1073
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,334
I'm the same, but here,
I feel like we should do that

1074
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,379
as soon as possible to get closer faster.
We don't have much time.

1075
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,547
-You did a great job just now.
-I did? Thanks.

1076
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,257
Okay.

1077
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,218
-So we're talking casually.
-You already got used to it.

1078
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,555
-I'm glad I came here with you.
-Really?

1079
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,723
Yes.

1080
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,350
See?

1081
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,686
He's flirting with her.

1082
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:36,606
And he talked
as if So-yeon was the only one he liked.

1083
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,734
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

1084
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,239
It tastes good.

1085
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,747
Let's talk about our ideal types.
Oh, we did it yesterday.

1086
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,957
-Let's do that.
-Did we?

1087
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,041
No, we didn't.

1088
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:59,504
I need to talk to someone
for a long time to get to know them.

1089
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,090
You talked to Ji-a yesterday. How was it?

1090
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:05,051
-I think I should get to know her better.
-Do you like her more?

1091
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,679
-In a way, yes.
-I see.

1092
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,597
-In a way, no.
-I see.

1093
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,934
I think I'm often attracted to women

1094
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,519
who have thick lips.

1095
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,854
I see.

1096
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,691
But Ji-yeon has thin lips.

1097
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,615
I didn't say that.

1098
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,368
-Never mind.
-I only looked at her eyes.

1099
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,661
-Only her eyes?
-Yes.

1100
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:35,290
You didn't look at her lips. I see.

1101
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,294
How about you? You went to Paradise

1102
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:45,341
with Jin-taek yesterday.
Do you think you like him better now?

1103
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,387
He really liked me, and I appreciated it.

1104
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,973
I mean, there are so many people here.

1105
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,183
Really?

1106
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,060
And he plucked up the courage
and said he liked me,

1107
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,519
in front of all the people.

1108
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,812
I'm so jealous.

1109
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,731
-I really appreciate it.
-Let's say

1110
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,526
you like someone, and you openly say

1111
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,278
that you like them.

1112
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,404
But if the person says,

1113
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,241
"Thank you", instead of "I like you too",

1114
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,993
it'll be really sad.

1115
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,495
-Right.
-Seriously.

1116
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,954
Well, it's not like,
"No. Definitely not him."

1117
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,040
I know. But it's more
a feeling of gratitude.

1118
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,250
We all had a lot to think about here.

1119
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,835
-Right.
-We had a lot to think about.

1120
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,588
But he collected his thoughts,

1121
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:26,091
came back to the lodging,

1122
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,593
and made time to talk to me alone.

1123
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,012
I think he's amazing.

1124
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,765
So I was thankful
that he took the initiative.

1125
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,018
You have no idea
what Jin-taek is doing now.

1126
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,270
You're too into this.

1127
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:42,982
Try this.

1128
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,776
Thank you.

1129
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,362
I'd like to have it with the steak sauce.

1130
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,114
-Do you like whole grain mustard?
-What?

1131
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,157
-Whole grain mustard.
-Oh, of course.

1132
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,492
-Of course?
-I like it.

1133
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,036
Thanks.

1134
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,040
You're doing everything for me.

1135
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,917
-It's easier to eat that way.
-It is.

1136
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,130
-It's tasty.
-Do you like it?

1137
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,214
Yes.

1138
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,384
Don't you want to talk casually with me?

1139
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,301
Oh, right.

1140
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,805
-It's awkward, right? Then just…
-How about

1141
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,308
we take a sip when we use honorifics?

1142
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,643
Okay. That sounds good.

1143
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:21,229
-Okay? Starting now.
-Are you sure it's not awkward?

1144
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,313
-It's not.
-Okay.

1145
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,273
Let's start now.

1146
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,025
You're not going to say anything now,
are you?

1147
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,529
-This bulgogi is delicious.
-It is, isn't it?

1148
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,698
It tastes really good.

1149
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,328
What did you talk about
with So-yeon yesterday?

1150
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:38,663
What?

1151
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,124
-What we talked about?
-Yes.

1152
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,293
I'm sure you talked a lot.

1153
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,383
We actually spent most of our time eating.

1154
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,926
-Eating?
-Yes.

1155
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,636
My gosh.

1156
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,513
No, you didn't.

1157
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,432
Okay.

1158
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,809
-What's happening now?
-Jin-taek.

1159
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,102
Did he change his mind?

1160
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,688
We actually spent most of our time eating.

1161
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,148
-Eating?
-Yes.

1162
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,610
It turned out
that So-yeon was a big eater.

1163
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,071
-We ate a lot of food.
-You ate a lot?

1164
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,122
-Those earrings look really nice on you.
-My earrings?

1165
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,583
I wanted to change them,
but it's been so hectic.

1166
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,585
-So I'm wearing them all the time.
-Really?

1167
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,255
-They look simple. They look good on you.
-Simple.

1168
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:36,304
-I think Jin-taek is the funniest here.
-He's the funniest?

1169
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,305
Yes.

1170
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,890
He's a really nice guy.

1171
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,475
When guys say some guy is nice…

1172
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,393
-He's a really nice guy?
-Yes.

1173
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,811
Do you like facial masks?

1174
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,980
Well, I don't use them very often.

1175
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,148
Is that so?

1176
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,274
Yes. I barely use them.

1177
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,567
Then let's use one today.

1178
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,860
Okay.

1179
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,490
I'm not sure because

1180
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,076
all men are enthusiastic at first.

1181
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,161
At first, all men are sweet
to their women.

1182
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,414
But only some men don't change.

1183
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,793
-Some men are sweet only in the beginning.
-Right.

1184
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,046
This is the second time we came here
and we came together.

1185
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,005
Right.

1186
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,133
This game has just started.

1187
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,598
-You don't want to go home, do you?
-No.

1188
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:25,395
I'm starting to get the hang
of what I should do here.

1189
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,521
Right.

1190
