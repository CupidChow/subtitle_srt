1
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,103
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,647
Hye-seon, come over here.

3
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,816
-Let's talk.
-Should we go inside?

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,234
Yes, let's go over there.

5
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,239
I've had a chance
to talk to everyone I wanted to talk to.

6
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,658
-When the new member arrives,
-Yes.

7
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,412
I plan on chatting with her a few times.

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,789
But after that,
I think things will be clear for me.

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,874
I see.

10
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,586
I want to be honest with you today.

11
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,380
-Okay.
-And I want you to be honest with me too.

12
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,423
You do?

13
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,092
Yes. I want to know where we stand.

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,052
Sure.

15
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,512
Well, in my case…

16
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,058
I've also talked to everyone
as of yesterday.

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,478
And now that I have,
I think I have everyone figured out.

18
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:05,065
Here's how I feel.
I told you I like to be honest, right?

19
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:05,982
Right.

20
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,613
I'm still attracted to you the most.

21
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,864
-You are?
-Yes.

22
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,908
I'm still attracted to you the most.

23
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,159
-You are?
-Yes.

24
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:21,247
But I still stand by what I said
in the hot tub when we went to Paradise.

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,834
I want you to get to know the others
and go to Paradise with them.

26
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,672
I feel like that's necessary,
and the same applies to me.

27
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,968
I am attracted to you,
but I'm still curious about a few guys.

28
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,887
When we're in Paradise,

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,724
we can be open
about our age and occupation.

30
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:44,312
I think having that conversation
could make a difference.

31
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,565
That's why I want to go to Paradise
with a few other guys.

32
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,155
That makes sense.

33
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,741
-She's so honest.
-Yes, it makes total sense.

34
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,039
That was really honest of you.

35
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,166
That's where I stand right now.

36
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,466
Can I be really honest with you,
or should I keep it at your level?

37
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:18,096
I can also sugarcoat it
if that's what you prefer.

38
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,640
Just tell me how honest you want me to be.

39
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,559
It's your choice.

40
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,770
-I don't want you to sugarcoat it.
-Okay.

41
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,981
I want a decent amount of honesty.

42
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,315
Just keep it at my level.

43
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:35,780
When we first met,
I thought you were totally my type.

44
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,782
That's what I thought,

45
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,409
but when we were in Paradise,

46
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,578
I just couldn't keep up with your energy.

47
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,374
I mean, I thought you'd be a calm person.

48
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,169
But then, I had a great time
with Ha-jeong in Paradise.

49
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,798
So I was attracted to her
the most at the time.

50
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,177
But when I got back and saw you,

51
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,723
it felt like I was meeting
my ex-girlfriend.

52
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,641
Ha-jeong said she felt the same way.

53
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,977
Hello.

54
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,022
Was Paradise fun?

55
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,398
It was all right.

56
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,193
I see.

57
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,238
Then, we paired up
and played a game together.

58
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,908
We meet again.

59
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,870
The way I felt during the game…

60
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:24,913
Should I get down?

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,251
And the way I felt

62
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,462
-when we had dinner…
-Give me some rice.

63
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,799
-I could see that you were
-Do you like perilla leaves?

64
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,428
trying to look out for me
and being really thoughtful.

65
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,474
And that sort of made me sure about you.

66
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,809
That's how I felt.

67
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,479
And to be more honest,

68
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,357
the person I'm attracted to the most

69
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,237
is you.

70
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,743
That's when I realized
that I actually do care about you.

71
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,995
I really felt that.

72
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,040
But the thing is,
whenever we would spend time together,

73
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,460
I would get a sense
that you were upset with me.

74
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,379
That's the vibe I got.

75
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,546
Was I right?

76
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,049
I guess a little.

77
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,176
What exactly upset you?

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,720
I wouldn't say I was upset.

79
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:28,059
I just thought, "Wow, he's so busy
going around talking to the other girls."

80
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,310
Is that how it seemed?

81
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,437
It's true, though. You were pretty busy.

82
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,356
Yes, I did want to talk to Gyu-ri.

83
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,400
-Right, exactly.
-You could've felt that way.

84
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,779
But like I said earlier,
I totally get why you'd want that.

85
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,449
But it did bother me
because you seemed so eager.

86
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,159
-That's how I felt.
-Okay.

87
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,161
Is that why you were upset?

88
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,664
-I just felt--
-Would you say you were annoyed?

89
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,417
-It bothered me a little.
-It bothered you? Okay.

90
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,962
I don't want to try
to make something happen with Gyu-ri.

91
00:04:56,045 --> 00:05:00,842
I'd rather let things flow
and see how it goes with her.

92
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,804
-Okay.
-As for the new participant,

93
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:09,017
I'll probably chat a couple times
with her when I get the chance.

94
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,312
But there are already
three people I'm attracted to, so…

95
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,189
I don't know
how you're going to take this,

96
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,860
but I wanted to let you know
that I'm attracted to you the most.

97
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,904
If I were to go to Paradise tomorrow

98
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,699
and could choose someone to go with,

99
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,536
I think I'd probably

100
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,539
want to go with you.

101
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,500
I'll keep that in mind.

102
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,129
There's no need for that.
You should go with Ha-bin.

103
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,299
Ha-bin or Won-ik.
Just go with whoever you want.

104
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,721
Who knows? If you end up
going to Paradise with someone else,

105
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,140
that might change how I feel.

106
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,852
I do wonder how I'd feel
if you went with one of them.

107
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,110
It feels good to be honest about all this.

108
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,868
-That was very healthy and constructive.
-It was.

109
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,205
It's quite different
from the conversation the girls had.

110
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,956
-They roasted him hard.
-Yes.

111
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,584
They completely tore him to bits.

112
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,630
I actually thought all that roasting

113
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,758
would've made Hye-seon
lose all interest in Gwan-hee.

114
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,551
-Right.
-But I guess not.

115
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,805
And isn't this the first time
for Gwan-hee to speak

116
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,556
that clearly about his feelings?

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,891
"I like you the most."

118
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,977
But the problem is,
that may be true at the moment,

119
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,188
but once there are other possibilities,

120
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,689
he could change his mind.

121
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,608
His feelings keep changing.

122
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,737
But Hye-seon isn't being clingy at all.
She seems rather relaxed.

123
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,739
I don't think that's what it is.

124
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:51,953
I think any woman would speak
to Gwan-hee the way Hye-seon did.

125
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,914
I don't think anyone would open up to him

126
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,375
and tell him
that he's the only one for her.

127
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,961
-I do think Hye-seon likes him, though.
-I see.

128
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,171
I don't know. Maybe I don't like Gwan-hee.

129
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,298
-Here's what I noticed, Da-hee.
-Yes?

130
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,136
Ever since last week,
you've stopped rooting for Gwan-hee.

131
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,595
-She's upset.
-She gets angry

132
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,347
-whenever Gwan-hee appears.
-No.

133
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,349
I wouldn't say I'm angry.

134
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,310
Here's what I thought
as I listened to their conversation.

135
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:20,481
She expressed how she felt about him
as well as her curiosity for other men.

136
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,693
So I think she wants
to check the other guys out

137
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,237
before solidifying her feelings for him.

138
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,574
The fact that they were
so open about everything

139
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,702
shows that they're both sincere
about how they feel

140
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,955
and willing to take things
to the next level if things work out.

141
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,541
So it sounded like
they were both asking each other

142
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,543
-to understand the situation.
-I see.

143
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,172
PARADISE
CHO MIN-JI & CHOI MIN-WOO & LEE JIN-SEOK

144
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,384
This place is huge.

145
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,690
Let's go in.

146
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,691
-Hi.
-Hello.

147
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,609
-Hey.
-Hi.

148
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,944
Hello.

149
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,242
Are the three of them sharing one room?

150
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,495
-That must feel weird.
-It's weird.

151
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,830
-They came in wearing bathrobes.
-They did.

152
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,666
Go and wash up first.

153
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,584
Okay.

154
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,422
He said to wash up.

155
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,258
He's like the third wheel
on his friends' honeymoon.

156
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,846
Let's order some food.
We should eat something.

157
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,933
She likes tteokbokki with rose sauce.

158
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,935
Tteokbokki? She likes spicy food.

159
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,895
Seafood tteokbokki?

160
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,315
-That'll be for Min-ji.
-She'll like that.

161
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,150
Let's get that for her.

162
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,194
What else for Min-ji?

163
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:53,699
Let's get chocolate ice cream
and sorbet for Min-ji.

164
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,119
And let's get orange juice.

165
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,539
It's as if he's Min-ji's dad.

166
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,250
It's like a battle to see
who knows Min-ji better.

167
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,544
-Information showdown.
-Right.

168
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,504
We ordered this for you.

169
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,508
-I'm glad we met.
-Likewise. Cheers.

170
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,386
Jin-seok and Min-woo.

171
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,638
Paradise is amazing.

172
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,556
It is.

173
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,559
We can order any food we want.
It's the best.

174
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,437
I want some too.

175
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,814
-Want some?
-Yes.

176
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,983
Seeing you enjoy them makes me want some.

177
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,820
-It's kabocha squash.
-Kabocha squash?

178
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,658
How late did you stay up
last time you were in Paradise?

179
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,867
Until around 3:30 a.m.

180
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,869
But it was just the two of you, right?

181
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,871
Yes, we just talked a lot.

182
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,373
What did you talk about?

183
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,292
-Are you curious?
-What?

184
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,503
-Min-ji's body is leaning toward Jin-seok.
-Right.

185
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,047
-Totally.
-She's totally leaning toward him.

186
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,843
This place might feel like
another Inferno to Min-woo.

187
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,844
I know.

188
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,762
Min-ji sure is an honest person.

189
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,973
What did you talk about?

190
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,100
-Are you curious?
-What?

191
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,644
-Are you curious?
-Yes.

192
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,564
We just talked about our values and stuff.

193
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,357
I mean, it was our first day.

194
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,651
Did you even remember each other's names?

195
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,111
No, we didn't.

196
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,031
Did you go with your ideal type?

197
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,198
-Me?
-Yes.

198
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,450
Was it someone pretty?

199
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,785
She was…

200
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,538
Well, she was all right.

201
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,047
But there wasn't enough time for me
to figure out how I felt about her.

202
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:36,052
We ended up going together
before I could even think about

203
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,346
whether or not I was interested in her.

204
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:51,108
Min-woo barely got a few words in.

205
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,944
But Si-eun is waiting for Min-woo.

206
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,488
-He has Si-eun.
-Right.

207
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,699
-Maybe he's reserved since he has Si-eun.
-Exactly.

208
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,416
INFERNO

209
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,627
-Do you think I'm pretty?
-Of course, you are.

210
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,212
Didn't you know?

211
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,799
Then, I'll meet them with confidence.

212
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,176
Yes, be confident.

213
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,012
I'm so excited!

214
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,597
Here they come.

215
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,765
-They're coming.
-Where?

216
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,684
Where are they?

217
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,560
After you, Princess.

218
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,480
I'm so nervous.

219
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,023
-Here they come.
-This is crazy.

220
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,525
-Who is it?
-They're coming.

221
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,443
-Here they are!
-Here they come!

222
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,903
No way.

223
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,030
-Gosh.
-They're back.

224
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,575
Oh, my goodness.

225
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,120
Hello.

226
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,375
Welcome back.

227
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,295
She doesn't look so happy.

228
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,006
You can't hide a face like that.

229
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,551
Jin-seok, I missed you.

230
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,885
-Hi.
-Hey.

231
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,388
-Hello.
-Hello.

232
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,266
What I first thought
when I saw the new girl

233
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,852
was that she seemed quite cute.

234
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,980
She seems like the type
who laughs a lot and is cute.

235
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,232
Jin-seok was walking right by her side.

236
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,860
I couldn't wait to give him an earful.

237
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,905
Jin-seok, I missed you.

238
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,073
-Hi.
-Hey.

239
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,409
Guys, how have you been?

240
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,494
Min-woo, you're glowing.

241
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,079
I guess you had a nice bath.

242
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,790
-Was it fun?
-Did you enjoy it?

243
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,213
How did it feel
to go to Paradise for the first time?

244
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,465
-It was nice.
-Was it?

245
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,466
It was really nice.

246
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,843
-Your face says it all.
-It was so relaxing.

247
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,638
-They've both brightened up a lot.
-Totally.

248
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,307
They look relaxed and happy.

249
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,602
Well, obviously. We got to go to Paradise.

250
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,645
-How was the chopper?
-What?

251
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,688
Did you have fun?

252
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,273
Did you have fun?

253
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,733
-I did.
-I see.

254
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,699
You should introduce yourself.

255
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,869
Hello, my name is Cho Min-ji.

256
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,954
-Nice to meet you all.
-Nice to meet you.

257
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,540
Why don't we go around the table?

258
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,587
I think a couple of guys
might change their minds.

259
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,671
Maybe Gwan-hee.

260
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,466
And Ha-bin.

261
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,136
I think Jin-seok won't change
as long as I don't mess up.

262
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,723
She's oblivious.

263
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,684
Don't you agree?

264
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,396
Was I too straightforward?

265
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,819
This is…

266
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,030
-It's so fun.
-What is?

267
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,658
What is?

268
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,576
I'm not going to tell you.

269
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,661
Come on.

270
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,497
Doesn't Min-woo seem brighter?

271
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,332
-He does.
-Yes, he must be happy.

272
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,416
He's adorable.

273
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,918
Who is that?

274
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,044
-Ha-jeong.
-Ha-jeong?

275
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,963
-It's Ha-jeong.
-What is she doing?

276
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,714
She has her legs propped up.

277
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,341
-Is she sitting on the wall?
-Yes.

278
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,010
If we rotated the screen,
she'd be sitting down.

279
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:05,928
Right.

280
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,471
She's so adorable.

281
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,932
Doesn't Min-woo seem brighter?

282
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,725
-He does.
-Yes, he must be happy.

283
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,768
He's adorable.

284
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,436
-He's cute.
-He's like a puppy.

285
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,771
-Yes, he's cute.
-Right.

286
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,108
Min-woo, your skin is glowing.

287
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,067
-Me?
-Yes.

288
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,195
We could really feel
Jin-seok's absence yesterday.

289
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,281
Someone made a great analogy yesterday.

290
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,034
They said Min-ji took
a wolf and a puppy with her.

291
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,954
-I guess he's the wolf.
-Yes, he's the wolf.

292
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,832
-And the puppy…
-I wouldn't say he's a wolf.

293
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,710
-The wolf took care of her.
-He's more like a raging bull.

294
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,129
Isn't he more like a wild boar?

295
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,505
Come on, man.

296
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,674
At least name something cool-looking.

297
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,760
Why did Min-ji choose you two?

298
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,015
He was picked because of his looks,
and I was picked because I was funny.

299
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,518
You made her laugh in that brief moment?

300
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,937
-I'm sure she has a great personality.
-She does.

301
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,439
-Yes, she's great.
-I figured.

302
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,817
I get why they picked her
as the game changer.

303
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,028
-She's that great?
-Yes, she's a decent girl.

304
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,739
-She's different.
-Based on your conversation with her?

305
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,699
-Really?
-She's quite refreshing.

306
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,160
I think it'd be good
to try and talk to her.

307
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,661
Oh, really?

308
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,080
Although we didn't have much time,

309
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,625
she tried to keep the conversation going.

310
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,460
She did?

311
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,794
-Yes.
-I see.

312
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,797
-So that's what you found refreshing.
-Yes.

313
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,842
-He seems so uncertain now.
-Gwan-hee…

314
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,093
Gwan-hee is so curious.

315
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,720
-He's listening carefully.
-Yes.

316
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,432
But Min-young seemed a bit…

317
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,684
She didn't seem too happy.

318
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,021
He still checked on her after he returned.

319
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,230
Yes, I guess so.

320
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,815
He still cares about her.

321
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,817
Of course.

322
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,404
You're so busy.

323
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,531
Yesterday, Min-young told me

324
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,910
-that she missed you.
-Really?

325
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,663
-So it was confusing to me.
-That's nice to hear.

326
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,915
But she gave out four candies.

327
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,877
-Am I holding a grudge?
-It seems like it.

328
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,005
Four candies.

329
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,675
I'm done playing it cool.

330
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,970
You need to talk to Min-young about that.

331
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,431
Jin-seok has an adorable side to him.

332
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,683
That was bothering him.

333
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,850
-Of course.
-Really?

334
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,227
-Sure.
-I really think

335
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,771
Min-young should try harder from now on.

336
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,190
-Otherwise, it's not going to work out.
-Right.

337
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:27,236
Min-ji's arrival has
really stirred up the guys.

338
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,696
-You're right.
-I agree.

339
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,781
I could tell Gwan-hee was contemplating.

340
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:35,077
You could hear the gears
turning inside his head.

341
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,329
I'm sure he'll go and talk to her.

342
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,707
I think most of the guys would as well.

343
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,208
-Right.
-Yes.

344
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,382
Today, the women will play a game
to win a date in Paradise.

345
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,425
I knew it.

346
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,510
-I'm so bad at games.
-I saw this coming.

347
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,512
I don't want to play.

348
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,598
I'm scared because I know
things are going to get heated.

349
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,851
-No way.
-Seriously?

350
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,060
The prize is Paradise.

351
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,979
It's not a meal? It's Paradise?

352
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,493
-What are those boxes for?
-What?

353
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,037
Are those belts?

354
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,665
-Here come the contestants.
-The contestants?

355
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,591
They look different in workout clothes.

356
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,134
I wonder how this will go.

357
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,305
Is it Korean wrestling?

358
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,222
I'm not sure.

359
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,600
Min-ji might actually win.

360
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,852
Yes, I can tell that she works out.

361
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,321
Today, the women
will be competing in a game

362
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,073
for a date in Paradise.

363
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,787
The top three contestants,
in order of rank,

364
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,750
will get to choose the men
they'd like to take on dates in Paradise.

365
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,504
Today's game will now be revealed.

366
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,756
Please open the black boxes.

367
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,970
-What's this?
-What are these?

368
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,597
-Is it jegichagi?
-What?

369
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,723
What is that?

370
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,433
-What are these? Caps?
-Caps?

371
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,604
-What's this?
-It's a tail.

372
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,732
-What?
-It's Catch the Tail.

373
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,609
-Catch the Tail.
-How will we do this?

374
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,113
Here are the rules of today's game.

375
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,992
The women must each wear a cap,
fasten a tail around their waists,

376
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,286
and then enter the ring in pairs.

377
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,747
At the sound of the signal,

378
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:49,378
whoever is the first to snatch
her opponent's cap and tail wins.

379
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,133
-We have to hold on to these.
-Oh, no.

380
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,261
If you witness this in person,

381
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,263
-you become really nervous.
-Really?

382
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,764
He's seen the ladies wrestle.

383
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,057
Yes, it's hard to watch.

384
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,184
I'd rather do it myself. You know?

385
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,395
This might get rough.

386
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,563
I know, right?

387
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,897
They'll become competitive.

388
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,399
Min-young might do well.

389
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,026
I hope I don't go against you.

390
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,945
-Me? Why?
-I'm actually scared.

391
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,864
If I'm being honest,

392
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,950
the other girls didn't seem that strong.

393
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,620
They looked so delicate and fragile.

394
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,541
So I figured I'd win, but who knows?

395
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,752
Each person will draw a ball
to choose their opponent.

396
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,088
Are they all avoiding Min-young?

397
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,548
You don't want to face her.

398
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,094
Beginning with Cho Min-ji,
please draw a ball.

399
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,144
I got yellow.

400
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,604
Okay.

401
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,773
-Blue.
-She got blue.

402
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:54,943
Red.

403
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,322
They all got different colors.

404
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,537
RED BALL
AN MIN-YOUNG VS. YU SI-EUN

405
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,289
I feel bad for Si-eun.

406
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,501
This is fate.

407
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,128
Let's take it easy.

408
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,880
Hang on.

409
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,549
My heart is about to burst.

410
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,719
I'm so scared.

411
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,055
What if I get Hye-seon?

412
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,312
BLUE BALL
YUN HA-JEONG VS. CHOI HYE-SEON

413
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,522
-Oh, gosh.
-Yes!

414
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,441
They'll be fighting for Gwan-hee.

415
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,654
-I'm not sure.
-I don't know either.

416
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:44,076
YELLOW BALL
KIM GYU-RI VS. CHO MIN-JI

417
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,786
Try not to hurt yourself.

418
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,537
We'll begin the first match.

419
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,792
Yu Si-eun and An Min-young,
please enter the ring.

420
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,418
You got this.

421
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,336
Let's go.

422
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,921
Good luck. Be careful.

423
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,590
This will be a one-sided match.

424
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,553
You got this.

425
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,271
Please begin when you hear the signal.

426
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,230
Ready.

427
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,822
Go!

428
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,700
-What?
-There they go.

429
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,286
Oh, gosh.

430
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,288
Nice.

431
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,248
She's so strong!

432
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,666
Oh, my gosh!

433
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,420
-I can't watch.
-Oh, no.

434
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,879
She's so strong!

435
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,594
She's so strong!

436
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,768
-She snatched it.
-See? You never know.

437
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,020
Oh, my gosh.

438
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,861
No.

439
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,823
You're super strong! What is this?

440
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,408
You said you were bad at this!

441
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,037
My finger.

442
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,790
-She looks so determined.
-Look at her.

443
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,500
She's circling for the tail.

444
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,169
Good. Aim for the right moment.

445
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,796
-She's become so serious.
-Yes.

446
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,049
Si-eun, you're so cool!

447
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,051
Look how serious Si-eun is.

448
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,261
Yes. They're getting pumped up.

449
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,346
Let's go.

450
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,514
This is scary.

451
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,061
I love that feisty look.

452
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,063
Keep it up, Si-eun.

453
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,690
-She's so strong.
-Min-young.

454
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,233
-You can do this.
-You got this.

455
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,070
Tighten your core.

456
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,363
"Tighten your core."

457
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,408
There you go!

458
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,535
That's it. You got this.

459
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,537
-They're going for it.
-You got this.

460
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,710
-They're going for it.
-You got this.

461
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,474
That was insane!

462
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,850
She let her take the cap.

463
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,395
And got the tail first.

464
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,105
She won by a split second.

465
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,981
Yu Si-eun wins.

466
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:21,858
No way.

467
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,152
This is fun.

468
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,822
-Yu Si-eun wins.
-Unbelievable.

469
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,031
Good job, guys.

470
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,658
That was insane.

471
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,785
-The first match was huge.
-It was close.

472
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,078
She was so close.

473
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,913
-Another big match.
-The second match.

474
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,834
Cho Min-ji and Kim Gyu-ri,
please enter the ring.

475
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,252
-Let's go.
-You got this.

476
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,586
You can do it.

477
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,428
-I'm looking forward to this match too.
-I know.

478
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,221
Good luck.

479
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,139
Don't get hurt.

480
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,808
Please begin when you hear the signal.

481
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,767
Ready.

482
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,688
She didn't look that strong,

483
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,023
so I thought I'd win and go to Paradise.

484
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,779
-We're going last.
-I know. It's making me more nervous.

485
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,117
-Let's go.
-You got this.

486
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,995
You're so frail.

487
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,413
I'm so sorry.

488
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,790
"Frail"? "Sorry"?

489
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,294
Sorry.

490
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,013
Oh, no.

491
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,476
Oh, no.

492
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,188
She's so strong!

493
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,106
Don't let your guard down!

494
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,404
That caught Min-ji off guard.

495
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,781
-I know.
-I can't believe Gyu-ri is smiling.

496
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,867
Don't let your guard down!

497
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,581
Oh, my gosh.

498
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,459
Please go easy on me!

499
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,462
"Go easy on me."

500
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,716
Gyu-ri's got some spunk.

501
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,553
-Look at that smile on her face.
-Her face…

502
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,892
That leg sweep.

503
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,936
-That leg sweep.
-This is like wrestling.

504
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,731
What was that?

505
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,982
This is like wrestling.

506
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,199
She was hurled to the ground.

507
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,825
But Gyu-ri didn't even frown.

508
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,577
-She kept smiling.
-While smiling…

509
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,497
She beat her with a smile.

510
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,333
Kim Gyu-ri wins.

511
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,377
That was unbelievable.

512
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,337
-She's so strong.
-She's incredible.

513
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,673
I mean…

514
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,262
I was so shocked
when my cap was thrown off my head.

515
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,223
I was so embarrassed
about what I had said earlier.

516
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,936
That was cool.

517
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,021
-So awesome.
-That was so cool.

518
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,024
She could come out on top.

519
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,993
Gosh, my heart is racing.

520
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,244
Ha-jeong.

521
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,454
Don't be nervous. Just do your best.

522
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,957
-You'll be fine. Be careful.
-Just be careful.

523
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,003
Choi Hye-seon and Yun Ha-jeong,

524
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,171
-please enter the ring.
-Don't hurt each other.

525
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,840
It's not over until it's over.

526
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,759
Make it painless.

527
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,723
Show us what you've got. You can do this.

528
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,518
Please begin when you hear the signal.

529
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,778
Ready.

530
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,497
-What do I do?
-She's so nervous.

531
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,500
Look how she's moving.

532
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,212
-What do I do?
-Get close.

533
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,758
She's careful.

534
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,343
It's like Hye-seon is hunting.

535
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,886
Oh, the head…

536
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,180
-Right for the tail!
-What? Right away?

537
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,432
Oh, the head…

538
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,519
What is this?

539
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,604
Oh, the head…

540
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,690
-You can do this!
-Oh, the head…

541
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,859
-What is this?
-The cap…

542
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,320
Let's go, guys.

543
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,949
This is so scary.

544
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,118
She's mad. Ha-jeong is mad!

545
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,204
Let's go, guys.

546
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,749
Ha-jeong is mad.

547
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,627
She lost it along with her tail.

548
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,723
She's really angry.

549
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,809
-Gosh, they're so cute.
-This is it!

550
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,936
-That's it!
-That's Ha-jeong.

551
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,111
Ha-jeong, careful!

552
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,489
Her foot.

553
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,700
-She kicked her.
-She kicked her.

554
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,494
Ha-jeong, careful!

555
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,210
Ha-jeong, careful!

556
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,388
She's so adorable!

557
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,768
Choi Hye-seon wins.

558
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,312
Are you okay?

559
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,689
That was so funny.

560
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,815
Hold on.

561
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,110
Ha-jeong.

562
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,864
Ha-jeong, you can't
just kick her like that.

563
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,781
Hey.

564
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,411
-This isn't the UFC!
-You said you'd lose gracefully.

565
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,538
-What did I do?
-You went full UFC mode.

566
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,539
What was that?

567
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,042
She thinks it's funny too.

568
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,169
She's so charming.

569
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,879
-I love Ha-jeong.
-Me too.

570
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,256
-She's really something.
-She's adorable.

571
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,966
That was hilarious.

572
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,635
Hey, you're the best.

573
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,221
I don't remember a thing.

574
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,225
The final match
will be a three-person game.

575
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,190
Yu Si-eun, Kim Gyu-ri, and Choi Hye-seon,

576
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,734
please enter the ring.

577
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,360
Don't get hurt. Let's go, guys.

578
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,445
Let's do this.

579
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,699
-They're all pretty strong.
-Yes.

580
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,075
And they're eager to win.

581
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:54,709
This Paradise-bound ticket
won't require us to become a match.

582
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,796
I can just take whoever I want.

583
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,508
So I wanted to pick someone who was
least likely to become a match with me.

584
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,385
I'm most curious about Min-woo,
so he's my first choice.

585
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,435
I'll be choosing Min-woo
with my ticket to Paradise.

586
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,436
YU SI-EUN

587
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,190
I have a feeling that Gyu-ri
will also pick Min-woo this time.

588
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,236
So I thought I should at least beat her.

589
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,279
This time…

590
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:30,286
I was thinking of going
with either Min-woo or Min-kyu.

591
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,455
They're all going for the same guy.

592
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,165
All three of them want Min-woo.

593
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,753
I didn't want to lose him to anyone else,
so I tried to do my best.

594
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,090
Let's go.

595
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,556
They're reading their opponents.

596
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,601
Those girls are scary.

597
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,523
They're sizing each other up.

598
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,693
They're starting to move.

599
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,452
Why are you looking at me?

600
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,498
Gyu-ri is really strong.

601
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,458
Si-eun has a feisty look on her face.

602
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,627
They exchanged glances.

603
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,312
They're ganging up.

604
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,358
They're ganging up on her.

605
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,285
That was fast.

606
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,786
Hye-seon was quick.

607
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,629
Si-eun is mad.

608
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,130
She's so angry.

609
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,256
Nice.

610
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,969
Careful.

611
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,434
-What?
-Oh, no!

612
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,274
Oh, no.

613
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,401
-It didn't come off.
-Yu Si-eun, out.

614
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,236
3RD PLACE: YU SI-EUN

615
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,155
Oh, no. Si-eun.

616
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,574
You did great.

617
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,370
They're both strong.

618
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,622
You did great.

619
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,379
She beats everyone with a smile.

620
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,929
Wait.

621
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,935
Hang on!

622
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,852
Wait!

623
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,022
Hang on!

624
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,066
Wait!

625
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,904
-Wait, what?
-Wait!

626
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,406
She's really strong.

627
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,326
-Hang on!
-She's really strong.

628
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,246
No! Wait!

629
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,541
No! Wait!

630
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:29,590
Gyu-ri won.

631
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,093
What did I just see?

632
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,636
Wait!

633
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,648
-What?
-Unbelievable.

634
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,280
This is hilarious!

635
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,282
Choi Hye-seon is out.

636
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,367
1ST PLACE KIM GYU-RI,
2ND PLACE: CHOI HYE-SEON

637
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,077
I got goosebumps again.

638
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,955
Come here. Hey.
There's something in your hair.

639
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,498
Your hair.

640
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,835
-Gwan-hee's so sweet.
-Gwan-hee.

641
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,212
-That was intense.
-Hye-seon.

642
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,213
Are you all right?

643
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,549
That was fun.

644
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,011
-Are you all right?
-That was so cool.

645
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,013
She's no joke.

646
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,182
-Gyu-ri is super strong.
-That was cool.

647
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,227
She turned out to be tough.

648
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,520
We thought she was weak.

649
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,440
I thought Gyu-ri would be a bit reserved,

650
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,525
but she just threw people down.

651
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,320
I didn't think she'd be aggressive.

652
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,405
-She usually keeps her composure.
-Right.

653
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:38,284
I didn't think she'd want people
to see her in a mess.

654
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,036
But that didn't even happen.

655
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,370
And she won first place.

656
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,414
-She won with a smile on her face.
-Right.

657
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,500
Do I look okay?

658
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,710
-Yes.
-I do?

659
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,054
Did you have fun?

660
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,515
What's going on?

661
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,434
Seriously.

662
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,645
That was a direct punch.

663
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,522
It was a cute approach.

664
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,692
-Did you have fun?
-Ask her why she gave away four candies.

665
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,819
I'll seek them out.

666
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,739
That was scary.

667
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,826
-Where should we go?
-So did you have fun?

668
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,417
The three of us just joked around.

669
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,086
-I see.
-Yes.

670
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,635
-What?
-You're scaring me.

671
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,513
-Why?
-I feel like I'm being interrogated.

672
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,306
-I'll stop talking about it.
-Okay.

673
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,435
I didn't spend time with her like we did.

674
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,937
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

675
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,480
Really?

676
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,274
-What did you guys do, then?
-What?

677
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,692
What did you guys do?

678
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,111
We just walked around in the pool.

679
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,155
We did that too.

680
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,657
Well, with you…

681
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,618
I carried you on my back like a baby.

682
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,538
-Are you my dad or what?
-You could say that.

683
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,583
I expected you to go, though.

684
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,209
-Really?
-Yes.

685
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,628
-What made you think so?
-She came in the middle,

686
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:16,174
so I figured she'd choose a guy
who's approachable and manly.

687
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:20,636
She didn't choose me because I was manly.
It was because I made her laugh.

688
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,014
She said she found me funny.

689
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:27,894
What?

690
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,563
I guess you joke around
and get along with everyone.

691
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,148
You're the only one I have fun with.

692
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,567
You should try to get along with everyone.

693
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,818
I do now.

694
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,571
-I'm just being grumpy about it.
-I won't be upset

695
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,489
even if you go to Paradise.

696
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,537
-The dynamics have changed.
-You're right.

697
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,497
-Still, it's cute.
-Why not bring it up?

698
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,627
Honestly, a girl who gave out
four candies doesn't get a say.

699
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,547
Hye-seon gave me
two different scenarios to think about.

700
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,008
But I really didn't like the first one.

701
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,426
What was it? Tell me.

702
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,554
-You go to Paradise
-Yes?

703
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,599
-and have a change of heart there.
-Okay.

704
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,393
So you are torn.
But in the end, you choose me.

705
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,771
So I said I won't choose you
if that happens.

706
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,106
What's the second one?

707
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,069
Your feelings stay the same.
But I'm not okay with the first one.

708
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,240
Is it the first one?

709
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,117
That's a secret.

710
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,703
-I'm leaving.
-Okay.

711
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,622
-Be honest. Is it the first one?
-Okay.

712
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,086
How could it be? I just met her.

713
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,630
And if you spend more time with her?

714
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,924
You're good at this, aren't you?

715
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,510
-What?
-You're asking leading questions.

716
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,886
Give me a clear answer.

717
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,265
But that would be no fun.

718
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,184
That's how it is now?

719
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,936
You gave out four candies.

720
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,188
-I'm off.
-Okay.

721
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,690
-Let it go.
-I need to row.

722
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,234
-This is the ocean.
-I'm going to hit you with this.

723
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,986
You can't get off right now.

724
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,572
I'm glad you had fun.

725
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,326
I want to go to the pool with you.

726
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,661
-The pool?
-Yes.

727
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,046
-Jin-seok's feelings seem to have changed.
-Right.

728
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,548
-It shows on his face.
-Yes.

729
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,843
She should've treated him better
while she had the chance.

730
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:29,390
It's a bit of a shame to see
how Min-young talks to him.

731
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,101
-She always asks leading questions.
-Right.

732
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,770
-She's doing that right now.
-For sure.

733
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,982
The person being questioned
could become really exhausted by it.

734
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,817
-You're right.
-She shouldn't do that.

735
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,403
Jin-seok used to put her at ease

736
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,031
-Right.
-by telling her he was still into her.

737
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,450
-He's not one to say it's a secret.
-Right.

738
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,453
I think she brought this upon herself.

739
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,121
-You're right.
-I agree.

740
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:54,874
Who's out there?

741
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:55,958
All the guys.

742
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,168
Should we go outside?

743
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,503
-Should we? Let's go.
-Okay.

744
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,007
Hello.

745
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,592
Hello.

746
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,427
-What are you up to?
-Hello!

747
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,096
Why are you dressed up?
You're not going to Paradise.

748
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,600
I know. I can't believe
the three of them are going to Paradise.

749
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,477
You did better than I expected.

750
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,479
-I did?
-She was just too strong for you.

751
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,438
She was.

752
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,203
-What's this?
-What was that?

753
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,038
Si-eun tilted her head like this.

754
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,916
This reminds me of Before Sunrise.
It feels different.

755
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,934
Should we talk?

756
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,852
Sure.

757
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,566
We didn't really get to talk properly.

758
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,776
-Right?
-Yes.

759
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,237
Min-woo mustered up his courage.

760
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,321
I'm excited.

761
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,948
-Romance is in the air.
-Right.

762
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,700
-This is comfortable.
-Really?

763
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,663
-Do you want this?
-Me? Sure.

764
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,914
It matches your shirt.

765
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,832
-This?
-Yes.

766
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,791
You're right.

767
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,211
-How was dinner yesterday?
-I was bored without you.

768
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,379
-Really?
-Yes.

769
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,299
-We only got to talk once before.
-Right.

770
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,762
I felt like we were both so shy

771
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,014
-that we didn't get to talk much.
-I know.

772
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,934
But I was thankful
because you kept making an effort.

773
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,437
-I've wanted to talk to you too.
-Really?

774
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,188
-Yes.
-Thanks.

775
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,316
But you approached me first
and asked if we could chat.

776
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,737
You seem a lot less shy now, though.

777
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,574
-I feel a little more at ease.
-I can see that.

778
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,118
-Anyway, we're both--
-You have lipstick here.

779
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,327
Really?

780
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,331
-Is it gone?
-Hold on.

781
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,211
Did you get it?

782
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,844
There.

783
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,430
-Did my makeup come off?
-Slightly…

784
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,431
-Slightly?
-Yes, a bit.

785
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,765
-It did?
-Dab it.

786
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,019
-Is that good?
-Yes, it's good.

787
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,530
-What's going on?
-That was nice.

788
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,240
-What?
-What's with this mood?

789
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,576
-They look good together.
-They really do.

790
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,120
I don't think anything was on her face.

791
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,122
I think so too.

792
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,999
Your outfit looks great.

793
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,001
Right? Since I'm going to Paradise.

794
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,630
I was a little sad.
I wanted to win first place.

795
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,715
-Did you?
-Yes.

796
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,633
Really?

797
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,052
There's someone I want to go with.

798
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:53,969
Really?

799
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,184
She's practically saying, "It's you!"

800
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,479
There's someone I want to go with.

801
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,487
Really? Have you already decided on that?

802
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,404
Yes.

803
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:17,993
I want someone that I can really talk to.
We need to be able to connect.

804
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,119
-You know?
-You told me.

805
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,498
Right, and the person
I feel comfortable talking to here…

806
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,334
I can't say it's you… I mean, it's you.

807
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,504
You can't say it's me, but it's me?

808
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,631
No, I mean it. Anyway…

809
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:36,929
So I want to go to Paradise with you,
but I can't if someone picks you first.

810
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,639
-Really?
-Yes.

811
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,560
I think it'd be a great opportunity
to have a deep conversation with you.

812
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,144
-That's what I thought.
-Right.

813
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,854
That's why I wanted to go with you.

814
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,357
But I only came in third place.

815
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,444
I came in third place.
I'm really upset about that.

816
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,904
-You are?
-Yes, I really am.

817
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,490
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

818
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,658
No, you did so well.

819
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,076
-Did I?
-You did really well.

820
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,251
I wonder how things will play out today.

821
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,836
-I know.
-Right?

822
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,504
What if someone else picks you?

823
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,714
-Someone else?
-Yes.

824
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,759
I guess it depends on who it is.

825
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,346
It'd be nice if it's someone
I want to get to know better.

826
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,056
Aren't you curious about them?

827
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:25,311
Who are the winners again? Hye-seon and…

828
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,354
-Gyu-ri.
-Gyu-ri.

829
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,234
I asked if we could chat
because I wanted to talk to you the most.

830
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,698
If I end up staying here or…

831
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,033
What if you end up going?

832
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,367
-If I end up going?
-Yes.

833
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,827
Just don't forget about me.

834
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,870
Okay.

835
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,206
Okay. I won't.

836
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,502
But…

837
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,756
That bird has a lot to say.

838
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,382
-We're talking here.
-Seriously?

839
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:01,472
Maybe it wanted to interrupt us.
I feel like that sound was a bad omen.

840
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,806
It feels like a message.

841
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,600
Come on. We don't know that.

842
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,143
-Really? Do you think so?
-Yes.

843
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,021
Wish hard, and it'll come true.

844
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,189
-That's right.
-Yes.

845
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,651
I hope you wish hard for this.

846
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,277
Got it.

847
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:17,988
Pray.

848
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,990
-I will.
-Pray for me.

849
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,451
How hard will you pray?

850
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,577
I'll pray hard.

851
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,540
-What's this?
-I'm rooting for Si-eun.

852
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,334
They're in Paradise right now.

853
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,837
-I love how honest they are.
-I know. Me too.

854
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,466
-Isn't this what we wanted to see?
-Absolutely.

855
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,427
Min-woo is starting to show us
how charming he really is.

856
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,346
It's because he's with Si-eun.

857
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,390
He thinks she's adorable.

858
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,266
He's younger than her, though.

859
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,895
I wonder how things will play out.

860
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,315
Min-woo is three years younger than her.

861
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,484
Come.

862
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,738
Have you decided?

863
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:00,781
-Me?
-Yes.

864
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,699
I think so.

865
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,825
Who is it?

866
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,120
It's a secret. Why?
Who are you leaning towards?

867
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,956
-I want to go with Min-woo.
-Min-woo?

868
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,501
-The same guy.
-Same guy.

869
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:17,089
I don't think Si-eun knows that
Hye-seon also has her eyes on Min-woo.

870
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,674
-I don't think she knows.
-Right?

871
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,260
I haven't said this before,

872
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,637
but I'm glad I got to talk to him today.

873
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,722
Really?

874
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,557
What made you so sure about him?

875
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,600
-We both…
-Really?

876
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:33,939
I never felt this way with the others,
but my heart fluttered because of Min-woo.

877
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,691
Really? Oh, my god.

878
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,776
I have to get to know him better though.

879
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,613
We only had a brief conversation earlier.

880
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:45,743
We just talked about
how we felt about each other.

881
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:50,664
So if I go to Paradise with him,
I think it'll make things clear for me.

882
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,166
That's what I would like.

883
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:59,882
-Now that Hye-seon knows how she feels…
-Hye-seon seems taken aback.

884
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,551
What if she still picks Min-woo?

885
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,678
-No, she wouldn't do that.
-No way.

886
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,723
-If she does…
-That would make things very awkward.

887
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,850
I mean, she even said, "Oh, my god."

888
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,519
-She wouldn't do that.
-You know what would be best?

889
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,773
As you know, Gyu-ri wanted
to go with Min-kyu or Min-woo.

890
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,649
-Right.
-So if she goes with Min-kyu,

891
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,068
and since Hye-seon knows how Si-eun feels…

892
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:24,448
-She should step aside?
-She's not head over heels for Min-woo.

893
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,452
She just wants a change,
so if she steps aside, they could both…

894
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:34,875
If Hye-seon hadn't heard what she said,
I think she would've picked Min-woo.

895
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,961
But now that she knows,
I think she'll change her mind.

896
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,922
-It wouldn't feel right for her.
-Right.

897
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,758
I'm rooting for Min-woo and Si-eun.

898
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,219
-I hope they go to Paradise together.
-Yes.

899
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,808
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

900
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,518
MATCHING THE COUPLES TO GO TO PARADISE

901
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,196
Starting with Kim Gyu-ri,
who came in first,

902
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:08,742
please select the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

903
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,496
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

904
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,750
-Don't be so nervous.
-But I am nervous.

905
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,502
Have fun, Min-kyu.

906
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,628
Bye.

907
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,092
What if she picks Min-woo?

908
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,927
What if Gyu-ri snatches Min-woo up?

909
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,098
I know. Everything we talked about
would have been for nothing.

910
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,184
No, she even held hands with Min-kyu.

911
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,070
Kim Gyu-ri has selected…

912
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,033
Choi Min-woo.

913
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,370
See? What did I tell you?

914
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,831
Oh, no.

915
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,958
Choi Min-woo.

916
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,879
Choi Min-woo.

917
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,171
It's Min-woo.

918
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,925
Choi Min-woo, please hold
Kim Gyu-ri's hand and leave for Paradise.

919
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,385
Choi Min-woo.

920
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:13,599
Choi Min-woo, please hold
Kim Gyu-ri's hand and leave for Paradise.

921
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,100
What is going on?

922
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,607
Min-woo's become so popular now.

923
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,400
-I know.
-He's cute.

924
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,625
I was so surprised.

925
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,836
Do we leave now?

926
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,591
I didn't expect this.

927
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,301
-You didn't?
-No.

928
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,762
-Really?
-I wasn't expecting this at all.

929
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,642
Si-eun looks so…

930
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,477
-You can tell.
-She has to watch

931
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,605
the man she likes walk away
hand in hand with another woman.

932
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:05,150
-It's not something that happens often.
-Right.

933
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,861
It's unfortunate that Si-eun
has to witness that today.

934
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,447
In her defense,
Gyu-ri did pick Min-woo on the first day.

935
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,365
Did she?

936
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,952
-They were left in Inferno together.
-Yes, they do have a history.

937
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,956
Is this really happening right now? I…

938
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,792
You didn't expect it?
I picked you on the first day.

939
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,961
I was just surprised.

940
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,714
We've never really gotten to talk
since the merge.

941
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,508
-I know.
-That's why.

942
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,220
Anyway, let's have fun today.

943
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,390
I knew she'd choose Min-woo.

944
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,726
-You went with her once.
-You're right, I did.

945
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,727
That's true.

946
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,939
No matter what,
I'm going with Gyu-ri before this ends.

947
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,403
Next is Choi Hye-seon, who came in second.

948
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,700
I think Hye-seon will go with Gwan-hee.

949
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,285
She told Gwan-hee
she'd pick someone else, though.

950
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,830
-I don't know who else she'd pick.
-There's no one.

951
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,332
I'm curious as to who Hye-seon will pick.

952
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,543
-She's hard to read.
-She hasn't decided yet.

953
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,587
Next is Choi Hye-seon, who came in second.

954
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,132
Choi Hye-seon, please select the person

955
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,844
-you'd like to go to Paradise with.
-I wonder who she'll pick.

956
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,228
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

957
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,318
Son Won-ik.

958
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,071
Son Won-ik.

959
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,406
-Oh, right.
-Son Won-ik,

960
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:38,035
please hold Choi Hye-seon's hand
and leave for Paradise.

961
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,079
Gwan-hee looks disappointed.

962
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,040
He knew this was coming.

963
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,751
-He seems let down.
-He rubbed his face three times.

964
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,086
Twice vertically and once horizontally.

965
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,464
-Son Won-ik.
-Have fun.

966
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,465
Son Won-ik,

967
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,051
-please hold Choi Hye-seon's hand
-This is crazy.

968
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,302
and leave for Paradise.

969
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:05,937
Won-ik is one of the guys
I want to get to know better.

970
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:10,525
But I just didn't see ourselves
picking each other,

971
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,279
so I chose to go with him
while I had the chance.

972
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,091
-Let's eat a lot of good food.
-That sounds good.

973
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,428
-I already feel so comfortable.
-Good.

974
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,849
Who should Si-eun go with now?

975
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,228
I wonder who Si-eun will pick
since Won-ik is unavailable.

976
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,145
Gwan-hee?

977
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,273
I have no idea.

978
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,984
Gwan-hee is probably the next best choice.

979
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,487
Why does Ha-jeong think it'll be Gwan-hee?

980
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,114
It's who she'd pick.

981
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:01,493
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

982
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,496
Park Min-kyu.

983
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,291
Park Min-kyu.

984
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,876
Park Min-kyu.

985
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,378
Park Min-kyu,

986
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:15,006
please hold Yu Si-eun's hand
and leave for Paradise.

987
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,341
She picked me?

988
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,805
-They called my name, right?
-Park Min-kyu.

989
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,271
Hi.

990
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,191
-Shall we?
-Are you ready?

991
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,110
Yes, let's go to Paradise.

992
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,195
-Be careful.
-Okay.

993
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,031
I did want to get to know you better.

994
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,658
-I know, right?
-Thanks.

995
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,411
We finally get to go together.

996
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,579
I'm sorry about that.

997
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,623
Let's get to know each other better today.

998
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,792
-Yes, let's do that.
-Okay.

999
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,462
There's something different about them.

1000
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,007
I think Hye-seon wants
to go with Gwan-hee later.

1001
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,427
She's just using this time
to simply get to know the other guys.

1002
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,889
I think it's payback
for everything he's done so far.

1003
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,725
When she was talking to the other girls,

1004
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,727
she also complained about him.

1005
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,728
If I were her,

1006
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:14,733
I wouldn't want to take him to Paradise
the second time around.

1007
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,694
She even told him
that she wasn't going to choose him.

1008
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,197
Things are about to
get interesting in Inferno.

1009
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,326
Ha-jeong and Gwan-hee are in Inferno
with the new girl, Min-ji.

1010
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,369
Come out.

1011
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,876
The view is spectacular
at this time of day.

1012
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:33,877
It's beautiful.

1013
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,670
Let's sit here.

1014
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,255
Let's sit wherever.

1015
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,186
Goodness.

1016
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,443
I can't think straight.

1017
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,408
It's so pretty out here.

1018
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,912
-It really is.
-Don't I look like I belong here?

1019
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,039
Sure, you could say that.

1020
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,212
-I'm sure that hurt her pride.
-I know.

1021
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,468
-Do you have something to say?
-No, I just…

1022
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,055
I just kind of felt like

1023
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,142
I was a bit too harsh on you,
so I wanted to apologize.

1024
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,060
Apologize?

1025
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,479
I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.

1026
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,982
I guess she felt bad about what she said.

1027
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,901
It takes courage
to talk about things like that.

1028
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,653
Ha-jeong is a transparent person.

1029
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,782
-Well…
-Yesterday, as I was talking,

1030
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,953
I got carried away
and was a bit harsh on you.

1031
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,581
You know…

1032
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,333
I just…

1033
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,710
-Just?
-Well, I just…

1034
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,879
It wasn't just you.
I acted the same way too.

1035
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,756
Still, I just…

1036
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,302
I think I said some things
that may have hurt you.

1037
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:09,014
That was weighing on my mind,
so I wanted to say sorry.

1038
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:10,807
-It's…
-I'm sorry.

1039
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,020
What's with the sudden apology?

1040
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,188
I mean, to be honest,

1041
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,607
we were the only ones
who fought yesterday.

1042
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,401
What? I don't think we fought.

1043
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,863
I don't think
we fought in Paradise either.

1044
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:28,491
If I don't get the response I want
or if something upsets me,

1045
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,910
I tend to be candid
and say what's on my mind.

1046
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:36,166
And I know you're the kind of person
who has to speak your mind too.

1047
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:39,419
I just wanted to apologize
because it was bothering me.

1048
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,213
Don't worry about it.

1049
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,174
-Are you sure?
-It didn't bother me.

1050
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,051
That's a relief.

1051
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:52,557
I just felt like
I was being too harsh on you

1052
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:56,644
for having an opinion
that was different than mine.

1053
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,271
I felt bad about it.

1054
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,274
I see.

1055
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,569
-I appreciate that.
-Okay.

1056
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,366
Is there anything you'd like to say?

1057
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,576
Well…

1058
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:19,709
You don't have to feel sorry.
I'm not holding anything against you.

1059
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:25,632
Now that we've talked about it,
I want you to forget

1060
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,093
what happened in the past.

1061
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,512
I'll do the same as well.

1062
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,265
Okay. Sounds good.

1063
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,601
Good.

1064
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,899
I hope things go well for them.

1065
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:46,069
What does he mean?
Forget the memories they shared together?

1066
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,153
No, that's not it.

1067
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,155
He means she doesn't have to feel bad.

1068
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,907
-About what happened.
-Really?

1069
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,410
He's not saying
they should forget the memories.

1070
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:57,914
I actually understood
what he just said the way you did.

1071
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,416
-Right?
-To end things…

1072
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,500
No, absolutely not.

1073
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,793
-That's not it?
-No.

1074
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:05,463
But it seemed to me
that Gwan-hee was telling her

1075
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,466
he no longer cares
what she does anymore

1076
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,678
-and that she doesn't matter to him.
-That's how I understood it.

1077
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,806
-Ha-jeong isn't important to him now.
-No.

1078
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,307
-Kyuhyun--
-I felt that too.

1079
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,769
He doesn't care if she likes him
or is harsh on him.

1080
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,981
Whatever she does,
it's not going to affect him.

1081
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,315
-That's what I got.
-Me too.

1082
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,860
-No.
-Think about it, Kyuhyun.

1083
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:31,698
The conversation wouldn't have ended there
if he really wanted to work things out.

1084
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,534
I think Kyuhyun knows that
deep down inside.

1085
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,369
-He's just in denial.
-He's in denial.

1086
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,372
-He wants them to end up together.
-Think about it.

1087
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,292
He told Hye-seon
that he wasn't going for Gyu-ri.

1088
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,210
But with Min-ji's appearance,

1089
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,505
he said he was interested in
three people again.

1090
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,175
That means
Ha-jeong is still in the picture.

1091
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,719
It's Ha-jeong, Min-ji and Hye-seon.

1092
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,638
-She's low on the list, though.
-I think so too.

1093
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,349
-They can't recover from this.
-I agree.

1094
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:02,604
-I think Ha-jeong had a little hope left.
-She did.

1095
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:05,565
She apologized and tried to talk to him,

1096
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,609
but Gwan-hee was cold and distant.

1097
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:11,154
-Ha-jeong did put in a lot of effort.
-She did.

1098
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,407
I still believe there's hope between them.

1099
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,995
This one.

1100
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,205
No, the one I took.

1101
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:23,082
But there are two people here.

1102
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,543
You should go and take a picture with her.

1103
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,337
-A picture?
-Don't you have a camera?

1104
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,423
This is so pretty. This one?

1105
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,883
-Well…
-Ha-jeong!

1106
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,218
-What?
-You look so pretty.

1107
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,928
-Really?
-You should take it home.

1108
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,556
-Let me see.
-You're so pretty.

1109
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,559
Gwan-hee.

1110
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,479
Why did you call me Dipsy yesterday?

1111
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,898
-That was you, right?
-No, that was him.

1112
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:47,941
Was it him?

1113
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,568
-I was upset at you. Sorry.
-Was it you?

1114
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,904
-I said you looked like grass.
-What?

1115
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,990
-You don't even remember.
-I liked the grass comment.

1116
00:58:56,574 --> 00:59:00,078
Get over here. This is all your fault.
My reputation is bad enough as it is.

1117
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,496
What? No, it's not.

1118
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,416
-Something sweet?
-Yes.

1119
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,835
Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not a bad person.

1120
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,212
Give me a tour.

1121
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,588
-A tour?
-Yes.

1122
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,131
What do you want to see?

1123
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,050
Since you called me grass…

1124
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,176
The Dipsy thing…

1125
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,219
Seriously, I can't…

1126
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,721
Out of everyone here,
why did you think it was me?

1127
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,683
-Because you looked great in red?
-I see.

1128
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:25,728
-Have you seen that side?
-No, I haven't seen anything yet.

1129
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:26,646
Okay.

1130
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,066
Where shall we start?
Maybe we should start with this well.

1131
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,276
-There's a well?
-Here.

1132
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,860
No, I don't need to see that.

1133
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,529
Ha-jeong…

1134
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,865
-Goodness.
-I feel bad for Ha-jeong.

1135
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,328
Not this place. There are a lot of bugs.

1136
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,580
Let's keep it simple.

1137
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,750
-There's a boat over there.
-I see.

1138
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,169
It's small,
so it's uncomfortable to eat there.

1139
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:54,090
The beach on the other side
is good for workouts.

1140
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,633
-There's another beach?
-Yes.

1141
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,927
There are two beaches here.

1142
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:58,886
Okay.

1143
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,265
Whenever I work out,
I go to the other side.

1144
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,517
That's about it.

1145
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:10,023
-Did you have fun yesterday?
-I did.

1146
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,526
The others said you were a funny guy.

1147
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,570
That's because they don't know me.

1148
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,572
So I wanted to get to know you.

1149
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:22,035
I am funny,
but it takes me a while to open up.

1150
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:22,952
I see.

1151
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,913
All of us just got close yesterday.

1152
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:26,998
What about me?

1153
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,584
Well…

1154
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,503
I don't know you that well.

1155
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:37,050
We've only talked to each other once,

1156
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,511
but everyone said
you had a great personality.

1157
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,263
I just…

1158
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,223
Did you agree with them?

1159
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,769
-Sort of.
-What?

1160
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,729
-What do you mean?
-It's just…

1161
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,232
I felt like things were
a bit awkward between us.

1162
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,360
-With me?
-So I thought--

1163
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,195
You thought you wouldn't make it?

1164
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,697
That's not it.
I told myself I wouldn't even try.

1165
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,701
-Seriously?
-I mean…

1166
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:08,373
You have such a great personality.
I'm sure all the guys will go for you.

1167
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,751
What about you? Aren't you a guy?

1168
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,214
I just don't think…

1169
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,341
She's gaining points.

1170
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,931
What about you? Aren't you a guy?

1171
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:30,937
I just didn't think you liked me.

1172
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,021
What?

1173
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:36,025
Jin-seok told me that you said
I was the hardest to approach.

1174
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,945
That's right.
I thought you weren't interested in me.

1175
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,572
You didn't even take
your sunglasses off. Even now.

1176
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,825
No, I took them off in front of you.

1177
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,535
Why do you have them on now?

1178
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:48,079
-These aren't sunglasses.
-Are they glasses?

1179
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:50,790
-Let me see.
-They're blue-light-blocking glasses.

1180
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,291
Do I look cool?

1181
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,669
-They go well with your outfit.
-Really?

1182
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,882
Gwan-hee seems… How should I put it?

1183
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,801
He seems really tense.

1184
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,511
I think he's interested in her.

1185
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,638
He's always like that at first.

1186
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,931
-Really?
-Yes.

1187
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,892
-He seemed very tense.
-He is in the beginning.

1188
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:16,065
Did your interest spark
because Jin-seok told you a lot about me?

1189
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:21,112
He told me a lot about everyone,
but you were the most memorable.

1190
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,572
I was the most memorable.

1191
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:25,867
I thought maybe you weren't being mean
when you called me Dipsy,

1192
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,119
so I wanted to ask you about it,

1193
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,371
but it wasn't you. I'm glad.

1194
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,625
I told you that your outfit
looked like grass.

1195
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,002
When you said that,

1196
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,545
it felt like a compliment.

1197
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:38,713
I'm fresh like grass.

1198
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,214
-Of course.
-That's how I felt.

1199
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,300
-That was it.
-I didn't tell you, though.

1200
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,385
Your outfit was the same color.

1201
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,596
You're right. You did.

1202
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:49,140
I should go and thank Jin-seok now.

1203
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:53,728
You're talking to me now
because he told you I was funny.

1204
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:57,106
I'm really grateful.
I didn't think I'd get to talk to you.

1205
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,900
Why did you think that?

1206
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,611
Isn't that obvious?

1207
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:07,158
Really? I just wanted to talk to you,
so I approached you.

1208
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,577
I came to you.

1209
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,287
You just saw me passing by.

1210
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,581
No, I was looking for you.

1211
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:15,416
-Were you?
-Yes.

1212
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,501
I see.

1213
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,712
-Out of everyone here,
-Yes?

1214
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:24,091
I don't think I've talked to anyone
this much in the beginning.

1215
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,510
-With me?
-Yes.

1216
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:29,680
It's interesting
how we've talked so much.

1217
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:32,058
It's because I keep approaching you.

1218
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,561
I still don't usually talk this much.

1219
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,854
But you're very…

1220
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,483
-Aren't I fun?
-You get along well with everyone.

1221
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:42,026
With everyone?

1222
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,487
Everyone will like you.

1223
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:45,696
Everyone?

1224
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,741
I'm just saying how I feel.

1225
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,743
-Just how you feel?
-Yes.

1226
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,831
I think I connected
with Min-ji the quickest.

1227
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,584
That really caught me by surprise.

1228
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,754
I was surprised when she approached me,

1229
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:06,259
and the conversation itself
was a shock too.

1230
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,427
It was shocking yet refreshing.

1231
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,763
That's how I felt today.

1232
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,645
Min-ji seems to be good
at making people feel comfortable.

1233
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:20,314
-I think so.
-She's good at striking up a conversation.

1234
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,483
Yesterday, she wasn't like this

1235
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,277
-when she was with Jin-seok.
-Right.

1236
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,155
This is a different side of Min-ji,
so I'm not sure how to describe it.

1237
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,283
We just saw her trying to hit on him.

1238
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:33,911
Right. I thought she was on another level.

1239
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,330
They were all hanging out

1240
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,542
when she asked for a tour
and casually whisked him away.

1241
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,419
We should learn from her.

1242
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:44,755
-The Dipsy thing was an excuse.
-We have a lot to learn.

1243
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,425
She just wanted to get him alone.

1244
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:49,802
If it was an issue,
she would've taken Ha-bin.

1245
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,596
She was out to get the Dipsy guy.

1246
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,390
But it was Ha-bin,
so she said she liked the grass comment.

1247
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:58,436
I had a bad feeling
when Jin-seok mentioned Gwan-hee.

1248
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,271
I knew this would happen.

1249
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:03,232
Min-ji seemed interested
when he talked about Gwan-hee.

1250
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,276
Especially when she heard he was funny.

1251
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,153
Gosh.

1252
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,366
-This is great.
-It looks good.

1253
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,451
Eat up, everyone.

1254
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:14,785
Thank you for the food.

1255
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,454
-Enjoy your meal.
-Eat up.

1256
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,125
Can I use this plate?

1257
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,084
Of course.

1258
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,544
The rice is…

1259
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,171
You're eating so much.

1260
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,297
It's good.

1261
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,507
It's weird eating this
after eating carrots.

1262
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,009
-Is it weird?
-Yes.

1263
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,721
If you say that,
they might give us carrots again.

1264
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,723
I take it back. Never again.

1265
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,976
We can't let that happen.

1266
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,277
-Aren't you tired?
-I'm fine.

1267
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,820
-Really?
-Are you sleepy?

1268
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,448
-You have a lot of energy.
-I might pass out later

1269
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,575
around 8:00 p.m.

1270
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,661
-I bet the bed was super comfortable.
-Why?

1271
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:58,496
Why?

1272
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,539
I bet you were happy.

1273
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,334
Is she still hung up on yesterday?

1274
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,544
-Why is she doing that?
-I wish she wouldn't.

1275
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,171
She wants to talk to him,

1276
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,715
-but it's not going well.
-She doesn't know how.

1277
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,384
-Right.
-Oh, Min-young.

1278
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,469
-I bet the bed was super comfortable.
-Why?

1279
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,388
Why?

1280
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,348
I bet you were happy.

1281
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,558
We're eating…

1282
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,018
-What?
-We're eating and she's…

1283
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,021
-Is it fun?
-I'm having so much fun.

1284
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,157
It's cold.

1285
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,119
Go grab a jacket.

1286
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,290
Go grab a jacket.

1287
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,750
-I don't have one.
-You don't?

1288
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,794
-Sorry, I'm not wearing…
-I only have hoodies.

1289
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:48,713
-Do you have one that zips up?
-No.

1290
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,756
-Do you want mine?
-I only have one.

1291
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,216
Let me borrow one.

1292
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,264
I'll give you tea,
since we had something salty.

1293
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:03,185
If Min-ji also says she's cold
and Gwan-hee takes off his hoodie for her…

1294
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:05,938
Or he brings out his only zip-up hoodie…

1295
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,524
-Just one. Please.
-Sure.

1296
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:09,775
-What about me?
-You too.

1297
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:10,985
I was so bloated this morning.

1298
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,069
Thank you.

1299
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,908
I was so bloated this morning.

1300
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,326
-What?
-I was really bloated.

1301
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,746
That's because you ate a lot.

1302
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:22,872
That's true.

1303
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,999
We had super spicy food before bed.

1304
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:26,459
What did you eat yesterday?

1305
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,045
We had tteokbokki.

1306
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,881
-Did you eat curry yesterday too?
-Yes.

1307
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,257
Oh, you didn't try…

1308
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,175
That's right.

1309
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,469
Lucky you. You had something better.

1310
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,680
That's right. I did.

1311
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,892
-I'm going to choke on my food.
-Eat up.

1312
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,978
She's like a wife scolding her husband
who came home drunk.

1313
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:51,734
That's enough.

1314
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:52,777
It's fun.

1315
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:56,655
I want to sit over there
and just watch these two eat.

1316
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,698
No, I'm good.

1317
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,034
But the two of you…

1318
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:01,744
Never mind.

1319
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,834
Min-young, stop it.

1320
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,294
She doesn't know any better.

1321
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:12,088
She really doesn't.

1322
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,799
That'll make the guy
more and more uncomfortable.

1323
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:15,925
-Right.
-Yes.

1324
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:17,468
He must feel so uncomfortable.

1325
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:20,638
Min-ji is catching on
to what's going on between the two.

1326
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:24,809
Here's the thing.
It's one of the things men don't like.

1327
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:29,146
It can be cute
if she talks like that when they're alone.

1328
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:33,943
But if she does that
when other people are present,

1329
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:37,113
he might not like it
because it makes everyone uncomfortable.

1330
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,657
-Women don't like it either.
-Right?

1331
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,450
I just wish she would stop.

1332
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,745
Min-young doesn't know
how to express herself very well.

1333
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,581
She can be upset,
but it's coming out wrong.

1334
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,960
One thing to note
is that Min-ji feels uncomfortable.

1335
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:56,090
I think the deciding factor
for Min-ji will be whether or not

1336
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,300
Jin-seok gives her
the assurance she needs.

1337
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,761
I can't wait to see
what happens at night in Inferno.

1338
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,304
I don't care about Paradise.

1339
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:04,348
-Our focus is on Inferno right now.
-Yes.

1340
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,893
Min-ji, since you're new here,
ask us anything.

1341
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,230
-Let's see…
-Are we going straight to questions?

1342
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:12,606
-Yes.
-Okay.

1343
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:16,485
Do you think
you'll have a change of heart?

1344
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,864
-Gosh.
-Was that too straightforward?

1345
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:24,493
"Will you keep liking Jin-seok?"

1346
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,078
This is nerve-racking.

1347
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,496
He's nervous.

1348
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,623
There's tension in the air.

1349
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,464
I don't think I will.

1350
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,260
Just take him with you already!

1351
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,972
You go first. I'll go next.

1352
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,892
-Ask you a question?
-No, whomever.

1353
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:53,230
Who's the most memorable person?

1354
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,315
-Person?
-Person?

1355
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:56,984
-The most memorable person?
-Yes.

1356
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,820
One you keep thinking about.

1357
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,991
-Be honest.
-Honestly? You.

1358
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:10,956
I didn't know that.

1359
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,626
-He hasn't talked about this before.
-I know.

1360
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,044
Have you been to Paradise?

1361
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,337
-I have.
-She went with me.

1362
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,005
-Really?
-Yes.

1363
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,465
How do you feel right now?

1364
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,383
-Was that too direct?
-I'm just…

1365
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,011
Are we playing Truth or Dare?

1366
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:24,970
I'm just curious.

1367
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,056
I don't know much about you guys.

1368
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:30,851
What are your thoughts

1369
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:34,605
after hearing how Ha-bin feels?

1370
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,607
-I was thinking…
-Be honest.

1371
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:39,944
I've been wanting to go to Paradise
with Ha-bin for some time now.

1372
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:45,741
I didn't see that coming.

1373
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,577
Will Ha-bin finally go to Paradise?

1374
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,388
We're done, right?
Can I go to the other room?

1375
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:08,347
Why?

1376
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,391
Aren't we done? We know everything now.

1377
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:11,350
-No.
-What?

1378
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,685
We're not done here.

1379
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,103
Do you want to go outside?

1380
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:16,397
Let's talk at the table outside.

1381
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:21,485
I want to know
how things have been going for you.

1382
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,237
-Me?
-Yes.

1383
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,864
-Ha-jeong?
-I haven't talked to you yet.

1384
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,283
-Ask her anything.
-I see.

1385
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,494
Up until now,
I haven't really talked to anyone

1386
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:33,914
about my feelings or things like that.

1387
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,791
-I see.
-People may be curious…

1388
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:37,543
-They don't know how I feel.
-I see.

1389
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:39,295
But I don't even know how I feel.

1390
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:42,172
I see. But have you made up your mind?

1391
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,020
I think I have.

1392
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,150
This is so much fun!

1393
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:03,902
She thinks she has.
Nothing is certain yet.

1394
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,446
That's so sweet.

1395
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:14,163
You haven't talked much
about your feelings either, right?

1396
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:15,372
-Me?
-Just like Ha-jeong.

1397
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,499
-That's right.
-About your feelings.

1398
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,960
When I asked everyone else,

1399
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,421
they all said
they couldn't figure you out.

1400
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,048
Me?

1401
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:27,051
I don't get it.
I said it in front of everyone.

1402
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,218
Really?

1403
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,637
That's because you mentioned
a lot of people.

1404
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,473
-I…
-It was Gyu-ri,

1405
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:35,225
-Hye-seon…
-Hye-seon and me.

1406
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:36,518
He was interested in us.

1407
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,062
Yes, I mentioned those three.

1408
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,147
-Really?
-Have your feelings evolved?

1409
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:44,818
My feelings have evolved,
and I've made up my mind now.

1410
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,320
-You have?
-Yes, I have.

1411
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:47,529
-Really?
-Yes.

1412
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,783
My mind is pretty set now,

1413
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:54,953
so I think by this time tomorrow,
it'll be down to one person.

1414
01:12:56,830 --> 01:13:00,000
And once I've made up my mind
by this time tomorrow,

1415
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,045
I'm going to stick with her until the end.

1416
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:03,962
Really?

1417
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,423
That is if things go as expected.

1418
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,928
Really?

1419
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:12,888
Is it Hye-seon?

1420
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,556
-Could it be Min-ji?
-It's Min-ji?

1421
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,766
-It is.
-I bet it's her.

1422
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:16,850
After one chat?

1423
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,227
-Yes.
-He felt a lot of emotions.

1424
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,604
Don't you remember
his interview on the beach?

1425
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:28,278
You said you were interested
in Ha-jeong, right?

1426
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,155
-Yes.
-Is there a chance

1427
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,907
you will change your mind?

1428
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:38,956
Well…

1429
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:44,169
We've never had the chance
to have a proper conversation.

1430
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,255
So I'd like to talk to her a bit first.

1431
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:51,635
You guys should talk. I'll be back.

1432
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:53,303
-All right.
-I want to talk too.

1433
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:54,263
Okay.

1434
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:58,142
It feels like they're trying to set us up.

1435
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,935
My head hurts.

1436
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:07,109
What kind of proper conversation
do you want to have?

1437
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:09,319
-It comes down to one thing.
-What?

1438
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:11,321
I don't think…

1439
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,950
I want to talk to you here.

1440
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,286
What?

1441
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:19,246
What does that mean?

1442
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,124
Well…

1443
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:28,881
I want to go somewhere
where we can break this rule.

1444
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,219
Simply put,
I want to go to Paradise with you.

1445
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:37,764
-So we can talk?
-I want to talk openly and candidly.

1446
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,521
I'll tell you everything in Paradise
if we get the chance.

1447
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:49,401
Have you been well?

1448
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:52,362
Yes. You seem like
you're on your honeymoon.

1449
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:53,280
-Me?
-Yes.

1450
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,323
That's not true.

1451
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,210
Why aren't you looking at me?

1452
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:07,294
I'm looking at you.

1453
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:14,009
I thought you were interested in me.

1454
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:17,179
Of course, I'm interested.

1455
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,643
-Are you trying to seduce me?
-No.

1456
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,520
-Really?
-I'm a bit upset right now.

1457
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:27,981
-Why?
-I didn't know you had someone you liked.

1458
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:33,946
You practically have a wife here.

1459
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,240
I never said she was my wife, though.

1460
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,533
-Really?
-No.

1461
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:39,952
Do you love her?

1462
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:44,248
Is that even possible?
We haven't been here that long.

1463
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,253
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

1464
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:51,380
Go.

1465
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:54,841
Regardless of how I feel,
I know your heart's not here anyway.

1466
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:55,884
What?

1467
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,512
-It's nothing.
-Are you really upset?

1468
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,306
I felt very uncomfortable today.

1469
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,808
-Why?
-What?

1470
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,769
I don't have a clue
about what happened here before.

1471
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:08,730
You told me to tell you
if anything was bothering me,

1472
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,983
but I couldn't
because of a certain someone.

1473
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,026
She wasn't like that before.

1474
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:15,153
-Why is she like that?
-She suddenly changed

1475
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,072
after I came back from Paradise.

1476
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:19,283
I'm taken aback by her too.

1477
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,118
I was just a little disappointed.

1478
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:24,913
I think you're decent,
and I was interested in you.

1479
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:29,209
But it's not like
I was head over heels for you.

1480
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:31,336
-I understand.
-It's just…

1481
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:34,047
It was awkward for me too.

1482
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:36,925
The only thing I did
was go to Paradise with you.

1483
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,594
She's just playing around.

1484
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,721
I'm sorry. This wasn't my intention.

1485
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,266
I didn't mean to…

1486
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:54,735
I bet a lot of guys like you.

1487
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,153
-Me?
-Yes.

1488
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:57,696
-So what?
-What?

1489
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,323
They're not you.

1490
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:03,952
I think you're speaking too highly of me.

1491
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,454
I had fun with you yesterday.

1492
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:06,371
-Really?
-Yes.

1493
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,624
I also enjoyed your company.

1494
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:14,338
I didn't think I'd like anyone else,

1495
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:18,050
but I started to have feelings for Min-ji.

1496
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:21,470
I think I need a bit more time
to fully understand how I feel.

1497
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:25,432
-Why won't you tell me you missed me?
-What?

1498
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:27,351
Why won't you?

1499
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:31,021
I'm expressing how I feel,
but you're not giving me anything.

1500
01:17:31,104 --> 01:17:32,230
I'm going to stop.

1501
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:35,150
To be honest,

1502
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:37,402
-I don't know what you're thinking.
-How come?

1503
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,237
-What I'm thinking?
-Yes.

1504
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,405
Why is that?

1505
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:45,327
I said I was attracted to you
but wanted to talk to others.

1506
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,621
-That's how I felt.
-Okay.

1507
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:50,290
But it seemed like
everyone wanted to set us up.

1508
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:54,795
We weren't that close back then,
so I felt pressured.

1509
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:57,923
-But then we talked.
-I see.

1510
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,426
That's when I realized
how I felt about you.

1511
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:07,641
I'm not so sure
about my feelings for you anymore.

1512
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,145
I mean…

1513
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,148
Well…

1514
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,110
I was sure before.

1515
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:22,114
I told you how I felt
and acted accordingly.

1516
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,699
But I didn't reciprocate?

1517
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:27,494
I guess I didn't feel that at the time.

1518
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:31,581
I'm sure about my feelings now.
Back then, we were only on day three.

1519
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:32,499
Right.

1520
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:37,337
After you left yesterday,
I kept talking about you to other people.

1521
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:41,466
You didn't have to.
That's actually what annoys me.

1522
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,843
-Why did your…
-Tell me.

1523
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:45,887
Why did your feelings become certain
when I was in Paradise?

1524
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:50,976
When we were together,
you weren't sure about me.

1525
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:55,188
I don't understand
why you became certain then.

1526
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,734
It was actually before you left.

1527
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,238
I wanted to talk to you,
but you left that day.

1528
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,489
I had a feeling you'd go,

1529
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,908
so I figured I'd talk to you
when you got back.

1530
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:11,204
But the whole situation is…

1531
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:15,459
The timing is kind of weird.

1532
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,630
I understand that
we might not see eye to eye.

1533
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,383
I don't like feeling confused.

1534
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:26,678
I also don't like people who confuse me.

1535
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,974
I think it would be best
for us to keep our options open.

1536
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:34,352
I don't think it'd be right
to commit to each other.

1537
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:40,984
Let's get some air. It's hot in here.

1538
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:43,695
I'm not done talking.

1539
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,699
I was upset.

1540
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,702
He told me to express my feelings,
so I did.

1541
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,412
Then he started to push me away.

1542
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:54,289
I don't know what to do.

1543
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,461
Their timing was off.

1544
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:04,007
I think what annoyed Jin-seok is key here.

1545
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:07,677
Min-young got anxious
after he left for Paradise.

1546
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:10,013
I think it seems to him
she doesn't want him

1547
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:12,390
but doesn't want anyone else to have him.

1548
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:16,394
I think he was disappointed
and was trying to tell her that.

1549
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:19,689
If Min-young had told him
that wasn't the case,

1550
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:24,361
this conversation could've been
a more constructive one.

1551
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:26,196
It's a shame they didn't get there.

1552
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:29,699
-I think Jin-seok is a great guy
-He really is.

1553
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:34,412
because when he was talking with Min-ji,
he didn't tell her how he felt.

1554
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,665
-He didn't try anything with her.
-Right.

1555
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:39,668
On the other hand,
when he was talking with Min-young,

1556
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:43,004
he was very clear about how he felt.

1557
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,882
I really think he's a decent guy.

1558
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:49,094
He's wrapping things up
before he goes to Min-ji.

1559
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,011
Right.

1560
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,681
He didn't even flirt with Min-ji.

1561
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:57,018
He first had a conversation with Min-young
to tie up any loose ends.

1562
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:59,563
-He didn't try to set up a backup plan.
-Exactly.

1563
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:02,858
His words and actions made me admire him.

1564
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:06,403
-Where are we going?
-You don't have any questions for me.

1565
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:08,446
Why do you keep saying that?

1566
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,782
-You do?
-I was upset earlier.

1567
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:11,825
Why?

1568
01:21:11,908 --> 01:21:12,784
I won't tell you.

1569
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,327
Why? What happened?

1570
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,705
-Where do you want to sit?
-I'll sit here.

1571
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:18,039
-Here?
-On the left.

1572
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,835
-This is nice.
-Yes, it's really pretty.

1573
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,630
Do you want to know why I was upset?

1574
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:26,590
Tell me.

1575
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:30,176
Jin-seok told me
that you were funny yesterday,

1576
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,846
so I approached you
after clearing up the misunderstanding.

1577
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:34,264
-Right.
-Yes.

1578
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,976
I'm not actually interested in everyone.

1579
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:41,146
-Okay.
-When we were eating earlier,

1580
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,607
I asked Jin-seok if he felt a flutter,

1581
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:47,819
and you acted like I was going around
saying that to everyone.

1582
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:50,196
-I see.
-I was super upset.

1583
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,074
No, I liked everything.

1584
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:54,075
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON

1585
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,493
Didn't you feel a flutter?

1586
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:57,746
"Didn't you feel a flutter?"

1587
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:01,041
Does she ask everyone that?

1588
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:02,208
-No.
-Did she ask you too?

1589
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,002
-She asked me the same question.
-No.

1590
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:05,587
No, I didn't. That's not true.

1591
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:08,089
-A flutter…
-Did you feel a flutter?

1592
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,925
-Not even one bit.
-Really?

1593
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,426
I'm not that easy.

1594
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:19,351
It's not like I said that
because I don't have feelings for you.

1595
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,603
It was just…

1596
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:25,857
I guess it just felt wrong for me

1597
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,234
to do anything

1598
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:31,780
or try anything with you.

1599
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:34,407
-That's why I said--
-What do you mean?

1600
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,533
Well…

1601
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,163
I didn't feel comfortable
expressing how I really felt.

1602
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:45,168
That's why I asked
if you felt that way for everyone.

1603
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:47,462
-That's why I said that.
-Right.

1604
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:51,800
I was debating whether or not
I should ask that question for a while.

1605
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:55,387
That's why I said that,
so don't get me wrong.

1606
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,181
-Anyway…
-Why are you suddenly confessing?

1607
01:22:58,264 --> 01:22:59,099
I'm not.

1608
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:00,558
I know. I was just joking.

1609
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,186
I was just answering you truthfully.

1610
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:07,607
I just like you, and I'm attracted to you.

1611
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:11,236
Why didn't you tell me that?
You could've been more forward.

1612
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:12,696
Are you not the type?

1613
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:17,492
If someone doesn't seem interested in me,

1614
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:21,329
-it's hard for me to take the first step.
-I see.

1615
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:26,710
If someone approached me first,
or if it was just the two of us,

1616
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,879
it would make things easier for me.

1617
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:33,883
If I were talking to another woman--

1618
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:36,302
I'd still approach you and ask to chat.

1619
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,096
Can you really do that?

1620
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,639
Do you want me to show you?

1621
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,560
You sure are different.

1622
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:44,894
Really? What do you mean?

1623
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,565
Let's reverse our roles
and say I was in your shoes.

1624
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:52,027
If I talked to six women
for ten minutes each,

1625
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,779
do you think I would've picked you
to go to Paradise with?

1626
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:55,697
Yes.

1627
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:57,449
-You think so?
-Yes.

1628
01:23:58,199 --> 01:23:59,159
Why? Wouldn't you?

1629
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:01,244
I actually thought about it.

1630
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,039
You didn't pick me to go with you,

1631
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:08,251
but if I were in your shoes,
I think I would've picked you.

1632
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:10,712
It felt like we weren't on the same page,

1633
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:12,338
-so I felt…
-I'd be upset.

1634
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:14,674
-I'd be annoyed too.
-You're right. I was upset.

1635
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:20,346
-I'm curious about your job now.
-Me?

1636
01:24:27,103 --> 01:24:29,856
I don't know
how the others feel about Min-ji,

1637
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:34,069
but I think Min-ji and I
both have cheerful personalities.

1638
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:37,655
I was quite surprised when I saw her

1639
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,658
because she was my ideal type.

1640
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:44,204
I think she's the kind of person

1641
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:48,124
I've been waiting for.

1642
01:24:49,959 --> 01:24:51,961
-Is he that into her?
-That's crazy.

1643
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,048
-He's really into her.
-That settles it then.

1644
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:58,093
-She has him in the palm of her hand.
-I don't know

1645
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:01,054
if I like how Min-ji is acting right now.

1646
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:05,600
She went to Jin-seok and acted as though
she had feelings for him,

1647
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:07,602
but now, she's doing that to Gwan-hee.

1648
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:10,688
But Min-ji just got here yesterday.

1649
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:12,982
-I see.
-Yes.

1650
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,693
It's too early for her to be committed.

1651
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,905
She didn't tell Jin-seok
that he was her first choice.

1652
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:22,117
-She's only talking to two people.
-That's true.

1653
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,619
If you think about it,
she only approached two guys.

1654
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:27,705
Are you Cho Min-ji's spokesperson?
Are you her lawyer?

1655
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:28,873
Are you a big fan?

1656
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,208
We have the same surname.

1657
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,502
-Oh, okay.
-I want to look out for her.

1658
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:34,838
-We'll have to keep watching.
-Right.

1659
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:41,719
-I think it'll be settled soon.
-Are you two still talking?

1660
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:43,680
She's here.

1661
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:45,557
-Ha-jeong is here.
-Ha-jeong.

1662
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,518
Can't you two just date, Gwan-hee?

1663
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,062
We're almost done.

1664
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:52,981
-You are?
-Do you want to talk to him?

1665
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:56,734
Take a seat over here.

1666
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,779
What took you guys so long?

1667
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:03,658
We had a lot to talk about
since we're getting to know each other.

1668
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:05,910
What do you think she's like?

1669
01:26:06,786 --> 01:26:08,663
Are you glad you talked to her?

1670
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:11,875
Yes, I think I got what I needed.

1671
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,293
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1672
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:17,630
-How are things with Ha-bin?
-Ha-bin?

1673
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:19,007
What did you talk about?

1674
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:20,300
Not much.

1675
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:23,720
Have you guys decided
to go to Paradise together?

1676
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:24,637
No.

1677
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:27,390
Why not?

1678
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,852
Because I want to go with you.

1679
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,104
Because I want to go with you.

1680
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,356
But you said so earlier.

1681
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,483
I was just curious about him.

1682
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:39,819
I want to go with you.

1683
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,033
I think

1684
01:26:46,826 --> 01:26:48,411
I like you the most.

1685
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:23,071
