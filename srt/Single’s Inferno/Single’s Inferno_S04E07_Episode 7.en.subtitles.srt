YUK JUN-SEO

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,334
AN JONG-HOON

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,925
SINGLE'S INFERNO

15
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,681
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,020
Yuk Jun-seo.

17
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,483
There you go!

18
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,359
That's right.

19
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,325
Logically, it was his turn to go.

20
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,701
-Exactly.
-Well…

21
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,330
She's already gone with Theo and Jeong-su.

22
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,918
Lee Si-an has matched with Yuk Jun-seo.

23
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,380
Have fun.

24
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,800
Have fun.

25
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,521
…Yuk Jun-seo.

26
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,231
-Yuk Jun-seo.
-I knew it.

27
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,982
Please come outside.

28
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,754
What took you so long?

29
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,301
Why do I…

30
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,720
feel so awkward?

31
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,765
It feels weird to go to Paradise with you.

32
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,850
I know, right?

33
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,601
I didn't think I would go today,

34
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,354
because I wasn't that expressive
about my feelings.

35
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,189
-You were expressive.
-Was I?

36
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,441
That's a relief.

37
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,654
This could be more fun than expected.

38
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,698
Well, they've both held back a lot.

39
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,949
-This will be so fun.
-Really?

40
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,117
-Exactly.
-Because…

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,788
They were being cautious
with Jeong-su and Min-seol around.

42
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,374
They can go have fun
without worrying about others.

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,588
The Paradise-bound couple matching
is over.

44
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,551
Being left behind feels…

45
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,386
Pretty bitter.

46
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,017
It's not great.

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,270
You definitely feel like you're at risk.

48
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,523
Poor Theo.

49
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,580
Wow, this is…

50
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,415
-That's how it turned out.
-Theo…

51
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,002
Why did Theo have to come out
and watch them leave?

52
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,462
He'll get a chance, right?

53
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,922
-He will. At least one.
-I hope so.

54
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,050
-Another chance for Theo?
-I find myself rooting for Theo.

55
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,719
It turned out exactly as expected.

56
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,763
-Exactly as expected.
-Yes.

57
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,723
Actually, you didn't see this coming.

58
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,768
-That's true. I didn't.
-I didn't see it either.

59
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,685
Seriously.

60
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,312
-Right? Jun-seo?
-No, I really didn't.

61
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,064
-I didn't think it'd be him.
-For real.

62
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,273
She kept giving hints.

63
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,234
I thought it could be
Jong-hoon as a surprise.

64
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,110
-What?
-Someone totally different.

65
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,946
What are you talking about?

66
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,574
-Jin-kyung, that's not it.
-It's not? Okay…

67
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,492
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,401
PARADISE
KIM A-RIN & KOOK DONG-HO

69
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,152
-Let's go carefully.
-All right.

70
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,865
-This car sounds amazing.
-Yeah, the engine sounds incredible.

71
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,285
Gosh, my heart's racing.

72
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,703
I feel the same way.

73
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,747
When I get in a car I like,
my heart starts pounding.

74
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,250
Can you lean forward a bit? Is that okay?

75
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,253
-All set.
-Thanks. That's so thoughtful.

76
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,304
-Time flies, doesn't it?
-It really does.

77
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,515
-We're more than halfway through.
-I can't believe it.

78
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,309
We're more than halfway through.

79
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,977
It's my first trip to Paradise though.

80
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,894
That's right.

81
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,106
We're crossing the river.

82
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,026
Dong-ho crossing…

83
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,653
Dong-ho crossing Dongho Bridge?

84
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,988
Dong-ho crossing Dongho Bridge.

85
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,615
I'll think of this
every time I cross this bridge.

86
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,785
It'll be such an honor.

87
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,665
I'll think of this every time.

88
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,917
That's literally the name. Dongho Bridge.

89
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,127
Exactly.

90
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,378
How meaningful.

91
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,883
This feels like a dream.

92
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,845
PARADISE
LEE SI-AN & YUK JUN-SEO

93
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,805
The third time feels nice.

94
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,474
-Enjoy it.
-Yeah, it feels good.

95
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,696
-We've passed the halfway mark now.
-Yeah.

96
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,698
Tomorrow's already the seventh day.

97
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,325
-I'm a bit…
-Yeah?

98
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:11,579
I had so much fun
up until the third or fourth day.

99
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,915
-Yeah.
-I was meeting people, went to Paradise…

100
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,251
But now, I don't even know
my own feelings anymore.

101
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,005
If someone asks about my feelings…

102
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,257
-Right.
-I don't know how to answer them.

103
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,218
-Yeah.
-That's what I'm going through.

104
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,844
It's understandable.

105
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,680
My mind suddenly filled with thoughts…

106
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,932
Right.

107
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,059
So my energy's dropped a lot.

108
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,561
-I get it.
-Yeah.

109
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:48,282
Since she has so many options,
it's a lot to think about.

110
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:52,161
And I think she's thinking
more seriously now about her choices.

111
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,871
At first, she came wanting to have fun.

112
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,875
But she's starting to think more deeply
after seeing how great everyone is.

113
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,713
-The vibe's great.
-Wow, this is great.

114
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,549
-Pardon me.
-Wow, coffee.

115
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,593
This looks delicious.

116
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,845
Thank you for the food.

117
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,221
Thank you.

118
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,682
Is this chicken thigh?

119
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,642
-Yeah. Want to try some?
-Yeah.

120
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,560
Okay.

121
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,062
It's different from chicken breast.

122
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,817
Thank you.

123
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,403
Here's the sauce.

124
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,783
Is it okay? Is it good?

125
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,290
-It's good, right?
-It's so good.

126
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,250
Do you feel better now?

127
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,377
I'm so happy.

128
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,795
-Are you sure?
-Totally.

129
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,172
What's up with that look then?

130
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,215
Totally.

131
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,760
That's good.

132
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,348
You're older than me, right?

133
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,392
-How old are you?
-Probably.

134
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,810
I was born in 1996.

135
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,020
-In 1996?
-Yeah.

136
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,402
And you were probably born in 1998?

137
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,154
-In 1999.
-In 1999?

138
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,071
Yeah.

139
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,742
-Then, how old are you? Are you 26?
-You're younger than I thought.

140
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,536
I'm 25 right now.

141
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,787
Twenty-five. Right.

142
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,709
So you are older.

143
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,551
Today feels like an escape.

144
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,136
-Right? Exactly.
-Yeah.

145
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,805
I really didn't think it would happen.

146
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,058
-Honestly.
-What?

147
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,809
I didn't think I'd be here today.

148
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,358
-I felt unsure.
-Yeah.

149
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,568
I thought

150
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:52,365
I didn't express my feelings to you
as much as the others did.

151
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,409
So I didn't get my hopes up.

152
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,496
But then, they called my name.

153
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,413
Yeah.

154
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,999
I was relieved and surprised.

155
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,376
-I see.
-Yeah.

156
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,835
It wasn't what I expected.

157
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,878
I see.

158
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,132
Yesterday,

159
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,970
I was grateful you came to me first.
I was thinking we needed to talk too.

160
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,723
I thought you expressed yourself well.

161
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,683
-Yesterday?
-Yeah.

162
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,601
Really?

163
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,855
Why didn't you answer the question?

164
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,773
What?

165
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,235
The person you wanted to take to Paradise.

166
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,695
LAST NIGHT

167
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,071
Then…

168
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,991
Who do you want to go with, Jun-seo?

169
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,034
To Paradise?

170
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,619
Why are you doing this to me?

171
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,837
I'll just drink.

172
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,595
I'd talked with Theo a lot,

173
00:09:55,678 --> 00:10:00,266
and I got a general sense
of how he feels about you.

174
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,267
That's why…

175
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,605
I was trying to be more cautious.

176
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,692
I know exactly the people
who are currently interested in you,

177
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,029
so I didn't want to casually reveal it
during a drinking game.

178
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,865
I hadn't properly
mentioned it before either.

179
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:17,867
That's why.

180
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,042
-She's pleased.
-That's a good response.

181
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,960
-She liked his response.
-Yeah.

182
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,712
He was considerate of his rivals.

183
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,713
Yes.

184
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,301
Honestly,

185
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,138
I feel like I'm holding back
my true feelings a bit

186
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:43,059
from the people I went to Paradise with.

187
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,977
Why?

188
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,314
My feelings keep changing.

189
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,400
But they could take that as certainty…

190
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,318
Right.

191
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,070
Or it could lead to misunderstandings…

192
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,529
-Right.
-before I decide.

193
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,740
-That's right.
-That's why…

194
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,242
I'm holding back
even when I want to express myself.

195
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,160
I see.

196
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,580
So…

197
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,375
After today,

198
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,461
I want to sort out my thoughts quickly…

199
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,379
Right.

200
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,257
And I just want to express myself freely.

201
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,425
Yeah.

202
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,844
-But…
-If I like someone, I want to tell them.

203
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,807
Do you have mixed feelings?

204
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,602
I just have a lot to think about.

205
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,106
At first,

206
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,234
I was just happy and having fun.

207
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,902
-But now…
-Yeah.

208
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,779
I'm scared.

209
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,863
-I see.
-Yeah.

210
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,120
I started feeling this way today.
My energy had suddenly dropped.

211
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,037
Really?

212
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,789
-Yeah.
-I get that.

213
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,544
But feeling conflicted and confused
is still you being yourself too.

214
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,296
This is what I think.

215
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,592
Those decisions are ones
you'll have to make eventually anyway,

216
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,010
so set them aside for now.

217
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,429
Let's just enjoy good food here

218
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,930
-and have fun talks.
-Okay.

219
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,723
-We'll just have fun and go.
-Sure.

220
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,101
-I'd like you to take it easy.
-Yeah.

221
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,311
-We don't need to be too serious.
-Yeah.

222
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,565
-Let's do that.
-And today, I'm going to focus on you.

223
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,275
-Good.
-Yeah.

224
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,656
-This is…
-Talking with Jun-seo seems very soothing.

225
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,574
I agree.

226
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,119
Jun-seo puts people
at ease with his advice.

227
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,036
Yeah.

228
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,956
I think they both share
a similar level of honesty.

229
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,500
-They have similar dispositions.
-Yeah, they do.

230
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,419
They're straightforward and not too…

231
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,713
Being serious
makes them too uncomfortable.

232
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:40,509
Instead of thinking too much,
I hope Si-an can have fun with Jun-seo.

233
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,597
But if you look at people who have
a lot of options and overthink,

234
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,348
they end up staying single.

235
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,021
-It's true.
-We didn't expect that response.

236
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,524
People with few options get married
as soon as someone comes along.

237
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,652
I've seen this happen a lot
with people I know.

238
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,448
I'm not saying
Si-an will end up living alone.

239
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,908
I hope she finds happiness.

240
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,201
In any case, she's popular.

241
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,869
-Right.
-It's a lot to think about.

242
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,289
You overthink and end up unable
to make a decision sometimes.

243
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,459
Right, and she's not just saying that.
Si-an genuinely seems unsure.

244
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,960
She's truly conflicted.

245
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,797
-Salad, fruit, champagne…
-Fruit? I love it.

246
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,842
-Here.
-This looks delicious. Thanks.

247
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,803
Now, here's a test.

248
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,098
-Any good at opening bottles?
-Try your best.

249
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,934
I've never tried this before.

250
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,188
-It's not working?
-No, it's okay.

251
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,315
I got it.

252
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,908
This looks so good.

253
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,034
Nice to meet you.

254
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,619
-Nice to meet you?
-Yes.

255
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,960
That's nice.

256
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,379
This definitely is paradise.

257
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,838
I don't know what it tastes like.

258
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,423
-It's good.
-The taste of champagne.

259
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,009
What is this? Tofu?

260
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,095
Let's try it. Give it a taste.

261
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,888
-It looks like tofu.
-Right?

262
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,182
-Can you pass me a knife?
-Sure.

263
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,102
Is it this knife?

264
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,562
Just pass me any knife.

265
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,647
Why is this so complicated?

266
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,861
That side of him is surprisingly charming.

267
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,155
-Yeah.
-That line showed his clumsy side.

268
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,491
-He doesn't pretend to be perfect.
-It's nice.

269
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,869
I should act like
I don't know anything either.

270
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,205
All right. Enjoy your meal.

271
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,331
Thank you.

272
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:39,962
It's delicious.

273
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,426
In general, eating food on Inferno
is like chewing on rocks.

274
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,343
Exactly.

275
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,264
Here, you could chew with just your gums.

276
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,349
Look. You don't need teeth for avocados.

277
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,559
For real.

278
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,437
I'm so curious about your job and age.

279
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,188
I'd really like to know your age.

280
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,025
-Can I guess?
-Are you most curious about my age?

281
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,484
-No, your job.
-My job?

282
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,154
I definitely think you're younger.

283
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,823
I think around twenty…

284
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,078
Around twenty…

285
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,414
Twenty…

286
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,459
six?

287
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,712
Actually, three years younger.

288
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,047
So I think you're 23.

289
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,215
-No, just be honest.
-Twenty-three.

290
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,592
-Twenty-three?
-Yeah.

291
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,886
I'm 25.

292
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,930
I was close…

293
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,016
You glared at me
like that difference was huge.

294
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,060
-A one-year difference is huge.
-It is.

295
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,186
A whole year.

296
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,313
Twenty-five. Guess my age.

297
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,023
You could be older, you know.

298
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,693
-Maybe I've been through a lot in life.
-I don't think so.

299
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,694
Definitely not.

300
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,113
Why are you so sure about that?

301
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,991
I feel like

302
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,661
you're older than me.

303
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,330
But not quite 30, so I'd guess 29.

304
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,459
And I'll add one more year.

305
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,460
So 30 years old.

306
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,504
You did that
because I seemed happy with 29?

307
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,463
Yeah. Thirty?

308
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,673
-Thirty?
-You're right.

309
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,383
-Really?
-Yeah, I'm 30.

310
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,887
You're right.

311
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,307
You look that age.

312
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,228
And your job.

313
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,729
I think…

314
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,734
when I look at how you dress
and everything,

315
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,571
you seem to know what looks good on you.

316
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,783
I figured you might be a model
or work in photography?

317
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,701
-Yeah.
-Right?

318
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,369
I'm a model for advertisements.

319
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,453
That's my job.

320
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,665
I'm a model for advertisements.

321
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,378
I've been modeling
for a beauty brand for three years now.

322
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,383
I also model for wedding apparel,
and I work as a fit model too.

323
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,972
KIM A-RIN, AGE 25
MODEL

324
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,557
That's my job.

325
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,810
So you do shoots
and pose with your shoulders like this?

326
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,395
You're pretty good.

327
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,024
-Aren't you supposed to do that?
-I do like to pose with my shoulders.

328
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,817
That's so interesting.

329
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,610
Have you ever modeled as a bride?

330
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,903
I have.

331
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,657
-How many times have you gotten married?
-I think around three times.

332
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,826
Wow, that's quite an exciting life.

333
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,745
That was so…

334
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,413
-Out of nowhere…
-Yeah.

335
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:23,125
Guessing like this is fun.

336
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,544
I can't tell what yours is.

337
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,213
-What? About my job?
-Yeah.

338
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,256
Yeah.

339
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,466
Give it a shot.

340
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,551
You seem like you work in an office.

341
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,094
How else would I make a living?

342
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,847
Did you think I stayed at home?

343
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,141
I do work in an office.

344
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,560
So I was right
about you working in an office?

345
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,854
Yeah, I'm a certified accountant.

346
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,314
-An accountant?
-Yeah.

347
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,900
Wow, no way.

348
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,445
I did have a feeling
it would be a professional job.

349
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,740
Is your office in Yongsan by any chance?

350
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,033
Yeah.

351
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,035
-Because…
-Amore…

352
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,536
-How did you know?
-Can I say that?

353
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,372
-I was there recently for a shoot.
-Right. It's usually…

354
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,875
-Do you know the Etude building?
-I do.

355
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,044
I go there for work a lot.

356
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,130
-We might have crossed paths.
-It's possible.

357
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,091
They have good restaurants
underground there.

358
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,258
Right.

359
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,344
When was the last time you were there?

360
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,055
I'm there at least once
every two or three months.

361
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,557
-We've probably passed by each other.
-Right?

362
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,310
We were really close.
Wow, that's so cool.

363
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,187
-They have a connection.
-Yeah.

364
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,439
Once every two months is…

365
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,275
-Yeah. It's not that often.
-Right.

366
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,152
I don't think
they crossed paths often.

367
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,738
I'm also curious about where you live.

368
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,115
Yeah, me too.

369
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,242
-Since you work in Seoul…
-Yeah.

370
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:42,329
Well, if you have to do
a lot of photoshoots,

371
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:47,501
wouldn't you live in areas like Nonhyeon,
Apgujeong, Cheongdam, or Gangnam?

372
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,086
Sinsa?

373
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,587
Where do you live?

374
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,422
I live in Wangsimni.

375
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,341
Wangsimni.

376
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,635
-Really?
-What?

377
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,928
-What is it?
-What?

378
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,680
Does he live in Wangsimni?

379
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,098
-Why are you surprised?
-Me too.

380
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,266
-Really?
-Yeah.

381
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,225
Seriously?

382
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,476
Wow, really?

383
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,603
That's so amazing.

384
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,980
-Yeah.
-It is.

385
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,440
They might have actually
seen each other before.

386
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,568
I live in Wangsimni.

387
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,112
It's been eight or nine years now.

388
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,029
-Really?
-Yeah.

389
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,781
It's been two years for me.

390
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,909
I've practically been there forever.
I've lived in Wangsimni a while.

391
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,619
-We're neighbors.
-You're right.

392
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,204
We're neighborhood friends.

393
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,415
-So that's why your eyes got so big.
-Then…

394
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,586
We must've taken the same subway
to go to the same place for work.

395
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,130
How is this possible?

396
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,632
This is amazing.

397
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,092
It really is.

398
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,512
It's not easy for this to happen.

399
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,015
But we have a lot in common.

400
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,018
I was even starting
to think if this was fate.

401
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,313
Being from the same neighborhood is…

402
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,272
It's significant.

403
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,440
It's suddenly huge.

404
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,443
-This could boost their level of interest.
-Right.

405
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,111
It's a sense of familiarity.

406
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,154
That's right.

407
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,488
-And the idea of fate…
-Right.

408
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,325
You make yourself fall
for that romantic aspect.

409
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,786
Coming here feels better
after all that trouble

410
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,871
and missing each other.

411
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,707
-We could've gone in the first matching.
-Yeah.

412
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,293
I still regret that so much.

413
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,631
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

414
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,216
Kim A-rin.

415
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,884
Thank you.

416
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,304
Jang Theo.

417
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,688
To me, that was the first…

418
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,316
Yeah, it was…

419
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,610
A shocking moment.

420
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,574
But now,

421
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,204
I don't have anyone I'm curious about
or want to initiate a conversation with.

422
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,206
I don't want to keep

423
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,918
thinking or pondering
about things anymore.

424
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,130
So I actually went and found you to talk

425
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,507
as soon as you got back.

426
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,509
"Hey, let's chat."

427
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,593
Really?

428
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,430
-I really had to muster the courage.
-I see.

429
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,017
Si-an and I decided to sit out front,
and that's when you came with Jeong-su.

430
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,229
So luckily, the four of us
sat down together.

431
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,438
That's right.

432
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,440
But since the four of us
were together,

433
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,361
I felt a bit shy about taking you aside.

434
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,364
Knocking on your door
already took a lot of courage for me.

435
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,157
It did. That was brave.

436
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,493
What surprised me at first was…

437
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,746
when our naive, innocent beast, Jun-seo…

438
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,331
Why did he sit there?

439
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,833
You didn't expect it either, right?

440
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,002
-In that situation…
-He had his toothbrush too.

441
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,545
-I would've left.
-Yeah.

442
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,172
But he surprisingly asked to sit,
and of course, he could.

443
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,090
Yeah.

444
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,425
Hey. Yo.

445
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,845
-What are you up to?
-Just talking.

446
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,013
-Really?
-Yeah.

447
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,222
Mind if I join?

448
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,474
-Make yourself comfortable.
-Okay.

449
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,642
What's happening?

450
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,937
-He was a bit clueless.
-Yeah.

451
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,775
He just sat right there
as if he was interviewing us.

452
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:04,114
I thought to myself,
"This isn't going to work out."

453
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,366
And as Jun-seo sat,
more people kept coming.

454
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,327
At that moment, I thought,
"It's over for me."

455
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,370
"Why does nothing ever go my way?"

456
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:15,292
I was so annoyed and upset
that I just walked out of the dining area.

457
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,588
We literally kept missing each other.
It was a winding road to get here.

458
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,592
They've come a long way.

459
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,509
They have.

460
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,803
I guess some people
are meant to cross paths.

461
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:27,846
It's so relaxing.

462
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,015
-Watching them lifted my spirits.
-Yes.

463
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,600
We have our first couple now.

464
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,517
-Right.
-Yes.

465
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,894
-Congratulations to them.
-Yes.

466
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,771
-Dong-ho and A-rin.
-Yes.

467
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,564
-I don't want to ruin the mood.
-Right.

468
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:41,985
But why do I keep thinking
Hae-lin and Dong-ho…

469
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,488
-There's this irresistible feel.
-There may be more there.

470
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,572
Yeah.

471
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,909
-Dong-ho couldn't get it together then.
-You're right.

472
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,203
-Things won't end smoothly like this.
-Yeah.

473
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,413
Dong-ho's feelings are key.

474
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,166
-You're hungry, right?
-I'm starving.

475
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,667
PARADISE
BAE JI-YEON & KIM TE-HWAN

476
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,504
-I'm hungry.
-I'm hungry.

477
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,798
-Let's eat. Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy.

478
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,053
Let's bring these plates closer.

479
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,640
Can you open it?

480
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,185
That scared me!

481
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,981
-That could've ended badly.
-Right.

482
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,525
He was born in 2003 for sure.

483
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,736
That scared me!

484
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,157
-Thanks. Right.
-I was surprised at how easily it opened.

485
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,410
Thank you.

486
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,288
Gosh, be careful.

487
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,540
Goodness!

488
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,795
-He's so cute!
-He's so cute.

489
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,839
We need to have a drink with Te-hwan.

490
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,173
I love them both.

491
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,138
So, should I go first?

492
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,223
-Do you want to?
-Are you curious?

493
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,684
Wait, I'm debating
whether to ask your age or job first.

494
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,601
Okay, choose.

495
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,019
Let's go one at a time.

496
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,646
-Sure.
-Then, our ages.

497
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,108
-So, my job is…
-Yeah.

498
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,985
I'm a designer.

499
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,903
-But…
-That suits you.

500
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,321
I'm a spatial designer.

501
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,994
I currently work as a spatial designer.

502
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,539
I arrange furniture
for events hosted by brands

503
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,499
to match their image and values.

504
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,920
I also contribute ideas
for their object designs.

505
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,508
BAE JI-YEON
SPATIAL DESIGNER

506
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,052
-What's your job?
-My job is…

507
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,264
-I'm a DJ.
-Okay.

508
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,600
I'm an artist
who produces electronic music.

509
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,726
Really?

510
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,019
And I also run a club.

511
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,520
-Really?
-Yeah.

512
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,230
-He's a DJ?
-A DJ?

513
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,274
-That's so unexpected.
-He runs a club?

514
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,525
He's a DJ?

515
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,321
I am a DJ.

516
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,490
I also run an underground club in Itaewon.

517
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,661
Unlike what most people expect
when they think of clubs,

518
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,788
ours focuses on house music.

519
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:04,544
This type of music and party culture
is still relatively new to Korea.

520
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,671
I want to lead the way in promoting it

521
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:11,509
so more people discover and enjoy
the music to make it more mainstream.

522
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,846
KIM TE-HWAN,
DJ AND CLUB OWNER

523
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,097
-Really?
-Yeah.

524
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,849
I never imagined that.

525
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,392
Pretty surprising, right?

526
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,061
-It's shocking.
-Doesn't suit me, right?

527
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,397
I never even imagined
that you make music,

528
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:28,276
because I thought you'd have…

529
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,403
a more laid-back job.

530
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,531
-You had no idea that I ran a club, right?
-Not at all.

531
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,075
-Not at all.
-Right.

532
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,078
But even after hearing this,
it's still hard to picture it.

533
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,162
-Right?
-Yeah.

534
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,498
-It just doesn't match.
-Yeah.

535
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,917
I'm curious about your age.

536
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,834
Take a guess.

537
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,255
-I'll tell you my age first.
-Sure.

538
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,217
Thirty-one?

539
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,552
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

540
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,054
-I'm right? Really?
-Yeah.

541
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,015
-What?
-What?

542
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,141
My goodness.

543
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,726
-He's older than we thought.
-He's 31?

544
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,644
Yeah.

545
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,688
-He's older than me.
-He's older.

546
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,982
We thought he'd be really young, like 22.

547
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:09,776
-Really?
-Yeah.

548
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,486
I actually thought you were around 30.

549
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,280
-What? Around 30?
-Thirty. Yeah.

550
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,323
Why did you add a year? That stings.

551
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,493
I'll take it back.

552
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,540
-Really? I was right?
-Yeah, I'm 31.

553
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,626
-I made it no fun and got it right away.
-Yeah.

554
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,712
-Let me try to guess your age.
-Okay.

555
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,464
Twenty…

556
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,926
seven.

557
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,177
Twenty-seven?

558
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,138
-Twenty-six.
-Twenty-six?

559
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,806
-Twenty-five.
-Twenty-five.

560
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,516
-I'm 25.
-Really?

561
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,851
-But…
-Yeah?

562
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,893
You have a mature vibe.

563
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,312
-Really?
-Yeah.

564
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,897
That's why I thought you were older.

565
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,524
I totally thought Ji-yeon was older.

566
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,775
-Seriously.
-Yeah.

567
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,527
We owe Te-hwan an apology.

568
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,195
-For real.
-We're sorry.

569
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,742
You talked a lot
with the game changer today, right?

570
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,411
-I talked a lot with the game changer?
-Yeah.

571
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,538
-The woman game changer?
-Yeah.

572
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,290
When we were eating earlier…

573
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,961
-Yeah.
-After the game, Hae-lin sat next to you.

574
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,129
EARLIER TODAY DURING LUNCH

575
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,882
What's this?
I've never seen this look before.

576
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,133
-Me? Really?
-Yeah.

577
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,135
You seem to like wearing glasses.

578
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,595
I did bring a lot of them.

579
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,680
They want you to take your sunglasses off.

580
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,099
They're cool though. What a shame.

581
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,142
It's a shame.

582
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,440
It bothered me a little.

583
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,568
I see.

584
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,903
-That's all.
-I see.

585
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,862
-A little.
-It did?

586
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,530
But not a lot. Just a little.

587
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,741
So I kept looking at you.

588
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,118
-But you never looked back.
-Right.

589
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,745
I thought, "Look at this guy."

590
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,163
"This is a little…"

591
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,666
I kept looking your way.

592
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,461
-And we made a lot of eye contact.
-Really?

593
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:55,131
I thought we were communicating
through telepathy.

594
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,216
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

595
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,597
It felt like Ji-yeon was a bit jealous,
so that was cute.

596
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,516
Whether it's Paradise or Inferno,

597
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,185
anywhere would be fine
as long as I'm with Ji-yeon.

598
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,106
Have you been to this ice rink before?

599
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,857
Yeah, I've been here before once.

600
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,443
Here they are.

601
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,403
Have a seat here.

602
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,409
How do you put these on?

603
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,537
-There it goes.
-Hold on.

604
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,955
You need to tighten the laces.

605
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,998
-That will protect your ankles.
-Okay.

606
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,625
Press your foot down a bit.

607
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,503
That's good.

608
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,796
They're super tight.

609
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,339
-Do they feel tight?
-Yeah.

610
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,591
-He's suddenly smooth with everything.
-Yeah.

611
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,343
He skates well too.

612
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,679
-Suddenly…
-And he does triple axels.

613
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,181
Well, he doesn't seem too athletic though.

614
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,141
Yeah.

615
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,809
Let's go.

616
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,148
-It's been a while.
-Hold on.

617
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,858
It's been so long since I last skated.

618
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,572
What do you think? I'm good, right?

619
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,282
-You are.
-Better than expected, right?

620
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,162
-Do I look like Yuna Kim?
-What?

621
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,581
-Do I look like Yuna Kim?
-Yeah, try a triple axel.

622
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,793
Like this?

623
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,045
You're good.

624
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,381
Let's play freeze tag.

625
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,383
-Run away.
-All right.

626
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,804
I'm scared!

627
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,316
That must've been fun.

628
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,986
-I love it.
-They look so innocent.

629
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,447
Wait. Pull me along.

630
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,991
Come here. Here we go.

631
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,493
-I'll stay still.
-Okay.

632
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,468
Are you pushing me from behind?

633
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,888
-You want me to pull you?
-Yeah.

634
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,312
Sir, you're too heavy.

635
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,566
-This is great.
-This feels nice.

636
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,776
Yeah, for real.

637
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,909
That soothed the soul.

638
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,995
Honestly, I feel like the two of them…

639
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,458
-We saw such a pure and innocent date.
-Right.

640
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,544
That made me so happy.

641
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:41,673
That might've been the most enviable date
I've seen so far on Single's Inferno.

642
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,841
-Really?
-Yes.

643
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,425
I loved it.

644
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,011
PARADISE
LEE SI-AN & YUK JUN-SEO

645
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,929
I'm cold.

646
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,848
Take out a jacket.

647
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,058
-I didn't bring any.
-You didn't?

648
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,101
Did I bring mine?

649
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,899
Darn, I only have this.

650
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,736
Want to put this on?

651
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,573
It's okay. I'll just drape it over me.

652
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,490
Yeah.

653
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,630
-You like it?
-Totally.

654
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,048
It looks good on you.

655
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,884
-This?
-Yeah.

656
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:26,801
It's yours.

657
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,304
I could never make this look good.

658
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,602
Do you like flowers?
I feel like you don't.

659
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,769
-I love them.
-Really?

660
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,687
Yeah.

661
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,404
Hey, do you have a side
you're more confident in?

662
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,907
I don't think you do.
You look similar from all angles.

663
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,867
-I don't care much.
-Really?

664
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,452
Why did you call me "Hey"?

665
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,162
-What?
-Why did you call me "Hey"?

666
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,079
You don't like it?

667
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,247
Call me "Si-an."

668
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,832
Okay, Si-an.

669
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,545
He's quick to adjust.

670
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,380
He corrected it right away.

671
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,799
It's a habit of mine. It drives me nuts.

672
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,803
It's become a habit.

673
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,057
"He loves me. He loves me not."

674
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,185
"He loves me. He loves me not."

675
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,489
Is there anyone else you'd like to
go on dates with when we get back?

676
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,703
I know everyone well enough now.

677
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,663
I don't think I'll gain
new interest in anyone.

678
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,998
-I see.
-Yeah.

679
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,918
You felt more mature to me today.

680
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,919
Really?

681
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,297
Yeah, when I'd see you on Inferno,

682
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,551
you just seemed like an athletic guy.

683
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,970
But today,

684
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,390
I saw more of your masculinity.

685
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,517
You're cool.

686
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,394
You looked cool with glasses on too.

687
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,770
-Really?
-Yeah.

688
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:45,982
Nice.

689
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,783
Everyone knows Theo has been pursuing you.

690
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,744
-Yeah.
-He's been going full steam ahead.

691
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,955
So I wanted to ask you

692
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,958
about your thoughts on him.

693
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,503
You mean how I feel about Theo?

694
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,421
Yeah.

695
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,597
Honestly…

696
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,349
-I like him.
-What?

697
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:21,934
-I like him.
-Okay.

698
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,607
I like him…

699
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,070
but as I said, I became confused today.

700
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,990
I like you too. But…

701
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,621
Jeong-su takes good care of me too.
You all do, so it makes my feelings grow.

702
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,874
But they keep changing every day.

703
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,546
-So I guess that is possible.
-Yeah.

704
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,465
-She's being really honest.
-Yeah.

705
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,301
You're the only one I'm sharing this with.

706
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,638
I don't talk about this much
even when other girls ask.

707
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,556
I can't talk about this
with the guys either.

708
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,267
Yeah, I just can't. It's so…

709
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,436
It's not liking one person.

710
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,773
Feeling attracted to several people
at the same time is…

711
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,067
-Yeah, it's strange.
-It's so strange.

712
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,652
It's unimaginable outside of here.

713
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,613
It's something
I've never experienced before.

714
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,864
It's kind of…

715
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,580
You like this guy, this guy, and that guy…

716
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,666
What do we do?

717
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:43,599
Well, Jeong-su is very polite
and has a kind demeanor.

718
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:47,103
I felt a lot of butterflies
in those moments.

719
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,488
With Theo, as he always is,

720
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:03,077
he shows his feelings
in a playful and cute way.

721
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,663
Let me see your ring.
And here's your flower ring.

722
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,249
Isn't it pretty?

723
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,048
Jun-seo has that tough guy vibe.

724
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,634
He's not exactly the warm and tender type,

725
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,181
but he has that mature energy
with strong leadership.

726
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm so confused.

727
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,069
I think I can understand how she feels.

728
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,031
For example,
if Cha Eun-woo said he liked me,

729
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,158
then I'd be thrilled.

730
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,535
But the next day,
if Park Bo-gum said he liked me,

731
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,703
I'd probably like him too.

732
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,039
And the day after that,
Byeon Woo-seok says he likes you.

733
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,958
Seriously. I'd be so confused.

734
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,712
-It must be like that.
-I get it.

735
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,755
I really do.

736
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,756
I see.

737
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,591
It's not easy to admit that though.

738
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,676
I think Si-an is a truly honest person.

739
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,594
Right.

740
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:06,599
And Jun-seo kept composed in front of her.

741
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,892
-Right.
-He kept cool.

742
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:08,809
Yeah.

743
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,561
He had that mature vibe.

744
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,731
But are her feelings
split evenly among the guys?

745
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,107
Do you think that's the case?

746
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,317
-I'm curious too.
-Right.

747
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,569
Can you have
the same equal feelings for everyone?

748
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,239
-It's possible to be interested.
-They can't be equal, right?

749
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,782
For me, they can't be equal.

750
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,159
Right now,
I like Byeon Woo-seok the most.

751
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,370
Just like her…

752
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,664
-The others are…
-You watched his drama recently.

753
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,625
I don't think Si-an has split
her feelings equally either.

754
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,876
-Yeah.
-Right.

755
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,963
-She's drawn to whoever she's with.
-More to who she's with?

756
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,506
Think about this too.

757
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,008
If I were one of those three guys,

758
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:46,097
I could give up after hearing this
and let go of her.

759
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,014
-Right.
-Yeah.

760
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,849
But none of them are giving up.

761
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,559
All three think,

762
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,230
"I may be just one of the three options,
but I still want to go for it."

763
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,316
Si-an must have that kind of charm.

764
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,276
-I guess so.
-Right.

765
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,530
But since Si-an keeps
getting confused and swayed,

766
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,740
it makes them hold on even more.

767
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,867
Men have that desire
to win a woman's heart.

768
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,121
-Maybe they think trying harder will work.
-Right.

769
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,914
Si-an…

770
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,293
-I can smell the pool!
-You're right.

771
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,003
PARADISE
KIM A-RIN & KOOK DONG-HO

772
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,005
-Hurry up.
-Yes, it's deep.

773
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,008
I need to tiptoe.

774
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,093
It's really deep.

775
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,013
Hold onto me.

776
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:27,930
Goodness.

777
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,933
Keep your feet off the bottom.

778
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,066
I'll just do what I did
earlier during the game.

779
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,944
Wait for me. You got sunburnt a lot.

780
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:42,987
Right?

781
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,864
There's already a tan line.

782
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,449
My chest was really burnt too.

783
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,409
Right.

784
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,130
This is nice. Come over here.

785
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,257
-I'll try.
-Okay.

786
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,425
Be brave.

787
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,720
How's this?

788
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,389
How's this?

789
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,058
You're like a puppy.

790
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,810
I want to get better at the dog paddle.

791
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,314
That way, I can survive in the water.

792
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,400
You look calm above water.

793
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,486
-Yeah.
-But you're working so hard below.

794
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,988
I want to stay afloat for a long time.

795
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,325
-Cute.
-They get along well together.

796
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,160
Yeah, this feels right.

797
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,913
I think it'll work if I practice a bit.

798
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:34,955
-It's a bit…
-How is it?

799
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,505
I want to try staying afloat too.

800
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,717
-Then, hold onto me and try.
-Okay.

801
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,552
Follow me as you kick.

802
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,138
-But don't tense up. Relax your hands.
-Okay.

803
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,265
-Trust me and float.
-Okay.

804
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,934
Keep coming forward.

805
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,894
Kick, kick.

806
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,354
Excuse me, I'm sinking.

807
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,189
You arms are too heavy.

808
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,983
-I'll try to relax.
-Yeah, don't tense up.

809
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:03,901
You have to help me.

810
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,319
-Hold on.
-I'll relax.

811
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,320
-Okay.
-Okay.

812
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,489
-Okay. Right.
-Relax and go.

813
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,907
-Follow me.
-Let's go.

814
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,158
All the way.

815
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,160
I'll just keep sinking like this.

816
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,581
Let's go again.
I'll hold you up this time.

817
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,876
This feels so different from Inferno.

818
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,089
Let's compare our arm lengths.

819
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,883
-Lean on the wall.
-My arms are long.

820
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:28,843
Mine are really long.

821
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,970
-Arm length…
-Wait.

822
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,639
-He did this with Hae-lin.
-He measured it with her.

823
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,266
This is weird.

824
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,350
Aren't my arms long?

825
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,852
Mine are longer. Look.

826
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,603
Of course, they should be longer.

827
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,313
-You're 20 cm taller.
-Since I'm taller?

828
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,401
What else did you want to do here?

829
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,027
-I'm sure…
-I…

830
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,487
…you had something in mind.

831
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,490
I just wanted to talk with you a lot.

832
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,285
-And swim?
-That was the biggest thing.

833
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,328
Yeah, and swim too.

834
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,086
I'm scared.

835
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,300
Here too. Okay.

836
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:20,436
When we go back tomorrow,
that feeling of emptiness will hit hard.

837
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,188
You pack up and head out,

838
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,815
only to end up back on Inferno.

839
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,192
That doesn't bother you?

840
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,860
Nope, it doesn't bother me now.

841
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,571
What do you mean by "now"?
You have no regrets?

842
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,115
Yeah, I've been in Inferno long enough.

843
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,826
I came to Paradise
with the person I want to be with.

844
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,787
And we'll have plenty
of opportunities to talk going forward.

845
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,749
Now, I don't think
the location will matter to me.

846
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,422
Do you think

847
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,300
we'll get to come again
after another game?

848
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,470
Or would there be
one last round of matching?

849
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,763
What's your prediction?

850
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,307
You must have a feeling
since we've been here.

851
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,226
I'm sure they'll have
the guys play a game.

852
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,521
I think the winner will get to choose
and come here again.

853
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,815
-But then, if you don't…
-You say this now…

854
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,317
But what if it's a women's game?

855
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,360
I know, right?

856
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,946
No way.

857
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,700
-Are you still confident though?
-Yeah.

858
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,953
Then, do your best
and take me with you.

859
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,793
-What did you say?
-What?

860
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,586
Look at her face.

861
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,754
She's in love.

862
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,757
Do you want some beer?

863
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,092
Okay.

864
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,308
Cheers.

865
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,439
Do you eat proper meals at home?
I mean, you live alone.

866
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,818
In the past, I used to cook,
because I wanted to.

867
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,779
But I don't anymore.

868
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,114
It's hard due to work.

869
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,200
-Are you a good cook?
-Yeah.

870
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,203
I can make almost anything I want to eat.

871
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,913
Really?

872
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,748
I even make my own kimchi.

873
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,918
That's amazing.

874
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,086
But you know,

875
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,757
that's an incredible charm.

876
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,385
-You can make kimchi?
-My charm?

877
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,178
If being a good cook is a charm,

878
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,224
you should be able to make
something like pasta for it to count.

879
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,602
But what I'm good at making is pa-kimchi.

880
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,480
Cook for me next time.

881
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,733
Make me some pa-kimchi.

882
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,611
It seems like you want
a home-cooked meal.

883
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:39,533
Since I'm at that age now, I do things
with the possibility of marriage in mind.

884
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,076
-Me too.
-Yeah.

885
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,870
Just assume we're getting married for now.

886
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,420
It's because you're fixated
on the pa-kimchi, right? You want some?

887
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,755
Fine, I'll make you some.

888
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,757
I'll deliver it right to your door.

889
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,302
-Just assume we're getting married.
-No.

890
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:02,264
-I feel so embarrassed right now.
-What's there to be embarrassed about?

891
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,683
You have this way of annoying people.

892
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,853
Now I see why everyone says
you have to come here.

893
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,440
It's fun teasing you
and watching your reactions.

894
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,817
Is this why people go
for younger partners?

895
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,492
They look very comfortable,

896
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,494
and it seems
they've quickly grown close, right?

897
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,578
-You're right.
-Yeah.

898
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,414
When Dong-ho is with A-rin,
he clearly takes the lead.

899
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,415
Yeah.

900
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,044
But with Hae-lin,
he seems unsure of what to do.

901
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,923
It makes me think
that if Hae-lin makes a strong move,

902
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,217
Dong-ho might lose his composure again.

903
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,677
-It feels like it.
-I think so too.

904
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,636
-Yeah.
-I agree.

905
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,346
Dong-ho expresses himself a lot.

906
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,390
But strangely, what we all sense is…

907
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,225
-We feel uneasy.
-That's right.

908
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,102
It feels like

909
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,980
there's a dark cloud
looming in the background.

910
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,150
-I don't think he's fully certain yet.
-I agree.

911
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,778
-Still, they do look like a good couple.
-Yes.

912
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,196
PARADISE
LEE SI-AN & YUK JUN-SEO

913
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,782
-Don't drink too much or you'll get drunk.
-Okay.

914
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,919
Hey, these snacks are so good
I keep eating them.

915
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,046
Stop calling me "Hey."

916
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,590
-Call me by my name.
-Si-an.

917
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,802
I'm not used to calling people's names.

918
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,054
I like it when people call me by my name.

919
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,722
-Okay, Si-an.
-Yeah.

920
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,475
But do you know what I'll end up doing?

921
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,228
"Hey, Si-an."

922
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,730
-That's fine.
-Is that okay?

923
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,902
How often do you usually see
your girlfriend when you're dating?

924
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,903
-Me?
-Yeah.

925
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,030
Once a week…

926
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,782
That's so infrequent.

927
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,284
At least once a week.

928
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,120
I make sure it's at least once a week.

929
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,037
-I see.
-Yeah.

930
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,748
I'd make time to see her
at least once a week.

931
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,378
-What did you usually argue about?
-What we argued about?

932
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,840
Well, I'm pretty stubborn.

933
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,176
Yeah, so sometimes,

934
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,512
I didn't consider
their thoughts or perspective.

935
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,098
-And I pushed for what I wanted.
-What you wanted…

936
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,685
It's something I need to work on.

937
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:16,482
I think that made things tough
for the other person.

938
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,275
I feel like you'd argue a lot.

939
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,944
But I don't think arguing is a bad thing.

940
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,779
-Right. Of course not.
-Right?

941
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,114
Having arguments

942
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:28,368
helps you understand
yourself and each other better.

943
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,955
-Right.
-I think that's how it was for me.

944
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,500
Still, even if you argue a lot,

945
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:38,420
you can only learn certain things
about yourself by being in a relationship.

946
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,422
You won't know any other way.

947
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:44,760
I've experienced many times where it took
a partner to learn more about myself.

948
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,263
What kind of relationship
do you want then?

949
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,932
-The relationship I want?
-Yeah.

950
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:54,978
Being with the person I want to be with
is probably the most important thing.

951
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,104
-That's true.
-Yeah.

952
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:03,153
If that part works out smoothly,
everything else will figure itself out.

953
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,572
Follow your heart.

954
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:10,327
By the way, I feel like
it's the easiest to talk to you.

955
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,120
-Really?
-Totally.

956
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,666
-I really feel like…
-Yeah?

957
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,334
I'm having a natural conversation.

958
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,378
Right.

959
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,092
-But normally…
-Yeah?

960
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,470
I never ask anyone things like this.

961
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,639
But can I ask…

962
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,641
-You can.
-I can, right?

963
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,352
-Of course.
-I'm actually a little curious.

964
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,814
What did you think of me
when we first met,

965
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,482
and what do you think now?

966
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:48,574
At first, honestly,
I wasn't interested at all.

967
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,325
But…

968
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:55,080
For some reason, you were the only one
I hadn't really talked with,

969
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,584
and you wouldn't talk to me
outside the designated times for talking.

970
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,501
Yeah.

971
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:01,837
So…

972
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,798
that made me curious.

973
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,925
I wanted to talk and get to know you.

974
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,219
-That was my first thought.
-Right.

975
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,637
And after we became close…

976
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,641
you turned out to be so different.

977
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,144
-In a good way.
-Right.

978
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,189
But…

979
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,068
I also thought I should go
to Paradise with you at least once.

980
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,404
And now that we're here…

981
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,907
It's great.

982
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:31,825
Yeah.

983
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,620
-I've become attracted.
-Right.

984
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,581
-It's interesting and confusing.
-I see.

985
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,207
Right.

986
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,210
I think I feel the same.

987
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,632
Today,

988
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,093
it felt like a genuine date to me.

989
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,182
Driving to our destination together,

990
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,936
going to dinner, and coming back here.

991
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,731
This actually feels like a real date.

992
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,399
-Really?
-Yeah.

993
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,235
I love this.

994
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,283
It all felt real.

995
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,744
When I talk with you,

996
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,246
it feels like…

997
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,290
I'm becoming more like myself.

998
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,086
I'm relaxed and honest.

999
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,087
That's true.

1000
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:28,840
I just end up talking
without overthinking.

1001
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,175
But that's…

1002
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,761
who I really am.

1003
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,471
I see.

1004
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,060
That's why I think
our conversations flow so much better.

1005
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,353
Really? That's good to hear.

1006
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:45,107
But I personally feel like
you still seem to have a lot on your mind.

1007
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,069
I do.

1008
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,406
The reason is

1009
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:56,451
I have a lot of things
I'm concerned about.

1010
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,727
What are you thinking right now?

1011
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,478
My eyes feel so dry.

1012
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,980
-Your eyes feel dry?
-Yeah.

1013
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:29,568
And?

1014
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,280
It's nice here.

1015
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,866
And?

1016
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,744
It's really nice here.

1017
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,009
I just want…

1018
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,724
I'm being sincere when I say this.

1019
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,437
You don't have to pick me.

1020
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,814
But I just want you to be genuine.

1021
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,940
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1022
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,318
Don't say things like,
"It's nice. It's really nice."

1023
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,822
Maybe you could say,
"Someone else is on my mind."

1024
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,241
Or "I keep thinking about them."

1025
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,912
I'd prefer it if you said
things like that instead.

1026
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:22,829
Okay.

1027
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,376
Just because it's the two of us here,

1028
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,838
that doesn't mean you need to hide
or sugarcoat your feelings.

1029
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,756
Okay.

1030
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,467
It looks like you have a lot on your mind.

1031
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,344
On my mind? No, I'm just tired.

1032
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:42,098
You feel good even though you're tired
and drinking like this?

1033
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,476
I don't think so.

1034
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,728
That's the thing.

1035
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,981
It feels good,
and that's why I'm confused.

1036
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,901
-You know?
-Explain that.

1037
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,239
I've been coming to Paradise often,

1038
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,575
and my feelings keep changing every day.

1039
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,493
Right.

1040
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,120
Up until yesterday,
I was sure I wasn't interested,

1041
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,414
but after coming here,
I started to like you.

1042
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,835
-Yeah.
-And seeing myself like that confused me.

1043
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,549
Out of us three,
who do you like the most?

1044
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,100
Right now, it's Theo.

1045
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,811
-Theo?
-Yeah.

1046
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,146
And the reason?

1047
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,151
Why Theo?

1048
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,863
He expresses his feelings a lot.

1049
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,536
He expresses his feelings a lot and…

1050
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,713
I keep thinking about him.

1051
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,725
Exactly, that's what I wanted you to say.

1052
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,193
Gosh.

1053
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:23,533
But being here has made my feelings grow,
and it's really confusing.

1054
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,869
That's what I wanted to express.

1055
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,777
-What is it?
-What?

1056
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,694
What's wrong?

1057
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,738
I don't know.

1058
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,838
-I must be drunk.
-Why are you crying?

1059
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:19,839
I don't know.

1060
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:28,932
Don't cry.

1061
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,186
-I don't know. I guess I'm tired.
-Here.

1062
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,940
My feelings are all over the place.

1063
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,486
I think I get it.
You don't have to say it.

1064
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:46,324
It must be so overwhelming.

1065
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,558
I need to use the restroom.

1066
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,939
Seriously, it's so tough.

1067
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,071
Just speak your mind.

1068
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,824
-And if you cry, let it all out.
-No, it's not that…

1069
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:32,245
I'm like this because I'm not even sure
about my own feelings.

1070
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:33,163
I see.

1071
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,790
Go away now. Go.

1072
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:42,047
I can't stop crying.

1073
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,060
I think my heart
was just hurting a little bit.

1074
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:59,397
Honestly, seeing myself
be indecisive like that…

1075
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,275
I didn't like that.

1076
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,779
And it felt like I was a person
with no backbone.

1077
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:10,784
But at the same time, I thought,
"It's understandable to feel this way."

1078
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,453
"These are my genuine feelings."

1079
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,122
My mind was in disarray.

1080
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,957
That's when Jun-seo helped me

1081
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,460
release those pent-up emotions.

1082
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,007
Those were deep talks over drinks.

1083
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,760
I see what Si-an is going through now.

1084
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,844
She's thinking,

1085
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:35,100
"I like this guy and that guy.
And now, a third guy? What's with me?"

1086
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,310
She's experiencing this sort of confusion.

1087
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,853
She thinks, "I shouldn't do this."

1088
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,107
But this is Single's Inferno after all.

1089
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,109
It's a place
where they don't have phones,

1090
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,277
and they're confined there to only date.

1091
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:50,115
So she's doing things
she wouldn't normally do,

1092
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,659
and that's making her confused
and feel conflicted.

1093
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,912
The fact that I can understand
Si-an to some degree

1094
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,789
makes me feel so confused.

1095
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,292
This is confusing everyone.

1096
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,169
-I'm so confused.
-We're all confused.

1097
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,420
On one hand, I get it.

1098
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,922
This isn't a normal environment.

1099
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:06,840
-Yeah.
-That's true.

1100
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,552
She came to Paradise with Jun-seo
while her mind was in disarray.

1101
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,275
Gosh.

1102
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:28,945
-Still…
-Yeah?

1103
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,864
-While talking with you…
-Yeah.

1104
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,953
I think I was able to
understand my feelings.

1105
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,455
-Really?
-Yeah.

1106
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,336
I feel more at ease.

1107
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:46,838
Thanks.

1108
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,260
I'm just…

1109
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,346
I'm just going to follow my heart.

1110
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,306
Okay.

1111
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:05,899
I never imagined
this would happen within ten days.

1112
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,328
Still, don't think
or worry about it too much.

1113
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,497
-Yeah, I truly feel…
-You and I…

1114
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,749
You and I will come here one more time.

1115
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,593
Yuk.

1116
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,597
That was a statement
filled with immense confidence.

1117
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,015
It feels like

1118
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:42,310
I'm eavesdropping on a conversation
next to me at a cart bar.

1119
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,020
Yeah.

1120
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,397
It doesn't make logical sense, but…

1121
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,525
It's clear Jun-seo really likes her.

1122
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,235
-He likes her more than you think.
-Yeah.

1123
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,152
You're right.

1124
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:55,490
Looking back at Si-an's initial interview,

1125
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,617
she mentioned being someone
who's easily swayed.

1126
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,161
So she said she wanted
a steadfast, supportive partner

1127
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,288
who would patiently wait for her.

1128
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,374
If you think about it,

1129
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:09,212
Jun-seo comforted her in that situation
and said they'll come here together again…

1130
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:13,174
It seems Si-an's heart
has opened up a bit more.

1131
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,759
But…

1132
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,720
I kept thinking
that being in a relationship

1133
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,515
with someone like her
could be a bit risky.

1134
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:24,686
If her feelings change that frequently
according to the situation,

1135
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,397
and if I was her partner,

1136
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,567
I'd feel a bit uneasy and worried.

1137
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,945
But since no one has actually
started to date anyone yet,

1138
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,989
and they're all
in the contemplating stage,

1139
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:40,034
I think it's reasonable
to continue to think about that here.

1140
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,829
When she said she was able to
understand her feelings,

1141
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,498
it didn't mean
she decided on a specific person.

1142
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,668
She just settled on the mindset
of doing what she wants.

1143
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,169
-Right?
-I think so.

1144
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,380
She's like, "Whatever.
I'm going to follow my heart."

1145
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,464
"I'm just going to…"

1146
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,508
Hasn't she always been like that?

1147
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:57,760
No, seriously.

1148
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:01,222
Up until now, she's gone on dates
with people she was drawn to.

1149
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,974
She's always followed her heart.

1150
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:05,393
But now, the difference is she's…

1151
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:06,978
-Did she feel guilty?
-She did.

1152
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:07,937
But now she doesn't.

1153
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,022
-No guilt.
-Right.

1154
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,607
-"Why would I?"
-None at all.

1155
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,984
"I didn't come here
to worry about what others think."

1156
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,152
Right.

1157
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,320
-Who knows?
-It's confusing.

1158
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,280
We don't know Si-an feels either.

1159
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,449
Let's go talk.

1160
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,575
-Talk?
-How about it? Yeah.

1161
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:21,618
-Let's go.
-Sure.

1162
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:23,995
-Follow me.
-What?

1163
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,913
It feels like a secret hideout.

1164
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,374
-I've actually forgotten
-What?

1165
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:32,170
-When we went to Paradise that time…
-Yeah.

1166
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,505
Now, that feels like it was ages ago.

1167
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,257
-Right?
-Totally. Yeah.

1168
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,092
When you left…

1169
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,011
-Yeah?
-I kind of forgot about you.

1170
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:46,601
The thing I'm most curious about is
how you're feeling now.

1171
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,020
I've also kind of…

1172
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,648
lost my direction.

1173
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:57,111
From what I can see, you're being…

1174
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:00,323
You're being too nice to everyone.

1175
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,908
-I see.
-To everyone.

1176
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:05,036
It feels like you're being nice
to everyone in the same way.

1177
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:08,331
-Well, my personality is…
-Seriously.

1178
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:09,957
Yeah?

1179
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:15,254
Whether they're men or women,
I want to take care of them a little.

1180
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:20,093
But if you do that with everyone,

1181
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,137
you know how it is.

1182
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,807
It can be confusing.

1183
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,520
-It's confusing?
-Yeah.

1184
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:31,437
Really?

1185
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,315
Don't you think people
would feel that way?

1186
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,526
Yeah.

1187
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,403
Right?

1188
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:41,656
I guess so.

1189
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,034
What do you mean?

1190
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,286
"I guess so."

1191
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:49,831
Right.

1192
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,171
Yeah.

1193
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,132
Right.

1194
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:03,344
So, who's your top pick?

1195
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,638
-My top pick?
-Yeah.

1196
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:10,935
For me…

1197
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,521
It's Si-an.

1198
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,566
Really?

1199
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:20,695
I thought that would be the case.

1200
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,371
I'm not great at multitasking.

1201
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,124
So for now,

1202
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,963
I want to get to know Si-an better.

1203
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,131
-Sure.
-Yeah.

1204
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,716
-That's why…
-Do as you wish.

1205
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,343
-I want to get to know her.
-Yeah.

1206
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:48,514
Whether that's the right choice or not,
I don't know.

1207
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,600
I'm going to keep it simple.

1208
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:51,684
Okay.

1209
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,187
Good job.

1210
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,188
Thanks.

1211
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,316
I'll cheer you on.

1212
01:02:58,399 --> 01:02:59,984
I'll cheer you on too.

1213
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,988
It feels like they're not though.

1214
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,825
But in the midst of all that,
he's being honest.

1215
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,368
-Right.
-He was straightforward.

1216
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,495
-Yes.
-It wasn't confusing.

1217
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,412
-Yes.
-Right.

1218
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,580
He did a good job.

1219
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,792
Let's go now.

1220
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:16,876
-Why?
-What?

1221
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,127
Why?

1222
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,087
I've heard and said everything now.

1223
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,005
I see.

1224
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,802
-What?
-What?

1225
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,054
What? I mean…

1226
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,139
Let's go back and hang out.

1227
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,809
Why? Let's hang out here,
just the two of us.

1228
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,645
Just go back. That's enough.

1229
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:39,357
-What else are you going to do?
-What's the point?

1230
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,442
Let's go back and hang out.

1231
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,945
Why? Let's hang out here,
just the two of us.

1232
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,905
-What are you doing?
-What?

1233
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,740
See? You're doing it again.

1234
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:48,950
What?

1235
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:52,829
Jeez.

1236
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,458
-Should we go back?
-What?

1237
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,709
Should we go back?

1238
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,712
If you have nothing more to say, let's go.
Let's go.

1239
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,172
I have a lot to say though.

1240
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,800
-Don't do that!
-Stop!

1241
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:09,053
-Yeah, that's the problem with Jeong-su.
-He needs to get up.

1242
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,513
I have a lot to say though.

1243
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,641
Stop lying. Jeez.

1244
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,603
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1245
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,107
I was getting a little angry
during that conversation.

1246
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:26,529
Jeong-su did show
a lot of interest in me.

1247
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:29,574
That's why I was really confused.

1248
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:32,285
But he told me
Si-an was his top pick.

1249
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,162
After talking with Jeong-su that night,

1250
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:39,083
I decided to focus only on Jong-hoon now.

1251
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:42,336
My feelings shifted a bit.

1252
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,755
Did I make it confusing?

1253
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,383
She said I did.

1254
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,051
Honestly…

1255
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:54,307
I'm not someone who's worth
having your feelings hurt over.

1256
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:58,769
That's why I tried to soften my words.

1257
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:04,191
I guess that could be
why she felt confused.

1258
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:05,985
Jeong-su…

1259
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,529
-What's with him?
-Jeong-su.

1260
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:09,947
Jeong-su.

1261
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:13,117
When two people
aren't interested in each other,

1262
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,202
rather than saying things in a nice way,

1263
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,497
just communicating clearly
is more respectful.

1264
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,750
The last words he said
were so unnecessary.

1265
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,711
He said, "Let's stay and talk more,
just the two of us."

1266
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:24,921
-What's the point?
-Right.

1267
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:28,382
-What do you mean "Why?" Just go.
-He likes someone else. So why stay?

1268
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,885
If I were to try
and understand it from his view,

1269
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:34,597
they'll have to see each other
for the next three or four days.

1270
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,766
So instead of having things
end so awkwardly…

1271
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:38,309
You're trying too hard.

1272
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:39,977
-He…
-To not make it uncomfortable…

1273
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:42,021
He didn't want things
to become uncomfortable.

1274
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,440
Don't we smell nice though?

1275
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,484
What's on your mind?

1276
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,819
Nothing's on my mind.
I just need some confidence.

1277
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,404
Confidence? Okay.

1278
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,116
I've been wanting to ask.

1279
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,660
Let's say there's someone you like,

1280
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,245
and you see them
choose someone else.

1281
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,247
Do you feel okay with that?

1282
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,165
-Me?
-Yeah.

1283
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:03,417
Yeah.
Well, it's not that I'm okay with it.

1284
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,587
When Si-an and I
went to Paradise at first,

1285
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,924
we talked about how spending
one day with me wouldn't make her say

1286
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,510
that she was in love with me
and only had eyes for me.

1287
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,637
I told her that wouldn't be believable.

1288
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,181
I'd rather let her meet everyone
and realize that I'm the one.

1289
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,016
-That would make me feel better.
-Yeah.

1290
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,060
That's what I told her. What about you?

1291
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,061
-Me?
-Yeah.

1292
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:28,067
Honestly, I feel like
I can express myself better now.

1293
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,860
-Yeah.
-But it's a bit…

1294
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,946
-You feel a bit…
-It's depressing.

1295
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:34,156
I suddenly felt so down.

1296
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,950
-I see.
-I was sad about the situation.

1297
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:40,121
But A-rin was right next to me.

1298
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,248
That's her bed.

1299
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,500
But who knows? There's tomorrow.

1300
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,002
And you have the day after that.

1301
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:47,795
Be aggressive.

1302
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:51,340
Just ask him later how it was
and if he wants to talk.

1303
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:54,176
You do it so naturally!

1304
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,054
But that's the difficult part.

1305
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:01,434
You'll be even more natural
with your facial expressions and tone.

1306
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,519
Seriously.

1307
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:06,981
I can do well
when I feel comfortable like this.

1308
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,482
-Right.
-But then, with Dong-ho…

1309
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,484
I'm stiff and robotic.

1310
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:14,238
"How was Paradise?"

1311
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:17,658
"Can we go and talk?"

1312
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:24,040
She's really let herself go.

1313
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,125
She's even showing us her acting.

1314
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,626
-Right?
-Gosh.

1315
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,962
We're seeing
a more human side of You-jin now.

1316
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,047
Right.

1317
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,631
She's revealing her true self.

1318
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,259
You need to be brave too.

1319
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:37,470
I mean, there shouldn't be any regrets.

1320
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:41,098
This is serious.
Tomorrow marks the start of the war.

1321
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,184
I feel like we'll keep
making eye contact tomorrow.

1322
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,569
What are you doing?

1323
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,447
I was so lonely.

1324
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,616
-Why are you alone?
-Were you alone?

1325
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,410
-Let's hang out.
-I was reading.

1326
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,454
-Let's hang out together.
-All right.

1327
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,460
Are you still drinking water?

1328
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,797
You still drinking water?

1329
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,798
Are you drunk?

1330
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:15,925
No.

1331
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,636
I think this was my cup.

1332
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,221
Why is You-jin so funny?

1333
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,263
-I'm funny?
-Yeah.

1334
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,557
I don't want to be the funny one.

1335
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:27,061
-You're Donald Duck starting from today.
-Me?

1336
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,439
My friends are always like…

1337
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,941
-Exactly.
-Did you two talk?

1338
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:33,692
We haven't yet. Want to talk?

1339
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:34,777
-Go and talk.
-Okay.

1340
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,861
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1341
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,822
-You're not tired?
-I'm tired, but…

1342
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,491
-Yeah, if you're tired, then…
-It's okay. We can talk.

1343
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,410
I want some water too.

1344
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,162
Let's get some water first then.

1345
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:50,000
Can I ask who you picked
for Paradise earlier?

1346
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:50,918
Me?

1347
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,837
Should we keep it a secret?

1348
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,258
-Si-an.
-Si-an.

1349
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,558
Well, it's because
I wanted to talk a bit more.

1350
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:07,601
Right now,

1351
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:12,606
I've felt interest in two people.

1352
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,524
Yeah.

1353
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:16,527
I want to confirm those feelings.

1354
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:21,949
Yesterday, I spent time with you,
and it was really fun.

1355
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:24,451
You were my ideal type
in terms of appearance.

1356
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,162
You told me this.

1357
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,121
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1358
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:30,708
I like you,
but I'm not good at multitasking.

1359
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,334
So the next plan

1360
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,838
was to spend time with Si-an.

1361
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:36,755
I see.

1362
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,383
That's why I chose Si-an today.

1363
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,970
-I can see that.
-I'm in the middle of that.

1364
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:43,888
Yeah.

1365
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,724
So I'm confused right now too.

1366
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:48,142
-You must be.
-Yeah.

1367
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,687
What's Si-an's charm then?

1368
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,023
Her personality?

1369
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:56,025
Do we have any differences?

1370
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,402
You're completely different.

1371
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,906
How is she different?

1372
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:02,907
What?

1373
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,575
-With you…
-Yeah.

1374
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,493
I have the urge to take care of you.

1375
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:07,870
I see.

1376
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:09,288
I want to do more for you.

1377
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:11,248
But?

1378
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,418
What's the difference?

1379
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,171
But you want to take care of her too?

1380
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:23,552
I think she weighs on my mind.

1381
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,387
What is he going on about?

1382
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:29,892
I think she weighs on my mind.

1383
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,478
Weighs on your mind?

1384
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,816
I don't understand what that feeling is.

1385
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,151
What?

1386
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,945
I don't know what that feeling is.

1387
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:48,619
I still have no idea right now.

1388
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:53,123
I was curious about the flip side.

1389
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,125
I wondered if you had feelings for me.

1390
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,795
I wasn't wondering
if you only had feelings for me.

1391
01:10:57,878 --> 01:11:00,798
I wondered if you had
feelings for who I was.

1392
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:06,845
Because from what I've seen,
you're caring and attentive.

1393
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:10,349
-That was very confusing for me.
-I see.

1394
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,851
So I was a bit confused.

1395
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:17,106
I'm not that attentive to the others.

1396
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,857
Really? Was I mistaken then?

1397
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,527
You were super nice to everyone.

1398
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,531
That's why I was curious.

1399
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:30,828
I'm cold.

1400
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:32,246
-Are you cold?
-Yeah.

1401
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,331
Do you want my jacket?

1402
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,833
No, it's okay.

1403
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,462
I'm actually feeling hot.

1404
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:41,380
Really?

1405
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,387
Really? Tell me if you get cold.

1406
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,680
Yeah, I'll let you know.

1407
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:50,973
Seriously.

1408
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,184
I should've slept for 30 minutes more.

1409
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,269
Go sleep.

1410
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:56,186
Go to bed.

1411
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,816
-Go and sleep.
-No…

1412
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:04,403
I feel a bit out of it to be honest.

1413
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:05,821
Let's go to bed then.

1414
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,740
Now.

1415
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,533
But that would be a shame.

1416
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,661
There he goes again.

1417
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,580
If you feel out of it,
you shouldn't hang out.

1418
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,165
-You should go in and sleep.
-Yes.

1419
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:18,542
But that would be a shame.

1420
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,338
-Don't you think?
-I don't get you.

1421
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,714
-Me?
-Yeah.

1422
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:25,924
The things you say are all over the place.

1423
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:29,720
Really?

1424
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,221
Yeah, you tend to do that.

1425
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,142
I don't like being confused.

1426
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,896
I told you clearly
so there wouldn't be any confusion.

1427
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:40,856
When?

1428
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,192
-When?
-No?

1429
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,278
He's so annoying.

1430
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,821
Look at Hae-lin's face.

1431
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:54,912
I don't know if you want to talk
or hang out right now.

1432
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:57,790
No, I do want to hang out and stay longer.

1433
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,334
But in my current state,

1434
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:04,463
I'm worried I might be
a bother to you since I'm so out of it.

1435
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,048
-That's what I'm thinking.
-Then…

1436
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:13,972
If Jeong-su just admitted
that he's really interested in Si-an,

1437
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,850
it would've been admirable.

1438
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,853
But speaking vaguely
isn't the type of thing I like.

1439
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:25,025
To Hae-lin as well…

1440
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:29,696
I thought I needed to
clearly express my feelings.

1441
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:34,118
So I told her that I liked Si-an more.

1442
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:35,369
I was clear about that.

1443
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:37,746
Was that not clear either?

1444
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,251
But that's not what he said.

1445
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:43,919
He said, "I chose Si-an today."

1446
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:45,838
"But I enjoyed my time with you too."

1447
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,131
"So between the two of you…"

1448
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:48,549
-Right.
-"I like you both."

1449
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:50,175
So I don't think it was clear.

1450
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,303
He communicated things
pretty clearly to Hye-jin.

1451
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:56,223
But I don't think
he was that clear with Hae-lin.

1452
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:59,226
Or maybe he wanted to convey
why he had chosen Si-an.

1453
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:01,520
But after that, he spoke in a daze.

1454
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,647
-Because he was out of it.
-Yes.

1455
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,817
Perhaps those words
didn't have any much meaning?

1456
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,112
Okay, guys. Wanting to care for
and being concerned for someone.

1457
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,071
It's the same, right?

1458
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:12,489
It's the same thing.

1459
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:13,949
-Those words…
-Yes?

1460
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:15,492
He made them up on the spot.

1461
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,119
"Made up"!

1462
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:18,704
-Yeah, I think so too.
-Really?

1463
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,415
As he kept talking,
he just started freestyling.

1464
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:22,875
-"Freestyling."
-Seriously.

1465
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,918
-It was a slip of the tongue.
-Right.

1466
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,337
-There's no reason to analyze those words.
-Yeah.

1467
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,840
To put it in another way,

1468
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,842
it's the same as asking the difference

1469
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,261
between liking someone
and having a crush on them.

1470
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:35,888
It's something like that.

1471
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,473
Why did Jeong-su do that?

1472
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,808
But if all the women are saying that…

1473
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,352
That really means he's confusing them.

1474
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,312
But it seems like

1475
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:45,856
being kind and caring
is a part of who he is.

1476
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:48,317
-Why do you keep spinning it positively?
-That's not it.

1477
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,610
-Do you know each other?
-No.

1478
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:51,403
Do you actually know each other?

1479
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:55,032
But if everyone says that,
he really must be nice to people.

1480
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,451
He really must be nice.

1481
01:14:57,534 --> 01:14:59,661
PARADISE
LEE SI-AN & YUK JUN-SEO

1482
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,705
I can just sleep here then?

1483
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:03,290
No, let's sleep here together.

1484
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:04,458
Let's sleep together.

1485
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,047
I'm not going to dry my hair.

1486
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:13,175
You couldn't find it?

1487
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:14,092
No. It's fine.

1488
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,761
It's okay. Just lie down.

1489
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:21,934
It doesn't matter. Air-drying is good too.

1490
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:22,851
Okay.

1491
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:23,977
In the same bed?

1492
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,229
-What?
-What?

1493
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,522
-Isn't this a first?
-Really?

1494
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:27,731
They're in the same bed?

1495
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:31,568
Mickey Mouse pajamas.

1496
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,029
This is my masterpiece.

1497
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,826
This is my first time
lying on a queen-sized bed.

1498
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:40,953
Me too.

1499
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,329
-Really?
-Yeah.

1500
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:47,543
-Are you drunk?
-No.

1501
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,086
-Are you okay?
-What?

1502
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:50,003
Are you okay?

1503
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,672
I'm okay. Are you?

1504
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:53,257
-Me?
-Yeah.

1505
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:55,592
-Me?
-Yeah.

1506
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,888
I think I had three glasses.

1507
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,139
-Three glasses?
-Yeah.

1508
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,902
Why did you cry earlier?

1509
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:14,903
Tell me.

1510
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:15,821
What?

1511
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,364
Why did you cry?

1512
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,620
-Earlier?
-Were you just sad? About the situation?

1513
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:27,124
It's just complicated.

1514
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,251
Because…

1515
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:34,464
The only person I've opened up to is you.

1516
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:35,382
Yeah.

1517
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,056
-What's going on?
-What?

1518
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,725
What?

1519
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,272
-It's 1:30 a.m.
-I see.

1520
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:51,398
Time flies, right?

1521
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,861
Wow, it's already 1:30 a.m.

1522
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:00,115
I'm glad I came here though.

1523
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:05,037
I got a glimpse of your genuine feelings.

1524
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,913
Yeah. That's true.

1525
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,832
And knowing that,

1526
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:12,669
I'll be clearer
on what actions I should take.

1527
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,546
Yeah.

1528
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,591
So I don't mind about your feelings.

1529
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:22,179
I'll do what I want to do.

1530
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,307
You don't have to confirm anything for me.

1531
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:30,520
What's interesting is

1532
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:34,733
the number of times
we've talked wasn't much.

1533
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,318
-Yeah.
-But…

1534
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,071
Without having to even talk a lot,

1535
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,366
I feel like I understand how I feel.

1536
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:47,663
Yeah.

1537
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:51,958
Me too.

1538
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,627
I feel the same about you.

1539
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:54,753
-Really?
-Yeah.

1540
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:00,801
Were there any moments
when I made you nervous?

1541
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:03,762
Now?

1542
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:14,898
-What are you doing?
-What?

1543
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:17,234
What are you doing?
Why are you squirming like that?

1544
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,611
You're squirming.

1545
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,497
-What is happening?
-What?

1546
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:32,124
-Did he hug her?
-He hugged her.

1547
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:33,291
I think he did.

1548
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,626
He just hugged her like this.

1549
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,544
He did.

1550
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,212
-He hugged her, right?
-He did.

1551
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:40,132
It's a bit of a shame to sleep, right?

1552
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:43,385
Yeah, maybe there's more
we could talk about.

1553
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:49,683
It does feel a bit disappointing
to just go to sleep like this.

1554
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:29,473
