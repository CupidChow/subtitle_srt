1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:13,638
A single choice can separate
Paradise from Inferno.

2
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,330
The person I want to go to Paradise with…

3
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,915
I want to be in Paradise with…

4
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,500
I want to go to Paradise with…

5
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,419
The woman I want to go to Paradise with…

6
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,630
What is this?

7
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,548
I got chills.

8
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,216
-Aren't we all here?
-I know.

9
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,977
This is Inferno,

10
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,690
where you seek love without knowing
each other's profession or age.

11
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,529
Singles who don't become couples
will spend painful nights here.

12
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,744
I literally got abandoned.

13
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:22,665
I knew it would be emotionally draining,
but it's worse than I thought.

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,334
We got into a fight.

15
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,878
-What is it? Why are you crying?
-I'm fine.

16
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,839
You changed so abruptly
that it confused me.

17
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,550
This is so hard for me.

18
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,094
I think I like someone else.

19
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,971
To be honest, it's upsetting.

20
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,807
I kind of want to go home.

21
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,849
I'm upset.

22
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,982
This is Paradise,

23
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,946
where you can reveal your profession
and age, and fall in love.

24
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,285
Singles who become couples
will spend the most amazing night

25
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,745
that they can imagine here.

26
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,625
I kind of want to know if you have a type
when it comes to appearance.

27
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,584
You.

28
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,503
Why do you keep laughing to yourself?

29
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,213
Because you're cute.

30
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,006
How was it today?

31
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,510
I think things will get interesting.

32
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,974
Charming singles…

33
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,436
have just arrived here.

34
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,155
When the hot summer sun
sets your heart on fire,

35
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,908
what choice will you make?

36
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,496
If I was really myself,
I would have gotten all the votes…

37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,124
I've never had something taken from me.

38
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,257
This is the hottest inferno in the world.

39
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,303
Single's Inferno.

40
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,305
SINGLE'S INFERNO

41
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,350
HANHAE, HONG JIN-KYUNG,
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

42
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,476
We're back.

43
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,020
The hottest inferno in the world,

44
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,814
Single's Inferno, is finally back.

45
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,274
That was a very brief clip,

46
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,569
but didn't it seem hotter
and more stimulating than last season?

47
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,030
What did you think of the first clip?

48
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:21,743
Honestly, I couldn't really see
the cast members' faces yet,

49
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,912
but the bodies
were like last season, right?

50
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,872
-Well, I was so shocked…
-Yes?

51
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,834
…by one of the scenes they showed.

52
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,254
-Then Single's Inferno succeeded.
-This is the hottest inferno.

53
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,089
-Yes.
-Right. Gosh.

54
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,133
So I caught a quick look at Paradise.

55
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,969
And while there was
just one room last season,

56
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,388
this time,
it's like they got a whole hotel.

57
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,431
There was a carousel.

58
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:47,101
By the way, I heard that
the first season of Single's Inferno

59
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,562
ranked fourth place internationally
on Netflix.

60
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,521
Right.

61
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,814
-This show…
-Worldwide.

62
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,360
…apparently had a great response
in Europe and South America.

63
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,862
I realized that Single's Inferno

64
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,449
was watched by people all over the world

65
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,827
when I saw them leave reviews
on overseas platforms.

66
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,120
-Really?
-Yes.

67
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,791
And when the episodes were released,

68
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,543
my friends asked me about it
within a couple of hours.

69
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,544
Right.

70
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,880
-The response was so amazing.
-Yes.

71
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,676
I came here as if I was coming
to see a long-awaited movie.

72
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,427
-I look forward to it.
-Yes.

73
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,640
Shall we keep watching and see what kind
of charming people we have this season?

74
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,599
-Yes.
-Yes.

75
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,105
INFERNO

76
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,686
-She's so pretty.
-Yes, she is.

77
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,897
There's something very Korean…

78
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,357
-She's very elegant.
-Yes. She looks innocent.

79
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,407
My name is Shin Seul-ki.

80
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,952
I haven't dated for a long time,

81
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,123
and I wanted to meet new people,
so I decided to come on the show.

82
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,585
People around me say that

83
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,339
I seem cold and snobbish,

84
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:25,426
but once they get to know me,
they say I'm actually easygoing

85
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,805
and surprisingly fun.

86
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,061
When it comes to my appearance,
I'm the most confident about my eyes.

87
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,689
I think my round eyes
are what make me attractive.

88
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,235
Guys tell me I have…

89
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,612
stars in my eyes.

90
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,326
Gosh, that's such an old pickup line.

91
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,078
She was so cute just now.

92
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,080
I like nice guys.

93
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:59,418
I want someone who's considerate
and has a friendly personality.

94
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,839
If I say I like someone,
they tend to like me back.

95
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,673
-She's completely different.
-I agree.

96
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,758
She looks very healthy and attractive.

97
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,639
My name is Park Se-jeong.

98
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,895
The person I want to meet
on the show is someone as hot as I am.

99
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,815
I think what makes me attractive
are my eyes and my sexy body,

100
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,735
and my surprisingly playful side.

101
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,573
I do weight training
three to four days a week,

102
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,117
and play tennis once or twice a week.

103
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:20,541
I'm quite confident about my figure
because I keep in shape by working out.

104
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,502
You can tell, can't you?

105
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,133
They have to be my type first
for me to have feelings.

106
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,637
Appearance-wise, I like someone
with monolid eyes and a pretty smile.

107
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,057
And someone who can take care of me.

108
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,519
If I go after a guy,
I rarely fail at getting him.

109
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,773
Hello.

110
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,399
Hello.

111
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,631
Someone's coming.

112
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,783
Hello.

113
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,661
-Hello.
-Hello.

114
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,671
He needs to quickly decide where to sit.

115
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,880
That's right.

116
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,925
-This first decision is important.
-Yes, it is.

117
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:07,148
I'll sit here.

118
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,574
Hello.

119
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,160
Hello.

120
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,417
My name is Choi Jong-woo.

121
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,171
I've never dated anyone
who I seriously liked.

122
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,132
Or where I was certain
that I liked that person.

123
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,384
So I came here to find that person.

124
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:40,473
I went to get my fortune told and the monk
said that if I came on this show,

125
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,476
I might meet someone
whom I could end up marrying.

126
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,145
That's why I made up my mind to do this.

127
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,607
Even monks know about this show.

128
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,067
-Monks.
-Monks watch this?

129
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,152
-It was foretold.
-They wouldn't watch.

130
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,070
That's right.

131
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,113
I like to play sports.

132
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,157
I used to be a soccer player.

133
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,534
I've played soccer
since elementary school.

134
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:06,415
But now I play soccer or futsal
as a hobby with my friends.

135
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,085
Since I was an athlete,

136
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,504
I think I am very competitive.

137
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:16,467
I'm quite confident
about my strength during games.

138
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,013
I usually go for women with pretty eyes.

139
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,809
If I meet someone who's my type
on Single's Inferno,

140
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,020
I think I'll express myself a lot,
even if it's nerve-wracking,

141
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,482
and try my best so that she'll like me.

142
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,153
What makes me attractive
is my empathy, sensitivity,

143
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,408
and how the corners of my mouth
naturally curl up.

144
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,412
He has such a pretty smile.

145
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,538
-I know, right?
-Yes.

146
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,497
Yes.

147
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,546
This is awkward.

148
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,298
It's pretty awkward.

149
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,226
Are you nervous?

150
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,978
Yes, I'm very nervous.

151
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,025
-Someone's coming.
-Right.

152
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,736
-It's another woman.
-She's coming.

153
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,720
-Hello.
-Hello.

154
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,181
I think she'll be cute.

155
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,432
She's adorable.

156
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,853
Hello, my name is Lee So-e.

157
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,774
I think I have a calm personality,
and I'm quite honest.

158
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,527
People say I can be clumsy sometimes.

159
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,450
I like to dance.

160
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:09,038
Dancing relieves stress,
and it's good for staying in shape.

161
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:14,001
My type is someone
who is generous and reliable.

162
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:18,839
I think I'm into guys who are tall
and have strong features.

163
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,760
I think it's something about
being in their arms and feeling secure.

164
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:27,056
What makes me attractive is that
I laugh a lot, I'm a good listener,

165
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,391
and this is a little embarrassing,

166
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,394
but I think I'm quite popular.

167
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:37,942
I did have a crush on a guy once,
and I succeeded in dating him.

168
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,737
It was just that one time,
so I guess my success rate is 100%.

169
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,865
Even if the person doesn't like you,

170
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,867
if you approach it with the mindset of,

171
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,537
"We'll see how long it takes
for you to like me,"

172
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,705
I think it will work.

173
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,211
-Hello.
-Hello.

174
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,680
Someone's coming.

175
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,266
He's coming.

176
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,957
He's handsome.

177
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,459
-Hello.
-Hello.

178
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,836
-Hello.
-Hi.

179
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,962
Hello.

180
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,589
-Hello.
-Hello.

181
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,008
-Hello.
-Hello.

182
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,301
-Hello.
-Hello.

183
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,385
Hello.

184
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,982
-Hello.
-Hello.

185
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,066
Hello.

186
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,778
Hi.

187
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,864
-Goodness.
-He sat right in between them.

188
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,824
-He chose a good seat.
-Right.

189
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,715
My name is Jo Yoong-jae.

190
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,052
Many people think I'm an athlete

191
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,972
when they first see me,
probably because of my big build.

192
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,933
I'm curious.

193
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,435
He's cool.
There's something natural about him.

194
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,313
I think being fit is very important,

195
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,359
so I regularly do CrossFit
and go on hikes.

196
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,737
Even if someone stronger comes
on the show compared to Season 1,

197
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,988
I'm confident I'll win.

198
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,785
Honestly, I think I'm quite popular
with the opposite gender.

199
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,956
When I was in college,
the school's online community said,

200
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,084
that I had the nicest broad shoulders.

201
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,047
Something important
that attracts me to a woman

202
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,882
is wisdom.

203
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,178
I want to meet someone
on Single's Inferno who I can be with

204
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,056
for the long run
and not just for the summer.

205
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,976
-Park Se-jeong?
-Yes.

206
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,312
I didn't catch your name earlier.

207
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,897
-Lee So-e.
-Lee So-e.

208
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,068
Someone's coming.

209
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,612
It's a woman.

210
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,538
She's tall.

211
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,005
Hello. My name is Lee Nadine.

212
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,801
I have a cold and honest personality.

213
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,013
I think I sound different
when I speak English versus Korean.

214
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:54,972
With English…

215
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,939
When I speak Korean,
I've heard that I'm a bit cuter

216
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,248
But also I think I came onto the show
because I want to date.

217
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,130
I like playing soccer and lacrosse.

218
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,603
and my curvy waist.

219
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:49,485
I'm on the taller side,
so my ideal guy would be tall.

220
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,238
Also, they should drive better than I do.

221
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,907
Since I'm a good driver myself.

222
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,328
If I'm really into the person,

223
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,208
I think I'll go all in.

224
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,217
It's cool how she switches
from English to Korean.

225
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,177
Everyone has a unique charm.

226
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,221
-They're all completely different.
-Yes.

227
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,973
Hello.

228
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,601
-Hello.
-Hello.

229
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,853
-Hello.
-Hello.

230
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,325
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

231
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,953
You're all so pretty.

232
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,038
You're so pretty.

233
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,206
Thank you.

234
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,209
What's your name?

235
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,252
Lee Nadine.

236
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,045
Nadine.

237
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,880
-Lee Nadine?
-Yes.

238
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,091
Your name is so unique.

239
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,259
Thank you.

240
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,771
-Someone's coming.
-Look.

241
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,116
My name is Kim Han-bin.

242
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,828
My personality in one word? "Positive."

243
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,246
Great positive energy.

244
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,498
I really like climbing.

245
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,459
I like to work out and sweat
because it's refreshing.

246
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,254
And I like feeling
an immediate sense of achievement.

247
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,381
I like people with intense eyes.

248
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,592
People who don't avoid eye contact.

249
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,677
There aren't many people like that.

250
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,014
So once I meet someone like that,
I think I fall head over heels.

251
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,974
When I meet someone I like,

252
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:48,687
I keep her entertained all the time
and make her happy.

253
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,356
I want to meet someone who's also positive

254
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,527
and create a sort of
combined positive energy with her.

255
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,113
-He's very bright.
-I get him.

256
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,449
He looks like he'll ace
all job interviews.

257
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,201
-Right.
-He's so positive.

258
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,661
Hello.

259
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,538
-Hello.
-Hello.

260
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,582
Hello.

261
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,541
Nice to meet you!

262
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,465
Nice to meet you.

263
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,179
-Hello.
-Hello.

264
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,138
What's your name?

265
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,932
-I'm Kim Han-bin.
-Kim Han-bin?

266
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,934
Nice to meet you.

267
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,562
-You're so cheerful.
-I am.

268
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,148
-Is everyone nervous?
-Yes, I'm a bit nervous.

269
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,733
I'm very nervous, too.

270
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,651
-Really?
-Yes.

271
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,944
You don't seem it at all.

272
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,240
I'm nervous. The view is nice.

273
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,578
-He's very outgoing.
-I know.

274
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,872
-We need someone like him on the show.
-Yes.

275
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,540
He loosened up the awkward vibe.

276
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,796
-Someone's coming.
-You're right.

277
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,049
He has a large build.

278
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,203
Hello.

279
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,080
-Hello.
-Hello.

280
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,039
Hello.

281
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,293
Hello.

282
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,628
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

283
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,635
He's handsome.

284
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,721
-He has strong features.
-Yes.

285
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,806
Hello.

286
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,934
-May I sit here?
-Yes.

287
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,153
My name is Shin Dong-woo.

288
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:06,616
My friends tell me,
"You really live life to the fullest."

289
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,369
I lift weights almost every day.

290
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,663
I feel very satisfied
to see my body develop

291
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,373
as I hit and surpass my limit.

292
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,251
I've liked playing basketball
ever since I was little.

293
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,505
I've trained a lot on a regular basis,
so I'm confident in my physical ability.

294
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,633
I think there are people

295
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,011
whom I meet for the first time
and sparks fly.

296
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,555
I have a bit of a calm personality,

297
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,892
so I think I prefer someone
who's very energetic and healthy.

298
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:35,145
Single's Inferno is a place

299
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,606
where we compete
with only our looks and charm,

300
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,233
and not our occupation or age.

301
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:44,946
So I'm curious to see how much
I can appeal to people with my charm.

302
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,161
Was your trip over here okay?

303
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,371
Yes.

304
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,665
Yes.

305
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,334
-It's takes a while by boat.
-Yes.

306
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,127
-Right.
-It does.

307
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,590
Someone's coming.

308
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,833
Hello, my name is Choi Seo-eun.

309
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,753
I think my biggest strength is
being natural.

310
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:48,009
No matter who I talk to,
I'm able to create a relaxed vibe.

311
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,638
My hobby is paddleboarding in the summer.

312
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,141
When you look at the Han River
from a paddleboard,

313
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,101
it's such a beautiful sight.

314
00:23:56,184 --> 00:24:00,897
And when I meditate there,
I like how my mind is at peace.

315
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,527
I think I can be competitive
and am on the athletic side.

316
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,904
If I ever compete with someone,

317
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,823
I think I have a winning chance.

318
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,534
When there's a guy I like,

319
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:17,122
I think I get very cutesy
and affectionate.

320
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,001
The tone of my voice is usually a bit low,

321
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,504
but people tell me
I talk in a sweet voice when I talk

322
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,089
to my boyfriend on the phone.

323
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,591
Hello?

324
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,509
Yes?

325
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,929
-She seems really cute.
-What's wrong?

326
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,598
What's with you, Hanhae?

327
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:40,562
On Single's Inferno, I want to be
in a happy relationship with someone

328
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,148
who can make me happy
by just looking at his face.

329
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,736
-Gosh.
-Hello.

330
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,071
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

331
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,156
Hello.

332
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,409
Gosh.

333
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:57,537
The men are giving her a standing ovation.

334
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,415
This is going to make
the other women nervous.

335
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,127
Oh, dear.

336
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,059
Please sit wherever you want.

337
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,685
-Hello.
-Hello.

338
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,731
-For your back.
-Thank you.

339
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,877
SHIN SEUL-KI

340

CHOI SEO-EUN

348
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,862
-This is driving me nuts.
-So it's a total…

349
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:17,284
-Season 2 is going to be great.
-…of four men and five women…

350
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,785
-Yes.
-…that are on this show.

351
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,371
-Are there really this many…
-Yes?

352
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,540
…attractive people
in such a small country?

353
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,624
Right?

354
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,044
-They're all pretty and handsome.
-Yes.

355
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,587
But they're all so different.

356
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,964
-Yes.
-Their personalities.

357
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,718
And it seems like they all know
how popular they are,

358
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,553
-and they look the part too.
-True.

359
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,889
And with Single's Inferno,
we have competitions.

360
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,350
I'm looking forward to those.

361
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,893
In the opening sequence,

362
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,396
they were sad and heartbroken.

363
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,316
-Right.
-Even if they went in knowingly…

364
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,610
For me, Nadine
was very charming this time.

365
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,611
Is that so?

366
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,323
I think Nadine will

367
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,618
actively win over the guy she likes.

368
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,705
Her name and the way she spoke English…

369
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,958
I think Nadine is very charming,
and I'm curious about her.

370
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,502
And among the men,
I'm curious about Han-bin.

371
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,255
-I liked his smile.
-Yes.

372
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:16,301
His positive energy and things like that
are what I look forward to.

373
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,927
-Kyuhyun--
-Wait, Kyuhyun.

374
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,680
-You won't be dating them.
-He's very cautious.

375
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,974
They're all so charming.

376
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,811
To be honest, when Seul-ki first came out,

377
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,605
-I thought she was the one.
-I see.

378
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,191
She was the first one
that came out, right?

379
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,776
"She's so pretty."

380
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,486
-That's what I thought.
-Right.

381
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,197
But then, later on, towards the end

382
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,949
-it was Seo-eun for me too.
-I see.

383
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,327
When Seo-eun pretended to be on the phone…

384
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:43,787
Hello?

385
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:45,789
Yes?

386
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,457
My heart melted.

387
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,709
-I saw you faint.
-Yes.

388
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:54,005
-Seo-eun is pretty.
-It's nice when a woman is usually calm,

389
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,883
but then acts cute
when she's with her boyfriend.

390
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,345
-For me, it was Yoong-jae.
-Yoong-jae is charming.

391
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,432
I bet he's very popular
with people of this generation.

392
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,393
-He's very--
-He's charming.

393
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,644
-Yes.
-He has a natural charm.

394
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,647
And the way his mouth looks
when he's clenching his jaw.

395
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,690
How should I put this? Gosh…

396
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,361
I love it.

397
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,536
What…

398
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,790
Hello, singles.

399
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,337
The hottest Inferno in the world,

400
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,632
Single's Inferno is back.

401
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:45,265
I'm the Master of Single's Inferno,
and I'll be helping you find love.

402
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:52,814
Now, I will inform you
of the rules in Inferno.

403
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,860
Inferno is isolated from the world.

404
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,571
You will not be able to use
any electronic devices.

405
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,576
For food, you must cook for yourselves
with the ingredients provided.

406
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:09,080
Here in Inferno, your profession, age,

407
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,791
and place of residence
must not be revealed.

408
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,254
Use only your natural charms

409
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,717
to actively win over each other's hearts
to become a couple.

410
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,344
Okay.

411
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,098
Those who become a couple
will spend a night in Paradise.

412
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:32,479
Luxurious suites are waiting in Paradise.

413
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,399
Here, you can reveal your profession, age,

414
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,152
and place of residence to your partner.

415
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,824
Whatever information you hear
during your stay in Paradise

416
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,912
must not be revealed
in Inferno under any circumstances.

417
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:56,961
-The map of the island is on the table.
-It's right here.

418
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,800
Please split into teams of three

419
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,678
in the order you are seated,
and begin exploring the island now.

420
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,432
I think this is where we are.

421
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,767
SO-E, YOONG-JAE, SE-JEONG

422
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,268
-So here.
-Yes.

423
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,062
HAN-BIN, NADINE, DONG-WOO

424
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,814
-We are…
-Here.

425
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,731
Right.

426
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,316
What's this, then?

427
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,609
SEUL-KI, SEO-EUN, JONG-WOO

428
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,028
-The heart is like a place for talking.
-Right.

429
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,382
CAFETERIA

430
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,889
GARDEN

431
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,357
CABANA

432
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,281
WATER FOUNTAIN

433
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,373
ICE CAFÉ

434
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,838
This is the cafeteria.

435
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,715
I'm hungry all of a sudden.

436
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,136
-Look at those cauldrons.
-The ingredients should be there, right?

437
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,555
Look at all those radishes.

438
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,766
-Wow, those radishes.
-So many radishes…

439
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,227
-I think we should do something with it.
-Right.

440
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,563
This can't be all the ingredients, right?

441
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,190
-One radish per person.
-Seriously?

442
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,692
There should be at least one cook.

443
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,485
-I wonder who it'll be.
-Right.

444
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,653
Is there water here?

445
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,449
Is it empty? We have to go get it, right?

446
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,658
Yes, we do.

447
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,913
I guess we're supposed to carry
the water in these.

448
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:55,872
Do you want to try?

449
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,540
-Should I?
-Yes.

450
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,881
-It suits you.
-It suits me?

451
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:05,965
Yes.

452
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,175
"It suits you."

453
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,135
He's become a servant.

454
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,388
Goodness, it's beautiful.

455
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,433
It's nice here.

456
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,146
Gosh, this is nice.

457
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,981
Do you like sports?

458
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,650
Yes.

459
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,859
Do you work out?

460
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,988
-Well, I like sports better.
-I see.

461
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,491
-But not something like Pilates.
-Working out?

462
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,160
I mean, working out is a type of sport…

463
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,370
-Weight training.
-Yes.

464
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,707
I thought you were talking about
going to the gym and working out.

465
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,834
Yes, that's what I meant.

466
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,003
-No, I don't do that a lot.
-I see.

467
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,798
-Yes.
-Then active sports?

468
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,758
-Like soccer.
-Yes. Soccer.

469
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,637
-You really play soccer?
-Yes.

470
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,098
Can I say…

471
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,266
-Can I say that?
-You play professionally?

472
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,353
No, I'm not a professional athlete.

473
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,106
We're allowed to talk about our hobbies.

474
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,273
Hobbies. Right.

475
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:08,486
I played soccer for almost ten years,
but now I'm not that good.

476
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,279
Good guess. She does play soccer.

477
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:15,076
To be honest, it was just a random guess,
but getting it right isn't easy.

478
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,579
Her reaction kind of felt like,
"As if I would play soccer."

479
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,456
-You thought she'd say that.
-Yes.

480
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,584
So it's soccer, right? Not football?

481
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,752
-Yes.
-Soccer.

482
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,753
Yes, soccer.

483
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,963
That's cool.

484
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,841
I played lacrosse more though.
Do you know it?

485
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,469
-The thing where you use a stick.
-Yes, a stick.

486
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,388
I played that a lot.

487
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,015
I have no idea what that is.

488
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,683
It's kind of like polo.

489
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,227
You hit a ball
with something like a hockey stick.

490
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,771
-How interesting.
-Lacrosse is really fun.

491
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,817
How tall are you two?

492
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,194
I'm a little shy of 170 centimeters.

493
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,654
-You're tall.
-You're tall.

494
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,656
How tall are you?

495
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,782
I'm 160…

496
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,826
I don't want to say.

497
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,328
-Why, what's wrong?
-But didn't you just tell us?

498
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,414
I heard her say "160."

499
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,542
-Okay, 160…
-Let's just pretend you shared.

500
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,919
It's this way.

501
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,965
The roof is such a pretty color.

502
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,924
It is.

503
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,721
The air definitely feels better here
because it's higher up.

504
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,773
There's barely a meter difference
in terms of altitude…

505
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,317
I feel like Jong-woo has
that kind of awkwardness.

506
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,318
That's adorable.

507
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,790
Doesn't it feel less awkward now?

508
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

509
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,794
I'm not so sure about that.

510
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,088
Let's talk about the radishes.

511
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,798
The radishes…

512
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,467
-There are a lot of radishes.
-Radish…

513
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,597
-You don't usually eat a lot, right?
-I like eating.

514
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,307
So I do eat a lot.

515
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,187
I'm a foodie.

516
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,773
What kind of Korean food do you like?

517
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:13,528
I like things like table d'hôte.
Korean table d'hôte.

518
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,279
That sounds good.

519
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:23,371
I can already tell that
the view is nice over there.

520
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,705
I totally agree.

521
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,375
Gosh, this is a great spot.

522
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,835
-This is good.
-Right?

523
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,211
Would you like some?

524
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,268
I get why everybody comes here
for iced water.

525
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,603
Right? Something about it…

526
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,647
-It's so good.
-Cold water.

527
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,526
We can drink coffee
while enjoying the view of the ocean.

528
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,736
Sounds good.

529
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,240
The view here is really nice.

530
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,283
-It is.
-Yes.

531
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,660
-Should we start heading back?
-Sure.

532
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,707
Gosh, it stings.

533
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,210
Are you okay?

534
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,342
-I think I have a splinter.
-Really?

535
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,721
-I have a splinter.
-Where?

536
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,181
But I can't see it.

537
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,808
It stings badly whenever I walk.

538
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:26,851
Hold on a second.

539
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,398
A splinter?

540
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,989
If it's all right with you, can I try?

541
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,616
Yes.

542
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,417
Is it out?

543
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,627
Wait.

544
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,630
Wait. Is it out?
It kind of feels like it's out.

545
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:57,924
How does it feel?

546
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,467
-I think it's out.
-I see.

547
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,511
-That's good.
-Thank you.

548
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,057
Trivial incidents
lead to something bigger.

549
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,058
That's true.

550
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,101
I bet So-e is looking for a splinter.

551
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,022
Yoong-jae seems nice.

552
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,233
-He does things very calmly.
-Yes.

553
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,236
I think you should walk
as carefully as you can.

554
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,153
Okay.

555
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,697
The road is kind of rough,

556
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,659
so it's a bit uncomfortable to walk.

557
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,743
It is.

558
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,079
This could be good later on.

559
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,206
-For what?
-When you come as a couple.

560
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,793
-So they can lean on each other?
-Yes.

561
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,711
That's true.

562
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:41,133
Gosh, the way everyone was grouped
in teams of three. It's like destiny.

563
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,427
-They were seated close to each other.
-Yes.

564
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:48,140
During this tour, did you notice any signs
of them showing interest in each other?

565
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,892
-Jong-woo.
-Jong-woo?

566
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,687
He was asking Seul-ki a lot of questions.

567
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,273
Even if they ask the same question,

568
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,067
don't you feel the difference,
looking into their eyes?

569
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,568
-Right.
-I kind of felt that.

570
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:04,824
I think Se-jeong is interested
in Yoong-jae.

571
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:09,078
Because if it were me,
and I don't really like the person,

572
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,830
then I wouldn't ask him to help me.

573
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:15,710
I'd wait a bit even if it gets infected
and limp towards the guy

574
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,420
whom I like and then I'd…

575
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,507
-So you'd hang in there until then?
-Right.

576
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,720
Yoong-jae also seems
to be easygoing and responds well.

577
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,973
Being taken care of could be
too much for that person.

578
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,018
-That's true.
-But you see, he doesn't put pressure.

579
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:32,977
Right.

580
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,521
He's easygoing yet attentive.

581
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,564
That's so right.

582
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,483
I saw Da-hee react to someone
for the first time today.

583
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,193
-She was like…
-She started whispering.

584
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,904
"I think I get why you brought up
Yoong-jae earlier."

585
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,365
And I'm like, "Go away."

586
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,742
"Go away."

587
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,751
It's so cozy here.

588
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,711
How was the tour?

589
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,338
-It was fun.
-It was fun?

590
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,630
Was it fun?

591
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,007
Are you sure you had fun?

592
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,968
I mean, we walked so much.

593
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,262
The island is a lot bigger than I thought.

594
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,598
-It is.
-Did you see the place earlier?

595
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,641
-Where do we cook?
-The 30 radishes?

596
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,144
There are 30 of them?

597
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,146
It seemed like it.

598
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,775
-Are you a good cook?
-I can make fried rice.

599
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,361
With chicken breast for when I'm dieting.

600
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,238
-I see.
-That's it. Nothing professional.

601
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,492
I actually like cooking a lot.

602
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,077
Great. We must try whatever we can.

603
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,912
-I was worried.
-Tell us what to do,

604
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,205
and we'll follow orders.

605
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,917
You're here.

606
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,627
-Gosh, you must be tired.
-Good job.

607
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,878
How was it?

608
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,756
-Like, how did it feel?
-Yes.

609
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,885
So Nadine speaks better English
than Korean.

610
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,763
Her responses earlier
were very short, right?

611
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,140
-Yes.
-She speaks English really well.

612
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,476
But not something like Pilates.

613
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,311
And she loves to exercise.

614
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,232
But sports, like, soccer.

615
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,945
It sounded like she played professionally.

616
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,197
She doesn't seem too talkative.

617
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,951
-That's unexpected.
-The two of you each went with two women.

618
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,035
-Yes.
-That's right.

619
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,747
Well, I went with Park Se-jeong

620
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,500
and Lee So-e
who were sitting on either side of me.

621
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,335
They both have good personalities,

622
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,714
and, as we were talking,
I found myself becoming interested.

623
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,384
How was it for you?

624
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,052
-Seul-ki?
-Yes.

625
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,889
She seems very quiet,
but doesn't hold back her words.

626
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,350
-I see.
-She seemed to be that kind of person.

627
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,061
-I think it'll be fun once we get close.
-I see.

628
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,982
And Seo-eun is a great listener.

629
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,900
She makes good eye contact.

630
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,110
That kind of person.

631
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,653
Were you attracted to anyone?

632
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,321
Do I have to answer that?

633
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,033
You can say "no comment."

634
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,705
-Yes.
-Gosh, then it must be one of the two.

635
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,039
This, too?

636
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,959
-Thank you.
-I still have to talk to everyone.

637
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:02,877
That's right.

638
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,670
Thanks for your honest response.

639
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,047
He's very kind.

640
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,967
We went on the tour with Yoong-jae…

641
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,677
-I see.
-…and he's very nice.

642
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,597
-They're all so nice.
-You're right.

643
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,432
-Choi…
-And Choi Jong-woo.

644
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,642
He was extremely nice, too.

645
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,478
And Han-bin is so funny.

646
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,230
-It's almost as if he's the host…
-The host.

647
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,191
He was our tour guide.

648
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,233
This way.

649
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,820
I want to go on a trip with Han-bin.

650
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:34,658
Was there anyone
you thought was your type?

651
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,827
-Do you…
-I'm not sure.

652
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,663
Do you?

653
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,626
No, I haven't talked to most of them.

654
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,170
-Right.
-Just appearance-wise, though.

655
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,922
What about looks?

656
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,923
Looks…

657
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,344
I'm not sure.

658
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,304
-"I'm not sure."
-What?

659
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:03,103
To be honest, I think Yoong-jae
made the best first impression.

660
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:07,525
I'm very sensitive when it comes to
scents, and he was wearing cologne.

661
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:12,696
I was sitting right next to him,
and I remember him smelling nice.

662
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,242
The person who made
the best first impression is Yoong-jae.

663
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,159
PARK SE-JEONG

664
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,203
He kept taking care of me.

665
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,080
-Are you cold?
-A little?

666
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,207
-I'm fine now.
-Okay.

667
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,752
-Are you okay there?
-Yes.

668
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,797
You should sit here next time.
It has a good view.

669
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,007
Are you okay?

670
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,095
If it's all right with you, can I try?

671
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,516
The person who made
the best first impression…

672
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,433
JO YOONG-JAE

673
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,935
…is Park Se-jeong.

674
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,937
She initiated conversations.

675
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,855
It suited you so well earlier.

676
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,065
-Really?
-Yes.

677
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,526
And she seemed like a good listener.

678
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,778
So I became interested.

679
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,114
Gosh, that's a love triangle right there.

680
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,824
LEE NADINE

681
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,077
When we were on our walk,

682
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,871
Dong-woo asked a lot of questions,

683
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,583
so I felt rather relaxed.

684
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,919
When I first saw everyone,

685
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,714
Se-jeong really caught my eye.

686
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,673
SHIN DONG-WOO

687
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:18,637
She had a healthy and attractive charm,
so I think she kind of fits my ideal type.

688
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,641
The person who made
the best first impression is

689
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,852
Choi Seo-eun.

690
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,229
She stood out to me
even from very far away.

691
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,690
I think that's why
I found myself staring at her.

692
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,986
The person who made
the best first impression

693
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,112
is Choi Jong-woo.

694
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,406
The one whom I went on the tour with.

695
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,951
I was able to talk to him a lot,

696
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,120
and it was so nice when he was leading us.

697
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,125
I'd say Jong-woo,
the one who I went on the tour with today.

698
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,043
SHIN SEUL-KI

699
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,461
I talked to him the most,

700
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,046
and he's the most memorable.

701
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,842
The woman who made
the best first impression is…

702
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:57,760
CHOI JONG-WOO

703
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,013
Out of the two, the person who's my type

704
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,641
is Seul-ki because she's closer
to my ideal type.

705
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:10,731
So I think that's why I sat next to her
when I first saw her.

706
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,361
Hello.

707
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,033
He knew in that short moment.

708
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,951
He made a choice, right?

709
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,286
Gosh, this is already…

710
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,707
Let's go make some food.

711
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,336
Is anyone good at cooking?

712
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,629
Han-bin.

713
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,839
-He's good at cooking.
-No, I can't cook.

714
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,634
-That's good.
-The pressure is on you now.

715
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,305
Let's cook up a delicious meal.

716
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,058
There are lots of radishes.

717
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,143
I only see radishes.

718
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:50,604
I'll make shredded radish.

719
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,276
-We have to use firewood to start a fire.
-Right.

720
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,112
This is survival.

721
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,741
-We should go get some water, right?
-Really? Okay.

722
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,160
Is there anyone who wants to go get water?

723
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,370
-Me.
-Shall we go?

724
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,247
-I want to go.
-See you later then.

725
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,707
Please prepare the soup well.

726
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,543
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

727
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,131
What should I do to help?

728
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,049
-Cheer for us.
-Pour the water in.

729
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,927
-I'll pour it then.
-Or we can do rock, paper, scissors?

730
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,597
You must be starving.

731
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,516
-I'm really starving.
-Right?

732
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,559
Did you have lunch?

733
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,519
I didn't even get to have lunch.

734
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,770
Gosh.

735
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,564
We have a chef, so…

736
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,566
-Just trust him.
-Right.

737
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,984
Is he good at cooking?

738
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,153
Yes, it seems like he's quite talented.

739
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,700
I want Seul-ki to carry this
at least once when it's filled with water.

740
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,161
Just for fun.

741
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,371
I'm strong. I can carry it.

742
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,456
-You're strong?
-Really?

743
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,754
-Let's start prepping.
-Let's wash the ingredients first.

744
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,047
-All right.
-Okay!

745
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,632
-So--
-Let's each take a radish.

746
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,759
-Anyone need an apron?
-I do.

747
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,678
Here's the apron.

748
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,890
I heard you're
in charge of making something

749
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,643
-like radish soup…
-Before you start, put on this apron.

750
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,811
-You're in white.
-Yes.

751
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,021
-Thanks.
-Here you go.

752
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:15,731
Thank you.

753
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,026
-Are there enough aprons?
-No, but you go ahead.

754
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,361
-But you're in white.
-But you're washing them.

755
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,321
It's okay.

756
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,533
Hey, wait a minute.

757
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,577
-Do you want this?
-No, you're in white.

758
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,953
-You wear it.
-No, I'm fine.

759
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,246
-You sure?
-Yes.

760
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,873
-I'd feel bad--
-Please wear it.

761
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,751
Then I'll make up for it by cooking more.

762
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,670
Thank you.

763
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,508
-Thank you.
-The back…

764
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,092
-I can do it.
-Let me help you.

765
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,302
Okay.

766
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,934
-So until then, we're going to…
-Think about a different dish…

767
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,186
Or we also talked about doenjang-jjigae.

768
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,896
-I tied it in a ribbon.
-Thanks.

769
00:46:55,979 --> 00:47:00,108
Put some radish in doenjang-jjigae.
Then it will taste nice.

770
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,740
-I'll go start the fire in the meantime.
-Sure.

771
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:10,327
-You have to use the water here, right?
-Yes, I think so.

772
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,912
Right? Okay then…

773
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,580
-Can you move over a bit?
-Sure.

774
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,290
-Be careful.
-Thank you.

775
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:22,214
I don't usually see this many radishes
unless it's kimchi-making season.

776
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,801
How's your cooking?

777
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,263
-I think I'm really a beginner.
-Really?

778
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,682
So are you able
to make stuff like ramyeon?

779
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,517
I can cook if I follow a recipe.

780
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,434
Right.

781
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,187
Yes, but I can't make anything on my own.

782
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,480
I see.

783
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,108
-I think I'm at that level.
-Got it.

784
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,196
-Am I the only one having trouble?
-Same.

785
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,155
It's like…

786
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,325
-Why are there so many holes?
-Right?

787
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,287
-Be careful with your hands.
-Thanks, you too.

788
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,082
Gosh, it seems like
So-e always ends up listening in.

789
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,002
-She needs to find a better position.
-Right.

790
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,382
Is this right?

791
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,759
Should I peel the radishes for you?

792
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:11,221
-I can handle vegetables.
-Do you handle vegetables well?

793
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,640
-Yes, I do.
-Is that so?

794
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,602
Then shall I handle the rice?

795
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,145
How about we switch places?

796
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,689
-Okay.
-But what if I'm not good at it?

797
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:24,067
-Then I'll finish this one first.
-Okay.

798
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,405
I should be responsible
and finish what I started.

799
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,574
You're good at this.

800
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,492
I'm okay at peeling fruit, too.

801
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,952
Right, you're good at this.

802
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,042
-All right.
-Shall we try carrying these?

803
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,337
Seul-ki, would you like to feel
how heavy this is?

804
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,630
-Me?
-Yes.

805
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,549
It'll be your fault
if I get a stiff neck tomorrow.

806
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,134
-Sure.
-Like it's a backpack.

807
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,887
-Like I'm going to school?
-Yes.

808
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,972
-I'll put them on one by one.
-Got it.

809
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,849
Here, turn around.

810
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,769
-I doubt I'll be able to stand up.
-Wait.

811
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:02,272
-My gosh.
-Okay. All done.

812
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,608
-Do I get up?
-I'll help you. One, two, three.

813
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,903
-Watch your balance.
-It's not heavy.

814
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,446
We're holding it up right now.

815
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,989
-Let go on three.
-One, two, three.

816
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,282
No, don't let go.

817
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,117
Stand still for a second.

818
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,078
-Can you walk?
-Did you let go?

819
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,746
-Yes.
-Try taking a few steps.

820
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,414
This isn't that heavy.

821
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,125
-Then we'll return like this.
-Like this.

822
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,168
No, please.

823
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,004
-No, I can't.
-All right. Hold on.

824
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,674
-Take it off.
-We'll do rock, paper, scissors.

825
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,050
All right, let's do it.

826
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,602
You're really good at this.

827
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,978
It's because I live alone.

828
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,063
-Really?
-Yes.

829
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,731
-You're good at this.
-He's good.

830
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,109
Mr. Chef.

831
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:52,155
-That sounds professional.
-Goodness!

832
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,535
I want to try and do that.

833
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,163
It's a useless skill.

834
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,167
-But it's very useful here.
-Do you think so?

835
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,629
What else should I do?

836
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,675
Hey, it's hot. Be careful.

837
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,969
What should we do?
Should we try this again?

838
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,765
-Two women starting a fire…
-I know, it's cool.

839
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,934
So-e.

840
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:23,228
Why are you there putting in firewood?

841
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,858
-Yes, there he goes.
-Yes.

842
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,997
You seemed to be too close.
This can be dangerous.

843
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,256
Just a second. I'll give it a try.

844
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,227
-Don't your eyes sting? Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

845
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,233
-I have a good feeling about this.
-Right.

846
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,911
-It worked.
-It looks like it worked.

847
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,037
You're the best.

848
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,414
-It worked, right?
-Gosh, you're the best.

849
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,958
Thank you.

850
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,336
It looks like it worked.

851
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,592
-There's firewood?
-Water's here.

852
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,888
It must be so heavy.

853
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,058
It's not too heavy.
Balancing it is the hard part.

854
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,227
Nice work.

855
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,355
-Let me take this off for you.
-Gosh.

856
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,106
-Goodness.
-My gosh!

857
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,108
Shall we pour it in?

858
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,653
-Shall we pour it in right here?
-Yes.

859
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,571
-Wait.
-Gosh.

860
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,115
-Is your hand okay?
-I didn't knock into it.

861
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,368
-This comes last.
-Okay, got it.

862
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,744
Like this?

863
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:06,039
-You brought back a lot of water.
-It must have been hard.

864
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,626
I think the water is just pooling.

865
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,045
-I see.
-We shouldn't use too much water.

866
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:14,172
That's why the water isn't draining.

867
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,925
-We'll have to throw this out.
-How should we do that?

868
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,094
I'll go throw it out.

869
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,429
Really? It'll be too heavy.

870
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,265
I'll just throw it out there.

871
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,599
It's too full.

872
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,497
-Look at her watching. So cute.
-Go help him!

873
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,749
It's like a scene from a movie
or something.

874
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,005
-Were you watching?
-Good job.

875
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,008
-Good job.
-Thanks.

876
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,053
It's nice to know someone's watching.

877
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,096
-That's true.
-Yes.

878
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,682
This smells so good.

879
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,018
Is that all we need?

880
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,355
The sunset is pretty.

881
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,608
-Gosh.
-Right?

882
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,402
This does seem like the perfect time.

883
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,905
That's really pretty.

884
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:24,743
I think this is the prettiest
dishwashing view in Korea right now.

885
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,787
"Dishwashing view."

886
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,376
Nadine.

887
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,670
-Should we do this together?
-What is it?

888
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,796
The radish dish.

889
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,257
-Sesame oil?
-We need to put vinegar in.

890
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,384
-To make it tart.
-Yes.

891
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,844
-Sugar.
-Sugar.

892
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,804
-The more, the better.
-Right.

893
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,015
Adding sesame seeds
make things delicious.

894
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,184
That's what my mom told me.

895
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,895
-Puts lots of sesame seeds in.
-It looks pretty good.

896
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,358
Oh, my god! This is so good.

897
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,275
-It's good?
-Yes!

898
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,360
I smell sesame oil.

899
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,029
How's our shredded radish?

900
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,614
-Goodness.
-Is it good?

901
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,241
-It's good.
-Maybe we're just hungry.

902
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,368
So good.

903
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,869
-So good.
-Didn't you make it?

904
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,579
-Yes.
-It's decent, right?

905
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,331
-The two of us.
-It's really good.

906
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,791
That's good.

907
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,709
-That's all we need.
-It's very good.

908
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,253
-I've gained confidence.
-It's really good.

909
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,588
It's good, right?

910
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,675
Let's put this here.

911
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,136
-What else should we do?
-I want to help…

912
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,806
-I'll put it here.
-Okay.

913
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,899
Is it good?

914
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,776
-Sorry?
-Is it good?

915
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,570
Do you want to try it?

916
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,697
Just one.

917
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,532
You can't eat it all before dinner.

918
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,533
Right, sorry.

919
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,535
I'm just kidding.

920
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,790
We could all catch a cold.

921
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,458
-My gosh.
-I'm sorry.

922
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,210
-Let me move these.
-Be careful.

923
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,128
I will.

924
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,587
I have to lower the fire.

925
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,259
He's so reliable.

926
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:05,802
He is.

927
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,181
Please turn out good.

928
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,977
You're kind of like
a professional pajeon chef.

929
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,106
It's cooking well and looks all golden.

930
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,692
The rice looks so good.

931
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,153
It smells so good.

932
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,488
This will be delicious.
My mouth is watering.

933
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,742
It looks like a pancake.

934
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:32,996
We actually did it.

935
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,667
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job, everyone.

936
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,045
-Thank you for the meal.
-Good job, everyone.

937
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,629
-Let's eat now.
-Eat up.

938
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,465
-I'm starving.
-Thank you.

939
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,133
-Thank you for the meal.
-Enjoy.

940
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,553
Try the jeon.

941
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,014
You put in so much effort to make it.

942
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,852
-It's okay?
-Yes.

943
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,771
-It's yummy.
-So crispy.

944
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,147
-Is it delicious?
-Yes.

945
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,403
-It's good.
-And the marinated radish.

946
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,909
It was just raw rice.

947
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,871
-Is it good?
-Yes, it's great.

948
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,998
-Is it delicious?
-Yes, of course.

949
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,000
-This is so good.
-Yes.

950
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,837
-You might get an upset stomach tomorrow.
-Really?

951
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,049
How's the food?

952
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,136
It's good.

953
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,848
-The rice is really good, too.
-The rice turned out well.

954
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,607
I've been wanting to say this,

955
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,859
but what you're wearing
goes really well with pajeon.

956
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:45,902
This sweater?

957
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,821
I wanted a nokdujeon look.

958
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,573
-It goes really well.
-Nokdujeon?

959
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,326
Maybe you worked so hard
that the color got on your sweater.

960
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,369
Maybe?

961
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,496
This wasn't the color.

962
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,043
-You react to jokes well.
-Right.

963
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,711
You're right.

964
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,840
I didn't think that was really funny.

965
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,134
They're easily amused.

966
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,094
Don't be jealous, Hanhae.

967
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,514
This is it. It has begun.

968
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,850
-You can feel the romance, right?
-Yes.

969
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:21,729
I think So-e
is a bit interested in Yoong-jae.

970
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:22,730
It's more like very.

971
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,065
-Right?
-Yes.

972
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,819
-She was watching him from afar like this.
-That's when I knew for sure.

973
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,404
It shows that she's interested.

974
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,031
Se-jeong seems
interested in Yoong-jae too.

975
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,451
-She kept telling him to try the radish.
-Right.

976
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,328
Dong-woo seems
like he's interested in Nadine.

977
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,540
I agree. Seeing the way
he kept asking Nadine questions,

978
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,459
I think he's interested.

979
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,961
Goodness, soon it'll be time
for the postcards.

980
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,629
-Yes.
-They have to write the postcards.

981
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,631
They have to write
about first impressions.

982
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,886
For now, I think Yoong-jae will receive
the most votes of the male participants.

983
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,597
The way Yoong-jae talks…

984
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,682
How should I put this? It's strangely…

985
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,518
-It's charming even to a guy, isn't it?
-It really is.

986
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,228
He's kind in a subtle way.

987
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,481
-And he talks really well.
-Exactly.

988
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,150
I think he's a no-nonsense type of person.

989
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,444
-Right.
-He's not a show-off.

990
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,403
I agree.

991
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:14,741
I mean, if a show-off
succeeded in starting a fire,

992
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,244
-he'd be like, "I did it!"
-Yoong-jae is not like that.

993
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,706
He even threw out the water
without making a fuss.

994
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,375
I think Yoong-jae will receive
at least two postcards.

995
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,754
But who do you think
Yoong-jae will vote for?

996
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,507
I first thought
he was interested in Se-jeong,

997
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,884
but then after seeing how So-e reacted,

998
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:36,429
I now think he could choose So-e.

999
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,847
That's what I thought.

1000
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,099
-So-e is the type…
-I'm rooting for them.

1001
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,977
-…who all of a sudden catches your eye.
-Yes.

1002
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,980
-"Wait? Why do I keep thinking of her?"
-Right.

1003
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,607
-She will only have eyes for you.
-Yes.

1004
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,734
-Let's keep watching.
-Yes, I'm curious.

1005
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,277
I'm so impatient right now.

1006
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,952
How was it? After eating together
and talking like this…

1007
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,372
Some people seem different
once you talk to them.

1008
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,665
-Right.
-Yes.

1009
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:07,252
They all seem a bit different
from how I first perceived them.

1010
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,169
Just a little.

1011
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,712
Han-bin.

1012
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,005
Han-bin?

1013
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,799
Great job today.

1014
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,592
-Thanks for everything.
-You saved us.

1015
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:17,428
-If you weren't here…
-We would've ruined everything.

1016
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,639
-Yes.
-It could have been a real disaster.

1017
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,058
He's so good at cooking.

1018
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,477
-He's serious when he cooks.
-Yes, he is.

1019
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,605
Everything really worked out
under his leadership.

1020
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,608
What did you discuss
while getting the water?

1021
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,860
We talked about MBTI tests,

1022
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,822
and then they told me
to carry the water all of a sudden.

1023
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:39,367
-They dumped the work on you.
-Right.

1024
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,910
And then…

1025
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,540
Now, you will choose a person you like

1026
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,459
and convey your feelings for them.

1027
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,462
-Oh, my gosh.
-Pretend you didn't hear anything.

1028
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,427
I can hear my heart beating in my ears.

1029
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,056
You'll see postcards in your room.

1030
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:05,935
Write down how you feel
about the person you like on a postcard.

1031
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,815
Why am I so nervous?

1032
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,901
I barely talked to the guys.

1033
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:18,948
Then put it in that person's postbox.

1034
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:25,121
Please decide now.

1035
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,666
-My goodness.
-This is hard.

1036
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:33,838
This is hard.

1037
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,765
You're all thinking hard about this.

1038
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,602
But we can change
our choice later on, right?

1039
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:50,104
-This is just about first impressions.
-Right.

1040
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,148
-It's really nothing…
-How I feel now

1041
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,568
is more important
than how I felt before, right?

1042
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:57,487
Did something change?

1043
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,578
I'm nervous.

1044
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,498
Why is this so nerve-wracking?
Why am I nervous?

1045
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,715
One of us won't
get a vote at all later, right?

1046
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,342
You're right.

1047
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:23,554
But if the four of them
choose the same person…

1048
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,224
-Then a lot of us won't get any.
-Right.

-Yes.

1052
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,291
I heard she lived overseas
for a long time.

1053
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,967
Nadine and Dong-woo
have something going on.

1054
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,517
-She has one.
-She got one.

1055
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,727
She got one vote.

1056
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:16,232
WE SHOULD WORK OUT TOGETHER SOMETIME

1057
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,818
-I think Dong-woo sent it.
-Right.

1058
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,903
-It's Dong-woo.
-They talked about soccer.

1059
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,697

It's not as cold as I thought.

1062
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:42,300
-It's a bit warmer now.
-Really?

1063
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:45,052
-Yes, I think it's a bit warmer now.
-That's a relief.

1064
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,598
-Was that yours?
-Yes.

This is fun.

1066
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,150
It's fun?

1067
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,492
I was surprised.

1068
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:10,453
I'm not the type to start conversations…

LEE NADINE

1070
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:15,333

would be good.

1071
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:18,169
"We should work out together sometime."

1072
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,257

Seo-eun.

1076

Seo-eun has a clean image.

1077
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,979
I felt that when she
first made her entrance.

1078
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,650
I think they're all
on the more energetic side.

1079
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,693
-That's true.
-They're all like that.

1081
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,211
"I love how you chop onions."

-Who could it be?
-Han-bin.

1083
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,881
But she was next to Yoong-jae?

1084
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,508
This is confusing.

I think among the women,
Seul-ki would have had the most postcards.

She seems calm on the outside,

but when you talk to her,
she has a friendly personality.

1091
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:36,914
I think a lot of the guys
would like that about her.

Now, either So-e or Se-jeong

-Right.
-"The shredded radish was great."

1107
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,838

She has a poker face.

1113
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,328
What's that nod for?
Does it mean "I knew it"?

-It was so awkward during dinner time.

1120
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,834
It was fine when we were cooking, though.

1121

As soon as we sat,

01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,856
Gosh, she can't sit there and just smile.

1125
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:52,902
At least she doesn't know
she's the only one without any votes.

1126
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,738
Still, it's hard to put a poker face on.

1127

Before I went to check,

1128
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,747

I don't think so.

1134
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,767
You don't think so? Me neither.

01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,019
But it could happen.

1136
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,689
You were the star today.

1137
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,818
But I barely talked to anyone
while cooking.

1138
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:37,780
But that could have
actually appealed to them.

1139
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,199
-To them?
-I really have no idea.

1140
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,200
You never know.

1141
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,837

He created a fun, relaxed vibe.

Compared to how he seemed at first,

1146
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:08,227
it seems like he has a more serious
and active side to him.

1147
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,814
He was such a good cook
and was good at giving instructions.

I can't tell. I really can't.

1156
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,453
"I swept all the votes?"

1157
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,788
Not even close.

1158
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,254
It's like we don't have to be
wary of each other,

1159

if I don't get any votes.

1162
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,182
I'd have a lot on my mind.
Like, "I have to try harder."

1163
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,392
-Don't say that.
-Han-bin probably took that

1164
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,728
-very personally.
-He didn't get any votes.

1165
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:37,608
That's how much they all assume
that Han-bin definitely got a vote.

1166
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,237
I'd have a lot on my mind.
Like, "I have to try harder."

I didn't think I would get zero votes.

Because I worked hard
and was satisfied with what I did.

So I didn't expect this.

1171

On my way back, I was at a loss for words,

01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,397
It really could have been given
to one person.

1182
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,651
Four votes? There's no way…

1183
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:04,820
Someone could have gotten three votes.

1184
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:08,574
I can't even begin to guess.

1185
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,035
I have no clue.

1186
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,955

1189
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:25,299
I don't think it's two to two.

1190
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:26,675
I call three to one.

1191
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,556
I think it's either three to one
or four to none.

1192
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,978
-Bet Yoong-jae got three.
-Four to none?

1193
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:38,937
Bet he got four.

1194
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,565
I think Yoong-jae would've gotten
a lot of votes.

1195
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:44,526
I talked to the women earlier,

1196
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:48,447
and we all had similar types.

1197
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:52,451
And Yoong-jae has a kind-looking face.

1198
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:55,829
I think it could be Dong-woo.

1199
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:58,582
I catch onto things really quickly.

1200
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:02,544
So I saw Seul-ki glancing towards
Dong-woo a lot,

1201
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:06,173
and when we were walking back,
she kept trying to walk with Dong-woo.

1202
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:09,551
I think Seul-ki chose Dong-woo too.

1203
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,513
-I wonder who got all the votes.
-Let's see.
