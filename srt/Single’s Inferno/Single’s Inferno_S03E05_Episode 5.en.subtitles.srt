1
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,103
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,273
He should tell us all three
if he's equally interested.

3
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,733
-You're right.
-Yes.

4
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,859
The three people?

5
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,402
This one, that one, and this one.

6
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,112
The three people?

7
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,530
This one, that one, and this one.

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:31,448
Who?

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,908
-This one, that one…
-They all have names, you know.

10
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,786
-This one, that one…
-They all have names, you know.

11
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,961
-What?
-"This one, that one, and this one"?

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,046
What was that?

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,506
That's a bit disrespectful.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,717
-It's…
-That doesn't look good for him.

15
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,012
-This one, that one…
-They all have names, you know.

16
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,513
I mean, Hye-seon.

17
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,767
Ha-jeong.

18
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,687
Gyu-ri. Those three.

19
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,856
That was unexpected.

20
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,863
Oh, okay.

21
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,115
This is really awkward.

22
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,116
Interesting.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,201
This is fun.

24
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:20,872
I didn't get why he said it like that
in front of everyone.

25
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,292
It didn't feel so great being chosen
in front of people like that.

26
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,589
He doesn't seem to share
the same values as me,

27
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,674
so it was a little off-putting.

28
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,098
-I understand why that put her off.
-He went too far.

29
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,225
-I agree.
-I'd feel the same way.

30
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,060
What if someone said that to you?

31
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,313
If I were one of the girls,
I'd be so offended.

32
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,190
I would've said something to him.

33
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,733
That was just rude.

34
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,152
-I'd be upset.
-Ha-jeong has been

35
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,987
-quite lenient with him.
-Right.

36
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,407
But I think he took things
too far this time.

37
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:01,329
Gyu-ri may have wanted to get to know him,
but he pointed at three girls like that.

38
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,666
Instead of being happy
that he showed interest in her,

39
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,919
she might think, "I can't believe
he said that. It's so rude."

40
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,046
I think Gwan-hee had a lapse of judgment.

41
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,215
Even if he does think a certain way,

42
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,009
he shouldn't divulge it
when there are people around.

43
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,928
There's a time and place for things.

44
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,972
But he pointed at the three

45
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,932
in front of everyone. That was just…

46
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,644
In his defense,
I think that's just the way he talks.

47
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,438
I think he was trying
to be honest about how he felt,

48
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,357
but it did come out a bit rude.

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,484
-Me? I'm going to change my top.
-I'll change too.

50
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,361
Who wants to get some water with me?

51
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,321
-Me.
-Who wants water?

52
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,239
Let's go.

53
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,740
We should all go.

54
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,741
You two can stay.

55
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,909
Why are you all going?

56
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,584
I don't have any recollection
of our first encounter.

57
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,211
Almost nothing.

58
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,546
You don't either, right?

59
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,048
Me? No, I remember you.

60
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,633
-You do?
-Why wouldn't I?

61
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,889
I was glad to see you here
because you were a familiar face.

62
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,434
You were glad to see me,
but you didn't even say hi?

63
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,438
You didn't.

64
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,191
-Hi, Gwan-hee.
-I mean,

65
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,235
I think the only time we made eye contact

66
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,655
was when we first met and said hi.

67
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,908
I think that was it.

68
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,369
I talked to everyone else,

69
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,498
but you were the only one
that I hadn't talked to.

70
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,335
It made me wonder

71
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,047
why you were avoiding me.

72
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,507
That's how I felt.

73
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,343
So what's the reason?

74
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,054
-Do you think I avoided you?
-I do.

75
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,224
Yes.

76
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,893
Weren't you the one avoiding me?

77
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,521
I never avoided you.

78
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,775
Then, were you waiting for me
to approach you?

79
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,402
Is that what you're hoping for?

80
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,530
No, I didn't get that from you.

81
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,827
I just waited for you
to strike up a conversation with me.

82
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,829
-Really?
-That's how it was for me.

83
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,083
I see.

84
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,380
How many people
do you want to get to know right now?

85
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,925
It could be one person or a few people,

86
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,886
but I can't tell you.

87
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,558
Just one person for you, right?
You gave one piece of candy.

88
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,436
Yes, it was you.

89
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,522
I gave it to you.

90
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,067
You got four, so among the four,

91
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,237
other than Jin-seok…

92
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,739
I guess I didn't do the math right.

93
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,950
You don't seem so quick with numbers.

94
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,121
I'm sorry.
I thought you gave it to someone else.

95
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,082
You were pointing to a few people.

96
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,751
When we played the game earlier,

97
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,753
I wanted to team up with you.

98
00:04:55,837 --> 00:05:02,176
I thought it'd give us the chance
to talk to each other.

99
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,724
I felt like you and I are quite similar.

100
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,143
That's why.

101
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,648
You must be so happy
that you received so many candies.

102
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,734
-No, I'm really…
-You can have them all.

103
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,777
Do you want one?

104
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,904
-Do you want one?
-No.

105
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,197
I don't want your candy.

106
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,000
-My spot is taken.
-What's your plan now?

107
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,084
My plan?

108
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:42,717
I do want to make a decision
as quickly as possible.

109
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,344
I also want to add

110
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,348
that we don't have much time left.

111
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,059
If you're interested in me,

112
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:55,438
we have a lot of catching up to do

113
00:05:55,521 --> 00:06:00,026
because compared to the others,
I feel like we're behind.

114
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,738
Are you saying that if I pick you,

115
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,158
you're willing to give us a try?

116
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,076
Of course.

117
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,079
I… I want to get to know you.

118
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,790
We haven't had a real conversation yet.

119
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,712
At any rate, you started talking to me
quite casually today.

120
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,005
-Yes.
-So…

121
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,675
I'll take that as a sign
that we have become pretty close.

122
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,302
Me too. I like that.

123
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:31,933
I can't say I'm as close to you
as to those I went to Paradise with,

124
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,102
but I think you're in third place now.

125
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,439
What an honor. I'm in third place.

126
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,690
-Right?
-Yes.

127
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,652
-It's not easy to make it on the list.
-No, of course not.

128
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:48,282
I saw Gwan-hee openly expressing
his interest in Gyu-ri,

129
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,701
and it didn't sit right with me.

130
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,912
I'm sure he was somewhat aware of the fact

131
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,624
that I was interested in her
and expressing my feelings to her.

132
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,835
So I didn't appreciate what he did.

133
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,255
Min-young, can we talk?

134
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,215
-Can we talk?
-Sure.

135
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,425
Okay.

136
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,968
-Let me be honest.
-Sure.

137
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,052
I'm all right.

138
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,055
-I just felt bad though.
-Yes?

139
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,182
-Don't feel that way.
-No, the thing is…

140
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,642
I was the one who felt bad.

141
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,978
You can feel free to tell me everything.

142
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,481
-About what?
-I mean, I realized something today.

143
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,276
-We came here to talk to everyone.
-Yes.

144
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,903
-We're here to see who we find attractive.
-Yes.

145
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:30,450
I know we hit it off from the start,

146
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,203
but I don't think that should stop us

147
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,165
from getting to know other people.

148
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,625
So, do you also want to get to know
the other girls?

149
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,294
No, that's not what I'm saying.

150
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,380
I'm bringing this up
because you seemed to feel bad

151
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,549
-Yes.
-about giving candies to other people.

152
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:51,637
I mean, you gave candies
to the other guys,

153
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,764
then you apologized to me.

154
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,766
But you didn't need to apologize.

155
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,227
Let me explain. I was…

156
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,024
No, wait. You don't need to tell me.
You don't have to explain yourself.

157
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:07,278
I think you're
a charming and beautiful woman.

158
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,573
But because of me, I think the guys…

159
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,575
-They were holding back?
-Right.

160
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,952
They found you charming but held back.

161
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:21,751
I felt like I was keeping you from them
as if I were your bodyguard or something.

162
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,211
Even I felt that way.

163
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,463
So don't mind me.

164
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,551
-That was spot-on.
-It probably made her appreciate him more.

165
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,095
-Jin-seok is a stand-up guy.
-He is.

166
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,972
He wants to give Min-young space.

167
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,849
-He's being considerate.
-Right.

168
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,435
So don't mind me.

169
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,478
I also…

170
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,647
So have you had a change of heart?

171
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,106
No, I haven't.

172
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,067
So you're saying this because of me?

173
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,193
Of course.

174
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,528
-Really?
-Yes.

175
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,697
I thought you were saying
we should go for other people.

176
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,032
No, that's not the case.

177
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,201
You're my number one right now.

178
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,494
And…

179
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,331
-What is it?
-Nothing.

180
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,249
Tell me.

181
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,419
-It's nothing.
-You can tell me.

182
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,674
-No, it's just--
-I was a bit annoyed by you.

183
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,801
-A bit.
-By me?

184
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,428
-A bit.
-Why? How so?

185
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,805
Why?

186
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,139
-Why?
-Why?

187
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,226
-Why was she annoyed?
-Can I get a woman's perspective on this?

188
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,978
Did we miss something?

189
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,188
-I'm getting goosebumps.
-Why was she annoyed?

190
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,483
-No, it's just--
-I was a bit annoyed by you.

191
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,610
-A bit.
-By me?

192
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,280
-A bit.
-Why? How so?

193
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,325
I like how you were so open
about your feelings.

194
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,494
-Is that so?
-Yes.

195
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,829
-But…
-But… Okay.

196
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,748
But we seemed so sure
of each other from the start,

197
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,835
and I felt like
you made it a bit too obvious.

198
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,504
It may have been better
if we kept it a bit private,

199
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,590
but it just seemed too obvious.

200
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,800
-Right.
-That bugged me a bit.

201
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,718
You're right.

202
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,095
It's true that you're my number one,

203
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,639
but I kind of want to talk
to the other guys too.

204
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,726
No one knows what will happen,
but I'll be frank with you.

205
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,438
Once you talk to someone else,
you could end up falling for them.

206
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,981
That could happen to you too.

207
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,652
That's a secret, but--

208
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,779
-Why is it a secret? Tell me.
-I'll tell you later.

209
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,739
No, tell me now.

210
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,656
I don't want to.

211
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,991
No, tell me.

212
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,371
Here's how I really feel.

213
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,042
You can get to know other people.

214
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,379
If you find someone better,
you can choose him.

215
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,799
But just know that I'll continue
to try to win you over.

216
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,344
So you'll continue to show interest in me?

217
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,557
I will try to win you over,

218
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,018
but probably not as much as before

219
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,647
since it could prevent the other guys
from approaching you.

220
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,651
I feel like it's the right thing to do.

221
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,070
I appreciate it
but feel disappointed a bit.

222
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,656
-Why… Don't feel that way.
-I have no idea why.

223
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,658
-I don't know why I feel this way.
-Okay.

224
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,120
Anyway, let's go.
Are you going to wash up?

225
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,171
What's wrong?

226
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,548
It's not like that.

227
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,884
Why are you crying? Come on.

228
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,929
Why are you crying?

229
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,806
-Are you drunk?
-I must be drunk.

230
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,433
Let me wipe that for you.

231
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,060
It might ruin your makeup.

232
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,562
Q. WHY DID YOU CRY?

233
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,648
I don't know. It's complicated.

234
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:36,570
And I don't think I fully understood
what he was trying to tell me.

235
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,197
I'm not sure.

236
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,161
I think Min-young wants
to get to know other people,

237
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,288
-But he…
-but she also wants him

238
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,499
to be devoted to her.

239
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,835
-She can cheat, but he can't.
-Exactly.

240
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:55,297
No matter how considerate
and kind-hearted Jin-seok may be,

241
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,133
that's a bit…

242
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,968
It seems like she's sulking.

243
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,885
I think so too.

244
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,390
She was trying to be cute about it,
but for men, there were a few red flags.

245
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,307
She said…

246
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,851
-"Annoyed."
-Yes.

247
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,310
-This was…
-"Disappointed."

248
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,021
I didn't understand what she was saying.

249
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,773
I don't know why she was annoyed.

250
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,860
I found it more annoying
when she gave away four candies.

251
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,986
I know.

252
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:23,325
Jin-seok cleared the air
even when Min-young didn't say anything.

253
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,785
He tried to give her space,

254
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,538
but she kept asking
if he was still going to pick her.

255
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,332
It almost felt like
she was driving the message home.

256
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,251
-She shouldn't have said anything.
-I know.

257
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,212
-I didn't like that.
-She could've just said thanks.

258
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:39,425
You know what?
We're really invested in these people.

259
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,720
Everyone is really upset.

260
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,264
I was shocked by what happened.

261
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,350
We should take into account
that they had drinks.

262
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:53,022
There are times when it's difficult
to fully grasp what's going on.

263
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,608
-She was a bit tipsy.
-She seemed a bit drunk.

264
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,444
It's day four.

265
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,223
Come on out. Breakfast is ready.

266
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,727
-It's bread rolls.
-Do we get a roll

267
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,979
and an apple each?

268
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,607
Can we start eating first?

269
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,150
-Let's eat.
-Okay, let's eat.

270
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,611
You can cut it like this for the guys.

271
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,196
Okay, do you have a knife?

272
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,201
-Be careful.
-Isn't it hard to eat it whole?

273
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,370
I've never had apples like that.

274
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,247
-Really?
-I'm not good with knives.

275
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,164
Have some.

276
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,292
I'm fine with whatever.

277
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,795
This is how you eat it.

278
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,177
-Hello.
-Hi.

279
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,470
-Hi.
-Did you sleep well?

280
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,930
I slept really well.

281
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,015
That was really sweet.

282
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,183
"Did you sleep well?"

283
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,894
Did you sleep well?

284
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,354
I slept really well.

285
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,648
-You should eat.
-Okay.

286
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,066
We have apples.

287
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,861
Do you prefer your apples sliced?

288
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,864
-Yes, where's the knife?
-You can have this.

289
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,782
-Thank you.
-Let's share.

290
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,118
I have to eat as well,
so don't eat all of it.

291
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,748
Did you sleep well?

292
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,834
-Let's sit together.
-Me?

293
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,341
-He's smiling at Min-young.
-Jin-seok thinks she's cute.

294
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,926
Jin-seok is pretty cool.

295
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,177
He has a big heart.

296
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,679
-He does.
-I agree.

297
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,186
Is that good?

298
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,649
Would you like juice or milk?

299
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,276
-Juice, please.
-Juice?

300
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,950
-Would you like something to drink?
-I'll have some juice.

301
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,411
-Do you like orange juice?
-I do.

302
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,539
Thank you.

303
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:25,174
It tastes like it's freshly squeezed.

304
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,723
I keep eating it.

305
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,021
-You're good at peeling apples.
-What?

306
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,690
What a sudden compliment.

307
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,944
I bet you won some apple peeling contest.

308
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,365
No, I'm not that good.

309
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,826
I just eat them every day,
so I know how it's done.

310
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,500
What is it?

311
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,587
-"What is it?"
-She's making a move.

312
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,965
I can see the look
in her eyes despite her hair.

313
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:06,882
Me too.

314
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,176
What is it?

315
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,428
It's the way you said it.

316
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,013
Me?

317
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,556
-You're good.
-That's it.

318
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,350
-That's the look.
-"What is it?"

319
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,063
I love Jin-seok.

320
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,025
-You're good.
-That's it.

321
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,527
-That's the look.
-"What is it?"

322
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:29,947
"What about me?"

323
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,995
That's a good impression. You're funny.

324
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,706
-Let's hold a mirror match.
-It's on.

325
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,457
-A mirror match?
-"It's on."

326
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,209
That was so coy.

327
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,338
It seemed like a light breakfast,
but I'm full.

328
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,256
Right?

329
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,925
-Hello.
-Hi.

330
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,428
What do you think will happen now?

331
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,595
I have no idea.

332
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,097
Who are you interested in?

333
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,390
I'd have to say

334
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,600
either Won-ik or…

335
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,229
I can't even guess Min-woo's job.

336
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,939
-Me neither.
-And…

337
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,942
-I'm curious to know his job.
-Me too.

338
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,778
What if he was born in the 2000s?

339
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,572
I want to know how old he is.

340
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,866
I have so many questions for Min-woo.

341
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,910
I'm really curious
to find out what he's like,

342
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,912
so I thought about picking him,

343
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,206
but I eventually didn't.

344
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,750
So…

345
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,128
They all seem
to want to get to know Min-woo now.

346
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:31,216
He's mysterious to them right now,
so they find him quite intriguing.

347
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,676
Yes, he's quiet too.

348
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,595
I wanted to go with Ha-bin.

349
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,680
-And?
-But he's a bit off-putting.

350
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,807
-Yes, he is.
-I get it.

351
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,935
Right? I sensed he was odd
during the bonfire last night.

352
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,937
I'll be your host for the day.

353
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,230
LAST NIGHT

354
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,523
I'll start the fire.

355
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,401
I'll charge double for the rooms.

356
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,528
Man, this is hard.

357
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,531
I already told you I'd charge you double.

358
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,825
He's a total stud.

359
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,954
Ha-bin, where are you going?

360
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,461
-Goodness, Ha-bin.
-My gosh.

361
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,546
-That was…
-Oh, my.

362
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,757
It's because of the candy.

363
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,509
-What?
-It's because he got so many.

364
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,052
-Ha-bin?
-That's why.

365
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,637
-He got a lot of candies?
-Yes.

366
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,055
Did you vote for him?

367
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,139
Am I allowed to ask?

368
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,516
-I did.
-I did.

369
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,517
-You did?
-You did?

370
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,393
-Me too.
-You did?

371
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,853
-I did.
-That means everyone.

372
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,854
That makes five.

373
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,439
He got it from all five of us?

374
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,774
-All five.
-Everyone.

375
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,234
I said it was four or five.

376
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,069
He got five candies… Listen.

377
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,946
-Listen.
-Okay.

378
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,115
-I said I voted for one person.
-Yes.

379
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:41,245
And he asked if I was willing
to go to Paradise with the one I chose.

380
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,706
-I'm getting chills.
-So that's why he asked that.

381
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,709
I see.
It was about going to Paradise with him.

382
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,419
So that's why he asked you.

383
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,756
When I told him I was willing to,

384
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,216
his face brightened up.

385
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,679
I bet he was thrilled to get
all the votes after two days in Inferno.

386
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,013
Since everyone chose him,

387
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,266
he knows the girl he picked
also picked him.

388
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,726
-Exactly.
-But that's not why we chose him.

389
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,646
-I know, right?
-Yes.

390
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,772
They all know it now.

391
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,482
This is crazy.

392
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,278
During the bonfire,
when I said I picked four,

393
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,030
Ha-bin told Jin-seok to control his woman.

394
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,117
It seems like they are trying
to force you two to happen.

395
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,660
-Don't you think so?
-I do.

396
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,621
I'm interested in him,
but I don't want it to feel forced.

397
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,831
That's my business.

398
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,958
-Exactly.
-Yes.

399
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,376
Last night,

400
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,297
-did Gwan-hee talk to you?
-What did he say?

401
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,633
He must've felt awkward
after picking three people.

402
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,927
I had my makeup wiped
and he was waiting for me.

403
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,555
He said he wanted
to talk to me for a minute.

404
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:45,517
He told me that he wanted
to go to Paradise with Gyu-ri

405
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,811
because he wanted to get to know her.

406
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,440
He also said he wanted
to go with Ha-jeong or me

407
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,025
because he felt comfortable around us.

408
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,611
And although he talked
to Gyu-ri a lot today,

409
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,071
it didn't mean
he didn't want to go with me.

410
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,156
When he said that,

411
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,366
-it felt like I was his backup plan.
-Exactly.

412
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,411
-You're right.
-He always has a backup plan.

413
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,788
-It's ridiculous.
-You know what he told me?

414
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,957
Oh, no.

415
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,042
This is bad.

416
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,171
I went to his room
and told him to come outside.

417
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,964
Then, he came out and told me

418
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:21,178
that I earned points
for taking the initiative

419
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,596
and approaching him first.

420
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,307
It's hilarious
that he equally likes three people.

421
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,768
-That was pretty ridiculous.
-Did he think

422
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,520
that we would be happy about that?

423
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,358
Oh, right. You know what he told me?
He said I was avoiding him.

424
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,196
He thinks that's why we never
had a chance to talk.

425
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,156
So I was like, "What?"

426
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,283
I couldn't care less about him.

427
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,952
This is ridiculous.

428
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,791
This is a scary room.

429
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,042
That was savage.

430
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,252
This room is scary.

431
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,880
Some people tend to be reserved,
but they're open about everything.

432
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,507
-Right?
-Goodness.

433
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,551
-I'm staying out of this.
-This is why you need to be good to women.

434
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,304
I'm staying out of this. I'm done.

435
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,350
I'm going to confront him
and ask what he's trying to do.

436
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,436
I almost said that to him
when we talked yesterday.

437
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,563
I have it up to here right now.

438
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,525
I'm the type who has to say
what's on my mind.

439
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,402
-I can't hold back.
-Look at her.

440
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,528
She's ready to go.

441
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,738
I'm dying for a one-on-one date.

442
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,741
I like Jin-seok when I talk to him,

443
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,412
but I hate it when people set us up.

444
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,080
I know I'm weird.

445
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,040
-I get it.
-Yes.

446
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,750
-I understand.
-Yes.

447
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,378
Gwan-hee is the most absurd one.

448
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,172
-He is. We need a villain like him.
-His actions…

449
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,301
-It's amusing to have someone like him.
-We need a villain.

450
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,887
Anyway, in his little scheme,
she and I are his backup plan.

451
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,142
Does he honestly think
we can't see right through him?

452
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:54,396
He kept telling me
at least one or two people would pick him.

453
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,023
He was quite sure of that.

454
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,067
-How confident.
-He's very confident.

455
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,110
And then…

456
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:04,614
He implied that he would choose the one
who showed the most interest in him.

457
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,658
He said something similar to me too.

458
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,829
He asked why I didn't take
the initiative to talk to him first.

459
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,789
He wants someone to pursue him.

460
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,709
Yes, he kept talking with that notion.

461
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,045
He wanted me
to keep showing interest in him,

462
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:22,007
but he never said he would choose me.

463
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,468
He just said there may be a possibility.

464
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,094
It's ridiculous.

465
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,063
Gosh, I can't breathe.

466
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,398
They're so open about it.

467
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,484
-They've teamed up.
-Gwan-hee is done.

468
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,401
Everyone is…

469
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,988
I hope Gwan-hee goes abroad
or something when this episode airs.

470
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,990
-Like an away game.
-Yes.

471
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,035
-He needs to go far away.
-A place with no phone signal.

472
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,244
Somewhere off the grid.

473
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,538
The basketball season is in the winter.

474
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,623
-That's good.
-Yes.

475
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,500
This is only the fourth day.

476
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,210
What will happen to Gwan-hee?

477
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,546
I said on day one
that he'd end up in tears.

478
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:07,386
To be frank,
I think he brought it on himself.

479
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,429
He's reaping the consequences

480
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,764
-of his actions.
-I agree.

481
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:14,101
They may have feelings for him,
but they're also mad.

482
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:18,021
During the bonfire, there was tension
between Ha-jeong and Hye-seon,

483
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,816
then Gyu-ri got involved,
and they all found out.

484
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,819
-The pent-up feelings burst open.
-I think so too.

485
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,989
They kept it bottled up
until one person mentioned it.

486
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,033
-Then, it all came out.
-That's right.

487
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:34,204
But is it just me?
I have a feeling that despite everything,

488
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,832
one of them will end up becoming a couple…

489
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,291
-With Gwan-hee.
-Definitely.

490
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,669
-I have a feeling it'll happen.
-Me too.

491
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,878
Who will it be?

492
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,463
-I say Ha-jeong.
-I think so too.

493
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,548
Me too.

494
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,632
After what she said?

495
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,342
-I think so.
-She'll take him back.

496
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,761
-What do you take her for?
-No, just watch.

497
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,097
-I really think…
-She's that feisty.

498
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,641
-She may be upset…
-She'll hold his hand again?

499
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,436
If Gwan-hee comes back and calls her name,

500
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,604
she'll act reluctant but go to him.

501
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,441
-I think that'll happen.
-Me too.

502
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,903
-Is this all we get?
-Who wants chicken breast?

503
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:07,863
Chicken breast?

504
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,868
-Give it to me.
-How do I…

505
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,411
-Do you need help?
-Thanks.

506
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,788
Did you hear Min-woo's voice?

507
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:17,956
"Do you need help?"

508
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,624
-Give it to me.
-How…

509
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,750
-Do you need help?
-Thanks.

510
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,337
It's delicious.

511
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,591
You don't want the oil, right?

512
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,633
I don't.

513
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,387
Thanks.

514
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,763
It's all gone.

515
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,349
It looked like fish food
when it had oil in it.

516
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,726
It was quite oily.

517
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,651
So you eat the skin too.

518
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,030
Yes, I do. I prefer the skin.

519
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,574
-Do you want this?
-What?

520
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,076
-I got a lot.
-Here, I have some too.

521
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,537
-Help yourself.
-I don't like it by itself.

522
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,206
I was saving it for later.

523
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,332
I'll eat it later.

524
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,754
There was a mosquito in our room
but I wasn't bit.

525
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,671
-Really?
-Yes.

526
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,590
-I also saw a cockroach.
-What?

527
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,300
-What?
-He caught it.

528
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,970
-A cockroach.
-I came outside, and I saw her screaming.

529
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,972
You heard me, but you didn't come.

530
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,849
I'll come running.

531
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,101
Please scream again.

532
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,853
Let ten roaches loose.

533
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,857
I love Jin-seok.

534
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,151
He's so manly.

535
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,278
That's not something you can learn.

536
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,989
-You should learn from him.
-Yes, he's hilarious.

537
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,283
"Let ten roaches loose."

538
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,536
"Please scream again." Things like that.

539
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,412
You're teaching me a lot.

540
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,959
You're such an introvert.

541
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,043
-What?
-An introvert.

542
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:45,961
I see.

543
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,131
-Respond a little.
-"I see."

544
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,051
Do you need a bigger response?

545
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,512
Things like, "That's interesting."

546
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,142
I feel awkward in the spotlight.

547
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,981
You become more manly
after a drink or two.

548
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,275
-Really?
-You get an intense look in your eyes.

549
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,444
-What?
-Min-woo may get the wrong idea

550
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:15,282
about Hye-seon after that interaction.
He may think she's interested in him.

551
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,950
I think she is.

552
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,119
She did say she was curious about him.

553
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,998
-That's why Si-eun is a bit uncomfortable.
-She's keeping an eye on them.

554
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,208
You get an intense look in your eyes.

555
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,420
He's usually like a puppy,

556
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,880
but after a drink,
his eyes were like this.

557
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,799
He was glaring.

558
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,551
Like this.

559
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,012
-I did that?
-Yes.

560
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,098
Maybe he was trying
not to pass out after the third shot.

561
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,393
-I probably was drunk after three shots.
-Or five shots?

562
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,895
No, I think I had a bottle or two.

563
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,732
Won-ik, did you drink a lot yesterday?

564
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,984
No. I just had one or two glasses of beer.

565
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,235
Can't you hold your alcohol?

566
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,696
-I have a low tolerance.
-You don't like to drink?

567
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,073
I still like drinking
every once in a while.

568
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,792
What was that eye contact?

569
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,294
-Oh, my.
-Gosh.

570
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,962
-Won-ik was…
-What?

571
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,465
-Won-ik was talking.
-What's going on?

572
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,967
…but my face turns red quickly.

573
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,179
You can't tell with Min-woo though.

574
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,726
Si-eun and I kept
making eye contact as we ate,

575
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,811
and I couldn't help but look at her.

576
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,483
What about you? Do you drink…

577
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,276
I can't drink.

578
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,823
Appearance-wise,
Min-woo is closest to being my ideal type.

579
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,494
So I thought I needed
to approach him more actively.

580
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,289
This is delicious.

581
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,166
-The sweet potato?
-Yes.

582
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,085
Can you peel one for me?

583
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,044
I don't want to.

584
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,052
Do we have ice water here?

585
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,430
You sound so entitled.

586
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,893
I started out in Paradise,
and I think that spoiled me.

587
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,438
You'll be spending a lot of time here,
so you should get acclimated.

588
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,946
That was a huge blow.

589
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,447
Shots fired.

590
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,367
-If she didn't like him, she'd ignore him.
-You're right.

591
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,536
-Gosh.
-That was harsh.

592
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,954
They're like siblings.

593
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,956
-We're like siblings?
-Yes.

594
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,916
We wouldn't even talk if we were siblings.

595
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,919
I'll be the judge.

596
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,672
I've been patient with him so far.

597
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,008
What? When were you patient with me?

598
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,761
I put up with you because I'm so nice.

599
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,430
Who else would put up with you?

600
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,227
What was it like in Paradise for you two?

601
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,981
-Things were great in the morning.
-Yes, things were great then.

602
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,066
-I see.
-It was awkward in the evening.

603
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,861
We fought the night before.
She scolded me.

604
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,196
I did not. He gaslighted me.

605
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,157
Don't say things like that!

606
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,659
He was like, "Just drink that!"

607
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,911
I was really flustered.

608
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,123
He took a blanket and slept outside
to show that he was upset.

609
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,710
I kept telling him to come back inside,

610
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,379
but he was so stubborn
and didn't come inside.

611
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,839
But I made myself clear.

612
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,843
Things were already awkward,
so I couldn't go back.

613
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,845
That's why I reached out first.

614
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,723
I told you.
You should've dragged me back in.

615
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,767
You're expecting way too much.

616
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,770
I offered you an olive branch,
but you didn't take it.

617
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,564
You can't always take.
That's being selfish.

618
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,858
My ears are about to bleed
from both sides.

619
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,693
He's adorable.

620
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,779
-Great timing.
-Oh, no.

621
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,572
Make them stop fighting.

622
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,033
Counsel, make your counterargument.

623
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,452
-It's funny, right?
-Yes.

624
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,495
I lost.

625
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,081
They'll need
a couples counseling session today.

626
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,962
Gwan-hee let her win this one.

627
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:02,383
Ha-jeong still has feelings for him,
so it looked more like a lovers' quarrel.

628
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,468
-Yes.
-It felt like it.

629
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:07,514
If she wasn't interested,
she wouldn't want to talk to him.

630
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,599
Yes, she was just irritated.

631
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,352
I think she still has feelings for him.

632
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,687
Ha-jeong only has eyes for Gwan-hee.

633
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,605
Stop it.

634
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,858
I just heard that…

635
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,984
And?

636
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:20,944
That startled me.

637
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,450
That startled me.

638
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,660
Choi Min-woo.

639
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,832
Go to the beach
on the other side of the island.

640
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:34,916
-What?
-The other side?

641
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,252
-What?
-No way.

642
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,211
What is it?

643
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,213
The other side?

644
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,798
-What's on the other side?
-Wait.

645
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,216
-Is someone else here?
-Again?

646
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,635
They do need one more woman.

647
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,554
-I wonder what it is.
-Right?

648
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,933
I think a new participant is here.

649
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,686
Oh, my god! I'm so scared!

650
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,979
No way!

651
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,523
-I think she's right.
-What a surprise.

652
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,572
-It's a new member.
-I just got chills.

653
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,781
-Gosh.
-Me too.

654
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,575
Oh, my.

655
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,461
Hello.

656
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,388
Hi.

657
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,514
-Hello.
-Hello.

658
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,058
Isn't it hot?

659
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,145
Hello, my name is Cho Min-ji.

660
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,941
Goodness, she's really pretty.

661
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,736
She's going to be a game changer.

662
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,654
Gosh, this is…

663
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:51,784
My charms? I'm cute and positive,
and I have a nice butt.

664
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,495
I was blessed with good genes.

665
00:31:55,788 --> 00:32:00,251
When I was in school,
everyone knew of Cho Min-ji from Yeouido.

666
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,171
That's just what I heard.

667
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,884
When I put on makeup and get dressed up,

668
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,679
there's at least one guy
who tries to hit on me.

669
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,560
You all believe me, right?
This is awkward.

670
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,979
I decided to join the show

671
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:24,025
in hopes of meeting someone truly amazing

672
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,986
who will blow my mind.

673
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:32,575
There must be a reason why
I'm joining the show at the halfway mark.

674
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,828
Let me make an acrostic poem
with my initials.

675
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,498
Min-ji is here to captivate you.

676
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,166
Jiggle over my way.

677
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,088
She's serious competition.

678
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,422
He's attracted to her.

679
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,715
Gosh, don't look.

680
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,467
When she looked into the camera…

681
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,345
-I was shaken.
-He got really excited.

682
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,682
-I mean…
-I'm starting to sweat.

683
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,851
Do you know what came
to my mind as soon as I saw her?

684
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,772
She seemed like a combination
of the five other women.

685
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,232
Really?

686
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,026
-That's hard to beat.
-You're smitten by her, aren't you?

687
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,195
-No, I'm not.
-You can be honest.

688
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,990
She seems quite bubbly,
and she has a great figure.

689
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,950
She is quite attractive in many ways.

690
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,996
-I can't wait to see her in action.
-The guys are going to love her.

691
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,081
They'll be smitten by her instantly.

692
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,290
She's a new face.

693
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,792
The ladies should buckle up.

694
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,669
-It's going to be tough.
-Yes.

695
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,255
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

CHO MIN-JI & CHOI MIN-WOO

697
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,549
What's your name?

698
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,883
I'm Cho Min-ji.

699
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,218
-Cho Min-ji?
-Yes.

700
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,177
I'm Choi Min-woo.

701
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,262
-Choi Min-woo.
-Yes.

702
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,931
-I heard it on the announcement.
-Really?

703
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,058
You must be rather nervous.

704
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,059
Yes, I am.

705
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,602
-It's nerve-racking, right?
-It is.

706
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,147
It must feel awkward
to show up in the middle.

707
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,773
What do I do?

708
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,069
It's not easy on the first day.
I was nervous too.

709
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:54,240
-You're right.
-I hope you can relax a little.

710
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,825
Right. Thank you.

711
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,076
I feel more at ease.

712
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,453
-Really? Now?
-Yes.

713
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,788
-You'll fit in fine.
-Okay.

714
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,249
-If you get nervous…
-Help me.

715
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,626
-Help me fit in.
-Sure, I'll help you.

716
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,005
Nice to meet you.
I'm a resident of Inferno.

1:1 DATE
CHO MIN-JI & PARK MIN-KYU

718
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,800
Don't worry.
There's a lot to look forward to.

719
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,093
-Really?
-Yes.

720
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,303
I really feel better.

721
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,305
-I was a bit worried.
-It's okay.

722
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,931
It seems like something's--

723
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,058
Lee Gwan-hee.

724
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,269
Go to the beach
on the other side of the island.

725
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,687
-I'll be back.
-Good luck.

726
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,772
I'll be quick.

727
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,026
Look how excited Gwan-hee is.

728
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,321
"Look how excited Gwan-hee is."

729
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,074
Oh, no. I think he's now…

730
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,577
-That's his reputation now.
-He's that guy.

731
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,247
Don't you think she still finds him cute
when she says things like that?

732
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,041
-Either that or…
-I guess.

733
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,009
Hello.

734
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,263
-You've been sitting here for a while.
-How did you know?

735
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,807
1:1 DATE
CHO MIN-JI & LEE GWAN-HEE

736
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,935
-There are beverages too.
-There are.

737
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,438
Thanks to you, I get to drink this.

738
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,108
So what's your name?

739
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,485
Why aren't you asking my name?

740
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,404
Because you didn't ask mine.

741
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,697
What's your name?

742
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,782
I'm Cho Min-ji.

743
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,950
-Min-ji?
-Yes.

744
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,451
That's an easy name.

745
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,161
-Yes.
-Mine's not so easy to remember.

746
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,997
-What's your name?
-I'm Gwan-hee.

747
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,582
-Gwan-hee?
-Yes, Lee Gwan-hee.

748
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,875
-Lee Gwan-hee?
-Yes.

749
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,085
I can remember that.

750
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,255
I mean, Min-ji is a common name, right?

751
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,172
Yes.

752
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,800
But Gwan-hee isn't a common one.

753
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,427
-There's--
-You look like a Gwan-hee.

754
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,266
Gosh. She's right, though.

755
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,726
That's how a Gwan-hee should look.

756
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,020
You look like a Gwan-hee.

757
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,149
Your name suits you.

758
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,359
What does it mean to look like a Gwan-hee?

759
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,777
-Like you.
-I see.

760
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,487
Thanks.

761
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:00,741
If I run into you
either today or tomorrow,

762
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,286
I'll see if you remember my name.

763
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,834
The color of your outfit matches this.

764
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,711
Really? It's more like this.

765
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,297
I've never seen anyone
wear this color before.

766
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,048
-In your life?
-Yes, in my life.

767
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,259
-I've only seen this color
-Today's your day.

768
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,552
on hats or accessories.

769
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,803
Do I look good in this?

770
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,807
Yes, you look like grass.
You remind me of grass.

771
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,519
-You said I look like a Gwan-hee.
-That was a compliment.

772
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,562
-Me too.
-Really?

773
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,106
Grass is pretty.

774
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,149
It is.

775
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,361
No one dresses like you,
so you'll stand out.

776
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,536
My ideal type is
someone who's calm and gentle.

777
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,706
I had a feeling Min-ji might be that woman

778
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,626
from our first conversation.

779
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,924
Gosh, Gwan-hee. I love you.

780
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,092
Is this a sitcom or what?

781
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,928
-Now it's 25% each.
-Yes, it is.

782
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,387
Now, it's 25%.

783
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,724

-Right.

787
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,189

788
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,357
Is it fun?

789
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,025
It's really fun.

790
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,443
-Really?
-Yes.

791
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,196
-Can I look forward to it?
-You can.

792
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,739
-Really?
-Yes.

793
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,075

-Yun Ha-bin?

794
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,618
-Yes.
-I'm Cho Min-ji.

00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,619

00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,083
Is he serious?

799
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,584
-Ha-bin.
-Dipsy?

800
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,127
Ha-bin, please stop.

801
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,629
Dipsy from Teletubbies.

802
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,298
-Were you going for a Dipsy look?
-What?

803
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,341
No, I wasn't.

804
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,510
-I was going for a fresh look.
-Really?

805
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,761
"Dipsy"?

806
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,137
Wait.

807
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,472
-Do I look like Dipsy?
-No.

808
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,848
It's… I love the color.

809
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,600
-Liar.
-I mean it. I'm serious.

810
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,768

Hello.

814
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,610
-Go, Jin-seok.
-Jin-seok.

815
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,736
You've got this.

816
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,904
It'll be interesting.

817
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,907
This is going to be quite interesting.

818
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,035
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

819
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,162
-Have you been well?
-Pardon?

820
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,330
Have you been well?

821
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,415
Have I been well?

822
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,874
-Yes.
-What do you mean?

823
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,334
I was just being polite.

824
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,300
Can we exchange names?

825
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,552

-Yes.

828
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,723
-What's yours?
-I'm Cho Min-ji.

829
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,765
Min-ji.

830
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,935
Someone said I looked like grass.

831
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:33,936
-This dress?
-Yes.

832
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,938
And someone else called me Dipsy.

833
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,690
-Dipsy?
-Isn't that awful?

834
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,650
That's a little…

835
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,237
I think he was joking
when he said I looked like Dipsy.

836
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,281
The name was just so nostalgic.

837
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,949
I loved Teletubbies as a kid.

838
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,075
-Me too.
-Really?

839
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,994
-Yes.
-I was a huge fan.

840
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,287
-Me too.
-Really?

841
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,289
-Yes.
-I even had the stuffed dolls.

842
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,957
-May I have one?
-They're gone.

843
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,251
-I liked Tinky Winky.
-I liked Tinky Winky too.

844
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,670
I see. What else do you like?

845
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,130
-Other than Tinky Winky?
-Yes.

846
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,507
-No, not from Teletubbies.
-What am I saying?

847
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,929
Since we're talking about your outfit,
you look great in that dress.

848
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,348
-I do?
-Yes.

849
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,016
That color is hard to pull off.

850
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,228
I'm getting nervous.

851
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,106
This is new.

852
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,234
Is she doing something to Jin-seok?

853
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,364
She gives off similar vibes as Min-young.

854
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,616
-The bubbly type.
-Yes, right.

855
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,994
It's tough to pull this off,
but you look great in it.

856
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,121
-Thank you.
-Sure.

857
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,333
-Do I get anything in return?
-This is all I have to offer.

858
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,376
Thank you.

859
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,921
When I first met Min-ji,

860
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:48,010
I found her quite cute and charming.

861
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,062
Hi.

862
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,064
-Hi. Did it go well?
-Yes.

863
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,482
How was it?

864
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,275
That was really different.

865
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,194
-A newcomer.
-You were the last one.

866
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,362
So? How is she?

867
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,990
She seems very nice.

868
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,827
She seems completely different
from the ladies here.

869
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,578
And you like the nice type.

870
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,207
-Are you interrogating me?
-No, I'm just asking.

871
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,293
-Are you interrogating me?
-No, I'm just asking.

872
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,712
-You like nice girls.
-We all have…

873
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,214
Won-ik is escaping.

874
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,508
-He's leaving.
-"This is awkward. I should go."

875
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,010
-He's quite sharp.
-He's quick.

876
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:35,266
-You like nice girls.
-We all have different charms.

877
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,728
Who knows, though?
I just met her, after all.

878
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,817
-Why? Are you nervous?
-Why?

879
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,901
I'm not nervous.

880
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,069
-You look nervous.
-No.

881
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,654
-You do.
-I'm not.

882
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,865
-Are you interrogating me?
-I am.

883
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:57,621
You're silly.

884
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,458
I'll take it that you're nervous.

885
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,544
As you wish. Which do you prefer?

886
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,753
You should be nervous.

887
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,132
I guess just a little.

888
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,425
-What?
-A little.

889
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,927
-What was that?
-I shouldn't be nervous.

890
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,347
-Be nice to him while he's still around.
-Exactly.

891
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,475
-Or she might lose him.
-Yes.

892
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,523
Today, the opportunity
to select a partner for Paradise

893
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,526
will only be given
to the new female participant.

894
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,445
-I saw this coming.
-Min-ji.

895
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,407
-Who do you think will go?
-I have no idea. I just…

896
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,952
-I wonder who she'll pick.
-In a moment,

897
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,664
she will pick two male participants
and leave for Paradise right away.

898
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,124
-Two male participants?
-Two?

899
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,584
Everyone…

900
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,503
-What?
-Two people?

901
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,087
-Two men?
-She'll pick two?

902
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,631
Two…

903
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,885
We didn't even get a chance
to meet her yet.

904
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,802
I know.

905
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,640
First, I was jealous
that she got to go to Paradise.

906
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,644
And even more jealous
that she was going with two guys.

907
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:06,440
How are things going to be
if she's in Paradise with two men?

908
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,608
I was…

909
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,277
I got curious, and it sounded interesting.

910
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,072
-This is a first.
-Right.

911
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,741
She'll choose two men
and go to Paradise with them.

912
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,701
Who will she pick?

913
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,828
I hope Jin-seok gets to go this time.

914
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,913
-Me too.
-Me too.

915
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,083
Then Min-young can talk to the other guys
without Jin-seok around.

916
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,085
-I'm sure Jin-seok will go.
-Yes.

917
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:29,171
If I must choose another,
I think it'll be Gwan-hee.

918
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,173
-I had that feeling.
-I think so too.

919
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,425
-Do you think so?
-I say Min-woo and Gwan-hee.

920
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,344
-Right? Wait, who?
-Those two?

921
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,512
Min-woo and Gwan-hee?

922
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,099
-I also think Gwan-hee will go.
-Gwan-hee has a nice first impression.

923
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,642
She may have liked him.

924
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,935
Yes, he's the funny one.

925
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,103
-Yes.
-He's funny.

926
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,105
All of us think Gwan-hee will go.

927
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,648
-Yes.
-Yes, you're right.

928
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:53,195
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

929
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:15,134
The first person
I'd like to go to Paradise with is…

930
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,388
The first person is…

931
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,098
-Why am I on edge?
-Me too.

932
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,726
-I'm nervous. Who will it be?
-I'm not even involved.

933
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,227
Yes, we feel nervous too.

934
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,233
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.

935
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,401
Exactly.

936
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,321
Jin-seok seems nervous.

937
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,489
-Yes, right?
-He must've liked her.

938
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,407
-Yes.
-Awesome.

939
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,325
This is great.

940
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,618
This is awesome.

941
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,290
I have a feeling it'll be Jin-seok.
He's a funny guy.

942
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,334
Yes.

943
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,301
The first person is…

944
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,511
Just say it already.

945
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,973
Choi Min-woo.

946
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,308
Choi Min-woo.

947
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,728
-What?
-Yes.

948
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,896
Min-woo's going.

949
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,022
I knew he'd go.

950
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,650
-I knew it.
-Just as we thought.

951
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,110
-Min-woo's going.
-Choi Min-woo.

952
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,071
Please step outside your lodging.

953
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,657
Gosh, Min-woo's going to Paradise.

954
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,003
Hello.

955
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,465
Hello.

956
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,887
We meet again.

957
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,394
Then it'll be either Gwan-hee or Jin-seok.

958
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,853
I think it's Gwan-hee.

959
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,355
-Gwan-hee?
-Yes.

960
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,523
Please pick Jin-seok.

961
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,109
-Yes, I hope she picks him.
-Yes.

962
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:59,697
The second person
I'd like to go to Paradise with is…

963
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,085
The second person is…

964
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,463
My palms are sweaty.

965
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:23,971
The second person
I'd like to go to Paradise with is…

966
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,266
Lee Jin-seok.

967
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,185
What is this?

968
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,437
Jin-seok!

969
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,149
Guys, why are we clapping?

970
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,860
I can go home now.

971
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,403
He should go.

972
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,156
-It's Min-young's chance too.
-Good one.

973
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,533
This will be her chance
to talk to the other guys.

974
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,452
-That was gratifying.
-Seriously.

975
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,620
-Yes.
-He needs to show off his charm.

976
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,290
Lee Jin-seok.

977
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,207
What?

978
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,169
Lee Jin-seok,
please step outside your lodging.

979
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,004
Lee Jin-seok.

980
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:57,921
What?

981
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,382
Lee Jin-seok,
please step outside your lodging.

982
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,885
Jin-seok? Actually, I had a feeling.

983
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,680
He's the opposite of Min-woo,
so I thought it might be him.

984
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:13,979
Hello.

985
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,276
-Hello.
-Hello.

986
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:33,999
Jin-seok could suddenly fall for her
and decide to go all-in.

987
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,710
-That could happen.
-Yes.

988
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,962
-Min-young doesn't deserve to say that.
-No.

989
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,506
She feels anxious now.

990
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,925
Think that anything could happen.

991
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,218
-What?
-Anything could happen.

992
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,512
-Right.
-So you won't be caught off guard.

993
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,185
Shall we get going?

994
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,399
Down there.

995
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,609
-Down there?
-Yes.

996
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,653
I've never been down there.

997
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,154
-Oh, my.
-Careful.

998
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,323
-Okay.
-Hold my back as you walk down.

999
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,241
Wait.

1000
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,034
-Thank you.
-Watch your step.

1001
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,829
-Gosh.
-Walk where there's more sand.

1002
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:12,955
Maybe I should.

1003
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,206
You might get hurt.

1004
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,543
I still haven't met the girls yet.

1005
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,919
-Right.
-I guess you didn't know.

1006
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,504
-No.
-None of them, right?

1007
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,715
Starting tomorrow, you'll get to spend
a lot of time with them.

1008
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,133
They're all nice.

1009
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,468
I'm nice too.

1010
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,469
You seem so.

1011
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,680
You're the nicest one.

1012
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,601
She really picked the two opposites.

1013
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,144
Gosh, she did.

1014
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,729
-Paradise will be fun.
-It will be.

1015
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,565
-Jin-seok is a fun one.
-Yes.

1016
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,944
So Min-woo ended up
going to Paradise today.

1017
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,405
Right. I'm the only one
who hasn't gone yet.

1018
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,032
Those two are polar opposites.

1019
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,995
She took a puppy and a wolf.

1020
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,085
I'm in shock.

1021
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,634
I wanted a chance
to talk to Min-woo today,

1022
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,469
but he went to Paradise.

1023
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,013
And it isn't just for a few hours.

1024
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,891
He's going to spend the night
and return tomorrow.

1025
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,019
We didn't get to spend
much time here together,

1026
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,855
so I couldn't help but think
that it was a bummer.

1027
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,318
That's how much Si-eun is into him now.

1028
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,988
She wanted to talk to him,
but he left for Paradise.

1029
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,072
-Right?
-Yes.

1030
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,658
They finally began to interact
with each other.

1031
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:36,455
Both Si-eun and Min-young,
who are left behind, look a little…

1032
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,624
-I can see how insecure they feel.
-Right.

1033
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:42,544
Everything will depend on
how the two guys change

1034
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,672
-after they return from Paradise.
-You're right.

1035
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:49,176
I think so much will change
now that Min-ji has joined.

1036
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,093
-Yes.
-Right.

1037
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,514
Can we stay inside?

1038
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,392
Why?

1039
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,979
Come sit. I'm your only chance
to come inside our lodging.

1040
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,732
I must seem unpopular to you.

1041
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,484
You seem popular.

1042
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,526
-You think so?
-Yes.

1043
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,986
Then you guessed correctly.

1044
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,947
-Yes, you look popular.
-I am.

1045
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,325
-Ha-jeong.
-You see that?

1046
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,120
Gosh, Ha-jeong belongs with Gwan-hee.

1047
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,248
So what's on your mind?

1048
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,291
-Me?
-Yes.

1049
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,460
I…

1050
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,087
I…

1051
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:29,299
I can't seem to figure you out
ever since we came back.

1052
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,010
-From Paradise?
-Yes, ever since we got back.

1053
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,261
-You and me?
-Yes.

1054
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,391
What are your thoughts lately?

1055
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,519
I'm not so sure about how I feel.

1056
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,400
And you're curious
about many things, right?

1057
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,737
Well, first off,

1058
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:54,741
I said that I was interested
in three people yesterday.

1059
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,494
-Yes.
-Having made that announcement,

1060
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:02,249
I thought one of the three
would either approach me or--

1061
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,251
Why don't you think to approach first?

1062
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:08,130
I thought I already made a move
by pointing out the three people.

1063
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,381
-But--
-I don't think so.

1064
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:13,760
But among the three,
if Gyu-ri wanted to get to know me too--

1065
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,139
You said that you were
equally interested in the three of us.

1066
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:20,809
It didn't feel so great
hearing that from you. And you…

1067
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:24,021
Anyway, in my opinion,
you shouldn't have said that there.

1068
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,483
-Exactly.
-What Ha-jeong says is right.

1069
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,528
-He needs to learn a lesson.
-He needs a reality check.

1070
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,490
Here's how we took it.

1071
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,245
"Now that I've made my announcement,
it's your turn to make a move."

1072
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,288
That's how it felt.

1073
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,665
-You know?
-That's what I meant.

1074
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:44,583
-Exactly.
-Yes.

1075
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,711
That didn't motivate us to do anything.
I mean, why should we?

1076
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,965
Then, are you saying--

1077
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:56,011
Think of it from a woman's perspective.
Women want guys to make the first move.

1078
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,222
I mean, let's be honest here.

1079
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,392
We're all pretty,
and plenty of guys hit on us.

1080
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,437
-Did you hear that?
-Goodness, Ha-jeong.

1081
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,731
-She really is the best.
-She has a point.

1082
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,941
-I really like her.
-She's so honest.

1083
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,446
We're all pretty,
and plenty of guys hit on us.

1084
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,115
So all you did
was offend us by saying that.

1085
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,577
What if I said this?

1086
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,247
"I like Gwan-hee,
so-and-so, and so-and-so."

1087
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,292
"I'd like to get to know
all three of you guys."

1088
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,544
You'd feel the same way, wouldn't you?

1089
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,463
Try thinking of it in my shoes.

1090
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:37,677
Well, I personally think I may have

1091
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,096
preferred that.

1092
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,139
-Come on.
-Stop being too proud.

1093
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,766
-Exactly.
-Don't be stubborn.

1094
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,103
You three girls might react differently.

1095
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:51,024
You might decide not to talk to me
until I approach you first.

1096
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:56,113
But Gyu-ri and Hye-seon
might actually want to make a move.

1097
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,033
Then, I would return the effort
and get to know them more.

1098
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,577
If that's what you think,
then, keep doing that.

1099
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,205
-Well…
-I think…

1100
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,629
I think I've already made it clear
how much I'm interested in you.

1101
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,923
If it wasn't clear to you, then, too bad.

1102
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,717
There's nothing more I can do--

1103
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,845
No, I did the same. We both felt it.

1104
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:24,224
You told me you didn't
and that you wanted me to express it more.

1105
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,476
-But I don't want to--
-I felt it, but--

1106
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,728
I don't want to do it anymore.

1107
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:36,236
I think I've done enough,
but you're asking for more.

1108
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,781
You say you'd return the effort,
but you want me to do all the work.

1109
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,576
That's not true.

1110
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,537
But that's how you're behaving.
That's how it felt.

1111
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,711
I was honest with you from the beginning.

1112
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,880
I clearly told you that I liked you.

1113
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,381
-Honestly.
-Yes.

1114
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,593
But did you make the next move?
No, you didn't.

1115
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,970
-Then--
-You wanted me to do everything.

1116
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:05,265
You expected me to tell you
that I liked you more.

1117
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,433
That's how you've been.

1118
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,061
So I think I've tried enough.

1119
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:15,233
I don't care if you end it with me
because of everything I just said.

1120
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,526
I've tried enough.

1121
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,946
If you're done with me, then so am I.

1122
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,285
I'm glad she said that.

1123
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,536
-Good riddance.
-Good one.

1124
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,829
It's all true.

1125
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:32,626
What if I told you flat out
that I'm totally into you right now?

1126
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,338
Then, will you tell me
that you'll go all-in on me?

1127
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,547
No, right?

1128
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,008
-If you tell me that you like me?
-Yes.

1129
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,891
You still want to get to know Gyu-ri,
Hye-seon, and everyone else.

1130
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,895
That's why I said it to all three of you.

1131
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:56,524
But if you made an effort to take
another step closer, let's say, tonight,

1132
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,569
you'd obviously be my first pick
among the three.

1133
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,487
That's my point.

1134
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:05,158
The point is that you want
one of the girls to approach you first.

1135
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,369
No, you guys don't have to.

1136
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,871
I'm just hoping that one of you will.

1137
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,207
But that's not something I'm entitled to.

1138
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,835
I don't care if none of you decide
to make a move.

1139
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:16,962
It doesn't matter.

1140
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,506
I'm not saying you're wrong,

1141
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:23,635
but I do think it is a bit disrespectful

1142
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,764
how you're openly
keeping your options open.

1143
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,432
It came off as a little rude.

1144
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,519
-Did it?
-Yes.

1145
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,857
Well, I do agree
that the way I said things

1146
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,651
-may have come off a little--
-Right?

1147
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,569
It may have come off a bit rude.

1148
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,322
Yes, it was a bit disrespectful.

1149
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,450
Okay. Well, I'm sorry.

1150
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,204
No, there's no reason for you
to apologize to me.

1151
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,340
I hope you aren't upset
because of what I said last night.

1152
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,800
I'm not upset.

1153
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,635
You're obviously upset.

1154
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,720
No, that's not why.

1155
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,681
I'm not offended
because you picked three women.

1156
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,933
-Whatever.
-I'm upset with your behavior.

1157
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,727
Do you think I'm being jealous?

1158
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,275
Let's go.

1159
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,486
I'll leave on my own.

1160
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,828
I don't remember much. I was so worked up

1161
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,789
and began to talk so fast
as if I was rapping.

1162
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:38,209
I don't want to cling to him
just so that I can be with him.

1163
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,839
-Gosh.
-Ha-jeong knows what she wants.

1164
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,300
But she's right about everything.

1165
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,552
-She said nothing wrong.
-Nothing.

1166
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,262
In that last interview,

1167
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,057
she said she didn't want
to be the only one trying,

1168
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,977
but I think she'd be willing to accept
Gwan-hee if he approaches.

1169
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,729
I think she would, if he did.

1170
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,940
I think she just wants Gwan-hee
to take a step forward.

1171
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:05,278
I feel that Gwan-hee might start
keeping his distance from Ha-jeong.

1172
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,073
-Right.
-Gwan-hee is a professional athlete,

1173
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,949
-so he's probably stubborn.
-He is.

1174
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:15,830
I don't think he likes Ha-jeong enough
to put his ego aside.

1175
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:19,584
I believe she gave him
a very valuable lesson in life.

1176
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:20,919
-Yes.
-Right.

1177
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,963
But I do wonder how it will play out.

1178
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,799
Will he change

1179
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,635
-Or fail to put his ego aside?
-or count her out?

1180
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,929
He might deduct points from her.

1181
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,515
Yes, I wonder how it'll play out.

1182
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:39,104
PARADISE
CHO MIN-JI & CHOI MIN-WOO & LEE JIN-SEOK

1183
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,153
Gosh, this is crazy.

1184
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,991
Let's open the door for her.

1185
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,244
-It's pretty.
-Shall we?

1186
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,498
It looks pretty inside.

1187
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,333
I'm really excited all of a sudden.

1188
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,503
-I didn't expect this.
-Me neither.

1189
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,462
Right?

1190
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,798
I'm still dumbfounded that I made it here.

1191
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:10,635
A toast?

1192
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,807
-I don't know much about alcohol.
-You don't?

1193
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,183
-No.
-Do you drink at all?

1194
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,269
I'm okay with a toast.

1195
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,186
One sip is fine.

1196
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,396
-One sip?
-I'm thirsty.

1197
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,815
Oh, no! My gosh.

1198
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:24,732
My gosh.

1199
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,026
-Oh, dear.
-It's okay.

1200
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,237
I don't think we have napkins.

1201
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,530
-It's fine.
-What do we do?

1202
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,448
It's fine.

1203
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,782
-I…
-You don't care?

1204
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:33,700
No.

1205
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,493
What if you smell like alcohol?

1206
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,911
That won't bother me.

1207
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,959
I love Jin-seok.

1208
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,211
Gosh, Jin-seok.

1209
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,046
-I want to call him "bro."
-"Bro."

1210
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,047
"Bro."

1211
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,217
-Here.
-Thank you.

1212
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,060
Let's have fun
and enjoy delicious food today.

1213
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,314
We've really been craving delicious foods.

1214
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,107
I've never made it to Paradise.

1215
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,485
I wonder what's for dinner.

1216
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,236
Sweet potatoes?

1217
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,199
-Don't jinx it.
-Oh, I thought you meant the others.

1218
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,617
-No, Paradise.
-You meant us.

1219
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,077
-He was thinking about us.
-Oh, us.

1220
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,664
Are you worried about anyone
back in Inferno?

1221
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,665
No, not at all.

1222
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,334
Well…

1223
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,335
Nobody?

1224
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,547
-Oh, no.
-He's a bit worried.

1225
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,798
He is.

1226
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,300
That's just how it is.

1227
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,513
You have your own unique charm.

1228
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,473
-You joined us in the middle.
-Yes.

1229
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,892
I wondered how charming one has to be

1230
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,895
to be able to join us
in the middle of the show.

1231
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,356
-You didn't think she'd be this charming?
-Well…

1232
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,649
-Is that it?
-Yes.

1233
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,234
-Is that it?
-Yes.

1234
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,944
-Am I charming?
-Yes, you are.

1235
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:55,198
But I figured you'd have to be
extremely charming to be able to compete.

1236
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:59,285
I mean, the rest of us already
spent some time together

1237
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,914
and expressed our feelings
for one another.

1238
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,959
But now that I've met you, I get why.

1239
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,337
Jin-seok has fallen for her.

1240
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,172
This isn't good. He's fallen for her.

1241
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,091
Min-woo doesn't stand a chance here.

1242
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,093
Yes, she keeps looking at Jin-seok.

1243
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,847
Someone said my dress looked like grass.

1244
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,225
Who said that?

1245
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:25,812
-Gwan-hee?
-The guy who looked sensitive.

1246
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,438
Was it Won-ik?

1247
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,315
Yes, it was him.

1248
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,859
I didn't expect him
to say something like that.

1249
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,152
Who said "Dipsy"?

1250
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,238
-Who was it again?
-Probably Gwan-hee.

1251
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:38,283
-Gwan-hee? The red shirt?
-Yes, Gwan… I think so.

1252
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,617
-The red shirt.
-Yes.

1253
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,869
-Dipsy?
-Gwan-hee is hilarious.

1254
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,080
-He's the funny type?
-He's funny.

1255
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,584
-He's articulate too.
-He's frank and articulate.

1256
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,627
-Really?
-He seems rough, but he's fun.

1257
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,048
So he's fun.

1258
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,552
He has a certain charm.

1259
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,096
He does.

1260
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,765
-It's a long drive.
-Yes.

1261
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:03,933
I think the sun's set.

1262
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:08,396
What's something
that the three of them can do?

1263
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,565
-I don't think this is Paradise.
-No.

1264
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,108
Is that a vacation home?

1265
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,820
I can't see a thing
through the tinted windows.

1266
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,115
I'm suddenly feeling nervous.

1267
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,206
That was scary.

1268
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,584
Will she have to pick one of them?

1269
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:30,752
-Here? Really?
-Really?

1270
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,005
Come on, that's crazy.

1271
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,592
Cho Min-ji, today in Paradise,

1272
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:42,096
you will go on a dinner date
and a swimming pool date.

1273
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,643
Please pick the man
you wish to have dinner with.

1274
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,395
-Gosh, this is…
-This is harsh.

1275
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,315
-My gosh.
-So one of you can't eat dinner?

1276
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,692
That might happen.

1277
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,652
This is crazy.

1278
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,489
This must be tough for Min-ji.

1279
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,783
If I were one of the guys,

1280
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:05,703
I'd want to go on the dinner date
but wouldn't want to lose the pool date.

1281
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,373
Important things always happen
in the pool.

1282
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,249
Yes, for Jin-young too.

1283
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,126
Yes, you had that moment.

1284
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,795
-Yes, right.
-You did this.

1285
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,380
That's true.

1286
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,256
The dinner date…

1287
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,134
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1288
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,469
It's all right.

1289
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,764
-See you later.
-Okay.

1290
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,275
This is so pretty.

1291
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,860
-Isn't it?
-The view is amazing.

1292
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,613
So this is how it's done.

1293
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,369
-Shall we?
-Why aren't you following?

1294
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,995
I'm leading the way.

1295
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,831
-Sorry.
-This view is amazing.

1296
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,917
I love places like this.

1297
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:01,175
PARADISE
CHO MIN-JI & CHOI MIN-WOO

1298
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:06,973
That must be our table.

1299
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,146
-Is this it?
-Awkward…

1300
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,022
I know, right?

1301
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,194
I wonder what we're going to have.

1302
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,738
The view is so pretty.

1303
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,157
-You're right.
-I almost missed it.

1304
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,118
-Jeju Island sure is pretty.
-Right?

1305
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,119
Yes.

1306
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,413
Just looking at the view makes you happy.

1307
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,330
You're right.

1308
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,675
-Allow me to pour tonight's wine for you.
-Hello.

1309
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,645
Thank you.

1310
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:55,646
Enjoy.

1311
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,939
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1312
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:58,441
Cheers.

1313
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,028
-You don't have to drink.
-Okay.

1314
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,533
Do you have any questions for me?

1315
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,659
-Questions?
-Yes.

1316
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,704
What do you do for a living?

1317
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:15,416
I have a feeling it might have
something to do with cameras.

1318
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,211
No, can I just say it? Am I too impatient?

1319
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,337
No, just tell me.

1320
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,340
I'm studying to become an anchor.

1321
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:23,841
I see. It suits you.

1322
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:24,842
-Really?
-Yes.

1323
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,386
I haven't graduated from college yet.

1324
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,806
-You're trying to become an anchor?
-Yes.

1325
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:34,268
I'm an economics major
at Ewha Womans University

1326
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,646
and an aspiring anchor.

1327
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,023
I'm currently preparing
to become an anchor

1328
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:42,235
through study groups
and a private institute.

1329
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,197
On weekdays, I wake up, study newspapers,

1330
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,534
then read news scripts out loud

1331
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,828
to practice vocalization
and pronunciation.

1332
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:55,790
The Ministry of Culture, Sports
and Tourism has conducted an investigation

1333
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:56,916
on a pro sports organization.

1334
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,377
Her voice changed.

1335
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,339
Not only is she pretty,
but she's also smart?

1336
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:04,423
The world is unfair.

1337
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,093
Yes, that suits you.

1338
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,553
-Really?
-An anchor. Yes.

1339
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:12,056
It's my goal.
I've been working hard lately.

1340
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,017
I feel like you are modeling.

1341
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,269
You're so tall.

1342
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,189
You're right. I'm a model.

1343
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,858
I see. It suits you well.

1344
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,695
I've been modeling for about six years.

1345
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:30,783
I usually shoot ads for clothing brands

1346
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,954
and walk in fashion shows,
such as the Seoul Fashion Week.

1347
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,456
I love my job as a model

1348
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,294
because of the thrill of standing
before people in the spotlight.

1349
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,045
That's why I love this job.

1350
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,464
CHOI MIN-WOO
MODEL

1351
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,383
I see. It suits you well.

1352
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,137
Hey… Wait, you might be younger than me.

1353
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,763
-What's with me?
-What…

1354
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,390
-Right?
-What makes you think so?

1355
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,142
-You may be younger.
-That's right.

1356
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,644
Are you in your mid to late twenties?

1357
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:02,315
-Mid to late twenties?
-We might be the same age.

1358
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,733
Are you 25?

1359
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:04,775
Twenty-five?

1360
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:05,902
Should we say it?

1361
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,278
-Should we?
-I'm 26.

1362
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:10,031
-Twenty-six?
-There's no reason to hide it.

1363
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:12,742
Are you younger than me?

1364
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,412
You're not 23 or something, are you?

1365
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,081
No. Should I tell you?

1366
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:21,334
I'm 24.

1367
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,252
I'm 24.

1368
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:26,047
I'm 24.

1369
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,256
-What?
-Oh, my!

1370
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,008
Really?

1371
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,010
-He was born in 2000.
-Oh, my.

1372
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,679
-Born in 2000?
-With that voice?

1373
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,848
It's not just his voice. His looks too.

1374
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,184
Maybe that was why he kept quiet.

1375
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,021
You're 24? I'm older than you.

1376
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,399
I want to know your type.

1377
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:50,279
Do you like guys with a sense of humor?

1378
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,740
-Yes, how did you know?
-Someone who's funny?

1379
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,951
-I'm just throwing questions.
-I see.

1380
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,745
-What else?
-Someone who's funny and witty.

1381
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,164
-Someone who knows what to say.
-I see.

1382
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,082
Someone…

1383
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,501
That's not good for him.

1384
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:05,252
He has no sense of humor.

1385
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,005
-Min-woo is far from it.
-Min-woo?

1386
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,633
I really didn't think you'd pick me.

1387
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,260
-Why not?
-I left there too quickly.

1388
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:16,847
I didn't think
you'd have a reason to pick me.

1389
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:20,393
Well, I didn't choose you
because we talked a lot.

1390
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,519
Right.

1391
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:24,480
It's just that you were
closest to my type based on looks.

1392
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:25,815
-Really?
-Yes.

1393
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,692
You're very frank.

1394
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,069
Am I? Should I be more subtle about it?

1395
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,196
-No. It's great.
-You looked handsome.

1396
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:34,365
-I like your honesty.
-Subtle enough?

1397
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,867
-Really?
-I thought it'd be nice

1398
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,369
to spend time with you.

1399
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,205
-I see.
-Yes.

1400
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:47,044
Also, I thought
you were really nice to me.

1401
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,045
-Really?
-Yes.

1402
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,631
I got the encouragement I needed.

1403
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:51,924
-Really?
-Yes.

1404
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,303
I had a lot on my mind
when I was in Inferno.

1405
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,474
-I should've been more proactive.
-You were there from the start.

1406
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,684
Right.

1407
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:10,067
INFERNO

1408
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,445
I wonder who will make the first move

1409
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,823
once the new female participant gets here.

1410
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,075
-I'm sure--
-What's she like?

1411
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,161
We haven't met her yet.

1412
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:22,246
Well…

1413
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,999
-She looked composed.
-Okay.

1414
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,127
She also seems like the type
who approaches people first.

1415
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,630
The type who feels comfortable
talking to people.

1416
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,883
I see. I can't wait to meet her.

1417
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,804
-What's on your mind?
-Me?

1418
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:43,601
Yes, I'm trying to read
who you're most interested in by now,

1419
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:45,269
but it's hard to tell.

1420
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,106
I wanted to get a chance
to talk to Min-woo today.

1421
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,901
-I see.
-We were too shy when we first talked.

1422
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,613
Then we spent some time together.
I thought he was just quiet at first,

1423
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:58,115
but he seems to be manly and courageous.

1424
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,619
So I thought he'd be different
if we had a more serious conversation,

1425
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:03,829
but the new participant snatched him away.

1426
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:05,915
You must be bummed out.

1427
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:11,170
I wanted to approach him and make a move,
but I couldn't.

1428
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,798
I always think about it,
but it's hard to act on it.

1429
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:18,761
You should find a chance to do that.

1430
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:21,764
I will.

1431
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,935
Beat that new girl at the next game.

1432
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,686
-Should I beat her?
-Yes, do that.

1433
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,854
I'll win the game.

1434
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:34,485
PARADISE
CHO MIN-JI & LEE JIN-SEOK

1435
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,422
-Hello.
-Hello.

1436
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,592
-I thought we were talking casually.
-Hi. You're right.

1437
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:02,721
These two will be so fun to watch.

1438
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:05,599
-Did you eat?
-Yes, I ate.

1439
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,268
-Good.
-Did you eat dinner?

1440
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,520
Did you have a good talk?

1441
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,732
It was kind of awkward.

1442
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,693
-With Min-woo?
-Yes.

1443
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,196
Maybe because you two just met.

1444
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,699
Yes, I think that's what it was.

1445
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,993
Things felt awkward once we were alone.

1446
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:26,704
You two just met,
so I get why it was awkward.

1447
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,747
-But to me, it felt like
-Yes?

1448
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,792
you were being really considerate.

1449
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,210
-That's what I thought.
-Why?

1450
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,546
I felt that you were a thoughtful person.

1451
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,089
-In three seconds?
-Yes.

1452
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,593
Min-woo kept saying he was hungry.

1453
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,511
Right?

1454
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:46,891
Didn't you take that into consideration
when you made your decision?

1455
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:48,851
Yes, I did.

1456
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,895
You said you had already been to Paradise.

1457
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,898
-So I thought you already had good food.
-Yes, right.

1458
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,902
That was mainly why,
and he was also hungry.

1459
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:59,069
That was why.

1460
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,281
I thought you were very thoughtful.

1461
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:06,368
-Really?
-And it really left an impression.

1462
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,120
"She's very thoughtful."

1463
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:11,665
-You managed to catch that.
-Yes.

1464
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,211
Wait, what about your age?
You might be younger than me.

1465
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:17,546
-Yes.
-Look at this.

1466
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,215
I put on a ribbon to look cute.

1467
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,466
Yes, you look great.

1468
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,468
It's cute.

1469
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,011
Well… I…

1470
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,305
I think you go well with cute things.

1471
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,932
-Really?
-Yes.

1472
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:30,643
That's cute too.

1473
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:32,895
Those two are…

1474
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:36,357
-He's fallen for her.
-Oh, no.

1475
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,776
He's into her already.

1476
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:41,070
Min-young should've treated him better.

1477
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:42,404
Do you want to try it on?

1478
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,864
-That? Give it to me.
-Really?

1479
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:45,532
-What is it?
-A ribbon.

1480
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:47,618
This will haunt me for life.

1481
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:50,788
It looks good on you.

1482
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,248
-Thanks.
-You should keep it.

1483
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:55,501
Wear this to Inferno,
and you'll be super popular.

1484
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,254
I don't think anyone will choose me.

1485
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:00,756
That's not true.

1486
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,967
-No.
-You look pretty.

1487
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,677
-No.
-You look pretty.

1488
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,053
I look pretty?

1489
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:08,514
You look pretty too.

1490
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,891
-Did I look like you too?
-No. You looked pretty.

1491
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,559
I'm joking. You did too.

1492
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,980
-What is it?
-Well…

1493
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,277
-Do you want some?
-Sure.

1494
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,489
-Gosh.
-Oh, my.

1495
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:27,950
-She's so affectionate.
-She's lovely.

1496
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:28,951
Yes.

1497
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:31,120
-Do you want some?
-Sure.

1498
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,707
You're adorable.

1499
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,792
-What? Am I?
-You are.

1500
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,419
Do you disagree?

1501
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,129
This is good.

1502
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:44,091
-Do you want more?
-Not that one. Something else.

1503
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:45,801
-This one looks good too.
-Okay.

1504
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,263
And this.

1505
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:50,222
Anyway, are you…

1506
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,765
Wait, you might not be older.

1507
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,183
You might be younger.

1508
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,227
I think I know how old you are.

1509
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,895
-Are you 26?
-You're right.

1510
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:57,813
You're 26.

1511
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:01,275
You're 26? Okay.

1512
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:02,860
Are you 30? Or 31?

1513
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:06,071
-Yes, I'm 31.
-I see. You're 31.

1514
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,364
Wait, I have a question.

1515
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,743
Did I seem bright and cheerful
when you first saw me?

1516
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:13,787
-Yes, but you also seemed elegant.
-Chic?

1517
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,582
Somewhere in the middle
of being bright and elegant.

1518
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:17,624
-Really?
-Yes.

1519
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:21,587
It was refreshing
to meet someone like you.

1520
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,966
And when we began to talk,

1521
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,969
you seemed quite sociable
despite it being our first time,

1522
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:32,181
and you didn't seem too shy.

1523
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,225
You knew how to hold a conversation,

1524
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,227
and you were very eloquent.

1525
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,896
You're complimenting me a lot.

1526
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,901
I'm not trying to compliment you.

1527
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:46,070
It's just how I felt.

1528
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:49,490
Anyway, it's interesting.

1529
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,200
How did you end up picking

1530
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,660
-You?
-Min-woo and me?

1531
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:58,540
-Min-woo and I are complete opposites.
-Yes.

1532
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,042
Guess what my ideal type is.

1533
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:03,253
-What is it? What's your ideal type?
-Me? Someone fun.

1534
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,381
-Really? I see.
-Yes.

1535
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,384
-Not bad.
-Yes, someone fun.

1536
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,845
You were really fun to talk to.
And when we talked,

1537
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,392
it felt like we were having
a solid conversation.

1538
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,643
I laughed a lot, right?

1539
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:21,146
Well, I do tend to laugh a lot,
but I laughed even more with you.

1540
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,319
What's your ideal type?

1541
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:29,405
I like someone fun too.

1542
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,115
-I see.
-And you're fun to be with.

1543
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,241
-I am?
-Yes.

1544
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:33,492
I'm glad.

1545
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:36,662
-I don't like boring people.
-You're very responsive when I talk.

1546
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,456
And I like how you laugh a lot.

1547
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:44,878
You laugh a lot.

1548
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,675
I think those are the best qualities.

1549
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:53,929
Yes, you're right.

1550
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:01,103
Is your type in Inferno?

1551
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:05,899
Not anymore.

1552
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,070
"Not anymore."

1553
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:16,201
I love it.

1554
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:22,040
-"Not anymore."
-He's so into her.

1555
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,959
-My gosh.
-He said, "Not anymore."

1556
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,878
Not anymore.

1557
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:37,306
-My gosh.
-He said, "Not anymore."

1558
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,142
That was such a wise answer.

1559
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:43,562
-Yes, totally.
-He couldn't lie and say no,

1560
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:44,813
nor say yes.

1561
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,857
-He didn't lie.
-No, he didn't lie.

1562
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:47,858
-"Not anymore."
-Yes.

1563
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:49,026
"Not anymore."

1564
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,944
-That was amazing.
-It was the best answer

1565
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,988
-anyone could have given.
-He's the best.

1566
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:55,532
-I've fallen for Jin-seok.
-Me too.

1567
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:57,075
-That was so cool.
-That's my bro.

1568
01:14:57,701 --> 01:15:00,579
INFERNO

1569
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,206
When is Jin-seok coming back?

1570
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:04,750
I want to hang out with him.

1571
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,003
This might be just me, but it gets lonely

1572
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:10,380
when the person
you had a thing with is gone.

1573
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,508
Yes, that's kind of how I feel.

1574
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,928
I actually wanted a chance
to talk to Jin-seok today

1575
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:18,764
-because I felt bad about yesterday.
-I see. Right.

1576
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,850
To be honest,
I was a bit annoyed yesterday.

1577
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:26,647
-What about him annoyed her?
-Exactly.

1578
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:28,899
The timing was off.

1579
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:32,069
Yes, she should've treated him better.

1580
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:33,862
She's got some intense competition.

1581
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,406
Do you feel confused now that he's gone?

1582
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,991
No, I was fine at first.

1583
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:41,203
So I figured
I really didn't like him that much.

1584
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:44,456
But I later realized
he could change his mind after this.

1585
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,624
Yes, he could.

1586
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,709
-What if he does?
-See? You feel anxious.

1587
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,294
-That means…
-Is that what it is?

1588
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,548
The fact that you're anxious
his feelings might change

1589
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:55,467
-proves that you have feelings for him.
-Do you think so?

1590
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,261
When I talk about these things,

1591
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:00,931
I begin to think
I really have feelings for him.

1592
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:02,391
-Do you get it?
-Yes.

1593
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:06,061
But it was a bit annoying
when he made things too obvious in public.

1594
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:09,773
But if he suddenly stops doing that,
you're going to feel empty inside.

1595
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:12,317
And to watch someone
who used to chase after you

1596
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:16,363
suddenly grow closer to someone else
will make you feel really upset.

1597
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:18,532
I'd be irritated if that happened.

1598
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:21,201
-Of course. That's jealousy.
-I wouldn't like that.

1599
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:24,079
I'm sure they'll get closer.

1600
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:25,163
That's jealousy.

1601
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,123
-Is it?
-Yes.

1602
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:27,124
And look.

1603
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:29,459
What if that new participant
likes Jin-seok?

1604
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:31,503
Then it'll be competition.
If that happens--

1605
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,130
I hate competition.

1606
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,548
We're here to do that.

1607
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:36,008
But I hate competition.

1608
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:39,845
Make a move and talk to him tomorrow.

1609
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,014
What if he suddenly loses interest in me?

1610
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,891
Take a shot tomorrow
and seize the opportunity.

1611
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,773
Min-kyu is giving her solid advice.

1612
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:54,276
-This must be tough on Min-young.
-It must be.

1613
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:56,695
-She's going to cry a lot.
-Yes.

1614
01:16:56,778 --> 01:17:00,240
PARADISE
CHO MIN-JI & LEE JIN-SEOK

1615
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:03,201
It's been so long since I swam.

1616
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,369
-Really? Me too.
-Yes.

1617
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,122
You came to Paradise not long ago.

1618
01:17:07,205 --> 01:17:09,708
Come on. I heard what you said earlier.

1619
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:10,709
Come on.

1620
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,047
-Right. I went swimming.
-Is my hair okay?

1621
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,381
-Yes, you look great.
-I do?

1622
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:17,299
Yes.

1623
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,302
I think we should go this way.

1624
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:21,428
Okay.

1625
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,975
-Your first time swimming here, right?
-Yes.

1626
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,355
Let me fold it for you.

1627
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:32,356
Okay.

1628
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:35,692
-Shall we?
-Okay.

1629
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:36,610
Okay.

1630
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,070
Do you want to go in first?

1631
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,404
-Me? Should I go?
-Yes.

1632
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,911
-It's deeper than I expected.
-Careful.

1633
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,245
-It's deep?
-Yes.

1634
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,333
-And it's not too warm.
-No.

1635
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:53,543
Because the pool is too big.

1636
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:56,254
-Let's swim.
-I like just being in the water.

1637
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,547
-It's fun.
-Right.

1638
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,476
Why are you spinning?

1639
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:12,938
Show me a trick.

1640
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,106
A trick?

1641
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,233
-Like diving underwater?
-A trick.

1642
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:18,193
-Let's see you swim.
-I can't.

1643
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:21,363
It's hot in here, isn't it?

1644
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:24,324
-You look like a good swimmer.
-I do?

1645
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,785
Can you tell just by my face?

1646
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:29,830
You look amiable.
That's the best kind of compliment.

1647
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:30,997
Do you think so?

1648
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:34,543
Yes, if you have sharp features,
you'd look unapproachable.

1649
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:35,669
-Right?
-I agree.

1650
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,006
This is so nice.

1651
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,260
-It's my first time here.
-Here?

1652
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:46,096
What's it like to be here
for the second time?

1653
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,597
It's my first time here.

1654
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:49,516
-Really?
-Here, yes.

1655
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,268
-Really?
-This place.

1656
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:53,520
-Oh, this pool.
-Yes, it's my first time here.

1657
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:54,604
Which one is better?

1658
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,401
That was indoors, and this is outdoors.

1659
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:01,153
It's not too cold today.

1660
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,654
-It was cold there.
-Really?

1661
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,572
Yes.

1662
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,240
So what's your answer?

1663
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:08,201
-Did you like it better there?
-No, I like it better here.

1664
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:09,119
Why?

1665
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,705
-You mean, there?
-No, here.

1666
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:13,123
-Here?
-Yes.

1667
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,250
I like how it's open.

1668
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:19,337
That's not the right answer.

1669
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,881
Yes, he knows what she means.

1670
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,340
-I guess he's shy.
-Right.

1671
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,010
-It's warm here. Let's stay around here.
-Okay.

1672
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:28,597
It's coming from here. Stand here.

1673
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:30,932
-It's warm.
-Do you like it?

1674
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,143
-Yes.
-Then, stand here like this.

1675
01:19:33,226 --> 01:19:35,228
-Stand here for ten minutes.
-No.

1676
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:37,898
I'm sorry, but I don't want to.

1677
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:39,608
I'm not sure.

1678
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:42,694
It gets hot and cold.
It's like the pool is playing games.

1679
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,280
Are you the type of person
who plays hard to get?

1680
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:51,411
-This is crazy.
-It's happening again.

1681
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:54,748
Are you the type of person
who plays hard to get?

1682
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:57,918
Me? I'm not like that.

1683
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:00,587
Then?

1684
01:20:04,424 --> 01:20:05,801
It's all or nothing for me.

1685
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,554
Really? So is it all or nothing?

1686
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:13,850
It's you.

1687
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,452
So did you have fun?

1688
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:34,329
Give me a clear answer.

1689
01:20:34,412 --> 01:20:36,540
I thought you were interested in me.

1690
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:37,624
Of course, I'm interested.

1691
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:39,334
NEXT EPISODE

1692
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:41,044
Did you have a change of heart?

1693
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:42,587
I don't know anymore.

1694
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,092
My heart fluttered because of Min-woo.

1695
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:49,803
I get nervous whenever I talk to you.

1696
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,472
Don't do anything funny.

1697
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:54,099
Should I try hitting on him?

1698
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:55,851
Look forward to it.

1699
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:58,645
She's so strong!

1700
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,023
-This is scary.
-She looks so determined.

1701
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,403
