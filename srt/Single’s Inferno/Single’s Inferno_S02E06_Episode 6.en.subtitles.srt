The weather's so nice today.

13
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,218
Seo-eun, how are you making me jealous
when I'm not the jealous type?

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,597
I'm kidding.

15
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,557
Did you have fun?

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,309
Well, yes.

17
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,270
I went to Paradise.

18
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,065
-Let's cross over here.
-And go to the beach?

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,235
Well, we have some free time now.

20
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,487
Right.

21
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,489
-I was the first to come outside.
-Yes.

22
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,034
But even if you didn't come to me,
I might've come to talk to you.

23
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,577
-Really?
-Yes.

24
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,121
-I probably would have.
-I see.

CHOCOLATE CAFÉ

26
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,626
Do you want to sit here?

27
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,184
I went running early in the morning.

28
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,977
-You did?
-Yes.

29
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,021
See the tracks I made over there?

30
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,189
I see.

31
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,818
I go running when I feel troubled.

32
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,362
Why are you troubled?

33
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,781
-It's a bit exhausting to be here.
-I see.

34
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,949
Yes.

35
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,079
I was curious about that.

36
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,792
Since I went to Paradise with Han-bin,

37
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:10,463
-I thought you might've felt bad.
-I see.

38
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,925
To be honest, I wasn't in a good mood.

39
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,886
I'd be lying if I said I was okay.

40
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,723
You're right.
I wasn't in a good mood.

41
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,351
If you're interested
and curious about someone,

42
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:28,106
I think it's better to talk to the person
and figure things out.

43
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,818
Of course, I know it's a competition,

44
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:36,531
but I'm just going
to play to my strengths.

45
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,284
That's why I came out first.

46
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,327
I see.

47
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,040
-This is a bit off-topic…
-Okay.

48
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,170
-…but do you remember the special meal?
-Yes.

49
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,046
-The prize for the men's game?
-Yes.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,716
Yes.

51
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,428
I saw how determined you were.

52
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,265
-I see.
-You were really cool.

53
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,602
Thanks. I really wanted to win.

54
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:13,109
If you had won the special meal date,
who would you have gone with?

55
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,029
Well, I would've had
to think about it hard.

56
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,490
I didn't know who my second pick would be.

57
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,496
But you would've been my first choice.

58
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,874
I see.

59
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,923
-That's an honest answer.
-I mean, that was…

60
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,425
That was me being very honest.

61
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,511
-I see.
-To be honest, today I…

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,098
I didn't want to test the waters.

63
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,852
When we decided to talk,
and you said you'd come outside,

64
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:54,108
I just wanted to say,
"I was a bit jealous."

65
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,280
But I somehow ended up

66
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,950
being very honest.

67
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,162
In a way, we're going in the same…

68
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,081
Thanks.

69
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,249
The same…

70
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,167
The same direction?

71
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,126
Yes.

72
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,837
HANHAE, HONG JIN-KYUNG
LEE DA-HEE, KYUHYUN

73
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:15,880
This is so…

74
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,715
The two that are waiting…

75
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,511
How are you feeling?
What are you thinking?

76
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,931
-I talked to Yoong-jae yesterday.
-Yes, I saw you guys.

77
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,559
-I tend to go all in when I like someone.
-Right.

78
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,730
But he wants to take his time
to get to know each person.

79
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,734
I don't think he is, though.

80
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,904
I think he only has eyes for Seo-eun.

81
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,781
-Yoong-jae? Really?
-Yes.

82
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,411
-You know, he ran out right away.
-Yes.

83
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,997
-And went straight to her first.
-Yes.

84
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,084
If he was planning to talk
to different people,

85
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,004
I thought he would've been
most curious about you.

86
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,092
Right. He doesn't really seem
to be curious about me.

87
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,681
If I had 100 hours to spend,

88
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,976
I'd like to spend 90 hours
with one person.

89
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,477
-I see.
-Maybe even more.

90
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,896
If I could, I would.

91
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,027
What about you?

92
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,866
If Seo-eun says
she's not interested in you,

93
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,868
what will you do?

94
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,120
I think I'd still try harder.

95
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,790
If we hadn't gone to Paradise,
perhaps I wouldn't.

96
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,169
But I learned a lot about her there.

97
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:40,131
I might've liked her first,
but she showed interest in me

98
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,592
for the first time
when we went to Paradise.

99
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,177
Because of that,

100
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,263
I think I'd try even harder.

101
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,474
-That way, I won't regret it later.
-I see.

102
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,809
Inferno…

103
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,689
I missed this place.

104
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,357
I know I was in Paradise.

105
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,401
My body was there,
but my heart was…

106
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,613
I left some of it behind in Inferno.

107
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,368
I keep thinking about you.

108
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,123
When they return
after having their conversation,

109
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,044
whatever they talked about will be key.

110
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,589
It'll be difficult for both of us,

111
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,384
but we have to follow our hearts, right?

112
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,471
But things can change in the future.

113
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,224
-We don't know what will happen.
-Right.

114
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,726
But…

115
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,271
I know how to protect what's mine.

116
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,817
I've never had anything taken from me.

117
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,529
How long are they going to talk for?

118
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,488
I know, right?

119
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,949
They've been talking
for a long time.

120
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,034
This is hard.

121
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,996
My heart felt heavy when we came here.

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,456
Do you feel better now?

123
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,415
Yes.

124
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,961
I didn't think we'd go
on dates freely right away.

125
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,048
-Me too.
-But I felt pretty happy.

126
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,634
-What?
-They're coming this way.

127
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,678
They're coming this way? Really?

128
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,728
They're getting closer.
They're about…

129
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,190
100 meters…
No, 200 meters away.

130
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,234
I don't know. I can't tell.

131
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,111
What are you going to do?

132
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:29,198
I'm not sure if they're coming back
or if they're going somewhere else.

133
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,993
I think they're on their way back.

134
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,298
I just thought of something.

135
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,050
-What?
-I was with Seo-eun earlier,

136
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,637
so I think going up
to her right now might pressure her…

137
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,099
Pressure her…

138
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,117
It's kind of hard for me
to meet Han-bin's gaze.

139
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,827
I wonder what they talked about.

140
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,334
I don't think you'd be pressuring her.

141
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,377
But if you don't go to her now,

142
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,505
-you might miss your chance.
-I see.

143
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,300
-I mean, you're giving her time to think.
-Right.

144
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,136
But you've already given her time.

145
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,931
If you give her even more time,

146
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,768
I think that just allows her
to make up her mind.

147
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,186
I see.

148
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,356
I think you're right.

149
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,026
Let's go once they part ways
at the top of the hill.

150
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,489
Let's go.

151
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,583
I've never sat down here before.

152
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,627
Wait.

153
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,672
-They sat down over there.
-Now what do we do?

154
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,030
The two of them together…

155
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,324
This just occurred to me.

156
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,618
-We saw them pass by, right?
-Yes.

157
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,412
They looked happy.

158
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,498
-I get similar vibes from them.
-I see.

159
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,375
Like, Seo-eun is…

160
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,004
-pretty mature, in my opinion.
-Right.

161
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,215
-And Yoong-jae seems mature as well.
-Right.

162
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:56,012
-So I think they might get along well.
-Yes.

163
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,894
-I see.
-Oh, dear. So-e's face is…

164
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,565
I feel sad for her. Goodness.

165
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,651
This is too much.

166
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,361
What is going on?

167
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,655
You know how Yoong-jae

168
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,117
-went to Seo-eun right away?
-Yes.

169
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,911
Yesterday, he told So-e
that he'll make up his mind

170
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,080
-and tell her as soon as possible.
-Yes.

171
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,500
I think he wanted to talk to her
since she went with Han-bin.

172
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,461
-Right.
-But after talking to her,

173
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,046
and if Seo-eun rejected him,

174
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,924
I think he was going
to give So-e a chance.

175
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:38,012
I want them to take some time
to get to know each other at least once.

176
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,555
Will that ever happen?

177
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,892
-But Yoong-jae…
-But when Yoong-jae went to Paradise,

178
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,687
I think he totally fell for Seo-eun.

179
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:51,942
So I'm not sure if he should let So-e know

180
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,111
so that she can give up on him.

181
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,404
I don't know what's right.

182
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,948
Let's just say that things
didn't work out.

183
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,993
But it's not like they can say,
"It wasn't meant to be."

184
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,953
And simply go home.

185
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,164
-They have to be together.
-They must.

186
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,083
-Exactly.
-And keep seeing each other.

187
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,296
Seul-ki, last time you said
we should swap books, so…

188
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,798
Really? You brought yours?

189
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,216
-Have a look at it.
-Okay.

190
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,219
-And if it's okay, then we can swap.
-Okay.

191
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:23,015
This is the cabana
where we sat and talked on the first day.

192
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,021
-How are you feeling?
-I'm good.

193
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,398
-You're okay?
-Yes.

194
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,191
Is my headband okay?

195
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,277
-It looks great.
-Should I wear it or not?

196
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,570
Should I take it off?

197
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,033
You look cute with it.

198
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,661
But if you take it off,
you look cute and sexy.

199
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,913
Okay, then I'll take it off.

200
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,292
Right. It's better to be both.
But you look nice either way.

201
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,425
You probably want to talk to other people.

202
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,426
Yes.

203
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,303
Who haven't you talked to a lot so far?

204
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,847
Well…

205
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,683
Maybe Yoong-jae?

206
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,851
-That's right.
-Right?

207
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,310
We haven't talked at all.

208
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,770
-Not at all?
-No.

209
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,691
What about you, Jong-woo?
Is there someone you want to get to know?

210
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,861
-Me?
-Someone you want to talk to.

211
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,320
Well…

212
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,949
I think…

213
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,411
I'm already talking to her.

214
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,416
-Yes.
-I see.

215
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,420
Thanks.

216
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,089
-I'm already talking to you, and I…
-I see.

217
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,467
I want to talk with you more.

218
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,597
And I think there's enough time
to do that in Inferno.

219
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,974
If we have meaningful conversations here,

220
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,519
I think we can get closer
to a certain degree.

221
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,606
-That's nice. Thanks for inviting me.
-Really?

222
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,860
-Yes.
-I'm not really good at this.

223
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,862
I'm really not good at this.

224
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,908
I've never approached anyone first.

225
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,534
Never in your life?

226
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,747
-Really?
-Yes.

227
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,959
But I came to you
because I really wanted to talk to you.

228
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,046
If I didn't feel this way,
I think I would've waited.

229
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,633
Thank you so much, truly.

230
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,843
I think I should also…

231
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,847
Honestly, I haven't been able
to sort out my thoughts until today.

232
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,891
-I see.
-I'll take some time

233
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,937
to think about everything seriously.

234
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,148
-On your own?
-Yes.

235
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,107
Thanks.

236
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,029
There weren't many opportunities
to talk in the beginning.

237
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,949
But now, we're getting
to know each other rather quickly.

238
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,910
I was worried about something else.

239
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,371
-Like when we started…
-Could you come with me?

240
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,456
Yes. Okay, let's go.

241
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,458
But when you're together all the time…

242
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,085
Nadine.

243
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,671
-Bye.
-I get it.

244
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,589
-Don't rush it.
-See you.

245
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,176
It's too bright.

246
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,678
Let's bring our sunglasses.

247
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,888
-I have a pair.
-Okay, I'll bring mine too.

248
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,390
-Meet me here.
-Okay.

249
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,991
She's so cute.

250
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,662
I like it when people do that.
When they quickly touch up their makeup.

251
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,416
It's nice wanting to look good
for the person you like.

252
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,669
Hey, are you having a good time?

253
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,258
What?

254
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,096
What did you guys do inside?

255
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,558
We were just talking,
and now I'm about to talk to Nadine.

256
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,268
-Really?
-Yes.

257
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,812
Bye.

258
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,401
-He didn't even respond.
-No response at all.

259
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,409
-Sorry.
-You don't have to run.

260
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,411
You got your sunglasses.

261
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,872
-It's nice. Everything looks nicer now.
-Right?

262
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,040
Exactly.

263
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,085
-Let's go get some water up there.
-Okay.

264
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,922
-This is my first time going there.
-I know.

265
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,675
-Please escort me there.
-Escort you? Okay.

266
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,386
It's so nice here.

267
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,597
-Where should we sit?
-Where's the shade?

268
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,474
-The shade…
-You should sit here.

269
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,225
-Okay.
-There's some shade here.

270
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,561
-Will you be okay? It's really sunny.
-Okay.

271
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,520
There's no shade.

272
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,481
-I'll just get a tan.
-No shade at all?

273
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,649
-All right then.
-Okay.

274
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,987
-I'm accommodating you.
-You keep speaking English.

275
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,405
I'm accommodating you.

276
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,450
It's great out here.

277
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,534
It's so nice.

278
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,081
What kind of relationship
are you aiming for?

279
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,791
What do you mean?

280
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,875
I mean, seeking.

281
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,752
And what does that mean?

282
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,754
-Like, want.
-"Want"?

283
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,464
Okay, I get it now. Want.

284
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,887
I don't like it when people get clingy.

285
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,223
-Like, texting all day.
-I knew it.

286
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,686
I'd rather be in a relationship
that's casual but hot.

287
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,437
-Casual but hot?
-Yes.

288
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,650
-I see.
-And passionate.

289
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,485
And about work…

290
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,780
-Someone who's focused on work.
-Yes.

291
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,408
-And very passionate about it.
-Yes, that's right.

292
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,244
Do you think someone here
is like that?

293
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,163
-I don't know yet.
-You're not sure.

294
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,581
I'm not sure.

295
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,543
I want to talk to different people.

296
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,794
I see.

297
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,631
I don't know yet,

298
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,342
but I think you have a professional job.

299
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,678
I'm just making a guess.

300
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,973
I get this vibe from you that tells me

301
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,475
you're very sure about what you want.

302
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,811
Well, if you're curious…

303
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,148
-Okay.
-Okay. You know what I mean, right?

304
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:08,944
That's cute.

305
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:17,411
What kind of relationship do you want?
I want to ask you the same question.

306
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,666
A relationship where my partner
and I are confident in what we do.

307
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,084
What does that mean?

308
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,046
Like, being confident
in our respective areas.

309
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,964
Someone who is sure about their job.

310
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,592
-Really?
-Yes.

311
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,928
You seem like you'd be more free-spirited.

312
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,515
-But I don't like undisciplined people.
-I see.

313
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,270
I'd want my partner
to be focused on something.

314
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,815
Also, I like being alone

315
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,735
-and enjoy spending time alone.
-I see.

316
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,905
Me too. I feel the same.

317
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,656
I also like being alone.

318
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,036
Do you understand?

319
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,412
-You mean, in life?
-Yes.

320
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,331
Nearby or recently?

321
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,917
-Recently in your life.
-Yes, recently.

322
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:10,339
Right. I recently felt that
being alone is really important.

323
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,882
It's important and…

324
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,635
I should really study Korean.

325
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,345
No, no. It's so attractive.

326
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,721
No, I should study.

327
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,224
I wonder what you do for a living.

328
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,183
-Me?
-Yes.

329
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,187
-Thank you for being curious about me.
-I'm really curious.

330
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,026
I'm not that curious about other people.

331
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,529
I shouldn't be saying this,

332
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,198
-but I've been keeping an eye on you.
-Really?

333
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:43,163
Yes. You were kind of cold,
but I also thought you were kind of cute.

334
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,750
-Really?
-Do you hear that a lot?

335
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,335
-That you're kind of cute.
-Me?

336
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,546
Cute?

337
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,382
I think you're the first person

338
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,759
to tell me that
so soon after meeting them.

339
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,885
I see.

340
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,764
But you are kind of cute.

341
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,476
I'm not sure how to explain this,

342
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,604
-but you're oddly cute.
-Oddly?

343
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,400
The way I said that was…

344
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,943
I'm sorry.

345
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,948
-It's kind of cute.
-Nadine is even cuter.

346
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,908
I know, Nadine. Gosh.

347
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,326
-They get along well.
-Yes.

348
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,495
-I'm also excited about them.
-Me too.

349
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,539
-I wonder how it'll go.
-I'm excited.

350
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,708
-He has good chemistry with everyone.
-Yes.

351
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,336
-Yes.
-Nadine's Korean is slightly awkward,

352
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,089
-and Jin-young's English is awkward,
-Right.

353
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,676
but it makes them laugh.

354
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,221
I look forward to seeing them
as much as seeing Seul-ki and Jin-young.

355
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,728
Did you enjoy your trip to Paradise?

356
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,105
Yes.

357
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,231
How was it?

358
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:53,901
Well, it was just…

359
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,777
-Can you tell us…
-It's just…

360
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,405
You look like you're about to fall asleep.

361
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,866
I'm a bit exhausted from the heat.

362
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:05,162
I think you would've done
something active over there.

363
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,833
Really? I'm not sure.
I'm just a bit…

364
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,919
What do you do if you get heatstroke?

365
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,259
-Did you have a good talk?
-Yes.

366
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,263
You look happy.

367
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,099
-Who did you talk to?
-Hi.

368
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,434
-Jin-young.
-I see.

369
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,144
Where did you go?

370
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230
-The ice water place.
-I see.

371
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,398
-Did he go to the locker room?
-No.

372
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,609
He went in here.

373
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,860
Really?

374
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,904
-After I dry off.
-Right. Here you go.

375
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,073
Put some on.
Your skin's about to turn red.

376
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,115
I got really red.

377
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,793
It's okay.

378
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,672
I'm fine. I think I'm just exhausted.

379
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,885
LEE SO-E

380
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,096
Well, he didn't say no

381
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:51,560
or use other words to reject me.

382
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:55,272
But things were going in that direction.

383
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,943
I think I started realizing it
and felt it as well,

384
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,988
so I couldn't help but feel sad.

385
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,032
I just felt sad.

386
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,956
Everyone, come on in!

387
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,917
Hey, that's so cool!

388
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,837
You're so cool!

389
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,341
Thanks!

390
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,722
It's just us here!

391
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,124
Where's Seul-ki?

392
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,919
-Where's Seul-ki?
-She's over there.

393
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:00,837
She's not here.

394
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,383
-She had heatstroke earlier, right?
-Yes.

395
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,593
That's right.

396
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,976
-Is that Jong-woo?
-Yes.

397
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,669
Did you have fun?

398
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,379
What? Yes, I did.

399
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,422
But you looked exhausted from the heat.

400
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,591
-Here you go.
-What's that?

401
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,762
-When you get heatstroke…
-What are these supplements?

402
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,056
-Vitamin D3 and magnesium.
-Really?

403
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:57,018
And I brought you
a facial mask to soothe your skin.

404
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,312
You said you have sensitive skin,

405
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,649
so I think it'll be good
if you use it in the evening.

406
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,359
-Thanks.
-It's aloe.

407
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,402
I love it.

408
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,405
He's so attentive.

409
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,116
-That was a nice move.
-It really was.

410
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:17,122
I was really nervous and also dehydrated,
so I wasn't feeling well.

411
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:22,294
But then Jong-woo approached me
and showed his concern.

412
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,548
He seemed like a very thoughtful person,
and I felt grateful.

413
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,596
But I can't tell
who you're interested in, Se-jeong.

414
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,516
I don't know about Jin-young.

415
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,896
But today, when we were together
for a bit, I watched him.

416
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,648
And he seemed interested in Nadine.

417
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,775
-Really?
-Yes.

418
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,986
I think he's just getting
to know everyone.

419
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,531
Well, Jin-young joined the show late.

420
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,867
-Right.
-Since he joined later,

421
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,620
I don't think he's sure about anyone yet.

422
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,787
-Not yet?
-Yes.

423
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,039
I think so.

424
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,625
If you and Nadine

425
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,835
-want to sway Jin-young's heart…
-Yes?

426
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,254
…then it's time for you

427
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,008
to really put yourself out there
and express how you feel.

428
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,011
He already went to Paradise
with Seul-ki and talked a lot.

429
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,681
I'm positive
that they had a great time together.

430
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,099
Seul-ki is…

431
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:25,148
Singles. Please come out
to the campfire right now.

432
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,526
Wait.

433
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,819
I think we're right.

434
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:34,407
-What we thought was right.
-We were totally spot on.

435
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,367
I'm nervous.

436
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,035
I think it'll be a new woman.

437
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,995
-It could be a man.
-Maybe both.

438
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,206
A woman and a man?

439
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,625
I think a woman will come first.

440
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,046
-Is someone else coming?
-Really?

441
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,090
It's already complicated enough.

442
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,049
I know, right?

443
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,593
For those who've lost their motivation…

444
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,678
I guess.

445
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,097
-This could motivate them.
-Yes.

446
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,859
-It's exciting that someone's coming.
-It's another new person.

447
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,701
Who do you think will come?

448
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,537
A woman?

449
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,792
Why am I nervous?
This feels like our first day.

450
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,002
I feel the same way.

451
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,381
Look, someone's coming.

452
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,885
Look, someone's coming.

453
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,471
-It's a guy.
-It's a guy.

454
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,557
What?

455
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,475
He looks really tall.

456
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,608
-Is it a guy?
-It's a guy.

457
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,612
It's a guy.

458
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,866
-He's wearing a suit.
-A suit?

459
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,909
He kind of…

460
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,959
He looks like an actor.

461
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,378
He's really tall and good-looking.

462
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,676
What?

463
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,053
He's cool.

464
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,930
-He's very tall.
-He's really tall.

465
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,061
-Hello.
-Hello.

466
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,062
Nice to meet you.

467
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,025
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

468
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,653
-Hello.
-Hello.

469
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,738
-Hello.
-Thanks.

470
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,697
Take a seat.

471
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,618
My name is Kim Se-jun.

472
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,996
I think some of my attractive features are

473
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,000
kindness and making others
feel comfortable.

474
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,462
And I think I'm cute in my own way.

475
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,175
I play a lot of tennis
these days as a hobby.

476
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,177
My tennis skills aren't that bad.

477
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:05,725
I'd like to meet a woman
who is kind and has a bubbly personality.

478
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,937
I tend to open up quickly
to people like that.

479
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,818
I know I'm joining the show late,
but if there's a woman I like,

480
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:18,613
I'll go out of my way to win her over
regardless of the circumstances.

481
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,409
-I look forward to being here. Thanks.
-Thank you.

482
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,160
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

483
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,915
You look so exotic and handsome.

484
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:32,419
Your voice is really deep and sounds nice.

485
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,339
Someone else is here.

486
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,554
It's a woman.

487
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,265
Another person is here.

488
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,868
Wait, why did I clap?

489
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,332
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

490
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,792
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

491
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,586
Welcome.

492
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,173
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

493
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,884
Hello, my name is Lim Min-su.

494
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,429
I'm like an iron fist
in a velvet glove.

495
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,474
People see me as someone
with a soft personality

496
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,058
who laughs a lot.

497
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,312
But if there's something
I want to do or feel like I should do,

498
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,814
I deal with those things head-on.

499
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,151
I like a specific type of guy,
so if I meet someone like that,

500
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,029
I put my blinders on and go all in.

501
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,990
Since I'm joining late,
there won't be many opportunities.

502
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:47,035
So I think I should
quickly find someone whom I like

503
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,953
and focus on that one person.

504
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,332
-Hello.
-Welcome.

505
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,291
Nice to meet you.

506
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,003
It's so pretty here.

507
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,296
-Right?
-Yes.

508
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,425
How was your trip coming here?

509
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,928
-There were lots of stairs.
-Right?

510
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,264
I wanted to look at everyone,
but I was afraid I might fall.

511
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,311
Those two probably feel awkward.

512
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:17,357
But I can tell they're motivated
by the way they talk.

513
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,359
I think Se-jun

514
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,320
-seems rather solemn.
-Maybe he's the oldest?

515
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,030
Yes. I have that feeling.

516
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,741
I wonder how Se-jun
might change the dynamic.

517
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,618
-I'm curious.
-Me too. I'm curious.

518
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,995
-I wonder what will happen.
-Exactly.

519
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,418
-Let's go.
-Let's cook some food.

520
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,171
-What are the ingredients?
-What are they?

521
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,507
I hope there's something good.

522
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,384
Wait, it's kimchi.

523
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,468
Kimchi?

524
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,220
There's tuna and kimchi.

525
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,764
Chef, what's the menu for today?

526
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,474
Should we make kimchi stew

527
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,142
-and kimchi fried rice?
-Yes.

528
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,477
-Yes!
-Yes!

529
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,646
-Fried rice is nice.
-Sounds great.

530
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,196
-Hello.
-No plates over there, right?

531
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,990
-Hello.
-How about this, then?

532
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,492
-Don't we have any?
-What's your name again?

533
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,535
I'm Lee Nadine.

534
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,245
Nadine. What a pretty name.

535
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,414
-Everyone here has pretty names.
-Gosh. Thank you.

536
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,378
-You don't see a torch there, right?
-Then…

537
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,255
Wait. Kimchi tuna stew?

538
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,215
Kimchi tuna stew.

539
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,092
Let's put our clothes in the back.

540
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,218
Okay.

541
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,387
-Maybe there's none.
-Really?

542
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,930
-We have some.
-We do?

543
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,557
Will that be enough?

544
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,850
What are we making?

545
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,018
Kimchi fried rice…

546
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,355
Let's prepare the ingredients.
Please wash them.

547
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,523
What are they?

548
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,400
-About your jacket…
-Yes?

549
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,651
I put it over there.

550
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:48,364
-Thank you.
-Kimchi stew and kimchi fried rice.

551
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,284
-Yes, just…
-Apparently, we need to save water.

552
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,119
We have to throw everything out.

553
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,414
I should carry something.

554
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,792
I just had a strange thought.

555
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,378
If the two new people get together

556
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,340
-and don't interfere with anyone else…
-Yes?

557
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,801
-…that would be awesome too.
-I thought of that five minutes ago.

558
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,094
They look good together.

559
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,180
Yes. That's right.

560
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,098
-As long as they don't pile up.
-Min-su?

561
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,642
-With the water…
-Your name?

562
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,809
I'm Kim Se-jun.

563
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,810
-Se-jun.
-Yes.

564
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,438
-Wash it twice, and let it soak.
-Take that out.

565
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:24,150
-The new members are working too hard.
-We're trying.

566
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,234
To make it spicy…

567
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,536
You really know what you're doing.

568
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,623
-I do?
-You seem like a local.

569
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,877
Shall we go get water?

570
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,337
Want to go get water?

571
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,546
Yes. Let's go.

572
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,006
-Want to come?
-Can I come?

573
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,424
Should I go get water?

574
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,467
-Go on.
-I'll be back.

575
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,136
-I'll help with the fire.
-Do you want to get water?

576
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,179
Want to get water?

577
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,138
-Okay.
-Go ahead.

578
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,431
I don't have to go.

579
00:32:56,182 --> 00:33:00,019
So-e helped them go together just now.

580
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,229
-I know.
-Right?

581
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,271
I can do that.

582
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,732
Weren't we the very first to go?

583
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,986
-Yes, that's right.
-You're right. That's cool.

584
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,530
Don't I look like a student?

585
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,115
Yes, you do.

586
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,783
Hey, did you do the assignment?

587
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,706
It's his first time doing it,

588
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,582
-but he did it easily.
-He managed?

589
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,168
-Wait, what?
-He's done already?

590
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,713
-My gosh.
-It's done.

591
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,214
What's going on?

592
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,508
Last time, it took us about 20 minutes

593
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,051
-to start the fire.
-Right.

594
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,230
He's concise.

595
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:49,694
I think Jin-young is unusual
because you know how

596
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,363
-he has something going on with Seul-ki?
-Yes.

597
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,657
But Seul-ki went somewhere
with two other men.

598
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,992
Shouldn't that bother him?

599
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,746
But he's only interested
in the firewood. Look at him.

600
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,415
-Don't you think so?
-That's what's making Seul-ki

601
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,542
-more anxious.
-Exactly.

602
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,461
But he's not even pretending.

603
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,380
He's just focused
on starting the fire, right?

604
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,631
Yes.

605
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,010
-It's so beautiful.
-It is.

606
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:18,848
Don't you think the weather's
especially nice today?

607
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,017
Let's fill this up with water.

608
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,937
It's coming out well.

609
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,733
-Let's watch the scenery while we wait.
-Okay.

610
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,906
I can't help but just stare.

611
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,287
Just looking at this
is helping to relieve…

612
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,332
-Your frustration?
-Yes.

613
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,543
I wanted to ask
about your trip to Paradise.

614
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,628
With Jin-young?

615
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,671
How was it talking to him?

616
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,134
I'm not really sure
what kind of person he is.

617
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,014
-Do you want to talk with him more?
-You should talk to him more.

618
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,641
Yes.

619
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,985
They both have feelings for Seul-ki.

620
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,866
You went there with me.
Did you get a sense of who I am?

621
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,535
-When you look at me.
-Yes.

622
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,161
Did you figure me out?

623
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,246
-Yes.
-I see.

624
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:27,416
It shouldn't have been so easy.
Maybe I was too open about myself.

625
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,389
-Is this even in season?
-Did you find your way here okay?

626
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,350
-Well, it took longer than I expected.
-Let's try our best.

627
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,477
-There were so many steps, right?
-Yes.

628
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:50,857
The stairs were narrow,
so I almost fell a few times.

629
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,441
-Really?
-Yes.

630
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,487
-There are 12 people now.
-Yes.

631
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,614
-I wanted to teach you.
-I know it already.

632
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,950
We're like one big family, right?

633
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:01,909
It is.

634
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,037
If you have any questions,
or if you need help, just ask me.

635
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,122
Okay. Thank you.

636
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,668
It's good.
I think it'll taste delicious.

637
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,838
-Do you know how to slice this?
-Yes.

638
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,423
Take a guess.

639
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,843
-Don't you think?
-I think it'll take time.

640
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,137
-You need to work hard.
-I always work hard.

641
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,889
You cut them…

642
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,350
so delicately.

643
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,560
What? This?

644
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,562
Well, there's no reason to rush.

645
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,939
-"There's no reason to rush."
-You're such a guy.

646
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,566
Is that a dialect?

647
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,484
Maybe?

648
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,323
I was going to do it,
but I somehow made you do everything.

649
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,158
Right. You're bossing me around.

650
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,493
You didn't know?

651
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,040
Really?

652
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,253
That's good. I think we can make more.

653
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,213
Four cans…

654
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,466
This is for the stew. This too.

655
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,176
This is for the broth.

656
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,469
Garlic and…

657
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,473
Who's good at peeling garlic?

658
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,017
Me. I can do it.

659
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,976
-Really?
-Yes.

660
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,937
-It's not easy.
-I'll try it.

661
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,527
-I think that'll be enough.
-Be careful.

662
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,031
I can do it. I'll try it.

663
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,160
-Yes?
-Where are the onions for the stew?

664
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,454
-I'll do it.
-Drain the oil…

665
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:29,914
-I see.
-Shall we?

666
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,374
Yes, I'll do it.

667
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,833
-Thank you.
-Sure.

668
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,174
The person who looked out for me
the most when I came here

669
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,426
is So-e, I think.

670
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,639
I was able to adjust more quickly
because she took care of me.

671
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,852
-Seul-ki.
-Yes?

672
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,980
-Come here.
-What did you say?

673
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,189
Come here, please.

674
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,649
Should I do the dishes?

675
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:00,987
Yes. I'll wash them with dish soap,
and you can just rinse them off.

676
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,946
Okay.

677
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,365
Are you good at washing dishes?

678
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,826
I guess I'm not bad at it.

679
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,496
-I'll be watching you then.
-Okay.

680
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,546
-Why didn't you come out earlier?
-What?

681
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,797
Why didn't you come out?

682
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,259
-When you guys were on the beach?
-Yes. Were you ill?

683
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,261
-Yes. I was feeling unwell.
-I see.

684
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,598
Maybe you got sick
from having too much fun yesterday.

685
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,766
Exactly.

686
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,270
-Are you feeling okay now?
-Yes.

687
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,027
What's with these dishes?
They keep appearing.

688
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,986
I know, right?

689
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,280
Jong-woo, what are you doing
with the pepper?

690
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,616
Jong-woo…

691
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,163
I'll just put this back inside.

692
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,582
-Are you done already?
-Yes.

693
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,917
You're a human dishwasher.

694
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,795
I did everything else
while you worked on that one plate.

695
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,715
-Seul-ki.
-It's so cute.

696
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,133
Seul-ki.

697
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,885
My gosh. Who didn't do it?

698
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,636
Seul-ki.

699
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,890
The way Jin-young speaks is so odd.

700
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:11,891
Right?

701
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:15,269
When he's playing around,
he speaks respectfully,

702
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,605
but he speaks casually
when he's worried.

703
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,564
Really?

704
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,900
He uses honorifics to Seul-ki,

705
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,402
but then his attitude suddenly changes

706
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,029
when he asks her if she's okay.

707
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,073
"Get it together, Seul-ki.

708
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,908
But are you feeling okay?"

709
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,454
Kyuhyun sounds sweet either way.

710
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,124
-You can't imitate Jin-young.
-They're not the same.

711
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,834
What is that?

712
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,420
-Are you using two knives?
-Yes.

713
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,214
I need to chop this up quickly.

714
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,007
We have a robot here.

715
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,300
A cooking robot.

716
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,260
Are you Wolverine or something?

717
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,806
Chef, the rice looks good.
It's perfect for fried rice.

718
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,848
Let's fry it up.

719
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,308
Okay.

720
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,769
Something smells good.

721
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:57,728
-Right?
-Yes.

722
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,231
That smells so good.

723
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,149
-That scent.
-It looks good.

724
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,034
It's kimchi fried rice!

725
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,245
Let's dig in!

726
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,414
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

727
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,709
-This is delicious.
-It's good.

728
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,171
This is so good.

729
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,924
It's delicious.

730
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,385
I think this is
the best thing I've eaten here.

731
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,719
It's delicious.

732
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,348
Do you know how to cook?

733
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,226
No. I just help out when I'm needed.

734
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,728
Are you good with names?

735
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,188
I'm trying my best.

736
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,524
I see. How many names have you memorized?

737
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,652
-What if she hasn't yet?
-No, I memorized some.

738
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,446
Whose names do you remember?

739
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,905
Seul-ki.

740
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,782
Dong-woo. Yoong-jae.

741
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,576
Se-jeong.

742
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,411
What?

743
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,913
Se-jun, get ready for your turn.

744
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,250
I'll get it eventually.
I can't remember any at the moment.

745
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,254
There's someone who uses name tags.

746
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,340
There's someone
who hasn't memorized our names.

747
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,259
He still can't remember our names.

748
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,635
I'm getting there.

749
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,180
He just got here yesterday.

750
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,140
The food was so good.

751
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,142
-Yes. It was perfect.
-Exactly.

752
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,813
There are two new members who have joined.

753
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,524
-Things are awkward.
-Yes, but at least Se-jun

754
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,735
-is talking to So-e.
-Yes.

755
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,737
So-e is taking care of him.

756
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,531
-Se-jun must feel grateful.
-Right.

757
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,242
Do you think Se-jun might
develop feelings for So-e?

758
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,955
But when So-e approached him
to talk to him,

759
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,791
he didn't really look at her.

760
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,376
I think that's just how he is.

761
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,421
He just stared straight ahead
while opening a can.

762
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,590
When he came to help her open it,

763
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,468
he didn't say, "Here, let me help."

764
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,845
He just came up
to her indifferently and did it.

765
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,681
It could still be awkward for him
to make eye contact.

766
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:03,354
During dinner, I saw that all the women
were very interested in Jin-young.

767
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:08,108
But I wonder who Jin-young
has feelings for.

768
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,320
When Jin-young starts a fire
or chops ingredients,

769
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,948
someone is always around him.

770
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:18,035
But Seul-ki
is the only person he called over.

771
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,119
Right.

772
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,414
So I think she's
definitely more important to him.

773
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,458
The moon is beautiful.

774
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,418
-It is.
-I can't stop looking at it.

775
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,671
-My gosh. There's beer.
-What?

776
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,589
There's beer?

777
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,552
-Beer?
-I'm down.

778
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,263
The new members should sit in the middle.

779
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,182
-You should sit in the middle.
-New members in the middle.

780
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,600
Right over there.

781
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,768
Thank you.

782
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,353
-Lefty, right?
-Yes.

783
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,896
Over there.

784
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,608
-We're too close together.
-I know, right?

785
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,695
-It's nice. I like it. It's warm.
-Everyone has one?

786
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,877
He's next to So-e, but…

787
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,963
-Uncomfortable.
-Tried to get another seat,

788
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,548
but he came back this way.

789
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,593
-But So-e…
-She felt that.

790
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,344
-…definitely felt that.
-Right.

791
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,471
What? Really?

792
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,265
I recommend this one.

793
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,559
-Thank you. Do you like beer?
-What?

794
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,394
-Do you like beer?
-Yes, I like beer.

795
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,523
Let's make a toast.

796
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,191
Cheers. Let's make a wave.

797
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,319
Cheers.

798
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:39,950
This is good.

799
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,119
-It's delicious.
-It's so good.

800
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,580
Now that the new members are here,

801
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,458
-why don't we ask questions?
-Yes, let's ask.

802
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,835
What's your type?

803
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,463
-She's so direct.
-I told you.

804
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,214
-You did.
-It is Single's Inferno.

805
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,174
Right.

806
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,219
Well, personality-wise,

807
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,056
I like someone
who is considerate of others.

808
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,557
-I see.
-I see.

809
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,225
And appearance-wise…

810
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:10,356
Well, I like someone
who looks charismatic,

811
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,107
but it's not that important.

812
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,361
-Looks don't matter to me that much.
-Someone who's charismatic?

813
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,322
But if I must choose,
then someone who has strong features.

814
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,616
-What about you, Min-su?
-What about you?

815
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,702
Appearance-wise,
I like someone who has a nice smile.

816
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,621
-Someone with a nice smile.
-Yes.

817
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,415
And I like a man with a big build.

818
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,834
And personality-wise,

819
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,129
I like someone who has good manners.

820
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,631
-Manners.
-Someone like that.

821
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,300
I like someone
who makes me feel comfortable.

822
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,011
-It's your first day in Inferno.
-Yes.

823
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,888
How does it feel to be here?

824
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,683
-Your first impression or--
-Honestly,

825
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:49,019
I don't think it feels like hell yet
because today was so…

826
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,979
-She hasn't had a taste of it yet.
-No.

827
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,189
It takes a few days.

828
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,401
I'm looking forward
to experiencing hell in Inferno.

829
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,278
-I'm glad you like this place.
-Yes.

830
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,571
-Se-jeong.
-Yes?

831
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,908
How has Inferno been treating you?

832
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,076
-Inferno?
-Yes.

833
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,452
Really want my opinion?

834
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,539
-What?
-You'll regret it.

835
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,626
Well, it's a new experience.

836
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,130
But I can grow from it.

837
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,882
-I see.
-And it helped me learn about myself.

838
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,426
-Yes, you're right.
-Who I am…

839
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,511
She's been in Inferno for four days.

840
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,888
-Really?
-She can tell you exactly how it is.

841
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,306
You too, right?

842
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,975
Yes, so…

843
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,520
-So we can tell you about it.
-What about you, Jong-woo?

844
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,980
-How I feel about it?
-Yes.

845
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:38,110
Well, Inferno is a place that sometimes

846
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:42,197
makes you feel like you're in heaven.

847
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,286
I think everyone feels
differently about staying here.

848
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,038
It could be heaven or hell.

849
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,374
-It's one or the other.
-It's heaven and hell.

850
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,169
Is this heaven?

851
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,671
-Yes, this is heaven for me.
-This is heaven.

852
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:58,922
I'm so happy.

853
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,217
It's heaven right now.

854
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,139
The beer tastes good.

855
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,308
-It's great, right?
-Yes, this is perfect.

856
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,517
I think we need soju.

857
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,729
-But…
-Are you done?

858
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,397
-Another one.
-Yes, another one.

859
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,274
-Are you done drinking?
-Yes.

860
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,859
-Is there smoke?
-Do number three.

861
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,360
-Four, three…
-Let's see.

862
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,945
-Want to switch?
-No, I'm fine.

863
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,155
This is challenging.

864
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,449
-You landed in prison.
-Want to sit here?

865
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,034
-There's no smoke here.
-Go.

866
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,744
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

867
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,872
It's okay. I'm experiencing
a communication barrier here, so…

868
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,763
-He said he wanted to switch seats.
-Yes.

869
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,515
I think it's so funny.

870
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,226
He's trying to sit next to Seo-eun.

871
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,310
Exactly.

872
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,396
-Like this?
-No, like this.

873
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,024
When did she move over there?

874
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,152
-I know, right?
-I mean, when did she go over there?

875
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,748
-What are you up to, Seul-ki?
-What?

876
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,501
-Can we talk real quick?
-Right now?

877
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,835
-Yes.
-Sure.

878
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,755
Is there no one here?

879
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,387
Do you want to talk
while looking at the ocean?

880
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,471
-Sure.
-Okay.

881
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,765
-Then let's sit next to each other.
-Okay.

882
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:38,438
When we first returned from Paradise,
I wanted to talk to you alone.

883
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,648
I see.

884
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:44,945
I thought I wouldn't have
many opportunities to talk to you

885
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,072
after returning from Paradise.

886
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,365
Okay.

887
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,784
-And I was right.
-I see.

888
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:55,205
To be honest, my impression of you changed

889
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,834
after returning from Paradise.

890
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,171
How did it change?

891
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,214
Well…

892
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:15,517
I thought we didn't really hit it off.

893
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,395
-Like, in what way?
-Well…

894
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,992
It's just…

895
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,078
You just treat me

896
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:42,836
like someone who's much younger than you.

897
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,299
I mean,

898
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:52,804
I get that you were trying
to be considerate.

899
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,641
Maybe you just thought of me
as being much younger,

900
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,060
so you acted like that
because you like me.

901
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:03,649
But I felt like you weren't taking me
seriously because of my age.

902
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:07,194
That's just how I felt.

903
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,656
Honestly, you're right.

904
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,242
I just wanted to take care of you.

905
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,410
Right.

906
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,455
And maybe I treated you like
you were much younger than me.

907
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:24,127
But when a person has feelings
for someone else,

908
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,714
-it makes them happy to provide things.
-Okay.

909
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,467
-I think that's what I was trying to do.
-I see.

910
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,679
I understand.

911
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,809
So when I came back from Paradise,

912
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:44,731
I contemplated a lot and had a hard time.

913
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,204
How should I say this?

914
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,790
I think I feel more comfortable
around you now.

915
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,754
Maybe not as a potential love interest,

916
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:13,635
but I feel like we can be
close friends now more than anything.

917
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:22,436
So when we came back from Paradise,
it wasn't easy for me to talk to you.

918
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,356
Just by ourselves, that is.

919
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:37,159
So did you want to spend more time
with other people?

920
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:43,457
Yes. By then, I think I wanted
to get to know other people.

921
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:49,671
Anyway, this is where you get
to know other people,

922
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:53,925
and find someone you like, right?

923
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,095
-Right.
-So I wanted to focus on that.

924
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:06,980
So I guess there are more people
that you want to get to know.

925
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,111
Yes.

926
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,504
It's the first time
she's talked about her feelings.

927
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,255
-Yes.
-I get what she's saying.

928
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,757
She's being honest about it.

929
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,926
Dong-woo is in disbelief.

930
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,928
They spent their time together,

931
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:40,263
but they felt something
completely different.

932
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:44,351
Dong-woo kept saying he was having
a good time when he was with her.

933
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,686
And Seul-ki finally expressed

934
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,774
how she feels in an honest way,

935
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,985
but Dong-woo is in disbelief.

936
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,905
He asked the same thing
about four times.

937
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,198
He really kept asking.

938
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,741
Dong-woo…

939
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,159
I'm sure Dong-woo felt it.

940
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,206
Everybody disappeared,
and I didn't even know.

941
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,457
I know, right?

942
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,210
Earlier, someone said
they were going to the restroom,

943
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,462
and then people started disappearing.

944
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,463
That's how it is.

945
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,422
-Really?
-Yes.

946
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,591
Are they all women?

947
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,051
What?

948
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,554
Is he surrounded by four women right now?

949
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,930
Hey. What is this?

950
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,349
-Is it four-on-one?
-What is this?

951
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,142
-That's how it is.
-Really?

952
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,395
-Yes.
-I'm not good at that.

953
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,939
I'm straightforward.
I just say, "Can we talk?"

954
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,567
Their signal is saying
they're off to the restroom.

955
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,818
-That's the signal?
-Yes.

956
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,027
-Really?
-Yes.

957
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,404
No wonder everyone got up.

958
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,073
They were all going
to the restroom, right?

959
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,533
And they didn't come back.

960
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,159
Exactly.

961
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,332
Do you have someone in mind?

962
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,793
-Will you say it?
-Do you want to talk to anyone?

963
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,753
-Me?
-Yes.

964
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:59,467
I want to talk to everyone at least once,
and with those I haven't yet.

965
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,139
-Are you heading back?
-What?

966
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,016
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Okay.

967
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,184
-Bye, Seul-ki.
-Bye.

968
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,315
Seul-ki.

969
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,817
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yes.

970
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:16,902
Let's go talk later.

971
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:17,861
Okay.

972
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,409
Who's in there?

973
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:30,290
It's Nadine and the friend
you talked to in the afternoon.

974
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,458
Who? A guy?

975
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,500
-Yes.
-Jong-woo.

976
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,464
I think he's a good competitor.

977
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,219
That's funny.

978
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,971
I was walking by and heard,

979
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:49,059
"I want to talk
to everyone at least once."

980
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,647
I didn't even know.
Were you behind me?

981
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,690
You were surrounded by women.

982
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,317
That's what you said.

983
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,445
You looked so arrogant.

984
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,696
-Really?
-Yes.

985
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,494
Why did you have
to walk by at that moment?

986
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,704
Punk.

987
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:11,915
Fine.

988
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,085
That was hilarious.

989
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,628
Did you see the sunset today?

990
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,463
-Yes, it was pretty.
-So you saw it?

991
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,465
Yes. When I went to get water earlier.

992
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,258
-What? You went to get water?
-Yes.

993
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,510
-When?
-You didn't see me?

994
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,679
-With who?
-You weren't paying attention.

995
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,472
No, you vanished from my sight.

996
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,849
You should've kept an eye on me.

997
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,434
Why do you keep disappearing?

998
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,353
But I kept my eye on you.

999
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,984
So did you have fun talking?

1000
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,695
-With who?
-The person you just spoke to.

1001
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,281
-Dong-woo?
-Yes.

1002
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,366
Right. Dong-woo.

1003
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,535
No.

1004
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:50,704
Why not?

1005
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,163
You didn't have a good time?

1006
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,332
I told him everything honestly.

1007
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,583
What did you say?

1008
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,460
That I don't have feelings for him.

1009
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,837
-Really?
-Yes.

1010
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,131
So you know how to be honest.

1011
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,090
Yes.

1012
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,766
Are you okay now?

1013
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,186
It didn't seem like
you were feeling okay today.

1014
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,566
I don't think you feel
too good right now, either.

1015
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,986
I'm not in a good mood.

1016
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,697
I mean, it's not easy

1017
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,952
to say those things.

1018
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,829
-I see.
-So…

1019
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,832
-Because you had to be honest?
-Yes.

1020
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,129
I feel so frustrated.

1021
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,675
-But I'm…
-Yes?

1022
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,636
I'm just…

1023
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,223
following my heart right now.

1024
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,230
Why didn't you talk with Seul-ki?

1025
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,818
Because she was talking with Dong-woo.

1026
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,279
She was talking to Dong-woo, so…

1027
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,616
This is a lot harder than I thought.

1028
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,617
I know, right?

1029
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,619
Everyone's choices overlap.

1030
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:18,708
After I came back from Paradise
for the second time,

1031
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,045
everyone was really curious to know
what it was like with you.

1032
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,714
-Really?
-Yes, they kept asking.

1033
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:29,302
The guys kept asking me too.
But I just said, "It was just okay."

1034
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,012
But I actually had a good time.

1035
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,265
But then I didn't want to say that.

1036
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,728
And I didn't want other people
to imagine us being together.

1037
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,231
If I say I had a good time,
they'll ask why.

1038
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,024
So I just kept saying,

1039
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,361
"Well, it was all right."

1040
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,908
-But I really had a good time.
-Right.

1041
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,119
I also said I wasn't sure.

1042
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,168
Let's go.

1043
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,379
Let's go over there.

1044
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,634
You're tired, so tonight you should…

1045
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:12,428
-I'm not tired. You are.
-No, I'm not.

1046
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:16,266
Seriously, I just think
you should take care of yourself.

1047
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,851
-Seul-ki.
-Yes?

1048
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,978
Are you done talking?

1049
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,480
-Are you tipsy?
-I'm sleepy.

1050
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,815
-You're sleepy?
-Yes.

1051
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,358
Do you want to call it a night?

1052
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,444
Let's talk tomorrow.

1053
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,945
-You must be exhausted.
-Yes.

1054
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,029
Okay.

1055
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,199
You should head inside.
I'll bring you the book.

1056
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,828
Just read one passage
before you go to sleep. Okay?

1057
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,163
Since you're too tired.

1058
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,373
-I'll bring it to you.
-Okay.

1059
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,630
Did you talk to her?

1060
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,552
She's really tired,
so I'm just going to give her the book.

1061
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,399
Can I come in?

1062
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,109
Yes.

1063
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,944
I'll be quick.

1064
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:16,159
I marked it for you.
Just read this side. Okay?

1065
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,911
-Okay.
-Then go to sleep, okay?

1066
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,079
Good night.

1067
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:28,129
Don't get too nervous
when you meet someone.

1068
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:32,050
If you keep tensing up
it's because you're trying too hard.

1069
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:35,720
So stop trying so hard
and things will work out eventually.

1070
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,263
Isn't this what he wants
to say?

1071
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,433
Yes, I think he's communicating
his feelings through this.

1072
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,227
Relax and you'll know what to do.

1073
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,437
Unrequited love is so sad to me.

1074
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,732
Oh, my gosh.

1075
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,818
Are you going somewhere?

1076
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,237
-Can we talk?
-Sure.

1077
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,782
-To be honest…
-Yes?

1078
00:58:57,408 --> 00:59:00,286
I was going to ask if we could talk.

1079
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,246
Yes.

1080
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,872
So I just wanted to say

1081
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:08,878
thank you for asking me first.

1082
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:14,300
When we talked yesterday,

1083
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,428
I said I'd tell you

1084
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,556
-how I feel before it's too late.
-Yes.

1085
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:24,060
But I thought it would be too late
if I didn't talk to you today.

1086
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,812
Right.

1087
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:31,693
Honestly, I thought about it a lot.
Really. I mean it.

1088
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,950
And I think that for now, I feel that…

1089
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,039
during the remainder of this time…

1090
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,835
I should talk…

1091
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,588
to other people.

1092
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,507
Or maybe

1093
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:59,095
take this opportunity…

1094
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,726
to talk to other people
as much as possible.

1095
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:09,397
I think that would be
better for me.

1096
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,482
I see.

1097
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:14,527
Anyway, those are my thoughts.

1098
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:20,199
-But when you say "other people."
-Yes?

1099
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,661
I mean, if we're going to be honest here,

1100
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:28,166
I didn't ask you about other people.

1101
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:30,376
I only talked about us

1102
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,130
-because it could've been rude.
-Right.

1103
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,633
But now, I don't think I have a choice.

1104
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,426
-Right.
-So I want to ask you.

1105
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:43,806
When you said, "other people,"
you meant Seo-eun, right?

1106
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:53,066
I think I'm the one
who always keeps an eye on you.

1107
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:57,820
Of course, it might not just be me,

1108
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,406
but that's what I've been doing.

1109
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,368
But what made me feel bad

1110
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:10,333
was knowing that
you only had eyes for Seo-eun.

1111
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,919
That's what I felt.

1112
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,757
Is that about right?

1113
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:21,761
You're feeling what I'm feeling right now.

1114
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,764
Right?

1115
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,528
I can't really deny that.

1116
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,534
I can't help how I feel.

1117
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,745
So, of course,
you can't help how you feel too.

1118
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:48,871
I understand that.

1119
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:56,254
Honestly, I say that I understand,

1120
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:59,465
but I'm not mature enough
to truly understand.

1121
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,593
It's not easy.

1122
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,595
-It's not easy.
-Yes.

1123
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,389
But I think it's possible.

1124
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:09,100
Because time will solve everything anyway.

1125
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:14,522
This is important to me right now,

1126
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,899
but as time passes,
it won't be a big deal.

1127
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,408
If we talk about this now,

1128
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:30,246
I thought we'd feel
more comfortable around each other.

1129
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,582
-Yes.
-I mean,

1130
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,628
I said I wanted to get to know you,

1131
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:42,300
but it could also mean

1132
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:46,220
that we can become good friends or peers.

1133
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:49,432
-If that's okay with you.
-Yes.

1134
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:55,271
So I thought we'd be able to have fun
for the rest of the time here.

1135
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,399
We could just casually ask each other
how we slept and stuff.

1136
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,734
-You know?
-Right.

1137
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:03,070
I thought it'd be okay to have
that kind of relationship with you.

1138
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:08,951
Feelings aside,
if we can get along as friends,

1139
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:12,455
I don't think I could ask
for anything better than that.

1140
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,415
That's how I feel.

1141
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:15,374
Good.

1142
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,503
Five more days.

1143
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,095
-I hope we get along.
-Me too.

1144
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:37,271
I'm going to learn
how to cook from Han-bin.

1145
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,732
-I see.
-I'll make you something delicious.

1146
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,737
I just said that to make you laugh.

1147
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:46,239
-Come on, just laugh.
-Okay.

1148
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,867
Thank you for telling me how you feel.

1149
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:01,838
I'm good.

1150
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,050
-Thank you for telling me how you feel.
-Not at all. I…

1151
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,971
You don't need to thank me.

1152
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,561
-Should we head back now?
-Yes.

1153
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,441
-Last drink?
-Yes.

1154
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:34,912
-Good night.
-Good night.

1155
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,388
It's going to be a long night.

1156
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,558
It was almost suffocating

1157
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,227
to watch that.

1158
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,186
Same here.

1159
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,732
-So-e is the one who should be comforted.
-Right.

1160
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:07,778
But Yoong-jae had no other choice
but to tell So-e the harsh truth.

1161
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:08,738
Right.

1162
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,157
It seemed like So-e was comforting him

1163
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,035
so that he wouldn't feel bad.

1164
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,080
That was so sad for me
because So-e is the one who needs support.

1165
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:22,585
She sounded sad
when she said she was okay.

1166
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,754
I'm sure he isn't feeling good, either.

1167
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:25,713
Probably not.

1168
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,549
But I think the conversation went well.

1169
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,259
-What?
-I don't think so.

1170
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:34,305
How is it possible for someone
to just shut down their feelings,

1171
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:35,932
-and change their mind?
-Right.

1172
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:38,893
"Let's be friends from tomorrow."
That's not how it works.

1173
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:42,980
But even if she gave up on him,

1174
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:46,609
it's not going to be easy for So-e

1175
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:51,989
to approach anyone else
on the show at this point.

1176
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,324
My gosh.

1177
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,953
-It's not fun anymore.
-What can we do?

1178
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,537
Can't So-e just leave?

1179
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,333
-Let her go.
-No, not yet…

1180
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,001
All it takes is a boat.

1181
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,962
How will she make it through this?

1182
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,297
Right. Can't we send So-e a helicopter?

1183
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,507
Exactly.

1184
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,384
-Gosh.
-So-e is really brave.

1185
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,198
You weren't feeling good yesterday, right?

1186
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:36,826
-Right.
-How are you today? Are you okay?

1187
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:39,120
Yes, because you took care of me so well.

1188
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,204
How so? With food?

1189
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:42,456
You were the doctor.

1190
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,628
If you need more,
I also have Omega-3 supplements.

1191
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,923
Do you usually take care of your health?

1192
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:57,179
Yes. Good health leads to happiness.
You need to be healthy to be happy.

1193
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:59,306
Yes.

1194
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,434
I was grateful
for what you did yesterday.

1195
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,562
But she already has her own doctor.

1196
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,858
I was wondering what you meant.

1197
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,234
Jeez.

1198
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:14,113
Jong-woo only has eyes for one person.

1199
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:32,965
-What's going on?
-This guy…

1200
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,467
-Is he sick?
-It's the new guy.

1201
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,968
The new guy is just sleeping.

1202
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,970
-Is that an IV in his arm?
-The new guy?

1203
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,513
I get why he's tired, though.

1204
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,229
He got here yesterday.
He's probably tired.

1205
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,149
We were all up late last night too.

1206
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,486
Think about our first day.
Of course, he's tired.

1207
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,404
-We were like…
-We passed out.

1208
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:56,822
We were like this.

1209
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,784
We just leaned back
and slept on our first day.

1210
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,077
We know how it feels.

1211
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,203
Wake up, please.

1212
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:08,626
-You have to sit in that position.
-Gosh, I slept well.

1213
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,767
The hottest inferno in the world,
Single's Inferno.

1214
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:29,355
Today, only the newly-arrived contestants,
Se-jun and Min-su,

1215
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:33,692
will be allowed to choose the partners
they'd like to go to Paradise with.

1216
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,488
-They deserve it.
-Really?

1217
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:42,576
-Now we can find out who they like.
-Right.

1218
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,702
It's a privilege.

1219
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:44,995
They deserve this.

1220
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,413
-There's no time.
-Right.

1221
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,208
They're going to Paradise right away.

1222
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,836
I'm so jealous.
I've never been there.

1223
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,712
I didn't expect this at all.

1224
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,882
How did they think to give them
the option to choose?

1225
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,760
They will be able
to make their choices this afternoon.

1226
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:05,641
This could be very cruel to someone.

1227
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,685
-Right.
-Right.

1228
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:10,271
-They can choose.
-I had no clue they'd go.

1229
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:14,191
I think the more attractive your crush is,
the more nervous you'll be.

1230
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,651
I wonder who'll get to go.

1231
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:32,751
I'm interested in Yoong-jae.

1232
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,503
I don't know how it all happened.

1233
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,589
If I'm not okay, then what should I do?

1234
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,090
I want him for myself.

1235
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,176
I really want to win.

1236
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,887
It's become like this
ever since Jin-young got here.

1237
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,764
I'm not sure about Jin-young yet.

1238
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,766
I feel strongly about her,

1239
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,977
but she's confusing me. I don't like it.

1240
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,813
I just feel like everything
will be taken away from me.

1241
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,190
I really want to win.

1242
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,650
He's really something.
