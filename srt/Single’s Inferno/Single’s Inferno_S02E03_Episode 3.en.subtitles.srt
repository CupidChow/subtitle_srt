LEE DA-HEE - CHO KYU-HYUN

00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,550
I think so.

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,551
Wait…

15
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,844
It might not be her.

16
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,387
What do you mean? It is her.

17
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,555
No, it's not.

18
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,023
Nice to see you.

19
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,984
You're so wise.

20
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,363
Thankfully.

21
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,073
Thank you.

22
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:56,950
-It is!
-Goodness.

23
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,243
Yes!

24
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,203
So he chose Seo-eun

25
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,830
-out of the three women?
-Yes.

26
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,373
That's amazing.

27
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,876
-This is fun.
-Gosh.

28
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,799
We escaped. We can leave this place.

29
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,553
-Cool, right?
-Gosh.

30
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,972
-Did you see this coming?
-No.

31
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,516
-Really?
-Yes, I had a lot on my mind.

32
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,475
Right.

33
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,434
I…

34
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,525
I'm so surprised right now.

35
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,611
Did you have me in mind when we talked?

36
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,488
When?

37
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,949
I mean, even before you and I talked.

38
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:38,908
Yes.

39
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,495
Why didn't you give me any hints?

40
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,788
What? You think I should have?

41
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,123
Yes.

42
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,959
Was I not being obvious earlier?

43
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,337
I kind of had a feeling
that you might like me.

44
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,630
I see.

45
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,758
So what were you worried about?

46
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,385
I was worried that…

47
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,804
-Should we talk about this later?
-Okay.

48
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,889
Since we have…

49
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,100
-A lot of time today?
-…a lot of time to have fun.

50
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,769
This is fun.

51
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,271
-So fun.
-It really is.

52
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,981
-So fun.
-I feel the same.

53
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,038
I thought you'd get chosen.

54
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,753
What?

55
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,381
-Did she forget something?
-Did she?

56
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,717
-Did you forget something?
-No.

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,718
-What?
-What?

58
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,677
Aren't you going?

59
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,304
-No.
-What?

60
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,682
No way.

61
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,351
-We thought you'd go.
-Really?

62
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,269
-You went on a date.
-You went on a date.

63
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,527
I'm upset.

64
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,793
SHIN SEUL-KI

65
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,294
-Shin Seul-ki.
-Seul-ki.

66
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,420
She got two votes.

67
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,133
Han-bin.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,014
Seo-eun also got two votes.

69
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,349
CHOI SEO-EUN

70
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,977
I wonder who's left.

71
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,229
Should we go outside?

72
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,110
I'm sad.

73
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,736
The view is nice.

74
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,616
-Hello.
-Hello.

75
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,575
This is crazy.

76
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,703
All of our luggage…

77
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,579
-Should we put it back?
-We should.

78
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,457
-Again.
-Unpack again.

79
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,834
I'm dizzy all of a sudden.

80
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,502
-It's like a headache.
-A migraine.

81
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,463
It feels like I've been hit in the head.

82
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,929
-This is complicated.
-I'm worried about tonight on Inferno.

83
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,891
Among those who are left,
no one chose each other.

84
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,603
-No one got any votes here.
-Right.

85
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,105
I guess I'm…

86
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:18,026
-I'm curious about them.
-Se-jeong and Jong-woo didn't seem okay.

87
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,486
-It showed on their faces.
-Yes.

88
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,446
-Right.
-Yes.

89
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,032
-Out of the four men,
-Yes.

90
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,285
two of them picked Seo-eun
and the other two picked Seul-ki.

91
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,954
Yoong-jae chose Seo-eun.

92
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:30,997
-Gosh.
-Right?

93
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,833
-I honestly thought Yoong-jae…
-Yes?

94
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,960
…would go with Se-jeong.

95
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,420
I thought he'd go with So-e.

96
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,840
It's his decision to make,
but think about it.

97
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,342
So-e had her eye on Yoong-jae all day.

98
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,302
Right.

99
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:48,389
And there's Se-jeong, who indirectly said
they should go on a trip together.

100
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,432
Right.

101
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,769
-But he chose Seo-eun in the end.
-Right.

102
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,645
-After speaking to her briefly.
-Yes.

103
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,314
I think that's amazing.

104
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:01,611
I think Yoong-jae
spoke the least with Seo-eun.

105
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,071
But in that short period,

106
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,074
I felt like the two clicked together.

107
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,618
Both of them are very down-to-earth.

108
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,038
They're very similar
in that they're both natural and genuine.

109
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,374
So I felt like they vibed with each other.
And look what happened.

110
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,378
-Also, Dong-woo and Nadine talked so much.
-Right.

111
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,173
But he eventually left with Seul-ki.

112
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,216
-Yes.
-Right.

113
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,013
It's a helicopter.

114
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,810
This is amazing.

115
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,852
So amazing.

116
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,860
It'll be fun.

117
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,070
This is so much fun.

118
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,713
Then…

119
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,549
-The helicopter's flying away.
-Hey!

120
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,142
-The helicopter's flying away.
-Bye!

121
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,853
Bye.

122
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,440
This is so sad.

123
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,483
-Bye!
-Don't leave!

124
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,943
Don't leave!

125
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,529
It's flying really low.

126
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,406
They want us to see.

127
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,199
They're flying low
so that we can see them.

128
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,201
We're teasing them.

129
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,137
I'm jealous.

130
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,689
I'm chopping out of anger.

131
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,735
I bet Paradise is really fun.

132
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,777
It probably is.

133
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:14,994
PARADISE

134
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,963
Amazing.

135
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,174
It's so nice here.

136
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,596
It's super spacious. This place is huge.

137
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,519
It's so spacious
that my eyes keep wandering.

138
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,479
-Yes.
-This place is enormous.

139
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,738
It's so spacious.

140
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,617
LIVING ROOM

141
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,119
The ceiling is so high.

142
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:01,207
Everyone on Inferno could come here,
and there would still be enough space.

143
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,626
There's a swimming pool too.

144
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,420
-There are a lot of things here.
-Exactly.

145
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,216
SWIMMING POOL

146
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,342
This is so nice.

147
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,055
The swimming pool is very big.

148
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,682
-Awesome.
-Super big.

149
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,641
It is.

150
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,436
Seul-ki, come over here.

151
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,480
Check this out.

152
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,024
This is the bedroom.

153
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:27,984
BEDROOM 1

154
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,986
The bedroom is really spacious.

155
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,863
There's one here, too.

156
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,657
It's connected to the swimming pool.

157
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,783
This is nice.

158
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,742
BEDROOM 2

159
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,868
Do you want this one?

160
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,704
I choose this room.

161
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,956
-This room?
-Yes, I want this one.

162
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,875
BATHROOM

163
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,669
How is the bathroom this huge?

164
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:48,879
SAUNA

165
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,964
Over here.

166
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,882
There's a sauna here.

167
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,094
And a powder room.

168
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,599
This really is paradise.

169
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,601
It's Paradise, indeed.

170
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,313
-We…
-One more high-five.

171
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,272
One more time.

172
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,153
-All I can say is, "Wow."
-Seriously. This place is mind-blowing.

173
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,822
I can't take it anymore.

174
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,241
Let's go swimming.

175
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,661
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

176
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,456
-Let's eat first, then think.
-Okay. Let's eat.

177
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,334
I'm starving.

178
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,545
This looks good.

179
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,922
I like salad.

180
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,674
-I see.
-There's fish.

181
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,301
There's more fish.

182
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,677
Let's order everything.

183
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,638
-Okay.
-Good.

184
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,640
What do you want to eat?

185
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,391
Honestly, I like everything.

186
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,061
All I need is protein. Meat.

187
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,479
-Fish and meat.
-Okay.

188
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,605
That's all I need.

189
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,108
I think it'll be nice
to order some drinks while we eat.

190
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,152
Are we drinking?

191
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,320
I mean, alcohol is…

192
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,280
I can't handle alcohol.

193
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,698
Really?

194
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,033
I see.

195
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,076
Really?

196
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,243
Then let's…

197
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,703
Then let's…

198
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,538
Are you okay?

199
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,499
I thought we'd at least have a drink.

200
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,334
Really? Okay, I'll have one drink.

201
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,002
Which one would you prefer?

202
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,380
-Champagne?
-Sure. I don't mind.

203
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,092
It looks like they have everything.

204
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,051
He seems confused.

205
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,219
This is important.

206
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,762
Alcohol preferences matter.

207
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,390
-They do. I think they do too.
-They do.

208
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,682
They didn't agree there.

209
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,060
PARADISE
SEO-EUN AND YOONG-JAE

210
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,603
It's warm.

211
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,147
It's so nice.

212
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,696
My special move.

213
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,367
You're good at swimming.

214
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,252
To Paradise.

215
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,212
-It's paradise.
-It is.

216
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:05,933
My gosh.

217
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,769
-I'm touched.
-It's so nice.

218
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,439
We chose the right dishes.

219
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,318
We had a crazy day today.

220
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,863
-I'm glad that…
-Yes.

221
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,906
…we got to come to Paradise together.

222
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,366
Cheers. Nice to meet you.

223
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,836
It's good, right?

224
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,338
Enjoy your meal.

225
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,674
Should we try this first?

226
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,633
-Yes.
-Right?

227
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,926
Of course.

228
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,345
Let's eat.

229
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,070
-Let's take our time.
-Okay.

230
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,616
What's your favorite kind of pasta?

231
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,119
If I had to choose
between tomato and cream sauce,

232
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,162
I'd choose cream.

233
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,747
-But I like tomato sauce too.
-Really?

234
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,915
-I see.
-Yes.

235
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:11,874
Thank you.

236
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,168
What do you like?

237
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,713
I honestly like
pasta with tomato sauce a bit better.

238
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,507
-Tomato sauce?
-Yes.

239
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,300
-A bit.
-I see.

240
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,468
This is good.

241
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,470
Right now, I like tomato sauce.

242
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,475
Right? Tomato sauce is good.

243
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,104
Wait, so…

244
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,692
You never give
any negative feedback, do you?

245
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,446
I mean, it seems like
you're always saying nice things.

246
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,074
I think you're like that too.

247
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,534
-In a way.
-Am I?

248
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,538
I try to be positive.

249
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,705
I see.

250
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,417
But it feels like you're a bubbly person.

251
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,086
Well…

252
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,630
-I'm usually bubbly.
-Right?

253
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,715
-Yes.
-That's exactly what I felt.

254
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,219
When we first talked,
you seemed very bubbly.

255
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,597
-You remember the first time we talked?
-The first time we talked?

256
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,891
Wait, radishes…

257
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,812
-That's when we first talked.
-Right, it started with radishes.

258
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,938
-Right?
-Yes.

259
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,690
We were peeling them.

260
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,776
Why are there so many holes?

261
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:21,860
Right?

262
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,489
But we talked for longer
right before we came here.

263
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,449
-Really?
-Yes.

264
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,702
It seems like you have a dilemma.

265
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,911
Yes, I have a dilemma.

266
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,496
You're not worried about that?

267
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,668
But it's not like I can change
how he feels by worrying about that.

268
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,212
You're very wise.

269
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,841
-Really?
-Yes.

270
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,135
-Right, it was that conversation.
-Yes.

271
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,387
That moment changed everything.

272
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,639
-They were wearing matching shirts.
-Yes.

273
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,141
So…

274
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,398
Did you choose me
because you're curious about me?

275
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,066
Let me go first.

276
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,029
I was very curious about you.

277
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,990
I usually like bubbly people a lot.

278
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,951
I thought you were super bubbly.

279
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:16,582
But I wondered
if you were like that with everyone.

280
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,209
So I wasn't quite sure

281
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,670
if you were interested in me.

282
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,006
But I couldn't figure it out at all.

283
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,970
I didn't know if I should choose you
or if it would be okay to do so.

284
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,014
-That's what I was thinking.
-I see.

285
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:36,393
I had been thinking about it in the lodge.
Then I stepped outside.

286
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,854
I went out

287
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:43,192
because I wanted to talk to you…

288
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,277
-Yes.
-…if you happened to come outside.

289
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,821
-Really?
-I wanted to talk to you.

290
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,657
-That's why.
-I see.

291
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,701
-Gosh.
-But then you just happened to be there.

292
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,787
So…

293
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,456
It felt very…

294
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,376
How should I put this?
It felt encouraging.

295
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,503
Really?

296
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,589
I thought I was the one
who initiated the conversation.

297
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,008
Really? I thought I did.

298
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,135
-Didn't I?
-We're both saying we started it.

299
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,679
-Is that what happened?
-Yes.

300
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,355
How did we…

301
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,112
Be honest. Did you wear blue on purpose?

302
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,823
Blue.

303
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,491
Blue…

304
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,284
Even if you didn't wear it on purpose,

305
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,870
-you made a good choice.
-Right.

306
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,212
-They click together.
-Seriously.

307
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,672
Yoong-jae was already…

308
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,590
-Interested.
-He had feelings for her.

309
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,468
But what's attractive about Yoong-jae

310
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,680
is I thought he was just going
to be calm and introverted.

311
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,434
But when he talks about his feelings,

312
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,602
he's honest and forthcoming.

313
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,522
It's nice because he's honest,

314
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,942
-yet he's still bashful.
-Right, he's shy.

315
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,654
But he doesn't try to hide anything.
He's just straightforward.

316
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,905
He's charming.

317
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,367
We should speak casually.

318
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,495
Casually?

319
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,705
-Shall we?
-Yes.

320
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,914
-Okay.
-Good.

321
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,043
-Should we speak casually?
-Yes, before we reveal how old we are.

322
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,711
-Right, I think that too.
-Right?

323
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,254
Good.

324
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,089
How old are you?

325
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,968
-Should we guess?
-Yes.

326
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,053
Their ages.

327
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,638
A four-year gap would be great.

328
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,266
Should we say it on the count of three?

329
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,643
-Okay.
-One, two, three.

330
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,936
-Twenty-seven.
-Twenty-eight.

331
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,439
-Am I right?
-Yes.

332
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,648
-You're wrong.
-What?

333
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,030
Wait, 29.

334
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,239
-No.
-Then 31?

335
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,240
I'm 32.

336
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,200
-Really?
-Yes.

337
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,284
Wait.

338
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,788
-He's four years older.
-What's the difference again?

339
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,414
Born in 1995 and 1991.

340
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,540
What?

341
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,587
-Why did you think I was so young?
-No, you look very young.

342
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,963
-Really?
-Yes.

343
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,591
What do you think I do for a living?

344
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,761
-Should we give each other hints?
-Okay.

345
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,638
It's in this room.

346
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,059
-Lighting?
-No.

347
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,774
What?

348
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,068
-Art?
-Yes.

349
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,403
Are you an artist?

350
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,288
I graduated
from the Pratt Institute in New York

351
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,707
as a Fine Arts major
with a focus in painting.

352
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,961
Currently, I'm working
as an artist in Korea.

353
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,506
That's so cool.

354
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,549
She's an artist?

355
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,511
I usually create abstract art.

356
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,764
I like to create simple, neat paintings

357
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:04,518
that inspire imagination.

358
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,316
CHOI SEO-EUN, AGE 28, ARTIST

359
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,527
-What a surprise.
-Exactly.

360
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,238
-It's a job that I didn't even think of.
-Artists are so cool.

361
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,615
That's so cool.

362
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,118
-Super cool.
-No, not really…

363
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,121
Okay, give me a hint…

364
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,831
-Okay.
-…then tell me.

365
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,084
I wear suits often.

366
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,461
-Suits?
-Yes, so…

367
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,173
Wait, do you work at a securities firm?

368
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,132
That's correct.

369
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,552
-I'm pretty good at guessing, right?
-Yes.

370
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,308
I currently work
at a securities firm in Yeouido.

371
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,811
-Yeouido?
-Yeouido.

372
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,565
Wait, a good-looking guy like him works
at a securities firm in Yeouido?

373
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,485
I graduated from Hanyang University
with a financial management degree,

374
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,113
and got employed through open hiring
at a securities firm.

375
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,576
I'm responsible for analyzing assets

376
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,621
and creating
specialized private equity funds

377
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,832
or specialized investments
that institutions can invest in.

378
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,293
JO YOONG-JAE, AGE 32
SECURITIES FIRM

379
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,377
It suits him.

380
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,046
It suits him so well.

381
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,050
This is so fun.
We're the only ones who know this.

382
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,968
-I know.
-A securities firm…

383
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,307
Our glasses are…

384
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,726
-We haven't eaten much.
-Sorry.

385
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,144
Help yourself.

386
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,271
I think I talked too much.

387
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,607
No, I had so much fun too.

388
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,318
I didn't eat much, but I feel full.

389
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,612
-Right?
-Yes.

390
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,615
It's not that I'm forcing myself
to not be hungry.

391
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,741
I actually feel fine.

392
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,452
-Yes. We should eat.
-It's nice if we eat, but if not…

393
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:49,873
This is fun.

394
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,832
Really fun.

395
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,209
-Yes.
-Yes.

396
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,380
I learned a lot about you.

397
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,507
I really learned a lot about you.

398
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,929
-Their date is going so smoothly.
-Right.

399
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:04,972
It's so smooth.

400
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,266
-They look so good together.
-They do.

401
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,811
I don't think Yoong-jae
even noticed he kept drinking.

402
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,897
They're definitely comfortable
drinking together.

403
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,775
PARADISE
SEUL-KI AND DONG-WOO

404
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,235
My gosh.

405
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,611
This looks really good.

406
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,739
-The food looks so good.
-Yes.

407
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,075
It's a feast.

408
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,286
Enjoy your meal.

409
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,788
Seul-ki, you want the salad first, right?

410
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,747
Thanks.

411
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,208
Let me cut it for you.

412
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,678
-This is really good.
-Yes, it really is.

413
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,473
I think this is
the best food I've had this year.

414
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,768
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. Cheers.

415
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,276
Do you have a big appetite?

416
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,613
I really like Korean food.
All types of Korean food.

417
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,701
What should we call each other?

418
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,745
-What about you?
-Mr. Shin?

419
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,871
-Mr. Shin.
-Dong-woo?

420
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,205
What about you, Dong-woo?

421
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,751
Meat is my favorite. Yes.

422
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,961
What's your typical meal?

423
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,922
My typical meal…

424
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,008
I'm just curious.

425
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,217
Well, I…

426
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,347
-Do you live with your parents?
-Yes.

427
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,890
I live with them.

428
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:35,645
But I'm a student,
so I live near campus for now.

429
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,024
Are we talking about this already?

430
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,567
How about this?

431
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,363
Why don't you guess what my major is?

432
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,699
Let's see…

433
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,451
Drama and film?

434
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,953
Drama and film?

435
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:52,913
-Right?
-No.

436
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,082
No? You're not a drama and film major?

437
00:22:55,165 --> 00:23:00,128
I'm a piano major
at Seoul National University.

438
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,092
I'm a university student.

439
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,720
I'm currently a senior
at Seoul National University.

440
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,641
And I'm a piano major.

441
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,978
-Piano?
-A piano major at SNU?

442
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,856
She must be a goddess at SNU.

443
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,400
-That word doesn't do her justice.
-She's almost like a…

444
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,913
I started playing the piano
when I was ten years old.

445
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,292
I have a love-hate relationship
with the piano.

446
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,964
It doesn't have just one melody,
so I can play it in various ways.

447
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,676
That appealed to me,
so I began to study the piano.

448
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,886
SHIN SEUL-KI
SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, PIANO MAJOR

449
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,846
That's amazing.

450
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,848
DEPARTMENT OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC

451
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,766
-That was really unexpected.
-Exactly.

452
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,810
-This was also unexpected.
-Seul-ki is also…

453
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,230
Are you on a semester break?

454
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,567
No, it's actually exam period.

455
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,610
-My gosh.
-I know.

456
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,571
-You're doomed.
-Yes, I am.

457
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,700
But, to be honest,
this is better than taking exams.

458
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,413
Thanks. It's because you're here
with me, right?

459
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,998
Of course.

460
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,708
-That's…
-Yes.

461
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,793
That was awkward. Anyway…

462
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,386
I think I could figure out your age.

463
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:32,888
I'm 25.

464
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,181
-You're 25?
-Yes.

465
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,099
Guess how old I am.

466
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,893
31?

467
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,436
-31?
-Yes.

468
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,354
I'm 32.

469
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,439
I see.

470
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,734
So what do you do for a living?

471
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,486
-Is that what you want to know?
-Yes, I've been so curious.

472
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,323
Remember how Han-bin said
you look like you serve in the army?

473
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,283
-Yes.
-It does suit you.

474
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,203
-Incorrect.
-Incorrect?

475
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,538
Then what is it? What do you do?

476
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,540
I am…

477
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,710
a doctor.

478
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,296
What?

479
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,048
Gosh.

480
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,593
Hang on, this…

481
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,678
A doctor.

482
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,389
What do you specialize in?

483
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,559
I specialize in plastic surgery.

484
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,103
That's amazing.

485
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,237
I'm a doctor.

486
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,489
I graduated from Yonsei University
College of Medicine

487
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,157
specializing in plastic surgery.

488
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,328
Yonsei University?

489
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,329
I didn't expect that.

490
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,747
-Plastic surgery?
-Med school?

491
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,873
I have chills.

492
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,211
I think I was influenced
by my father who's also a doctor.

493
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,256
I've seen my father
impact others positively

494
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,967
through the use of medical knowledge
and technology.

495
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,219
That's what prompted me
to go to med school.

496
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,430
SHIN DONG-WOO, AGE 32
PLASTIC SURGERY SPECIALIST

497
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,515
He's so cool.

498
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,185
Do doctors like him even exist?

499
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,646
What? He's too good to be true.

500
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,439
Right. How is he even real?

501
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,149
Single's Inferno is amazing.

502
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,818
I really didn't expect that.

503
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,829
-I had a lot of questions for you.
-Really?

504
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,746
Yes.

505
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,082
Why did you choose me?

506
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,670
You first.

507
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,673
Me first?

508
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:38,221
When I first entered and sat down,
you were next to me.

509
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,973
-Right.
-Anyway,

510
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,726
we had the same last name,
so we talked briefly.

511
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,103
My name is Shin Dong-woo.

512
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,813
My name is Shin Seul-ki.

513
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,232
Pyeongsan Shin clan, 35th generation.

514
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,275
-I see.
-What about you?

515
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,818
I'm not really sure.

516
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,195
We should know if we're in the same clan.

517
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,366
I didn't really see you after that.

518
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,035
Then you came outside with a parasol.

519
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,246
-Right.
-You had a red dress on.

520
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,916
You were like a shrimp
caught in a whale fight.

521
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,669
You would've looked more
like a shrimp in this red dress.

522
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,629
-You're so mean.
-You put up a good fight.

523
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,215
It seemed like you were

524
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,427
pure and innocent.

525
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,678
Really?

526
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,597
So…

527
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,932
-You're right about that.
-Am I?

528
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,144
And because you're cute.

529
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,230
-Thanks.
-Do you know that you're cute?

530
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,275
-I kind of do.
-Kind of?

531
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,155
What?

532
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,035
Jeez.

533
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,873
Remember that time
we went to go get water?

534
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,916
Yes.

535
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,628
I thought you were calm,
but you were funnier than I had expected.

536
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,755
This isn't that heavy.

537
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,092
-Then we'll return like this.
-Like this.

538
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,095
No, please. No, I can't.

539
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:06,101
So I wanted to know more about you.

540
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:23,159
Did you think there was a chance
you might not have gotten chosen today?

541
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,414
I wasn't sure what to expect.

542
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,333
So do you mean…

543
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:34,796
that you weren't sure of how you felt?
Or what kind of person I was?

544
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,715
I wasn't sure of both.

545
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:44,013
To be honest,
we haven't been here for that long.

546
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,684
So I'm not sure about how I feel yet.

547
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,229
But in the beginning,
I was very curious about you.

548
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:57,235
What's attractive to you
when it comes to looks?

549
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:03,324
To be honest, looks aren't
that important to me.

550
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:07,328
But still, people need time to get
to know each other on a deeper level.

551
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,789
That's true, which is why I…

552
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,042
need time.

553
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,502
How much time do you need?

554
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,840
I don't know.

555
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,304
Are you expressive when you're on a date?

556
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,473
-Me?
-Yes.

557
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,807
Do you…

558
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,394
tell someone you like them first?

559
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,062
I tend to be like that.

560
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,439
-Do you tell them?
-Yes.

561
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,567
You tell him first?

562
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,904
-Yes. I think I'm like that.
-I see.

563
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,615
I can't tell right now.

564
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,495
Maybe I should try harder.

565
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,248
Do you want to do something else?

566
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,963
Wait. Are you tired,
or can you swim right now?

567
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,174
You can swim if you want to.

568
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,843
I can splash around a bit.

569
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,180
-Then let's not swim.
-Okay.

570
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,558
Let's go outside for a bit
and get some air.

571
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,185
Yes, after we get changed.

572
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,395
-Let's get changed and meet here.
-Okay.

573
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,691
-It's really cool outside.
-Yes.

574
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,945
The weather is so nice.

575
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,947
-Yes, it's nice.
-It's so cool.

576
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,616
What do you think will happen?

577
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,162
It's not like we'll always end up coming

578
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,164
-to Paradise together.
-We might not.

579
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,416
Do you think your feelings will change?

580
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,044
I don't know.

581
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,338
Today…

582
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,131
It's a secret. I can't tell you.

583
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,384
I'm sorry, but are you
at some kind of hearing?

584
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,302
You keep saying you don't know.

585
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,848
I don't know. I just don't know.

586
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,935
I think he'll feel disappointed
if she keeps saying that.

587
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,436
She does seem a bit passive.

588
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,437
-Yes.
-Right.

589
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,481
Because earlier she said

590
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,651
she's expressive
when she's with someone she likes.

591
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,070
-Yet she keeps saying she doesn't know.
-Right.

592
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,531
But then, Seul-ki did say earlier

593
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,576
that she's the type who needs time.

594
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,328
Maybe she's just taking some time
to get to know him.

595
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,708
I don't know. I just don't know.

596
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,502
You're acting so cute all of a sudden.

597
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,089
Your cuteness level was at 50,
but it's at 100 now.

598
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,676
Really? I'm not really the cute type.

599
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,053
-But…
-Yes?

600
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,393
-I don't know. I really like you.
-I see.

601
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,353
And I want to treat you well.

602
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,356
Thanks.

603
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,451
I hope I can come here with you again.

604
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,334
You won't say, "I don't know," right?

605
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,093
How old was the oldest guy you've dated?

606
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,556
I've only been…

607
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,352
in a relationship once.

608
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,270
-I see.
-Right.

609
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,859
Is it hard for you to open up to people?

610
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:30,073
No. It's just that I've been studying
for a long time,

611
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,743
so I haven't really had the chance
to meet people.

612
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,995
Are you sure you didn't push them away?

613
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,457
-No.
-They say

614
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,502
love blossoms even in the middle of a war.

615
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,547
-I keep work and love separate.
-I see.

616
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,717
Love is love, and work is work.

617
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,886
-Right.
-They're just totally separate for me.

618
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,682
-Okay.
-No matter how busy I am,

619
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:59,519
I never let work
get in the way of dating someone.

620
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,487
-Tonight is amazing.
-Yes.

621
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,909
-To be honest, I don't want to go back.
-Same here. Can't we just stay here?

622
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,619
Why don't you want to go back?

623
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,373
Because they make us do things?

624
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,458
I'd rather you didn't ask me that.

625
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,626
Okay, I'm sorry.

626
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,920
-It's just between you and me.
-Right.

627
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,255
No, but it's a bit…

628
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,631
-Okay.
-…too much.

629
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,924
Okay.

630
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,759
Right.

631
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,594
But that was harsh.

632
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,805
"I'd rather you didn't ask me that."

633
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,392
So Seul-ki is the type that needs time.

634
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,060
Even if she's interested,

635
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,813
if Dong-woo keeps asking her questions

636
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,857
to get validation and comes on too strong,

637
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,859
I think she could feel pressured.

638
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,944
So she's gradually pushing him away.

639
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,612
They're going at different speeds.

640
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,698
Right, that's exactly it.

641
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,909
And they don't really click that well.

642
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,495
When he says, "You want to drink?"
and she says, "I can't."

643
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,621
"Want to swim?" "No."

644
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,459
Compared to the beginning,
the air is a bit…

645
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,585
-Different.
-Yes.

646
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,838
Right. If their feelings
for each other started at 50-50,

647
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:12,759
it feels like Seul-ki is either
still on the same level or lower.

648
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,595
-I agree.
-But Dong-woo is suddenly way up high.

649
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,846
Really up there.

650
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,100
I feel like Dong-woo's feeling tipsy
and becoming more enthusiastic.

651
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,101
Possibly.

652
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,436
-Yes, maybe.
-Right.

653
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,605
I don't think he's usually
that aggressive.

654
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,900
Right. He could be acting like that
since he's had a drink.

655
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,570
PARADISE
SEO-EUN AND YOONG-JAE

656
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,282
-Should I sleep here?
-No.

657
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,950
That would make me feel bad.

658
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,337
This is nice.

659
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,379
So nice.

660
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,466
Wait, come here for a second.

661
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,385
Try lying down here. Try it.

662
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,595
It feels different.

663
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,763
Come try it.

664
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,016
It's made of a different type of feather.

665
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,310
It's very different.

666
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,484
-Isn't it so nice?
-Gosh.

667
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,195
This is paradise.

668
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,281
-Goodnight.
-Are you sleeping there?

669
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,283
No. Sleep here.

670
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,161
This place is so nice.

671
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,329
Yes.

672
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,249
Thanks, Seo-eun.

673
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,501
-I should thank you.
-What?

674
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,671
-I should thank you.
-No, I should. It's all thanks to you.

675
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,630
Thanks to you.

676
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:39,929
Really.

677
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,475
We'll be able to come back again, right?

678
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,644
I hope so.

679
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,565
How was today?

680
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,650
-Today?
-Yes.

681
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,944
I'll never forget it.

682
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,614
Seriously.

683
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,911
I think the timing was
perfect for everything.

684
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,996
Right.

685
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,456
And that's what made today awesome.

686
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,254
I really liked talking to you today.

687
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:19,552
-Me too.
-I really was so curious.

688
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,345
Was it like, "Who is that guy?"

689
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,016
"What's up with him?
What does he do for a living?"

690
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,142
Really?

691
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,646
Everything was perfect.

692
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,065
But there wasn't very much food

693
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,485
I was surprised about that,
but I didn't think about it till after.

694
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,405
-We still have breakfast tomorrow.
-Right.

695
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,699
You choose what we'll order.

696
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,995
It's so nice and comfy.

697
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,163
Let's go to sleep.

698
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,833
You look really happy.

699
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,585
I love it.

700
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,129
This is nice too.

701
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,131
It's so nice.

702
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,216
It's great.

703
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,967
Let's sleep.

704
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,846
Seriously, today was really nice.

705
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,266
Not just because we're here.

706
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,226
Yes?

707
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:12,188
But also because we talked a lot.

708
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,941
That was great.

709
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,611
-It was fun because we came here together.
-Yes.

710
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,030
Get some sleep.

711
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,657
Goodnight.

712
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,869
It's funny we're talking right next
to each other.

713
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,830
Right?

714
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,499
Can we stay up just a bit more?

715
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,459
-What?
-Can we talk for maybe ten minutes?

716
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,835
Yes. That's fine.

717
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,878
You don't mind?

718
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,339
-Wait, what?
-What?

719
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,217
He doesn't want to go to sleep yet.

720
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,468
He's being honest.

721
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,595
It reminds me of how couples fall asleep

722
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,474
-together while talking on the phone.
-Right. Exactly.

723
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,309
He's like that
because he's really excited.

724
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,355
INFERNO

725
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,608
So did anyone…

726
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,820
kind of…

727
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,448
change their minds?

728
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,576
I mean, in terms of who they like.

729
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,370
To be honest,

730
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,498
I've been talking about the same person
since the beginning.

731
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,749
-Really?
-Yes.

732
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,792
I see.

733
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,918
But…

734
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,504
How should I put this?

735
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,260
If I like someone even just a little,

736
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,721
I make it pretty obvious.

737
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,515
But it's only been a few days now.

738
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,934
-So I'm worried that he might…
-Right.

739
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,686
…feel uncomfortable

740
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:39,275
or something like that.

741
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,112
But that wasn't what I'd intended.

742
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,155
Right.

743
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,323
But today,

744
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,199
I think Seo-eun…

745
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,203
How should I put this? Seo-eun left…

746
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,497
-Left with him, right?
-Yes.

747
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,041
I knew he would choose her.

748
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,167
-Really?
-Yes.

749
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,253
Yes, because I saw them go inside to talk.

750
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,051
-But when we were having brunch earlier…
-Yes?

751
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,678
-…we talked a lot so…
-Right.

752
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:14,185
…I thought maybe he would want

753
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,520
to talk more with other people.

754
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,480
I see.

755
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,690
Or I thought maybe

756
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,901
he wasn't really attracted to me.

757
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,989
So-e is so good at picking up on things.

758
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:31,202
-Her eyes were only on Yoong-jae.
-Right.

759
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,288
What about you, Nadine?

760
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,958
Right now, I'm like…

761
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,464
-I feel like I'm starting over.
-I see.

762
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,174
Do you get what I mean?

763
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,551
I briefly talked to him too.

764
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,261
It's like…

765
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:55,935
I don't usually approach a guy like that.

766
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:59,814
-Right.
-It was the first time I had done that.

767
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,943
-Talking to him?
-Approaching someone I have feelings for…

768
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,112
-Really?
-…and talking to him.

769
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,322
-That's crazy.
-It really was.

770
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:12,827
So I'm very proud of myself right now.

771
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,080
-You experienced something new.
-Yes, I really did.

772
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,957
So did something change?

773
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,001
Yes, but now it's like…

774
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,547
The thought of trying again is…

775
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,590
-Frustrating?
-Yes.

776
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:31,095
But I don't want you to think

777
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,932
that he made that decision
because he wasn't interested in you.

778
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,643
I think he talked to you

779
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,063
because he was somewhat interested in you.

780
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,997
PARADISE
SEUL-KI AND DONG-WOO

781
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,337
-Did you sleep well, Seul-ki?
-Yes?

782
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,344
Do you always

783
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,222
speak like that?

784
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,641
-Like what?
-Like…

785
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,898
-Anyway, enjoy your meal.
-You too.

786
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:31,238
I cook fish often,

787
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,074
-and they served us grilled fish.
-Right.

788
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,828
We have to eat our fill before we leave.

789
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:38,787
Right.

790
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,168
-We have to go back soon.
-Yes.

791
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,545
How was your experience here in Paradise?

792
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,843
It was really nice because…

793
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,556
I mean, we're
in a completely different environment.

794
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,476
This place is like a sports field.

795
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,897
That's how I feel.

796
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,901
-I see what you're saying.
-Yes?

797
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:14,406
But I wanted to know how you felt
about other things too.

798
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,699
I see.

799
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,789
But this is our first time here,

800
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,708
and it's only been two days.

801
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:30,005
So when you ask me questions like that,

802
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,967
I kind of find it

803
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,345
difficult to give you an answer.

804
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,269
I can't watch this.

805
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,982
-That's worse than saying…
-Yes.

806
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:52,319
-"It wasn't fun."
-But I think it's nice that she's honest.

807
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,990
It seems like Dong-woo's
never heard anything like that before.

808
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,032
Right.

809
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,627
I wonder what we'll have to do today.

810
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,298
I have a feeling the men will play a game.

811
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,634
If I win the game,

812
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,763
do you want me to choose you again?

813
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,976
I just want you

814
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:29,356
to choose someone you like

815
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,151
based on your feelings,
regardless of how I feel.

816
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,325
I want to ask you something.

817
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,076
Okay.

818
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,705
Do you tend to like someone
who likes you more,

819
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,874
or is it the other way around?

820
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,752
It definitely has to be someone
whom I like.

821
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,545
Even if they don't really like you?

822
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,796
Yes.

823
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,715
Same.

824
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:56,884
Someone whom I really like.

825
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,845
I see.

826
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,853
But you know,

827
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,731
I can't win someone's heart with money.

828
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,067
-That's true.
-Yes.

829
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:19,406
So even if the person doesn't like me,

830
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,160
I think I'll respect that.

831
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:32,920
I can make an effort to win their heart,
but I can't force them to like me.

832
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:41,178
It's really kind of sad.

833
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,597
What is?

834
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,643
I wanted to spend more time with you,

835
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,978
but this was too short.

836
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,109
When we go back,

837
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,236
we never know when just the two of us

838
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,196
will get to talk again.

839
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,449
And I have a feeling that…

840
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,828
there will be some sort of challenge.

841
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,707
I hope we can see each other again

842
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,002
even if that happens.

843
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,599
I don't think Seul-ki
likes what's going on.

844
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,893
-I don't feel anything from her.
-There's a wall.

845
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,271
-I agree.
-I definitely feel it.

846
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,523
Would you hate it
if someone kept asking you questions?

847
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:38,068
I mean, Seul-ki kept telling him.

848
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,654
If she didn't say anything about it,
and he kept on going,

849
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,698
then you could think
that he wasn't aware of it.

850
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,868
But she had already told him
that she needs time.

851
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:50,080
She expressed how she felt,
but Dong-woo kept pressuring her.

852
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,749
I would've responded the same way.
I would've hated it.

853
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,587
But I think Seul-ki wasn't being
straightforward either.

854
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,423
I think Dong-woo just wanted
to hear a definite answer.

855
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,841
Also, he's a doctor.

856
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,179
When you deal with patients,
you have to know

857
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,930
how your patients are feeling.

858
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,057
"How do you feel
once your stitches are removed?"

859
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,934
-"Has the swelling gone down?"
-He must know.

860
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:15,230
-He has to ask questions.
-Right, maybe it's because he's a doctor.

861
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,858
-Right.
-It just went downhill.

862
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,069
-He put a damper on their conversation.
-It all started when he said,

863
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,697
-"Did you sleep well, Seul-ki?"
-I agree.

864
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,033
-That's when she put up a wall.
-Right.

865
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,784
"You sleep well, Seul-ki?" was cheesy.

866
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:28,785
-Yes.
-Right.

867
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,913
She should speak her mind too.

868
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,499
-Right.
-She didn't like it when he said that.

869
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,502
-She hated it.
-She could've let it go, but she hated it.

870
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:40,297
That's why she said, "It's too much."
And, "I don't like it."

871
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,883
-I think Dong-woo is doing a good job.
-Right.

872
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,262
-They're not right for each other.
-They're different.

873
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,681
-They aren't right for each other.
-It isn't his fault.

874
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,266
Dong-woo just likes Seul-ki.

875
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,518
-Right
-Yes.

876
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,480
INFERNO
10:00 A.M.

877
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,149
I wonder how things will play out.

878
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:03,028
I thought I'd be able
to predict what would happen,

879
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,404
but I'm not sure anymore.

880
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,951
The women we chose

881
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:12,246
were more interested in other men.

882
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,750
-We didn't have a lot of time to talk.
-That's true.

883
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:21,046
I think it's obvious that the women

884
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,924
will be more interested
in the people they've talked to.

885
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,594
They would be interested in men
who express their feelings.

886
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,848
I don't think you should worry about that.

887
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,601
I'm trying not to care about it.

888
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,812
If I care about every single thing,

889
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,399
I think I'd feel so small
that I wouldn't be able to express myself.

890
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,317
-That makes things worse.
-Yes.

891
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:44,695
So just be confident.

892
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,035
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

893
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,413
That fly is going all over the place.

894
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,207
Even that fly is working hard,
so we should too.

895
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,750
Gosh, I'm attracting flies.

896
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,586
Today is just…

897
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:05,132
Not a good sign.
Yesterday, a button on my pants fell off.

898
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,633
Now I'm attracting flies.

899
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,594
I can't help but give it meaning

900
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,721
-since it happened to us.
-But that fly likes us.

901
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,307
-Someone else might like us.
-That's another way to see it.

902
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,017
Since the fly likes us…

903
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,479
-This is weird.
-…maybe other people will like us too.

904
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,027
Did you have fun, Seul-ki?

905
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,070
Yes, it was a new experience.

906
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,115
-Watch your step.
-Okay.

907
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,701
-I walked this path alone the first time.
-Right.

908
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,786
It's fun to walk together.

909
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,455
Let's go again next time.

910
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,831
Read this.

911
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,542
"Don't make rules."

912
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,504
Are you okay? Isn't it heavy?

913
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,881
I'm okay.

914
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,217
I think they're back.

915
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,013
I guess they're here.

916
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,016
-When did you arrive?
-You're back!

917
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,185
-Hello.
-You guys came back so fast.

918
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,269
I know, right?

919
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,857
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

920
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,277
Good morning.

921
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,614
Look at them. They look so energetic.

922
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,575
I could even run right now.

923
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,829
Was I overreacting?

924
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,331
Do you want to go first, Seul-ki?

925
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,167
-I'll carry this over there for you.
-My luggage…

926
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,543
Welcome back!

927
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,676
-Ladies, they're back.
-Did you all have fun?

928
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,302
We're back.

929
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,679
We did.

930
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,972
Did you eat a lot of delicious food?

931
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,474
We did.

932
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,060
-Hello.
-Hello.

933
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,103
They're here?

934
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,521
-Are they back?
-Hello.

935
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,939
You're back.

936
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,483
Hello.

937
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,526
Her face is glowing.

938
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,278
-You look different.
-How was it?

939
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,780
-Hello.
-Hi.

940
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,199
-You look so pretty!
-Gosh.

941
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,242
So pretty.

942
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,702
-Seo-eun.
-Thanks.

943
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,704
-I'll leave your bags here.
-Thanks, Yoong-jae.

944
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,830
See you later.

945
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,415
-See you later.
-Okay.

946
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,041
-See you later.
-Thank you.

947
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,376
You're here.

948
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,378
-How are you?
-I missed you.

949
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,672
You didn't miss us at all.

950
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,090
He didn't miss us at all.

951
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,260
First, I want to know what you ate.

952
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:17,597
First, when you go in, you can't help
but say "Wow!" like 20 times.

953
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,807
Really?

954
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,559
You just can't help but say it

955
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,560
for a few minutes.

956
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,353
We've never been
anywhere like that before.

957
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,897
It's surprising to discover
such a place in Korea.

958
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:26,982
Really?

959
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,066
Is it that great?

960
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,026
-It is.
-The ceilings are so high.

961
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,027
And it's huge.

962
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,529
Did you eat a lot of good food?

963
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,989
What did you eat?

964
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:34,948
Steak and…

965
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,993
We really ate a lot. Grilled salmon…

966
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,454
-That sounds delicious.
-It was.

967
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:44,916
I guess it's called Paradise for a reason.

968
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,463
-So, do you now know his job and age?
-Yes.

969
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,547
-Right.
-I'm so curious.

970
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,007
-Were you surprised?
-How was it?

971
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,467
Was it what you expected?

972
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:58,054
I think the job suits him.

973
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,182
I personally think so.

974
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:04,895
So I was like, "I see."

975
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,273
-That's what I said.
-You keep smiling.

976
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,609
-That's so true.
-As you're talking, you keep…

977
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,653
Yes. I think I enjoyed talking
to him there.

978
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,698
We talked a lot.

979
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,700
Like for a few hours?

980
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,702
-More like six hours.
-Six hours?

981
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,870
Six hours?

982
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,830
-Really?
-Yes.

983
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,248
Did you guys click?

984
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,708
Well, it was fun, yes…

985
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,211
Dong-woo…

986
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,505
Why do you look so troubled?

987
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,049
-What happened?
-I'm just tired.

988
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,425
-I see.
-I see.

989
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,637
I talked a lot with Dong-woo as well.

990
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,472
But…

991
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,558
Since I got to know one person,

992
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:47,354
I want to get to know other people too.

993
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,313
-I see.
-I see.

994
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:52,067
I want to get to know other people.

995
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,568
-Right.
-Okay.

996
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,822
I feel like the air's going
to feel different today.

997
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,156
I think so too.

998
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,827
Rather than going to Paradise,

999
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,830
I want to try to focus
on someone I have feelings for,

1000
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:09,042
so that I won't regret it later.

1001
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,919
It was day two…

1002
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,170
No, day three, right?

1003
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,839
-Right, day three.
-But then

1004
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,008
why does it feel like it's been a month?

1005
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,554
-It's because you came back from Paradise.
-It really feels like it.

1006
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,557
This is hard.

1007
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,516
It's hard?

1008
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,768
I have a lot on my mind.

1009
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,146
We keep holding our feelings in,

1010
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,191
so it's hard to talk openly about things.

1011
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:38,071
So I get frustrated,
and the other person gets frustrated too.

1012
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:41,283
I keep beating around the bush
to avoid the point.

1013
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,830
Beat around the bush?

1014
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,082
-That's what it feels like.
-That's funny.

1015
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,755
Did you enjoy your date in Paradise?

1016
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:05,181
Today, matches will be made again.

1017
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,976
-What? Again?
-We're not going again, right?

1018
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,895
But the couples

1019
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:15,025
who went to Paradise
cannot choose each other today.

1020
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,152
YESTERDAY'S COUPLES
CANNOT CHOOSE EACH OTHER

1021
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,612
Really?

1022
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,198
So we can choose.

1023
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,951
I look forward
to the new Paradise couples.

1024
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,498
But first, you have to play a game
to go on a date and have a special meal.

1025
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,752
Participants, please come to the beach.

1026
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,462
A special meal.

1027
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,089
Right, the men have to play a game.

1028
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,466
It's our turn now.

1029
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,682
A box?

1030
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,978
I wonder what's inside it?

1031
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,773
There's a box. What is it for?

1032
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,943
-What's that box doing there?
-A box?

1033
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,279
They'll probably
have to do something active.

1034
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,697
-Yes.
-They might go in the water…

1035
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,698
Gosh.

1036
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,993
-Let's do this.
-You got this.

1037
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,137
Today, the men will play a game.

1038
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,432
The winner will get a chance

1039
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,518
to choose two women

1040
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,020
to have a special meal with.

1041
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:40,777
Today's special meal
is pork cutlet and cold buckwheat noodles.

1042
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,654
-Gosh!
-Cold buckwheat noodles.

1043
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,155
That's my favorite food.

1044
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,700
-That's crazy. I need it.
-I love cold buckwheat noodles.

1045
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,659
It'll be so good.

1046
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,952
Pork cutlet.

1047
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,496
Cold buckwheat noodles
sound so good right now.

1048
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,580
It'll be so refreshing.

1049
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,873
Cold buckwheat noodles.

1050
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,419
I will now reveal today's game.

1051
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:01,047
Please open the black box
that is in front of you.

1052
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,218
-I'm going to open it.
-Hang on.

1053
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,095
-Let's do it together.
-Together?

1054
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,054
Please.

1055
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,932
-Three, two, one.
-Three, two, one.

1056
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,184
-What is it?
-What is that?

1057
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,352
What is that?

1058
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,563
What is that?

1059
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,064
-What is that?
-What is that?

1060
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,567
Climbing gear?

1061
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,153
-I see.
-It's for tug-of-war.

1062
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,946
-It's for tug-of-war.
-Tug-of-war?

1063
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,575
Today's game is tug-of-war.

1064
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,535
This is…

1065
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,579
This is crazy.

1066
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,289
It's one-on-one.

1067
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:39,961
Put on the connected shoulder straps
in front of you.

1068
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,798
Once you hear the whistle,
run as fast as you can toward your flags.

1069
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,177
The first person
to pull out his flag wins.

1070
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,720
THE PERSON
WHO PULLS OUT THEIR POLE FIRST WINS

1071
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,514
This is a tournament game.

1072
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,516
This is…

1073
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,517
This is so cruel.

1074
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,935
-So cruel.
-It's about strength.

1075
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,983
It's all about strength.

1076
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,611
This is a battle of pride.

1077
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,114
But if they lose,

1078
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,617
-don't they get dragged by the winner?
-Yes.

1079
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,077
My gosh.

1080
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,870
-This will hurt their pride.
-This is sad.

1081
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,371
My gosh.

1082
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,166
We will now start the first match.

1083
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:22,921
Dong-woo and Yoong-jae,
please put on your shoulder straps.

1084
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,391
It's a match between musclemen.

1085
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,810
I wonder who'll win.

1086
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,311
This is intense.

1087
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,147
Gosh, look.

1088
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,441
Look at his face.
He seems like a different person.

1089
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,778
-Yoong-jae's legs are so toned.
-Yes.

1090
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:50,073
They're both very muscular.

1091
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,699
I'm not sure who'll win.

1092
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,662
It's a match between
a stockbroker and a doctor.

1093
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,957
Though I've never seen
such ripped stockbrokers or doctors.

1094
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,126
-Me neither.
-They look unreal.

1095
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:07,048
The match will now begin.

1096
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,301
I wonder who'll win.

1097
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,809
Be careful.

1098
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,818
Ready.

1099
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,323
-My gosh!
-Wait.

1100
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,161
Wait. Wait a minute.

1101
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,707
-They're evenly matched.
-They are.

1102
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,918
Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait.

1103
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,298
Hold on. Wait.

1104
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,675
This is crazy.

1105
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,760
Hold on.

1106
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,429
They're not moving forward.

1107
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,431
-What's going on?
-This is insane.

1108
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,476
This is amazing.

1109
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,686
Wait, hang on.

1110
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,230
They're both so strong.

1111
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,317
-This is intense.
-Their faces are red.

1112
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,360
This is strength versus strength.

1113
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:12,363
-Are they okay?
-Their faces are red.

1114
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,032
They're neck and neck.

1115
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,452
Wait.

1116
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,912
They're not budging.

1117
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,332
They haven't moved from the center.

1118
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,958
They haven't moved at all.

1119
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,086
Wait, this is just…

1120
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,632
-Their eyes are red.
-Goodness.

1121
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,509
I've never seen Yoong-jae look so fierce.

1122
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,594
He's up.

1123
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,430
-He's up. He just has to stay up.
-I know, right?

1124
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,433
My goodness.

1125
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,270
All it takes is one moment
for someone to lose.

1126
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,230
You're right.

1127
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,982
-That's crazy.
-Look at them.

1128
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,651
He's getting up.

1129
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,861
Jeez, hold on.

1130
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:54,906
They're getting up.

1131
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,455
They're getting up.

1132
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,044
You got this.

1133
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,671
Just take one more step.

1134
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,297
Just take one more step.

1135
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,341
My goodness.

1136
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,970
Will he take a step?

1137
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:20,932
He's moving forward.

1138
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:28,940
My goodness.

1139
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,327
-He fell.
-Gosh.

1140
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,287
Good job.

1141
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,873
-Are you okay?
-You were really amazing, though.

1142
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:46,958
You were amazing.

1143
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,253
The winner of this match is Dong-woo.

1144
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,048
Dong-woo.

1145
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,511
Are they doing this again?

1146
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:05,685
Does it hurt your pride
to lose in front of someone

1147
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,228
that you're interested in?

1148
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,563
Yes. It makes you sad.

1149
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,814
-Really?
-Yes.

1150
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,859
It was hard to breathe while watching.

1151
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,487
-Exactly.
-I got really tense.

1152
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,575
The next match will now begin.

1153
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,120
Jong-woo and Han-bin, please step forward.

1154
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,790
-Should we help each other out?
-Yes.

1155
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,459
-You got this.
-You got this.

1156
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,878
This is making me nervous.

1157
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,882
You got this.

1158
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,508
You can do it!

1159
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,725
The two men who stayed behind
in Inferno need to win.

1160
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,310
Right.

1161
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,811
Ready.

1162
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,956
Han-bin is…

1163
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,047
-You need to get up.
-You got this.

1164
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,799
-You got this!
-You got this!

1165
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,762
-Will he turn the game around?
-Look at his feet.

1166
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:23,721
You got this!

1167
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,264
Come on!

1168
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,017
Jong-woo's jaw is clenched.

1169
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,019
Hey, wait a minute!

1170
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,737
-My gosh.
-You can do this.

1171
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,447
My gosh.

1172
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,782
You can do this.

1173
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,992
-Get up.
-Let's go!

1174
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,327
Let's go.

1175
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,205
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1176
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,124
You can do this!

1177
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,253
My gosh. He's holding his ground.

1178
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,339
Good. You can do this.

1179
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,049
Don't bend your knees.

1180
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,301
-That's so amazing!
-It is!

1181
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:07,056
-You're almost there, Jong-woo.
-Use your left foot.

1182
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,518
-Your left foot!
-You can do this. Hang in there.

1183
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,157
Both were so amazing.

1184
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,034
Both were amazing.

1185
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,370
-You both did so well.
-That was awesome.

1186
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,707
Will it be Nadine today?

1187
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,292
-Good game.
-Good game.

1188
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:37,587
The winner of this match is Jong-woo.

1189
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,546
Are you okay?

1190
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,174
-Good job.
-You must be exhausted.

1191
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,467
You really did great.

1192
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,427
They were so cool.

1193
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,636
They really were.

1194
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,181
Han-bin is amazing.
Their physiques are different.

1195
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,683
Yes. Jong-woo is taller, too.

1196
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,435
They did their best.

1197
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:57,857
The two winners, Jong-woo and Dong-woo,

1198
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,984
will now compete in the final match.

1199
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,361
The final match is…

1200
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,114
a three-way match.

1201
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,700
A three-way match.

1202
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,743
-Wait, what?
-What?

1203
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,328
-What?
-What was that?

1204
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,412
-What?
-What?

1205
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,581
What's going on?

1206
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:14,540
A three-way match?

1207
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,083
What's a three-way match?

1208
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,210
Is it different?

1209
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,461
-Wait.
-What?

1210
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,755
Is there a new person?

1211
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,173
-What?
-Someone's coming?

1212
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,341
Wait.

1213
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,801
-My gosh.
-What?

1214
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,470
-Is someone coming?
-Is it another male participant?

1215
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:28,429
Another person?

1216
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,264
-Really?
-No way.

1217
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,891
-Wait.
-What?

1218
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,777
-He's here.
-He's here.

1219
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,905
-This is insane.
-I was right.

1220
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,990
-I have goosebumps.
-Me too.

1221
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,924
He has long hair.

1222
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,012
This is amazing.

1223
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,473
-He's good-looking.
-He is.

1224
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,432
Seriously?

1225
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,147
-He's not your average guy.
-He really isn't.

1226
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,275
-He's confident.
-He is.

1227
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,117
-I think he's tall.
-He looks pretty tall.

1228
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,618
-He's tall.
-Yes.

1229
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,749
-He seems pretty confident.
-He does.

1230
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,418
Yes, I agree.

1231
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,387
He's making a bold entrance.

1232
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,723
-Just like a star.
-Exactly.

1233
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,267
-He's good-looking.
-He is.

1234
01:04:58,769 --> 01:04:59,645
Hello.

1235
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:01,397
He's so cool.

1236
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,982
-Hello.
-Hello.

1237
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:04,942
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

1238
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:05,902
Hello.

1239
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,278
-Hi.
-Hello.

1240
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,279
-Hello.
-Hello.

1241
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:10,281
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

1242
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,240
Hello.

1243
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,408
-Hi.
-Hello.

1244
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,493
-Hi.
-Hello.

1245
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:33,387
Hello, my name is Kim Jin-young.

1246
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:37,099
I'm very shy at first,
but once I warm up to people,

1247
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:40,144
I think I'm fun to be around.

1248
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,897
I don't have a lot of hobbies.

1249
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,901
But I like motorcycles,
so I enjoy going out for a ride.

1250
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:51,113
When I'm stressed, I ride my motorcycle.

1251
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,824
It feels good to feel the wind
in my own little world.

1252
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:56,827
It relieves stress too.

1253
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,373
I work out five times a week at the gym.

1254
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,124
I also run.

1255
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,585
I regularly do intense workouts,

1256
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,754
so I'm confident
that I won't fall behind others

1257
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,965
when it comes to athletic performance.

1258
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,926
When I see a woman, it takes
only three seconds to feel a spark.

1259
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,428
So I hope to feel that spark
with someone special

1260
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:17,765
while on Single's Inferno.

1261
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,935
Three seconds? I'm curious.

1262
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,561
He's very charming.

1263
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,146
-He seems charismatic.
-Yes.

1264
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,649
We'll see if he'll turn the tables.

1265
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:31,028
The final match will now begin.

1266
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:35,116
The final match is a three-way match.

1267
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:38,452
So the three of them will…

1268
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,663
The men…

1269
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:45,042
-The men seem competitive all of a sudden.
-It's a competition.

1270
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,757
I'm nervous.

1271
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,760
-I'm already nervous.
-Shall we put these on for each other?

1272
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,013
I really am back in Inferno.

1273
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,598
It hit me just now.

1274
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:02,018
He gives off…

1275
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,895
-savage vibes.
-Yes.

1276
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,356
His back is ripped.

1277
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,817
-Is he coming out again?
-Gosh. He's so fit.

1278
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:12,737
He's got muscles.

1279
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,365
-I think he'll surprise us.
-Something tells me he's going to win.

1280
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,616
Really?

1281
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,786
It feels like it.
I think the new guy will win.

1282
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,747
-He's really charismatic.
-Yes.

1283
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,957
He looks so charismatic, but if he loses…

1284
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,876
I know. That's what I'm afraid of.

1285
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:30,463
We will now start the match.

1286
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,902
Choi Jong-woo,

1287
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,612
Shin Dong-woo,

1288
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:56,947
and Kim Jin-young's final match.

1289
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,366
Ready.

1290
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:18,761
I have chills.

1291
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,325
Did you see his face
when he threw his flag?

1292
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:43,160
His face went from this to this.

1293
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,331
That was a great performance.

1294
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,592
What just happened?

1295
01:08:58,676 --> 01:08:59,969
He's really strong.

1296
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,180
I actually have goosebumps.

1297
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:06,892
See, I told you I had a feeling he'd win.

1298
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,144
Five seconds. Not even.

1299
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,979
I told you I thought he was going to win.

1300
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,188
He was so amazing.

1301
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,816
All of the men are really flustered.

1302
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,109
It's an emergency.

1303
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:17,236
What was that?

1304
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,237
Just like that?

1305
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,740
-What happened?
-He's really strong.

1306
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,619
I'm so curious about him.

1307
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:28,414
-The mystery guy who came out of nowhere.
-Yes.

1308
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,456
Right, I'm curious.

1309
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,710
The final winner of the tug-of-war match

1310
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:34,670
is Jin-young. Congratulations.

1311
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,716
-Congratulations.
-He probably doesn't know who we are.

1312
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,593
Jin-young, you are the final winner.

1313
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:45,472
Please choose two women you would
like to enjoy the special meal with.

1314
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,974
You can go and choose.

1315
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,271
He just arrived, and he's having
a special meal date with two women.

1316
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,314
What is going on?

1317
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:55,524
I wonder who he's going to choose.

1318
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,152
He said it only takes
three seconds to feel a spark.

1319
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,669
I'd like to have a meal
with the second woman

1320
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,005
and the fourth woman.
