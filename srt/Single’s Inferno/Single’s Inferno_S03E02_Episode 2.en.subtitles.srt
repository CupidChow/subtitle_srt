1
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,103
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,105
I arrived in Inferno yesterday
and came to Paradise.

3
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,356
Oh, my god.

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,484
-There must be two Infernos.
-I guess so.

5
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,902
There are six in our group.

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,696
What? Six people?

7
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,909
I'm getting chills.

8
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,079
So there's another world.

9
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,289
Wait. What's going on?

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,332
It means there's another Inferno,

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,085
and two people
from each of those worlds just met.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,255
They both made it to Paradise
and met there.

13
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,883
I don't understand. What does that mean?

14
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,926
What do you mean there's another world?

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,471
-There are two Infernos.
-Jin-young, you explain.

16
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,016
There are two Infernos,
and they started simultaneously.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,811
The guy matched with someone there
and made it to Paradise too.

18
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,189
They spent a night there and met today.

19
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,732
This is going to be so fun.

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,526
-How insane.
-Look at him.

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,278
This is crazy.

22
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,293
Wait. Where's Min-young?

23
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,669
It's like a mystery show.

24
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,174
-Hello.
-Hello.

25
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,051
Hello.

26
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,679
Would you like to sit in the middle?

27
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,434
-You know each other?
-Yes.

28
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,977
Oh, you do.

29
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:43,895
-Hello.
-Hi.

30
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,648
-Do you know what's going on?
-Not at all.

31
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,068
-Did you hear what happened?
-No.

32
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,028
-There are two Infernos.
-What?

33
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,739
-Two Infernos.
-How did you part from Min-young?

34
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,990
Were you told this morning

35
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,326
-His face says it all.
-that you can't leave together?

36
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,244
Yes, pretty much.

37
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,745
-That was it?
-Yes.

38
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,289
Didn't they say
someone was waiting for Min-young?

39
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,833
-No.
-So they just told you

40
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,918
-that you couldn't leave together?
-Yes.

41
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:07,877
What's going on?

42
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,255
This is on a whole new level.

43
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,256
I know, right?

44
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,093
I did not expect this.

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,305
By the way, Jin-seok is so funny.

46
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,141
He had no idea what was going on.

47
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,144
Then, a complete stranger
got in the helicopter,

48
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,312
-You're right.
-and he nonchalantly said hi.

49
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,730
-Totally.
-It's ridiculous.

50
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,066
Maybe he forgot what Gwan-hee looked like.

51
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,826
Is this scenery unfamiliar to you?

52
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,827
It is.

53
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,121
And I feel completely lost.

54
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,291
They're here.

55
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,254
I can hear their voices.

56
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,465
Someone's sitting over there.

57
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,176
-Hello.
-Hello.

58
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,387
Hello.

59
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,431
Really?

60
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,516
-Hello.
-Hello.

61
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,769
-Hello.
-Hello.

62
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,771
-Hello.
-Hello.

63
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,689
Hello.

64
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,316
Nice to meet you guys.

65
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,276
I don't think we've met.

66
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,153
Oh, haven't you heard anything?

67
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,696
-No.
-We haven't.

68
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,655
Nice to meet you.

69
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,865
-You too.
-What's your name?

70
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,283
I'm Park Min-kyu.

71
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,576
-Park Min-kyu.
-Hi.

72
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,829
You seem really puzzled.

73
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,291
It really caught me off guard.

74
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,168
I was like, "What's going on?"

75
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,339
I couldn't understand why she returned
with a completely different guy.

76
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,176
What in the world happened over there?

77
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,888
Do you see that long island over there?

78
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,933
I came from the other side of that island.

79
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,644
What?

80
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,605
He's from another Inferno.

81
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,732
There are two Infernos.

82
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,485
-That one over there?
-Yes.

83
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,569
-That one?
-Yes.

84
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,154
No way.

85
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,749
So crazy that it was right there.

86
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,502
-They paved a road for us.
-They did.

87
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,088
Hello.

88
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,007
What? I don't think that's him.

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,594
It looks like there's another Inferno.

90
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,012
This is so shocking.

91
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:23,972
Oh, really?

92
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,516
-I'm getting goosebumps.
-Me too.

93
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,142
-Really?
-What's going on?

94
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,562
-What if they swim over?
-They might.

95
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,022
-Saying "I miss you."
-Right.

96
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,524
There was another inferno.

97
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,444
I think this could make couples
long for each other more,

98
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:43,324
but it might work against them
and cause them to fall out.

99
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,035
Because the other person
isn't in the same Inferno,

100
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,330
-they're free to do whatever they want.
-Right.

101
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,207
-It'd be like a fresh start.
-I know.

102
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,822
BACK TO DAY 1

103
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,911
Hello.

104
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,663
My name is Son Won-ik.

105
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:36,377
People around me often say
that I'm optimistic and honest.

106
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,547
I've often been told
that I have a boyish charm.

107
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,843
I like trying new things
and taking on new challenges.

108
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,928
I'm all about new experiences.

109
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,014
I'm always up for a challenge.

110
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,350
I'm determined to find a good match here

111
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,020
and escape Inferno.

112
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,444
Hello, my name is Yun Ha-bin.

113
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,655
I think my eyes
are what make me attractive.

114
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:09,535
People around me often say
that they make me look good-natured.

115
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,997
Also, once I set a goal for myself,

116
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:17,168
I push forward with it
without ever giving up.

117
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,837
I want to shake things up a bit
when I get there.

118
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,946
Hello.

119
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,531
Hello.

120
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,293
My name is Yun Ha-jeong.

121
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,130
People often assume
that I'm the foxy type.

122
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,424
The type to charm her way
into getting things from her boyfriend.

123
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,677
They say that based on my looks,

124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,180
but I become simple and transparent
once I'm in a relationship.

125
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,849
No matter where I go,

126
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,685
there's always at least one or two guys
who fall for me.

127
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,856
My popularity overwhelms me sometimes.

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,609
I doubt any of the girls have
a prettier smile than mine.

129
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,111
Especially with this dimple.

130
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,823
I'm sure everyone will fall for me.

131
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,327
I can't wait to see.

132
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,746
We have the most confident girl
and guy already.

133
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,706
-Yes.
-Definitely.

134
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,623
For sure.

135
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,646
My name is Park Min-kyu.

136
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,024
I'm very competitive.

137
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,484
When I set a goal

138
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,195
and meet someone I like,
I make sure they know it.

139
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,989
I think my charm is my tall height

140
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,783
and my broad shoulders.

141
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,369
I've had many nicknames
about my shoulders.

142
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,831
There wasn't a viral nickname back then
for broad shoulders.

143
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,293
At some point,
people started calling me Shoulder Beast.

144
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,631
He sure is a beast.

145
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,675
-His body is like armor.
-Right.

146
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,065
My competition?

147
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,610
I'd have to say Min-kyu.

148
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,821
He has a great physique
and is good-looking in a stylish way.

149
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,258
-She looks like Jennie.
-She does.

150
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,468
She's so cute and pretty.

151
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,686
Hello, my name is Yu Si-eun.

152
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,815
I've been popular since I was little.

153
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,150
I was popular in school,

154
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,696
and I got hit on a lot
after I became an adult.

155
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,864
It's always been like that.

156
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,077
People around me tell me that I'm lovely.

157
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,748
I think it's because I'm expressive
and have a cute personality.

158
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,126
Guys tell me

159
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,921
that they probably can't see my wings
because of how radiant I am.

160
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:53,342
They often jokingly say that to me.

161
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,891
-What, have you fallen for her?
-What?

162
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,436
It looks like that's what you want.

163
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,607
-Hello.
-Hello.

164
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,025
-Hello.
-Hello.

165
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,651
-Hello.
-Hello.

166
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,736
Hello.

167
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,945
Hello.

168
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,211
Q. DO YOU KNOW ANYONE HERE?

169
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,256
Yes, I've known
the other female participant

170
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,425
for quite a while now.

171
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,469
-Oh, really?
-What?

172
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,720
-Really?
-Oh, wow.

173
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,639
What? They know each other?

174
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,391
She's my friend's older sister,

175
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,143
so we've been pretty close.

176
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,065
I was glad to see her,
but I didn't show it.

177
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,819
I think I'm more charming
in bubbly and lovely ways.

178
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,404
That's what I think.

179
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,160
I think I'm classier and better than her
in every way.

180
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,624
She's so daring.

181
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,918
This is a coincidence, right?

182
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,838
They'll be more open with each other
since they've known each other.

183
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,424
-Right. Yes.
-When it's just the two of them.

184
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,009
"What do you think of him?"

185
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,469
"I like him. How about you?"

186
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,055
-They could do that.
-What if they like the same guy?

187
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,432
-Plus, they've been staying close.
-Right.

188
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,643
I wonder how she'll compete
with her sister's friend.

189
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:29,021
We already know
that Park Min-kyu made it to Paradise.

190
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,399
-You're right.
-That's true.

191
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,817
I wonder who he went with.

192
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,320
Enjoy your meal.

193
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,988
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

194
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,157
-Enjoy. Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

195
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,409
Let's enjoy.

196
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,914
The chicken breast is delicious.

197
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,165
-Really?
-Yes.

198
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,126
Carrots.

199
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,297
Can we eat like this?

200
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,465
It's not bad.

201
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,508
It's additive-free.

202
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,885
The carrot tastes better
because of the heat.

203
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,014
-It's so organic.
-Exactly.

204
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,057
I love it.

205
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,269
-Yes, it's nice.
-This isn't Inferno. It's Paradise.

206
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,314
It feels like Paradise. Right?

207
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,649
-Yes. Paradise.
-I like it.

208
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,608
-Right?
-Yes.

209
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,818
-Paradise.
-I like it.

210
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,948
What's so funny?

211
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,453
It's really not that bad.

212
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,079
-I know.
-It's really good.

213
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,164
I love it.

214
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,209
I could eat this every day
for a whole year if I had to.

215
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,335
-Really?
-Seriously?

216
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,046
-Seriously?
-I think…

217
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,469
Wasn't Ha-jeong's reaction a little odd?

218
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,928
Ha-jeong's a little…

219
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,805
"I've never seen you eat carrots."

220
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,933
It felt like,
"Is that how you're going to play it?"

221
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,187
I could eat this every day
for a whole year if I had to.

222
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,188
-Really?
-Seriously?

223
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,900
-Seriously?
-I think you're a good liar.

224
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:59,236
I once got hooked on cabbage
and ate it for a month.

225
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,821
-Just cabbage?
-Yes.

226
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,780
Really?

227
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,907
Like this.

228
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,658
-You ate it raw?
-Yes.

229
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,875
Why are all my carrots bitter?

230
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,710
I'll take this one.

231
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:18,172
Try this. It's the core,
so it shouldn't be bitter.

232
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,091
Okay. I don't usually eat carrots raw.

233
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,134
Isn't it good?

234
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,844
Yes, it's good.

235
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,846
-This one is delicious.
-Right?

236
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,473
-It's really nice.
-Right?

237
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,725
I'll find you the good ones.

238
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,312
Maybe not this one.

239
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,023
Doesn't this one look okay?

240
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,110
I think Si-eun and Ha-jeong
like the same guy.

241
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,779
Right? It seems like it.

242
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,781
He's going to get both their votes.

243
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,742
We already know
that Min-kyu made it to Paradise.

244
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,993
But with whom?

245
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,914
Does anyone want water?

246
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,041
I'll go get some.

247
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,000
-Me.
-Okay.

248
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,210
Thank you.

249
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,506
Anyone else?

250
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,467
Why don't we just get five cups?

251
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,385
Okay, sure.

252
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,480
-These are so pretty.
-I know, right?

253
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,860
She just glared at her.

254
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,196
Is it just me?

255
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,407
-No, she totally did.
-I saw it too.

256
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,033
-Just now…
-She scowled at her.

257
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,159
Yes, I saw.

258
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,244
-My gosh.
-Seriously?

259
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,954
Si-eun is one step ahead of her.

260
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,332
-She's one up.
-It's like a game of Go.

261
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,796
-I'll take these.
-Okay.

262
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,714
Water, anyone?

263
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,340
Thank you.

264
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,009
I already have some here.

265
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,427
-Okay.
-Thank you.

266
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,512
One person already has water.

267
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,597
-Really?
-Yes.

268
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,599
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

269
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,851
How does the water taste?

270
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,227
It tastes okay.

271
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,353
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

272
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,772
-Thank goodness.
-The taste of the water?

273
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,692
-The water's good.
-Is it?

274
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,651
It's sweet.

275
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,236
-Really? Si-eun.
-It is?

276
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,282
I think I'm full.

277
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,199
Are you full?

278
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,451
Not really.

279
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,953
I'll eat more for dinner.

280
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,747
-Dinner?
-I'm not really full.

281
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,332
What if dinner is the same?

282
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,835
-Then I'll just eat.
-She'll eat the chicken breast then.

283
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,795
If that happens, I'll eat everything.

284
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,382
What was that?

285
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,550
Singles.

286
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,554
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

287
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,973
Already?

288
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,476
Already?

289
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:43,817
Couples that match
will leave for Paradise immediately.

290
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,319
-Seriously?
-Already?

291
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,445
Already?

292
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,364
But we just got here. It's too soon.

293
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,240
-Oh, gosh.
-It's too soon.

294
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,742
For real?

295
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,456
They didn't know the couple matching
would happen so soon.

296
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,460
-Right.
-But they still did a great job

297
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:02,962
of being assertive.

298
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,839
-Right.
-She said she could eat carrots every day

299
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,841
-I agree.
-and that the water was sweet.

300
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,969
-They tried their best.
-They really did.

301
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,136
In that brief moment.

302
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,930
-Si-eun put in a lot of effort.
-Yes.

303
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,975
Did you see Ha-jeong's face
when Si-eun said the water was sweet?

304
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,064
Unfortunately, both women
seem to have feelings for Min-kyu.

305
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,273
Yes, it seems so.

306
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,109
It's one of two things.

307
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,402
Ha-jeong helped Min-kyu

308
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,197
pick out better carrots
when he said his were bitter.

309
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,907
-Right.
-She helped him.

310
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,534
-Yes.
-Meanwhile, Si-eun…

311
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,202
-She helped him get water.
-Right.

312
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,079
I wonder which person he'll choose.

313
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,207
-Water or carrots.
-Yes, it's tough.

314
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,670
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

315
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,797
PARADISE-BOUND COUPLE MATCHING RESULTS

316
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,550

319
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,163
Son Won-ik.

320
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,876
Please deliver your ticket to the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

321
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,008
Thank you.

322
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,681
SON WON-IK SELECTED YU SI-EUN

323
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,270
Yu Si-eun.

324
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,691
Please deliver your ticket to the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

325
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,128
YU SI-EUN SELECTED PARK MIN-KYU

326
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,472
Yun Ha-jeong.

327
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,727
Please deliver your ticket to the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

328
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,194
YUN HA-JEONG SELECTED PARK MIN-KYU

329
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,780
-They picked the same guy.
-Right.

330
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,573
-This is…
-There was no hesitation.

331
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,825
But they're friends.

332
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,328
Oh, dear.

333
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,798
Park Min-kyu.

334
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,470
Please deliver your ticket to the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

335
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,606
Who is it going to be?

336
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,234
Who will he choose?

337
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,500
YUN HA-JEONG & PARK MIN-KYU
SUCCESSFULLY MATCHED

338
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,212
-He chose Ha-jeong.
-Really?

339
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,797
It's the carrots.

340
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,424
-The carrots.
-Yes, carrots.

341
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,779
The first Paradise-bound
couple matching is over.

342
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,202
Couples that have matched,
please hold hands and leave for Paradise.

343
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,755
It's nice to meet you.

344
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,675
I didn't know we'd get to leave so soon.

345
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,719
-Right?
-Totally.

346
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,645
I'm glad we're starting out
like this together.

347
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,604
Same here.

348
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,238
I had you in mind
the moment you picked out carrots for me.

349
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,490
-Really?
-You helped me pick the tasty ones.

350
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,160
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

351
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,292
-See you later.
-Do we go in right away?

352
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,800
-Sit here.
-Sit here like this?

353
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,811
Are you okay?

354
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,617
-She seems a little…
-Yes.

355
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,619
-She's shocked.
-She must be upset.

356
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,496
It was a huge defeat.

357
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,458
-Being rejected for the first time
-Right.

358
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,335
could be a huge blow.

359
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,544
-Yes.
-But I think

360
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,338
hitting rock bottom…

361
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,090
-You keep saying that.
-You think it also applies here?

362
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,425
-It's not bad.
-Like Gyu-ri?

363
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,011
Do you think they go there
to hit rock bottom?

364
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,306
-It's the only way for her to go back up.
-He's right.

365
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,682
She'll rise again.

366
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,186
It's probably worse for her
since they know each other.

367
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,103
-Right.
-Oh, dear.

368
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,064
-It's going to feel so awkward.
-Gosh.

369
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,777
PARADISE
YUN HA-JEONG & PARK MIN-KYU

370
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,778
Is this it?

371
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,112
I think so.

372
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,411
It's so heavy.

373
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,290
This is awesome.

374
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,541
It's so pretty.

375
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,337
The view is amazing.

376
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,838
-This is great.
-It is.

377
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,633
-We can see everything.
-Right.

378
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,552
Shouldn't we enjoy the view from here?

379
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,637
Totally.

380
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,596
It's so pretty.

381
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,264
-It really is.
-Yes.

382
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,643
-Look at all this.
-It's fruit.

383
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,144
Korean melons.

384
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,563
This is nice.

385
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,732
Wait, they aren't Korean melons.

386
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,192
-These must be mangoes.
-Mango?

387
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,318
Yes.

388
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,402
-Yes.
-Is it a mango?

389
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,320
Yes, it is.

390
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:26,988
Then I'll have some.

391
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,577
I'll try this one too.

392
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,374
I'm so happy.

393
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,128
The texture is so different from carrots.

394
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,172
Carrots can't compete.

395
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,134
Still, you found me the sweet ones.

396
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,886
I know. I picked them out for you.

397
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,722
The ones you picked out for me
were really good.

398
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,349
Thank you.

399
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,517
It's nothing.

400
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,201
-Finally, we're free to talk.
-You're right.

401
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,662
-It's okay to talk, right?
-Yes.

402
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,914
How about we start by talking casually?

403
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:18,957
-Casually?
-Yes.

404
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,875
Please go ahead.

405
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,002
Oh, right. Casually.

406
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:22,919
Okay.

407
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,754
Let's talk casually.

408
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,965
-Sure.
-Okay.

409
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,261
Does this taste good?

410
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,220
Yes, it's good.

411
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,722
This is so nice.

412
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,016
Right? The view is amazing.

413
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,062
You can even see the plane landing.

414
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,022
-See?
-I know.

415
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,858
We haven't talked
about our ages yet, right?

416
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,775
No.

417
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,069
-Are you curious?
-Yes, I am.

418
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,279
-Are you?
-Of course.

419
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,197
Take a guess.

420
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,199
I'd say…

421
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,701
Maybe around…

422
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,078
Around 26?

423
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,705
-For real?
-Yes.

424
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,749
Or 27 at most.

425
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,376
Correct.

426
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,004
You're so good at this.

427
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,048
-Are you 26?
-Yes, I'm 26.

428
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,259
All right, then. It's your turn to guess.

429
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,554
I feel like you're probably older than me.

430
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,017
Twenty…

431
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,521
I saw you grin when I said 20.

432
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,857
-No.
-Maybe you're in your thirties.

433
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,776
Just go ahead and take a guess.

434
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,028
-How old do I look?
-Maybe 28 or 29?

435
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,322
-Twenty-eight?
-Not quite.

436
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,240
-Not quite?
-Yes.

437
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,366
Is it far from it?

438
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,408
-Thirty-two?
-It's…

439
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,369
-It's more than that.
-More? Older?

440
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,286
Yes.

441
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,080
You're older?

442
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,790
Then I'll go with 34.

443
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,707
Yes, correct.

444
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,042
-I'm 34.
-You're 34?

445
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,627
Yes, there's quite an age gap.

446
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,587
There is. How many years?

447
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,172
It's…

448
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,173
Eight years?

449
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,718
We're eight years apart.

450
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,720
It's an eight-year gap.

451
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,848
But you don't look your age.

452
00:25:58,932 --> 00:25:59,849
Really?

453
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,310
I have something to ask you.

454
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,481
I've been meaning to ask you
what you do for a living.

455
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,732
-My job?
-Yes.

456
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,817
-But…
-What do you think?

457
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,944
-Let me make a guess.
-Okay.

458
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:14,322
I noticed that you have
really good diction.

459
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,741
-Yes?
-So I thought you might be a news anchor.

460
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,078
-Did I get it right?
-No.

461
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,456
-You got it completely wrong.
-I did?

462
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,417
-It's not even close.
-Sorry.

463
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,252
I can't believe I got it so wrong.

464
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,838
I work for a company.

465
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,839
-A company?
-Yes.

466
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,882
-What kind?
-A clothing company.

467
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,135
-A clothing company?
-I'm an office worker.

468
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,971
Can I ask what kind of clothing?

469
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:38,930
Medical clothing.

470
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,015
What?

471
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,016
Hospital uniforms.

472
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,100
-Hospital uniforms?
-Yes.

473
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,353
-Like scrubs and hospital gowns?
-Yes, stuff like that.

474
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,152
I'm currently working
in the clothing industry.

475
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,865
I'm in charge of handling
the overall office work,

476
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,951
which includes customer service,
purchase orders,

477
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,579
inventory management and price quotes.

478
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,208
YUN HA-JEONG, AGE 26
CLOTHING COMPANY EMPLOYEE

479
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,502
Yes, I work for a company.

480
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,046
I see.

481
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,130
That's so cool.

482
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,008
So how about you?
What do you do for a living?

483
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:16,885
My job…

484
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,470
I'm…

485
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,556
-I'm a police--
-Let me…

486
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,599
I wanted to guess.

487
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,641
Just tell me then.

488
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,684
-Sorry.
-Take a guess.

489
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,602
No, it's fine.

490
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,479
It's okay. I already heard a bit.

491
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,607
-Sorry, I didn't mean to.
-Oh, no.

492
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,401
Anyway, I'm a police officer.

493
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,113
I'm a member of the Korea Coast Guard's
Sea Special Rescue Team.

494
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,240
PARK MIN-KYU
SSRT, KOREA COAST GUARD

495
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,163
I'm a rescue worker
for the Korea Coast Guard.

496
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:48,792
That's so cool.

497
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,418
-No wonder.
-A coast guard.

498
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:56,674
We respond to ship-related incidents
which involve capsized or sunken vessels.

499
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,888
We're also involved

500
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,351
in maritime responses such as rescues
and emergency patient transport.

501
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:11,189
Emergencies occur without warning,
so we're on duty 24 hours a day.

502
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,025
And we're dispatched
regardless of the time.

503
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,907
PARK MIN-KYU, AGE 34
SEA SPECIAL RESCUE TEAM

504
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:25,662
He looks like a movie star
in a film about the Coast Guard.

505
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,788
I agree.

506
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,915
I never would've guessed.

507
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,419
You must be a good swimmer.

508
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,254
I used to be a competitive swimmer.

509
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,005
Really? It suits you.

510
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,299
But I wasn't great at it.

511
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,302
I started competing in elementary school,

512
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,931
but I injured my shoulder
and eventually quit in high school.

513
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,560
-Then I started focusing on studying.
-It suits you.

514
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,062
-Swimming?
-Just sports in general.

515
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,815
I have a feeling that you work out a lot.

516
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,734
Don't you work out too?

517
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,527
You also look like you work out.

518
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,695
-Me?
-Yes.

519
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,321
I just got started.

520
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,241
-On what? Pilates?
-Working out.

521
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,659
No, I go to the gym.

522
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,078
I work out.

523
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,789
How long… How long has it been?

524
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,791
It's been kind of on and off.

525
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,501
-Everyone's like that.
-Right.

526
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,297
Do you do any other activities?

527
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,548
-Something else?
-Yes.

528
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,842
-Well, I'm not really good,
-Okay.

529
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,635
but I do like to play golf.

530
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,805
When did you start going to the gym?

531
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,892
About three months ago.

532
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,187
-What's so funny?
-It's nothing.

533
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,146
What's so funny?

534
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,814
So you really just started.

535
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,357
-Do you find that funny?
-No.

536
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,942
-Do you find that funny?
-No.

537
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,736
No.

538
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,237
How about golf? How long?

539
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,697
You know what's funny?

540
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,532
-You've never been on a golf course?
-No.

541
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,912
-I only play screen golf.
-I thought you might have.

542
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,956
I tend to give up easily.

543
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,503
It's okay.

544
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,546
-You can try different things.
-Right?

545
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,381
-You'll find what you like.
-Right.

546
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,425
-That's fine.
-Yes.

547
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,641
I guess he finds her cute.

548
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:12,060
Before I heard Ha-jeong speak,

549
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,730
she seemed a bit cold
because of the way she looked at people.

550
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,649
But after she started talking,

551
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,777
-her real charms are on display.
-I agree.

552
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,279
There's something I find funny about her.

553
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,823
-She has this move.
-Okay.

554
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,618
-She pulls her chin back like this and…
-How she looks up?

555
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,955
I can tell she's trying to dazzle him

556
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,581
with her charm.

557
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,958
-It's sexy.
-Like this.

558
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,835
-She does that.
-Yes, just like that.

559
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,128
-Min-kyu seems to like it.
-Yes.

560
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,340
I can tell that they have good chemistry.

561
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,342
It was pleasant to watch.

562
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,593
INFERNO II

563
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,928
It's so pretty.

564
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,556
The sunset is really beautiful.

565
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,476
It's so beautiful,
though what we came to see was the ocean.

566
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,394
Right?

567
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,187
So pretty.

568
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,691
The sun has gone down.

569
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,733
It has.

570
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,530
-Aren't you cold? It's windy.
-I'm fine.

571
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,244
-I'm glad we came for a stroll.
-So am I.

572
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,081
-It's nice to just stare at the water.
-It is.

573
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,545
I really like the calm and soothing sound

574
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,046
-of the ocean waves.
-Right.

575
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,049
It gets dark really fast.

576
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,175
-I know.
-Yes.

577
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,390
What's your ideal type?

578
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,474
-My ideal type?
-Yes.

579
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,977
I tend to like guys

580
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,021
with a puppylike face.

581
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,230
-A puppylike face?
-Yes.

582
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,024
Someone who looks kind.

583
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,235
But I care more about
how well we click when we talk.

584
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:46,988
What about you?

585
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,867
I like a woman with a round face.

586
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,705
And I have a thing for tall women

587
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,457
with puppylike faces.

588
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,001
There is one more thing.

589
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,338
I like women who exude a natural glow
through their expressions.

590
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,258
Someone who's not afraid
to show her true self.

591
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,927
-Someone who is just natural?
-Yes.

592
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,931
There's something beautiful about people
who stay true to themselves.

593
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,390
-You think so?
-Yes.

594
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,392
Tell me more about it later.

595
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,310
All right.

596
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:23,942
PARADISE
YUN HA-JEONG & PARK MIN-KYU

597
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:28,821
It's a spa.

598
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,781
It is.

599
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,951
I've never been to a spa with rose petals.

600
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,328
It's so nice.

601
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,246
It's so pretty.

602
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,873
-Everything's pink.
-Is it pretty?

603
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,546
I mean…

604
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,633
Isn't this funny?

605
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,760
-What is?
-We only just met today,

606
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,262
but we've already done so much.

607
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,472
I know.

608
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,182
-Right?
-Seriously.

609
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,394
We're doing so much together
even though we've just met.

610
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,603
-Right?
-Yes.

611
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,772
-Coming here…
-We rode a helicopter,

612
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,608
had good food,
and now we're enjoying a spa.

613
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,776
We even rode a boat.

614
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,819
Right.

615
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,696
I really enjoy

616
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,073
warming up my body like this.

617
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,951
-Me too.
-Really?

618
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,332
What was that?

619
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,501
-Her eyes.
-She's doing it again.

620
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,962
-Her eyes.
-What is this mood?

621
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,839
-Those mesmerizing eyes.
-Yes.

622
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,717
-She's charming and she knows it.
-She's captivating him.

623
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,884
I know, right?

624
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,268
What? What is it?

625
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,227
What?

626
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,395
Never mind.

627
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,114
I'm getting fidgety and tearing petals.

628
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,657
You know what? Me too.

629
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,993
We're similar.

630
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,371
I've also been tearing the petals.

631
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,002
-It seems Min-kyu really likes her.
-Yes.

632
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,379
-He must really like her.
-He looks so shy.

633
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,552
I can't stop laughing
every time I look at you.

634
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,511
Do I look funny?

635
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,222
It's not that you look funny.

636
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,184
It's just that
the way you're acting is funny.

637
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,936
I just feel a bit nervous. That's why.

638
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,313
No, I find it cute.

639
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,857
I feel nervous too.

640
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,442
-Really?
-Yes.

641
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,777
You don't seem to.

642
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,278
I'm trying not to show it.

643
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,781
I see.

644
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,201
How do you feel?

645
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,619
-About what?
-Being here.

646
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,703
Being here?

647
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,790
I'm having a lot of fun.

648
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,707
-You are?
-Yes.

649
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,501
What about you?

650
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,045
I was really worried at first

651
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,257
because I wasn't really sure
if I'd find someone I like.

652
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,467
Right.

653
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,803
-But…
-Yes?

654
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,931
I'm having a lot of fun now that I'm here.

655
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,893
-Am I too simple-minded?
-No.

656
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,230
-But I was really worried about that.
-I see.

657
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,983
But I bet everyone felt the same way.

658
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,861
To be honest…

659
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:19,450
I picked you because you were my type
in terms of looks.

660
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,120
But now that we've talked
for quite a while,

661
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,705
I actually think you're fun to be around.

662
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,374
Thanks.

663
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,049
I want to lie back.

664
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,634
-Want to do what?
-Lie back.

665
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,594
-Lie back?
-Gosh, it's slippery.

666
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,429
It's so slippery.

667
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,848
The bottom is…

668
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,142
-It's…
-It's so slippery.

669
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,064
-Are you good?
-Yes.

670
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,108
I won't lie back. You were right.

671
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,276
-Do you get it now?
-Yes.

672
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,236
The same thing happened to me earlier.

673
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,156
I felt like I was on a sled just now.

674
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,298
-You should do this.
-What is this?

675
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,340
A rose skin treatment.

676
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,550
A rose skin treatment?

677
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,302
-My skin's going to be so smooth.
-Yes.

678
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,012
Here's some for you too.

679
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,096
Thanks.

680
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,611
Don't you think
it's getting hotter in here?

681
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,279
It's so hot.

682
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,158
Today has made me think a lot.

683
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,409
-Really?
-Yes.

684
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,954
This is so romantic.

685
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,081
Things are heating up.

686
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,209
Min-kyu's already fallen hard.

687
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,086
-He's completely fallen for her.
-Yes.

688
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,797
I feel hot just watching them.

689
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,591
It's really getting intense.

690
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,344
It feels like Ha-jeong
makes things easy for him.

691
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,929
-She seems experienced.
-Yes.

692
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,889
-Right.
-You can easily tell

693
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,515
how popular Ha-jeong has been

694
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,100
-Exactly.
-by the way she acts.

695
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,479
Like her facial expressions
in certain moments.

696
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,897
You mean how she sometimes

697
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,191
-pulls her chin back like this?
-Yes.

698
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,734
She sends the signal.

699
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,569
Would you fall for that, Jin-young?

700
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,946
Me? Never.

701
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,740
What's your take on that move?

702
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,243
-What if a girl did that?
-I'd lift her chin up.

703
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,372
He won't let her have it.

704
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,416
She pulls it back, and I push it back up.

705
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,876
It'd be perfect chemistry.

706
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,962
-You should get back in there.
-He's hilarious.

707
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,838
"Please raise your chin now."

708
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,219
The day it all went nuts.

709
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,768
PARADISE
YUN HA-JEONG & PARK MIN-KYU

710
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,395
It looks delicious.

711
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,730
It looks so good.

712
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,150
-What a grand breakfast.
-I know, right?

713
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,194
An apple for breakfast is good for you.

714
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,821
It's as good as gold.

715
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,242
Why are you laughing when I'm talking?

716
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,326
It's nothing.

717
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,954
I just thought you were cute
when you said it.

718
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,290
-Oh, my.
-You see?

719
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,210
-He laughs because he finds her cute.
-He laughs whenever she talks.

720
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,754
I'll eat apples for breakfast from now.

721
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,465
I think it's really good.

722
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,342
-I've been doing it for a while.
-Okay.

723
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,805
I'm thinking of this
as my last proper meal.

724
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,642
No, we can always come back here.

725
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,271
I don't want to go back. Don't you agree?

726
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,859
I haven't relaxed like this
and had this much fun in a while.

727
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,027
Let's come back.

728
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:42,903
Let's come again.

729
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,197
Now, I have a new goal.

730
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,282
-Really?
-Yes.

731
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,576
What if you come back with someone else?

732
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,204
Don't you mean to come back
with someone else?

733
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,664
-Separately?
-Yes.

734
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,916
-Is that what you meant?
-Let's come together.

735
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,460
We'll come back together.

736
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,046
By the way,
just so you don't feel pressured,

737
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,466
you can talk to the other guys
if you want to.

738
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,468
-I know that.
-Feel free.

739
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,385
I plan to do so.

740
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,181
-I got ahead of myself. I did.
-That was the plan.

741
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,849
That's the purpose of the show.

742
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,392
Yes, you're right.

743
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,229
What was that?

744
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,315
There must be something more.

745
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,318
What? I'm feeling nervous now.

746
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,695
-My heart rate just went up.
-Really?

747
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,280
Yun Ha-jeong,

748
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,242
you may not return to Inferno
with Park Min-kyu.

749
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,955
I'm nervous.

750
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:35,998
Yun Ha-jeong,

751
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,126
a new male participant is waiting for you
in the lobby.

752
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,044
-What?
-No way.

753
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,420
Please return to Inferno with him.

754
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,717
I don't get it.

755
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,928
I'm so confused right now.

756
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,555
It's okay. You'll be fine.

757
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,477
Oh, no.

758
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,523
I was 60% excited and 40% disappointed.

759
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,443
-Sixty percent is more than half.
-Sixty percent…

760
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,694
She was more excited.

761
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,280
-The excitement was 60%.
-That's…

762
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,325
-The disappointment was only…
-It means she's excited.

763
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,286
Does it look better on or off?

764
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,038
What is more…

765
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,374
I don't want to say, but try it on.

766
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,585
Wear it outside and take it off indoors?

767
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,670
Is she serious?

768
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,132
This just shows
she isn't thinking about Min-kyu at all.

769
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,466
I feel so bad.

770
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,928
Wear it outside and take it off indoors?

771
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,932
-That sounds good.
-Okay.

772
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,434
I'm excited right now.

773
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,104
But I am sad you're leaving.

774
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,648
My gosh.

775
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,361
This is fun.

776
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,946
It's fun, indeed.

777
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,297
Oh, there he is.

778
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,339
Hello.

779
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,468
Hello.

780
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,137
Should I get in?

781
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,182
Hello.

782
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,476
-Where are you coming from?
-My bags…

783
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,186
I came from up there.

784
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,104
-Pardon?
-From up there.

785
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,024
You spent the night here?

786
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,614
-I'll…
-I'll get that for you.

787
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,742
Thank you.

788
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,750
Nice to meet you.

789
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,709
Nice to meet you.

790
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,713
When I saw Gwan-hee
after I was with Min-kyu,

791
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,466
I thought Gwan-hee was closer to my type.

792
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,302
They both are, but he's closer to my type.

793
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,224
Where are we going?

794
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,560
Gosh, that's…

795
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,771
She's giving him that look.

796
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,232
She's doing it again.

797
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,319
Where are we going?

798
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,240
I'm guessing we're headed to Inferno.

799
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,326
What's your name?

800
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,746
My name is Lee Gwan-hee.

801
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,706
What's your name?

802
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,083
I'm Yun Ha-jeong.

803
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,125
-Ha-jeong?
-Yes.

804
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,168
Yun Ha-jeong.

805
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,753
Did you arrive today?

806
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:33,092
I was in Inferno yesterday.

807
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,426
You came from Inferno?

808
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,344
Yes, I did.

809
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,137
How did you end up here?

810
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:41,016
I matched with someone and came here.

811
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,978
-But the woman I came with…
-Yes?

812
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,021
A new male participant picked her up.

813
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,483
Meanwhile, I was told to wait here,

814
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,152
and I was wondering when I would leave.

815
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,407
I have no idea what's going on.

816
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,658
-Let's go.
-Shall we go?

817
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,909
Yes. Here we go.

818
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,121
I'm perplexed.

819
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,544
I really don't know what's happening.

820
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,214
What was in your Inferno yesterday?

821
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,841
Ours had a plane.

822
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,510
We had a boat.

823
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,180
Then there really are two Infernos.

824
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,517
No way. Then, there must be
many more participants.

825
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,895
-How many were there on your side?
-Five, including me.

826
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,067
Am I allowed to ask where you live?

827
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,027
No, you're not.

828
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,029
-Are we not allowed?
-No.

829
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,784
Why do you want to know where I live?

830
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,372
I just got curious.

831
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,498
You got curious?

832
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,336
Then come to Paradise with me next time.

833
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,435
Min-kyu!

834
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,772
She was having fun with him
just an hour ago.

835
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,817
Did you have fun with Gwan-hee?

836
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,902
Yes.

837
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,071
According to what he said,

838
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:21,158
he was sure
that his feelings wouldn't change.

839
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,327
-He said that?
-Yes, but I'm thinking,

840
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,914
"How can he be so sure when he hasn't
even spent time with the others?"

841
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,708
I appreciate what he said,

842
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,877
but I only trust him 40%.

843
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,300
They announced we had to leave separately.

844
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,513
Did they tell you to go separately?

845
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,106
If it's hot, I'll open the window for you.

846
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,695
What's that?

847
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,364
Vitamins.

848
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,868
Wait, I should take out my medicine.

849
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,747
-Let me have some.
-It's medication.

850
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,207
They're prescription meds.

851
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,718
I swallowed it.

852
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,053
Just drink it already.

853
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,484
Look at her sleeping next to them.

854
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,069
That's Min-young.

855
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,113
-Right now…
-They're in their own little world.

856
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,156
Yes, exactly.

857
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,367
-It's like they spent the night together.
-I know, right?

858
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,036
INFERNO II

859
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,204
I'm so excited.

860
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,497
-It's this way.
-This way?

861
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,415
Yes.

862
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,878
Then we have to walk past this place.

863
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,422
You talk as if you've been here
for like ten days.

864
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,302
Just follow me.

865
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,472
Isn't the view so pretty?

866
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,975
-It's a nice island.
-Right?

867
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,316
I think we had a lot more fun here
than I thought we would.

868
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,442
-Yes.
-I agree.

869
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,902
-It was fun.
-Yesterday.

870
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,238
-And now, up this way.
-Where? There?

871
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,490
It's this way.

872
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,407
Oh, my.

873
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,035
-Wait.
-Grab onto me.

874
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,873
Are you cooled off now?

875
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,502
What?

876
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,257
Hello.

877
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,258
Hello.

878
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,678
I'm exhausted.

879
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,724
-Is that them?
-Hello.

880
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,100
-Hello.
-Hello.

881
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,354
What? I don't think that's him.

882
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,317
What's going on?

883
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,152
What's happening?

884
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:03,654
What is this?

885
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,448
I'm good at recognizing people.

886
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:10,953
But I couldn't tell at first
since they were far away.

887
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,247
Then I noticed his short hair.

888
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,707
So I kept wondering if I was mistaken.

889
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,918
What's going on?

890
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,925
Apparently, there's another Inferno.

891
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,510
They switched the guys.

892
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,012
-That's insane.
-I was told to go to the lobby,

893
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,723
-and there he was.
-I'm getting goosebumps for real.

894
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,850
-Are you all acquainted?
-We are.

895
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,811
-Yes.
-We're all from this Inferno.

896
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,772
This is so shocking. Is this for real?

897
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,315
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

898
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,441
-Hello.
-Your name…

899
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,820
-You should introduce yourself.
-I'm Lee Gwan-hee.

900
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,655
-Gwan-hee?
-Gwan-hee.

901
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,534
-I'm Son Won-ik.
-Won-ik?

902
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,618
-Yes.
-You're tall.

903
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,620
-Thank you.
-So random.

904
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,621
How tall are you?

905
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,000
I'm around 190 cm.

906
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,252
-Around 190.
-You're 190 cm?

907
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,088
He left a very strong first impression.

908
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:07,634
He had an eyebrow slit
and really short hair.

909
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,512
It made me want to find out
more about him.

910
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,222
I'm curious.

911
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,558
The same guy again?

912
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,727
You're right.
They like the same guy again.

913
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,103
-This is crazy.
-Really?

914
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,068
-How tall are you?
-I'm 170 cm.

915
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,862
-You're 170 cm?
-Yes.

916
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,741
-You're 170 cm?
-Yes.

917
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,618
You're rather short.

918
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,786
-Do you know my height?
-It's under 170.

919
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,787
Well, yes.

920
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,164
I could tell right away.

921
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,209
It seems like you became besties
on your ride back.

922
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,086
He's unbelievable.

923
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,339
-I mean…
-He's so rude.

924
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,720
-Unbelievable.
-That's funny.

925
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,767
Did you enjoy it?

926
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:58,644
Was it fun?

927
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:02,147
I guess it all depends on who you go with.

928
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,440
Of course.

929
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,692
Why do you look sad?

930
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,236
-No, not at all.
-Why…

931
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,660
To be honest, I only said that
to let the guys know

932
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,453
they still have a shot with me.

933
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,542
-She's the best.
-I like her honesty. I could tell.

934
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,670
She's really something.

935
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,629
She's the best.

936
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,923
-This show needs someone like her.
-Right.

937
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,758
-She's something else.
-She is.

938
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,885
She really is.

939
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:35,305
I want to explore my options
with different people,

940
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,600
and I might not get to do that
if I say I enjoyed it too much.

941
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,771
Then is Gwan-hee also…

942
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,356
What the…

943
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,233
What the…

944
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,111
-Hello.
-Hello.

945
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,112
Hello.

946
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,365
-Hello.
-Hello.

947
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,909
-Hello.
-Hello.

948
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,995
You're the star,
so you should sit in the center.

949
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,580
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

950
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,919
It feels different
now that you two are here.

951
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,338
-We're lucky we came here.
-I agree.

952
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,799
-Welcome.
-He's lightened up.

953
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,718
-You look so happy.
-I like that.

954
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,303
Didn't you two just meet?

955
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,847
-Yes.
-We did, but…

956
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,349
-So what's with the bickering?
-"Bickering"?

957
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,642
We're not bickering.

958
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,894
-We're not.
-We just slightly don't get along.

959
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,360
Gwan-hee kept playing pranks on me.

960
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,906
So I was wondering
why he kept saying stuff like that.

961
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,618
But he's fun to be around,
and I like fun guys.

962
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,249
Gwan-hee said he always pulls pranks
on his girlfriend.

963
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,250
-Right.
-Yes.

964
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,920
Maybe he's acting that way
because he wants her to be his girlfriend.

965
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,046
But what's certain is,

966
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,133
she seems more comfortable around Gwan-hee
than around Min-kyu.

967
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,470
Gwan-hee is more relaxed
and seems more experienced,

968
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,346
which makes Ha-jeong more comfortable.

969
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,266
Min-kyu was mostly shy around her,

970
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,686
but Gwan-hee
is more comfortable in interacting

971
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,646
-and having fun with her.
-Right.

972
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,275
-Please sit.
-Okay.

973
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,986
-It's a bit cramped.
-Let's talk casually.

974
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,780
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

975
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,156
Won-ik and Ha-bin.

976
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,574
-Yes, Ha-bin.
-Gwan-hee.

977
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,909
So how was Paradise?

978
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,162
Paradise…

979
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,665
Did you get to share more information
such as your age and job?

980
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,959
Yes, I got to ask her all that.

981
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,004
But she turned out to be a lot different

982
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:34,090
than what I had expected
based on my first impression of her.

983
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,343
She wasn't what you'd expected?

984
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,178
Right, it was very different.

985
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,722
I don't think you mean that in a good way.

986
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,767
I guess you didn't feel any chemistry.

987
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,435
It's not exactly that,

988
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,938
but it just wasn't what I had expected.

989
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,526
I feel like I need to go to Paradise
with different people

990
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,153
to find out who's a good match for me.

991
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,783
If you ask me if my feelings for Hye-seon

992
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,286
got stronger after the trip,

993
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,498
I'd have to say no.

994
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:12,170
I felt that I couldn't keep up
with her energy.

995
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,841
Is it because she's too cheerful?

996
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,717
She did have big reactions.

997
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,679
I mean, she got all excited about mangoes.

998
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,681
-"Apples!"
-Right.

999
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,599
-She exclaimed a lot.
-"What a nice hotel."

1000
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,684
-It was too much.
-Yes.

1001
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:26,643
Exactly.

1002
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,812
How was it?

1003
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,314
-Paradise?
-Yes.

1004
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,399
It was nice.

1005
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,067
-Is it different?
-Yes.

1006
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,902
-Really?
-She got a massage.

1007
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,238
Lucky you. Do you think
we can get one today?

1008
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,656
Oh, maybe no one's going today.

1009
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,285
-I think someone might.
-You think?

1010
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,954
We might pick again
since the members are different.

1011
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,456
But the members are all mixed up,

1012
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,001
so it'll be harder to tell
how other people feel.

1013
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,335
This is really crazy.

1014
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,671
Unbelievable.

1015
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,882
I went to a swimming pool.

1016
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,925
-It was…
-Was it nice?

1017
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,012
It was awkward at first,
so we just splashed around.

1018
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:05,015
Later, I asked him to carry me
because I was too tired.

1019
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,183
-So I latched onto him like this.
-Really?

1020
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,643
It's like we were siblings.

1021
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,103
-Siblings?
-Yes.

1022
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,022
-What? Siblings?
-What?

1023
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,316
Siblings don't do that with each other.

1024
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,650
At least not in Korea.

1025
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,320
We had…

1026
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,906
-We had a real blast.
-Did you?

1027
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,115
Well, I can tell.

1028
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,868
I can tell you had a blast. I know you.

1029
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,412
You look so…

1030
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,956
-The thing is…
-We both chose the same guy.

1031
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,833
What was he like?

1032
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:35,253
But it wasn't about his looks.
You know my type, right?

1033
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,632
-I like guys with puppylike faces.
-I see.

1034
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,799
What does he look like?

1035
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,052
-He has more of a dinosaur face.
-Right.

1036
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,095
Really? That's my type.

1037
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,139
We like different types.

1038
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,390
-Really?
-We're the opposite.

1039
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,601
I'm getting curious about that guy.

1040
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,686
-He really looks like a dinosaur.
-Very fit too.

1041
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,438
He totally looks like a dinosaur.

1042
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,107
I can't wait to meet
the other participants.

1043
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,151
There are some attractive guys there.

1044
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:02,364
There's one guy
whose name starts with "Min."

1045
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,032
-He might be your type.
-Really?

1046
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,159
He has a puppylike face,

1047
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,535
but he's well-built.

1048
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,120
And he's super tall.

1049
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,538
-Really?
-About 190 cm.

1050
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,248
Your eyes just lit up.

1051
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,875
-I'm just…
-What about my type?

1052
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,336
-Is there anyone for me?
-I can't think of anyone.

1053
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,421
The guys there are all well-built.

1054
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,340
They're well-built?

1055
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,133
-I'm so curious.
-They're well-built.

1056
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,343
-I'm so curious.
-The guy…

1057
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,887
-Look at you acting all shy.
-The guy who came here today

1058
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,889
is also well-built, right?

1059
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,310
My gosh, seriously.

1060
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:36,106
What's with you?
Why are you suddenly blushing?

1061
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,691
Excuse me.

1062
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,361
Didn't you just get back from Paradise?

1063
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,905
I guess I'm getting excited.

1064
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,783
I can't wait until they come over.

1065
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,577
You should pay a visit over there.

1066
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,913
How are the people there?

1067
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,916
First, as for the ladies,

1068
00:54:55,542 --> 00:55:00,839
there's one who I bet
is an ideal type for all men.

1069
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:02,966
That's what I think.

1070
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:07,220
Exactly what type of woman
is an ideal type for all men?

1071
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,555
It means she's pretty.

1072
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,683
Like someone you'd see
in a beauty pageant.

1073
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,768
She always has the perfect posture,

1074
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,313
and she also speaks
in a calm tone like this.

1075
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:22,902
I'm still kind of curious about her.

1076
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,072
-The girl who stayed behind?
-Her name was Gyu-ri.

1077
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,490
Gyu-ri? Is that her name?

1078
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:35,290
INFERNO I

1079
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:38,001
-Is this the way to the cafeteria?
-Yes.

1080
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,672
Are we not there yet?

1081
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,591
-We're almost there.
-Almost?

1082
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:49,345
Are there no steep slopes like this one
on the other island?

1083
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,264
-No.
-Is it all just flat?

1084
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:53,141
Well, not exactly.

1085
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,226
But it's nothing like this.

1086
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,729
This place feels a bit more intense.

1087
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,190
I see. I guess our place is a bit worse.

1088
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,442
A lot worse, I'd say.

1089
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,279
What are we eating today?

1090
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:08,323
I bet they're chicken breasts.

1091
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,325
-Chicken breasts and cucumbers.
-Carrots?

1092
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,826
-Cucumbers.
-Oh, not bad.

1093
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,827
Nice!

1094
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,413
-Do you like cucumbers?
-I like them.

1095
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,082
-Thank goodness.
-I like cucumbers.

1096
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,501
Should we wash them first?

1097
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,253
-I'll wash them.
-I want to peel the skin.

1098
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,463
-Really?
-Yes.

1099
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,841
-Are there any plates?
-I'll peel it for you.

1100
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,179
-I'm an expert at peeling.
-At peeling?

1101
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,598
-Yes, I have lots of experience.
-Is that a thing?

1102
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,183
Let's see.

1103
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,810
What have you peeled?

1104
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,437
We had a master peeler all along.

1105
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,529
-What is it?
-It's just that he…

1106
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,906
He just quietly left.

1107
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,991
Look over there.

1108
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,953
-Gyu-ri's changed a lot.
-You're right.

1109
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,162
-She's proactive.
-She has.

1110
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,997
She's completely different.

1111
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,126
I'm good with a potato peeler.

1112
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:03,837
You're better than I am.

1113
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,297
-I'm good with my hands.
-You're good.

1114
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:07,841
Careful.

1115
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,300
Done.

1116
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,052
Here we go.

1117
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,178
You're good.

1118
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,515
Look, you're quite the artist.

1119
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,725
Is it to your liking?

1120
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,395
Do you need me to peel anything?

1121
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,604
Don't we have more?

1122
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:25,733
Gyu-ri seemed indifferent at first,

1123
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,446
but as we grew closer,
she started talking more. She seems nice.

1124
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:36,077
-The cucumbers look delicious.
-I know.

1125
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,120
They look decent.

1126
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,121
-Right?
-Yes.

1127
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,205
They look delicious.

1128
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,250
-They're cute.
-Yes.

1129
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,877
It's like a cucumber family.

1130
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,170
A cucumber family?

1131
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,505
Does that mean if someone eats one…

1132
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,507
Would that make us homewreckers?

1133
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,968
Doesn't it suit me?

1134
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,094
It does.

1135
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,555
It wasn't that funny.

1136
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,850
-She used to be so cold.
-Look how much she's laughing now.

1137
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,101
She's a different person.

1138
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,854
I guess you need to hit rock bottom
like Kyuhyun said.

1139
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,315
-It has to happen.
-That's how you change.

1140
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,441
It's essential.

1141
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,152
-Enjoy.
-You too.

1142
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,696
Enjoy your meal.

1143
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,072
-Eat up, guys.
-Eat up.

1144
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,324
Thank you for the meal.

1145
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,869
-The cucumbers are pretty good.
-They're delicious.

1146
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:18,828
They're sweet.

1147
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,373
The cucumbers are good.

1148
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,419
You sound so sad, though.

1149
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,796
What's with the stem?

1150
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,509
-Who put that here?
-I guess it's the baby.

1151
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,428
I like being in nature.
I'm getting used to being here.

1152
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,014
This is so different
from what I had for breakfast.

1153
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:40,308
Don't you agree?

1154
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,392
What did you eat?

1155
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:46,272
For me, out of all the breakfast dishes,
I loved the blueberry pie.

1156
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,690
-It was so good.
-Really.

1157
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,401
That sounds delicious.
We were craving bread earlier.

1158
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,488
-It is the best breakfast.
-Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

1159
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,365
You shouldn't be settling for this.

1160
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,491
I want some bread.

1161
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,326
You'll get to try some soon.

1162
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,203
Go and try them yourself.

1163
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,248
Blueberry pie sounds so good.

1164
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,044
You can order anything you want there.

1165
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,047
Really? I love bread.

1166
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,385
Gyu-ri was very responsive
whenever I talked.

1167
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,136
I liked that.

1168
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,764
I really like people who are responsive.

1169
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,850
I think I'm attracted to Gyu-ri.

1170
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,439
Come on.

1171
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:30,692
Singles.

1172
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,527
Today,

1173
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,864
there will be another
Paradise-bound couple matching.

1174
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,495
It will commence in an hour.

1175
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,748
-In an hour?
-They need to use their time wisely.

1176
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,625
-In an hour,
-In an hour, they need to…

1177
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,002
-they need to entice someone.
-Right.

1178
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,878
Or do something to win someone over.

1179
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,924
In an hour?

1180
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,054
Gyu-ri, can we talk?

1181
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,099
-Right now.
-Okay.

1182
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:04,642
He's fast.

1183
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,645
They should get a chance to go.

1184
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,689
They should go to Paradise today.

1185
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,691
Gyu-ri, can we talk?

1186
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,777
-Right now.
-Okay.

1187
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,613
Let's go.

1188
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,450
We should have a talk too, Hye-seon.

1189
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:21,909
Min-kyu?

1190
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:25,079
Min-kyu actually has feelings for Gyu-ri,

1191
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,290
but she's already taken by another guy.

1192
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,375
I think he's trying to be proactive.

1193
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:33,129
In any case, does it mean Ha-jeong's
no longer on Min-kyu's mind either?

1194
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,505
-That's…
-I'm not sure.

1195
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,382
He's trying to make the best

1196
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,384
-His best effort.
-of the situation.

1197
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,142
Would you like more water?

1198
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:47,935
I'm good.

1199
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,314
My heart is pounding.

1200
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,150
A lot.

1201
01:00:57,278 --> 01:01:00,239
I wanted to talk to you more yesterday,

1202
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,825
but we didn't have much time.

1203
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:03,826
Right.

1204
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,538
I bet you were exhausted
from starting that fire.

1205
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,083
-It took so long too.
-Right.

1206
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,584
It was fun yesterday.

1207
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,544
Yes, I had fun yesterday.

1208
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,548
The more we talk,
the more I enjoy your company.

1209
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,716
-Really?
-Yes.

1210
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,177
-That's good to hear.
-Don't you feel the same?

1211
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,304
What? I also feel the same way,

1212
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,723
but I wasn't sure how you felt.

1213
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:34,107
That's why I asked you to talk with me
as soon as I heard the announcement.

1214
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,987
I wanted to score some points with you.

1215
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:40,905
Is that right?

1216
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,535
That's just how I felt.

1217
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:50,707
You know,
after our last Paradise selection,

1218
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,711
I really regretted my decision,
and I don't want to make

1219
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:56,879
the same mistake.

1220
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:58,423
He's really trying.

1221
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,633
He's basically telling her

1222
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,302
that he's sorry
and that he made a mistake.

1223
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:08,099
I really regretted my decision,
and I don't want to make

1224
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,309
the same mistake.

1225
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,438
So I just wanted to tell you
how I really felt.

1226
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,400
I regretted making that decision.

1227
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,152
-You regretted it?
-Yes.

1228
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,450
I asked if we could talk
hoping we could go together.

1229
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,826
-To Paradise?
-Yes.

1230
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,413
I want to go with you, not anybody else.

1231
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,919
I wanted to be honest with her
about how I felt.

1232
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:40,465
We'll have to see what she decides to do,

1233
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:44,302
but I don't see myself regretting
being honest with her,

1234
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,012
so I'm just going to wait.

1235
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:59,025
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1236
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,281
Please write down the name of the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with

1237
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:09,327
on the Paradise-bound ticket
and put it in the mailbox.

1238
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,965
-Right away?
-They announce it right away?

1239
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,887
-We can see Gyu-ri's really changed.
-Right.

1240
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,640
-She smiles a lot and is more responsive.
-Right.

1241
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,935
-This is what I was talking about.
-So the guys are opening up to her more.

1242
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:36,187
Yes, Gyu-ri has changed.

1243
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,022
She might get all the votes.

1244
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,106
-You think so?
-Really?

1245
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,691
-Gyu-ri might.
-I agree.

1246
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,194
I think all three guys
have feelings for her.

1247
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:44,445
It seems…

1248
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:48,115
-Then who do you think Gyu-ri will pick?
-That's the big question.

1249
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:51,452
-Gyu-ri didn't show how she felt
-I think…

1250
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,287
about what Min-woo said.

1251
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,915
She seemed a bit vague about it.

1252
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:59,627
I'm personally looking forward
to seeing Gyu-ri and Jin-seok together.

1253
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,546
-They're so different.
-Yes.

1254
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,464
It'll be fun to see them in Paradise.

1255
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:04,757
-I thought so too.
-Right.

1256
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,175
-Right?
-Gyu-ri and Jin-seok.

1257
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,135
-Right? It'll be so…
-It'll be so fun.

1258
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,053
Really?

1259
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:20,648
I will now announce
the couples bound for Paradise.

1260
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,567
PARADISE-BOUND COUPLE MATCHING RESULTS

1261
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:33,077
The man who will be joining Kim Gyu-ri
on her trip to Paradise is…

1262
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:45,381
I picked Kim Gyu-ri.

1263
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,091
CHOI MIN-WOO SELECTED KIM GYU-RI

1264
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:51,512

01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,562
PARK MIN-KYU SELECTED KIM GYU-RI

1268
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:01,188
All the votes.

1269
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,523
-All the votes.
-There we go.

1270
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,191
She really got all the votes.

1271
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:09,447
The man who will be joining Kim Gyu-ri
on her trip to Paradise is…

1272
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,741
I hope it's Jin-seok.

1273
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:12,825
It might be Min-kyu.

1274
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,243
-Min-kyu?
-Yes.

1275
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,291
