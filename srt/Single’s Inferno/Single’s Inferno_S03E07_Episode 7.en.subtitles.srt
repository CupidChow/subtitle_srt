1
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,103
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,480
I think

3
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,900
I like you the most.

4
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,318
-Me?
-Yes.

5
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,823
This is crazy.

6
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,710
During my time here…

7
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,129
How do I describe it?

8
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:51,801
You've had the biggest impact on me

9
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,513
and made me feel
a lot of different emotions.

10
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:04,022
And I think I got mad at you before,

11
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,318
-because I was jealous.
-I see.

12
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,028
I think that was why.

13
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,112
Partially, anyway.

14
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:18,661
The fact that you were even curious
about other women made me jealous.

15
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,414
-So--
-You mean when I told you

16
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,042
I was also curious about Gyu-ri?

17
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,378
Yes, and I thought I'd expressed
my feelings enough,

18
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,881
but you still wanted
to get to know other women.

19
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:33,968
So I think I got mad at you
out of jealousy.

20
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,973
She's amazing.

21
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,141
-She is.
-Really.

22
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,976
This makes her so charming.

23
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,648
Yes, I get it.

24
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:52,111
If you weren't attracted to me at all,

25
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,865
you wouldn't even care enough
to be upset or disappointed.

26
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,783
Right.

27
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,786
-But as for me,
-Okay.

28
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:05,333
I've been a little upset with you
ever since we returned from Paradise.

29
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,793
-With me?
-And…

30
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:12,132
I had a great time with you in Paradise,
including the breakfast we had together.

31
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:16,010
But since we came back from Paradise,

32
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,764
the way you've treated me and talked to me

33
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,517
seemed completely different
from how you were there.

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,685
I see.

35
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,186
It felt like…

36
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,107
Well, it made me wonder

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,112
if you weren't
really yourself in Paradise.

38
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,029
I see.

39
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,575
This can't be the real you, right?

40
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,119
-Right now?
-Yes.

41
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,704
This is the real me.

42
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,582
-That's who she really is.
-Yes.

43
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,167
-Yes, she seems sincere.
-Yes.

44
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,502
-No one is as transparent as she is.
-Exactly.

45
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:55,592
You're very different here
from when you were with me.

46
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,054
They're both me.

47
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,224
-How exactly am I different?
-Are you saying you're different

48
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,102
-when you're with a group of people?
-When I'm in a group…

49
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,855
How did I seem different
when I was with other people?

50
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:16,779
Let's say someone else like Ha-bin
or Won-ik is interested in you.

51
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,033
You make it hard for them to approach you.

52
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,618
-I see.
-So it made me wonder

53
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,955
if you're normally the type
to build a wall like that.

54
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,457
-Me?
-Yes, that's how I felt.

55
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,292
That was a weird remark.

56
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,960
I don't get what he's saying.

57
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,005
Yes, he's always like that
whenever he talks to Ha-jeong.

58
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,383
Remember the private conversation
they had in the lodging?

59
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,678
Ha-jeong stated the facts
and was honest with him,

60
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,765
but he kept steering the conversation
in a weird direction.

61
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,807
Is he just dumb?

62
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,227
Is Gwan-hee just dumb?

63
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,062
-Gwan-hee is…
-He's a little…

64
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,314
-He's missing the point.
-It's odd.

65
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,442
So it made me wonder

66
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,070
if you're normally the type
to build a wall like that.

67
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,446
-Me?
-Yes, that's how I felt.

68
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,989
Because I'm not into them.

69
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,077
Because you aren't interested in them?

70
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,994
Yes.

71
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,125
I'm not like that with you, am I?

72
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:17,465
Well, I guess you do treat me differently.

73
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,383
Exactly.

74
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,765
I was already pretty into you,

75
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,268
so I didn't really want
to talk to anyone else.

76
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,815
Okay. I get what you mean now.

77
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,732
Okay.

78
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,239
I'm sure

79
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,826
it wasn't easy for you
to tell me all this.

80
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,995
Thank you for doing so.

81
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,038
Everyone I talk to here tells me

82
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,626
-that they can't figure out how you feel.
-I see.

83
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,586
So I was also curious.

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,844
Honestly speaking,
my mind was made up just today.

85
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:07,473
What caused you
to make up your mind today?

86
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:17,442
It felt like I wasn't being honest
to myself about my feelings,

87
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,403
and it was giving me a hard time.

88
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,910
I'm usually not like that,
but ever since I came here…

89
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,748
I just don't want to regret it later.

90
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,634
I'll let you know

91
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,887
once I make my decision.

92
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,391
If I end up deciding on you,

93
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,350
I'll tell you so.

94
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,020
And I'll still tell you even if I don't.

95
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,397
-Yes, okay.
-Okay.

96
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,486
I knew Ha-jeong wouldn't change.

97
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,821
She was so honest and straightforward.

98
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,864
You know what?

99
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,034
In the beginning,
I thought so negatively about Ha-jeong.

100
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,952
I'm so mad at myself now.

101
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,663
-I want to apologize to her too.
-She's so charming.

102
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,916
-I owe her an apology.
-She's amazing.

103
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,459
But seriously,

104
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,129
she completely opened up
to him about her feelings.

105
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,508
I feel like that could've moved him.

106
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,592
In my opinion,

107
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,596
when Ha-jeong opened up
to Gwan-hee about her feelings,

108
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:32,600
he seemed a bit uncomfortable
as if he didn't have feelings for her.

109
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,894
-I noticed that too.
-He seemed flustered.

110
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,106
I think all he's thinking about
is Min-ji right now.

111
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,273
-I think so too.
-Yes.

112
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,776
I hope he gets to go
to Paradise with Min-ji.

113
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,530
-So he'll know for sure?
-Yes, so he can sort things out.

114
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,784
Who are you set on right now?

115
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,785
-Me?
-Yes.

116
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,288
I doubt it's easy.

117
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,834
Hye-seon is really nice too.

118
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
You think so?

119
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,338
She's great,
but I can't really figure her out.

120
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,595
On top of that,
Ha-jeong just told me that she likes me.

121
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,721
Ha-jeong?

122
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,933
That's bothering me too.

123
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:14,851
Of course.

124
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,479
So I'm a bit torn.

125
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,732
Did you have a good chat?

126
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,317
-Our chat?
-Yes.

127
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,361
I told him that I liked him.

128
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,279
-To Gwan-hee?
-Yes.

129
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,657
I feel so much more at ease
now that I've told him.

130
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,328
So I think I'll be able to enjoy
the remaining four days.

131
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:38,082
Jin-seok was apparently confused
because my actions didn't match my words.

132
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,585
-Yes, but that's--
-He said he was disappointed.

133
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:45,590
Well, it's understandable
if you think about it in his shoes.

134
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,300
Yes, but it still frustrates me.

135
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,177
He told me to get to know the others.

136
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,887
He's giving you a chance too.

137
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,097
But why now? This late?

138
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,682
-Is that how you feel?
-Yes.

139
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,519
It may not be too late for you
to work things out. Be good to him.

140
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,983
I doubt that's what he wants.
I think he wants a shot with someone else.

141
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,735
No, you're being so frustrating.

142
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,445
You're driving me nuts.

143
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,031
But didn't I make it clear
about my feelings today?

144
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,908
Don't just end it there.

145
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,453
Rather than just talking about it,
show it through your actions.

146
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,830
Make it easy enough for him to understand.

147
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,998
This is exhausting.

148
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,334
You barely did anything.

149
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,045
-It's tiring. This isn't me.
-It's tiring for all of us.

150
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,797
I even told him that I missed him.

151
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,050
No, that's not enough.

152
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,762
I even once told Min-kyu
that I had missed him a lot.

153
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,267
Good one, Ha-jeong.

154
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,852
That's just…

155
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,896
-Is it not enough?
-No.

156
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,441
-We only have a few days left.
-Right.

157
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,195
If you let things end like this,
you'll definitely regret it.

158
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,703
You'll regret not having done your best
to win over someone you like.

159
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,289
Yes, that's so true.

160
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,960
-She's teaching her a priceless lesson.
-Goodness.

161
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:09,674
PARADISE
CHOI HYE-SEON & SON WON-IK

162
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,051
-We can see the ocean from here.
-Gosh.

163
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,136
This is so nice.

164
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,430
This is amazing.

165
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,103
The sunset is so pretty right now.

166
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,897
It's so beautiful.

167
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,067
It's so pretty.

168
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,988
-This is perfect timing.
-We came at the perfect moment.

169
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,824
It looks great.

170
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,787
-It smells so good.
-Bon appétit.

171
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,589
Try it.

172
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,302
-How is it? Is it good?
-It's so good.

173
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,097
-Isn't it good?
-It is.

174
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:05,271
Now, we finally get to ask
each other's age and occupation.

175
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,188
Right.

176
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,817
I'm not saying you look old,
but you don't seem to be too young.

177
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,236
I'm guessing maybe 26?

178
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,738
-What?
-Never mind.

179
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,323
I think… Yes, I'll go with 26.

180
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,033
-Right on.
-Really?

181
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,075
-Yes.
-You're 26?

182
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,035
Yes.

183
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,328
You're really 26?

184
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,331
I guess you thought I was older.

185
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,665
Yes… No, I didn't.

186
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,791
So you're 26.

187
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,002
How old do you think I am?

188
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,420
I thought you'd be my age.

189
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,921
-Really?
-Born in 1998.

190
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,173
I was born in 1993.

191
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,841
-Oh, I see.
-I'm 31.

192
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,092
-Really?
-Yes.

193
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,135
That's surprising.

194
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,637
-Really?
-I'm so surprised.

195
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,929
-Stop lying.
-I'm serious.

196
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,306
-Really?
-Yes.

197
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,266
You're so pure at heart for your age.

198
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,560
-You were born in 1998?
-Yes.

199
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,103
You seem more mature.

200
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,773
-Did you think I'd be around your age?
-No, not quite.

201
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,443
But you seemed very mature
based on your self-discipline,

202
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,112
and the way you think and speak.

203
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,491
So I thought you'd be
in your mid-to-late twenties.

204
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,661
I see.

205
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,165
That makes it harder to guess what you do.

206
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,419
I work in the real estate industry.

207
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,379
I'm a realtor.

208
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,338
Really?

209
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,839
-Do you know what it is?
-Yes.

210
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,300
-Yes, I'm a realtor.
-That's so cool.

211
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,303
I'm still in college.

212
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,305
-You are?
-Yes.

213
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,807
I see.

214
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,113
Really?

215
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,705
You seem to have a good appetite.

216
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,666
I know. Especially today.

217
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,794
But I couldn't eat much
when I first went to Paradise.

218
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,004
I guess I feel more at ease now.

219
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,257
-It's a good thing.
-Yes.

220
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,593
When you won that Paradise-bound ticket…

221
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:07,685
I thought you'd choose Gwan-hee
to spend more time with him.

222
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,442
Gwan-hee?

223
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,452
That's not how I feel, at least for now.

224
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:30,916
I see.

225
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,631
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

226
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,508
-That was a nice dinner.
-It was.

227
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,016
Do you and Gwan-hee click when you talk?

228
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,436
-Well, I thought we did.
-Okay.

229
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,190
But Gwan-hee seems to think
I was very different

230
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:58,777
when I was in Paradise with him
from how I am now.

231
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,781
He thought I was far from his type
when we went to Paradise together,

232
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,743
but his mind changed
after he met me again in Inferno.

233
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,786
So I have no idea anymore.

234
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,624
That day, he said many things
that showed his interest.

235
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,587
So I'm not sure how he feels.

236
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,387
She just said how she feels.

237
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,598
It wasn't about those two.

238
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,350
Won-ik kept bringing Gwan-hee up.

239
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,186
-There was no romance there.
-No.

240
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,691
PARADISE
KIM GYU-RI & CHOI MIN-WOO

241
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,485
That's a really nice boat.

242
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,736
I know, right?

243
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,196
Oh, the fenders.

244
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,158
One second.

245
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,745
That's quite a big gap.

246
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,499
Let's go.

247
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,838
Look at these. They're so cute.

248
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,591
There's a lot of food here.

249
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,636
-Do you want a glass?
-Sure.

250
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,805
-I'll pour you just a bit.
-Okay.

251
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,436
-My eyes…
-Be careful.

252
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,771
Okay.

253
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,897
Do they look fine?

254
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,536
You're good now.

255
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,914
It must've bothered you.

256
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,042
-There was a strand of hair there.
-Yes, it bothered me.

257
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,879
Something was bothering me.

258
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,424
He always finds something
on his date's face.

259
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,342
Whenever Min-woo is on a date,

260
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,888
he makes it look like a scene
in a romantic movie.

261
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,232
-It's so pretty.
-It is.

262
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,695
The view from Inferno
is actually quite pretty too,

263
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,906
-but this is different.
-Yes, it's different.

264
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,159
It really is.

265
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:16,498
After spending days in Inferno,
I've been living the dream recently.

266
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,125
Yesterday must've been fun.

267
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,129
You seemed brighter than usual.

268
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,258
I felt rather encouraged.

269
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,720
To be frank, I wasn't adjusting too well.

270
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,680
Everyone kept telling me

271
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,809
-that I was too reserved and quiet.
-I know.

272
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,771
So everyone got so curious about you.

273
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,730
I know.

274
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,148
How old are you?

275
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,316
-Me?
-Yes.

276
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,484
I'm 24.

277
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,110
Twenty…

278
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,447
She's taken aback.

279
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,658
He's the youngest one.

280
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,036
-Wait, you're 24?
-Yes.

281
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,996
-You were born in 2000?
-Yes, 2000.

282
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,289
The millennium.

283
00:15:59,083 --> 00:15:59,917
I see.

284
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,085
How old do I look?

285
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,921
I'm guessing around 25?

286
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,131
I'm 28.

287
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,508
You're 28?

288
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,386
Wait. Really?

289
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,889
You look much younger.

290
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,726
But age is just a number, right?

291
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,353
That's true.

292
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,771
It's just a number.

293
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,779
But you seem more at ease
compared to the first day.

294
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,864
-Really?
-Maybe it's because we've grown closer,

295
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,491
but you're more talkative now.

296
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,538
Did I stutter or something back then?

297
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,707
I wouldn't say you stuttered, but…

298
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,542
-Did I seem nervous?
-Yes.

299
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,880
I began talking more to people
I wanted to get to know,

300
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,216
so I feel a lot more comfortable now.

301
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,554
-It helped me adjust better.
-Right.

302
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,180
Who did you talk to so far?

303
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,518
I got to talk a bit with Si-eun.

304
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,770
And yesterday, with Min-ji.

305
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,022
-I see.
-Those two.

306
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,232
And the others? You didn't talk to them?

307
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,150
No.

308
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,570
That's about it.

309
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,240
You must be curious about the others.

310
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,450
Me?

311
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:20,039
I've already narrowed down
who I want to know better.

312
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,332
-It's not everyone.
-Who?

313
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,794
Who is that person?

314
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,879
-Who?
-Yes.

315
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,886
-You better answer wisely.
-Yes.

316
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,138
It might be better to stay silent.

317
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,725
-What about you?
-Me?

318
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,061
-Yes.
-Good job. Way to dodge a bullet.

319
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,980
For me, it's…

320
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,818
It's you.

321
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,737
-Me?
-Yes.

322
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,615
Why do you think I've brought you here?

323
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,209
-He's uncomfortable.
-He's in a pickle.

324
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,836
-You can tell by his face.
-He feels awkward.

325
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,964
I'm just really curious about you.

326
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,260
I felt something
from the moment I saw you.

327
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,974
Even though a few guys
have expressed interest in me

328
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,519
in a roundabout way,

329
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,146
there's no one I'm still curious about.

330
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,316
So in other words, I don't think…

331
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,361
There's no one that I'm really…

332
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,487
-Curious about?
-Right.

333
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,785
I told you I picked you on the first day.

334
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,702
Right.

335
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,707
And I picked you again
the day that Min-kyu joined us.

336
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,045
I'm only human,
so when I saw you leave with him,

337
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,880
I was obviously disappointed.

338
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,132
I see.

339
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,883
What about after that?

340
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,136
I tried to talk to you, but…

341
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,388
You tried to talk to me? Stop lying.

342
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,266
I'm saying I thought about it.
I really did.

343
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:06,061
But because of my personality,
I couldn't get around to it.

344
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,231
Then I kept missing
the right time again and again.

345
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,367
Since we already know how Min-woo feels,

346
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,079
it feels like the conversation
isn't really going anywhere.

347
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,044
-This view is breathtaking.
-Isn't it?

348
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,882
I've never been
to a place like this before.

349
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,059
Was there someone else
you wanted to come here with?

350
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,437
Are you bummed out

351
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,939
-What do you mean?
-that I picked you?

352
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,482
-Am I bummed out?
-Yes.

353
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,110
No, this is a great experience
and a good memory.

354
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,415
Min-woo isn't giving her
a positive answer.

355
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,542
Experience and memory?

356
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,295
She sensed something was off.

357
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,422
Gyu-ri picks things up quickly.

358
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,258
I was really curious about you.

359
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:26,767
If I don't click with someone
and I'm not interested in them,

360
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,311
I have no interest
in doing anything with them.

361
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,690
It's not like anyone will do,
so I've already…

362
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,442
Are there six guys in total?

363
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,694
The others are already…

364
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,739
off my list.

365
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,660
That's it.

366
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,058
Min-woo and Si-eun keep missing each other

367
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,977
even though they want to be together.

368
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,063
So nothing's really happening.

369
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,023
There's something there, but…

370
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,025
-Nothing certain happens.
-Yes, exactly.

371
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,819
But Gyu-ri made herself clear.

372
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,239
He may like Si-eun more,

373
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,075
but I think
he's still interested in Gyu-ri.

374
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,245
But I can tell Gyu-ri has
more feelings for Min-woo

375
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:32,082
than Min-kyu judging from her dates.

376
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,710
-She's leading the conversation too.
-Yes.

377
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,005
-I think she finds him cute, like a puppy.
-You're right.

378
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,340
PARADISE
YU SI-EUN & PARK MIN-KYU

379
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,009
This is tough.

380
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,594
It's so tough. Life can be so difficult.

381
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,347
I wonder how they're doing.

382
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,350
What do you think
Min-woo and Gyu-ri are doing right now?

383
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,227
Maybe they're in a spa?

384
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,939
-Spa…
-I wonder how things are there.

385
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:13,582
If I sense any kind of change
on our helicopter ride back,

386
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,667
I'd feel dispirited.

387
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,379
I think that's about it.

388
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,055
It wasn't this bad,

389
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,931
but the more I talk to you,

390
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:35,103
the more it feels like
I have a huge, one-sided crush on him.

391
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,063
-You?
-Yes.

392
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,691
Honestly, it wasn't this bad a while ago.

393
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,277
Paradise is great,
but time flies too quickly here.

394
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,120
It's as if I'm lovesick right now.

395
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,622
I must've rubbed off on you.

396
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,666
Yes, because I honestly think
he should meet other people

397
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,460
-so he won't regret anything.
-Right.

398
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,671
It might even make him realize
that he likes me more.

399
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,307
Spending time with her
will help him make up his mind.

400
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,893
-Are you confident though?
-Yes.

401
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,895
-That you're more attractive?
-Of course.

402
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,356
I think I'm way better.

403
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,608
I really do.

404
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,531
I feel like the older one.

405
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,577
Are you going to sleep?

406
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,163
I should.

407
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,416
Was today more fun than yesterday?

408
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:43,755
Yes, but we'd already spent
a night alone together in Inferno.

409
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,673
Right.

410
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:49,344
So I naturally felt more at ease with you.

411
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,390
-As for me,
-Yes?

412
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:57,561
I had so many questions about you,

413
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:01,106
and today's date really helped me
resolve all those curiosities.

414
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,816
-Really?
-Yes.

415
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,986
Was it the same for you too?

416
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,822
Yes, we talked a lot on the yacht.

417
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,578
It's nice to get a chance
to talk to you like this.

418
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,495
Yes.

419
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,415
I feel more comfortable around you now.

420
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:22,669
Then were you not
going to talk to me at all?

421
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,047
-Well--
-What if I hadn't brought you here?

422
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,050
To be frank, you've been busy too.

423
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:30,886
For real.

424
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,765
What is it?

425
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,934
You're so cute.

426
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,895
Gosh.

427
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,690
Good night.

428
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,734
You too, Min-woo.

429
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,165
Look at all those waves.

430
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,131
Let's run six to seven laps
from here to there.

431
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,424
-We're running?
-Yes.

432
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,259
-Come on.
-Let's go.

433
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,730
I'll have three bread rolls for breakfast.

434
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,482
And lots of milk for protein.

435
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,359
-Let's dip them in milk.
-Okay.

436
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,282
That was a good workout. We did our best.

437
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,200
We did.

438
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,284
Time to eat.

439
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,497
-We should wash the apples.
-Yes.

440
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,293
-Good morning.
-Hey.

441
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,421
-Good morning.
-Hey.

442
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,841
Is he drawing a line?
Did you hear that tone?

443
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,760
-Min-young's going to approach him.
-Yeah.

444
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,515
-Hello.
-It's my first alarm… No, I mean…

445
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,309
-It's my first breakfast in Inferno.
-Really?

446
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,019
Did the alarm go off? I missed it.

447
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,105
Really? Yes, I heard it.

448
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,815
-Apples?
-Yes.

449
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,275
Hey, rookie.

450
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,485
I can't really see properly.

451
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,948
Do you know why? I lost my contact lens.
It went down the sink.

452
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,324
So I only have one on.

453
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,868
-Did you see her wink?
-Exactly.

454
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,203
It's her thing.

455
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,497
-Really?
-She really knows what she's doing.

456
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,498
-She's good.
-She is.

457
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,875
-She's an expert.
-She really is.

458
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,419
That was so smooth.

459
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,255
It's not easy
to pull that off so smoothly.

460
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,383
I lost my contact lens.
It went down the sink.

461
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,718
So I only have one on.

462
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,595
Oh, no.

463
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,682
-Jin-seok just fell for her again.
-Yes, exactly.

464
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,393
My gosh.

465
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,568
-I want some water too. Good morning.
-Hi.

466
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,992
She winked at Jin-seok,
then sat next to Gwan-hee.

467
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,081
Something's in here.

468
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,583
What's in there?

469
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,668
Didn't I tell you? I can't see well.

470
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,171
-I…
-This is cool.

471
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,048
-Ha-jeong.
-Yes?

472
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,133
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

473
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,177
-Really?
-I guess I don't look so well.

474
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,428
Everyone's been asking.

475
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,679
You just seem so calm.

476
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,722
I seem calm?

477
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,391
I'm sorry, I'm usually this ladylike.

478
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:25,894
Sure.

479
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,440
-Come on.
-They don't know how she feels.

480
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,776
The sun is so strong.

481
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,861
-Yes.
-That's why it's called Inferno.

482
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,572
-You can hold on to me.
-Sure. Thank you.

483
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,532
It's hot.

484
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,369
-Is no one here?
-Get some rest in your room.

485
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,870
-See you later.
-Okay, see you.

486
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:44,788
Bye.

487
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,998
Everyone looks…

488
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,750
-Hi.
-How did it go? How was it?

489
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,336
-How was it?
-Tell us how it went.

490
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,462
I'm dying to know.

491
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,464
You look pretty as always.

492
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,673
What did you do?

493
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,884
What happened here? Did you guys have fun?

494
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,427
-Us?
-We went to bed right away.

495
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,012
-Really?
-We went to sleep early.

496
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,430
We didn't do much.

497
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,683
-We got on a yacht yesterday.
-Really?

498
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,894
-It must've been nice.
-That's awesome.

499
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,354
We watched the sunset.

500
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,397
You did?

501
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,440
-It was beautiful.
-That sounds wonderful.

502
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,358
It was.

503
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,902
So did you have a change of heart?

504
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,279
Pretty much the same?

505
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,323
It was more fun than I thought.

506
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,325
Yes.

507
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,119
At first, I thought…

508
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,539
You thought he'd be super quiet?

509
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,625
That was why I chose Min-kyu
the first time around

510
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,294
because I thought
I'd have more fun with him.

511
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,297
But now that we've become
more comfortable with each other,

512
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,467
and we had already
spent some time together before,

513
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,012
it turned out to be better
than I had expected.

514
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,224
It'd be more fun to go there
after you got close to the person.

515
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,434
Yes, I bet.

516
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,186
It was really great.

517
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,564
How was Gyu-ri?
How do you feel about her now?

518
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,528
I found a new side to her,
so it's become more complicated.

519
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:02,031
I was able to see
how bright and bubbly she actually is.

520
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,116
Oh, really?

521
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,034
So I had so much fun in Paradise

522
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,494
-with Gyu-ri.
-Really?

523
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,788
Were you interested in Gyu-ri at first?

524
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,206
Yes, in the beginning.

525
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,668
She was the one I picked
for the first impression vote.

526
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,879
But after I got here,

527
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,714
I saw how popular she was,

528
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,925
and I'm not the type
to strike up a conversation.

529
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,763
Then, she suddenly picked me,

530
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,265
so I got a chance
to talk to her for a long time.

531
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,143
Who did you like most until recently?

532
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,895
I wanted to get to know Si-eun.

533
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,855
-Si-eun?
-Yes, to be honest.

534
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,900
That time when we talked…

535
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,821
She was really honest about her feelings.

536
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,200
She took the initiative with me,

537
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,952
so I felt like we hit it off
and had good chemistry.

538
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,621
That's why.

539
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,956
How was everything?

540
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,708
-How was it? What did you do?
-Here?

541
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,418
-Yesterday…
-How was it in Inferno?

542
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,836
-Well, it was…
-Was it fun?

543
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,631
Well, as for the men…

544
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,341
Jin-seok seemed…

545
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,718
-Jin-seok?
-He was…

546
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,721
When we were eating,
I noticed that he was…

547
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,682
That he and Min-young are really close?

548
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,560
Everyone just seems
to think of them as a couple.

549
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,771
-Don't let that get to you.
-I know.

550
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:18,316
Right, I'll talk to him some more today,

551
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,486
and if I like him the most
among all the guys,

552
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,822
I'll just make him mine.

553
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,324
-Win him over.
-Yes, win him over.

554
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,242
Yes.

555
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,786
I had fun with Gwan-hee too.

556
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,248
As for Gwan-hee…

557
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,252
I thought he kept being curt with me
because he wasn't interested.

558
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,712
-How should I even put it?
-That's what he's like.

559
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,341
So I thought he had
already decided on someone.

560
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:48,054
I felt like he thought
I was getting in the way

561
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,849
when things were going well
between him and someone.

562
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,434
But it turns out that's just who he is.

563
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,855
It didn't seem like he was set on anybody.

564
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,275
The way he treats me is different
from how he treats others,

565
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,818
so I'm so confused.

566
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,819
You're right.

567
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:08,157
He never teased me
like he does with the others.

568
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,245
So that kind of confuses me.

569
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,665
Do you think Hye-seon had fun with Won-ik?

570
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,583
Probably.

571
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,335
Hye-seon likes Won-ik so much.

572
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,170
-What?
-What?

573
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,839
-What?
-What?

574
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,634
Does it seem that way to you?

575
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,095
Hye-seon definitely likes Won-ik.

576
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,557
-Really?
-She's always focused on him.

577
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,601
I can see she's really into him.

578
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,185
-Yes, seriously.
-It's obvious.

579
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:38,980
What?

580
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,773
-What?
-Really?

581
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,775
They're completely off the mark.

582
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,944
Why do they think that?

583
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,155
Let's say you're Won-ik, and I'm Hye-seon.

584
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,281
When they were eating…

585
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,619
-Really?
-And when he was chopping something…

586
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,413
You're so good at mimicking her.

587
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:56,789
You're so good.

588
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,125
-You're just like her.
-She's always like this.

589
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,586
So I kept watching her.

590
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,088
Do you also think that Hye-seon is…

591
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,467
Yes, I definitely picked it up
on the helicopter ride back.

592
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,177
-I'm certain.
-What did you notice?

593
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,887
How should I put this?

594
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,723
The way she looked at him
and the vibe she gave off.

595
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,934
The nonverbal cues and body language.

596
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,810
It's just a gut feeling.

597
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,772
Stop saying stuff you're not sure of.

598
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,150
-What gut feeling?
-That's what men are like.

599
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,660
-Man, I'm getting stressed out.
-I mean…

600
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,078
It was so obvious.

601
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,043
I'm so annoyed.

602
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,380
Men just don't get women, do they?

603
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,297
I don't think so.

604
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,216
How could they think so?

605
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,342
That was so random.

606
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,095
-I'm in shock right now.
-Where did that even come from?

607
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,721
We see everything from here.

608
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,473
-Right.
-But if you were there…

609
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,100
-You have a point.
-But even so…

610
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,520
I think Min-kyu
was just going along with it.

611
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,230
Ha-bin's the one who's mistaken.

612
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,399
He's way off the mark right now.

613
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,442
In a way, he's spreading fake news.

614
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,360
Seriously.

615
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:10,405
The problem is
that it's really rattling Gwan-hee.

616
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,739
-Yes.
-That's the problem.

617
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,324
-It's even worse.
-What now?

618
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,953
Gwan-hee's feelings
must be changing every single day.

619
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,123
-He's going to get swayed again.
-I can see it in his eyes.

620
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,836
What now?

621
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:31,926
Today, the men will play a game
to win a date in Paradise.

622
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,053
Gosh, come on.

623
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,516
Please go to the island on the other side.

624
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,059
The island on the other side?

625
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,355
-I wonder what we'll be doing.
-I have no clue.

626
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,109
What on earth could they
make us do on that island?

627
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,945
-I really can't guess.
-Right?

628
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,531
This hill is seriously…

629
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,367
What did I tell you?
This island is way worse.

630
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,121
-It's a long walk. Look.
-This is the real Inferno.

631
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,123
-The true Inferno.
-How was it here?

632
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,208
There are way too many hills here,

633
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,711
and all the roads are
dirt and gravel ones.

634
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,921
We're literally hiking.

635
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,090
-What's that?
-They're flags.

636
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,133
-Flags.
-Yes.

637
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,551
I wonder what the game is.

638
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,636
Oh, it's a race.

639
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,804
-A race?
-Gosh.

640
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,890
I guess it's a race from there to here.

641
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,808
I should've skipped the morning run.

642
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,815
This is crazy.

643
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,361
Singles.

644
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:37,325
Today, the men will be competing in a game
for a date in Paradise.

645
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,913
The top three contestants,
in order of rank,

646
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:45,833
will get to choose the women
they'd like to go to Paradise with.

647
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,047
I'm nervous.

648
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,384
-I think I'll lose.
-Here are the rules of today's game.

649
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,347
There are three flags on top of this hill.

650
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,308
At the sound of the signal,

651
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:07,396
the men will sprint from the starting line
toward the flags as fast as they can.

652
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,273
-My gosh.
-It's a race?

653
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,151
It's a race.

654
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,195
I wonder how far it is.

655
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,158
-My gosh.
-It's far.

656
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,244
-It's so far.
-It's almost like a marathon.

657
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,162
-It's a marathon.
-Really.

658
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,080
Seriously.

659
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,001
The first three men to seize the flags

660
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,839
will be placed first, second, and third.

661
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,967
This is a battle
between Min-kyu and Gwan-hee.

662
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,469
We've got ourselves a basketball player
and a coast guard.

663
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,138
-It seems so.
-But you know,

664
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,056
Ha-bin may be a professional runner.

665
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,266
-What?
-His job.

666
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,600
-His job?
-An athlete?

667
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,643
In track and field.

668
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,562
-It hasn't been revealed yet.
-Exactly.

669
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,314
He could be a professional runner
for some team.

670
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,236
They're running all at once?

671
00:35:59,031 --> 00:35:59,907
This is insane.

672
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,076
Jin-seok kept saying he was a bad runner.

673
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,288
He seems like the type
who's better at lifting weights.

674
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,664
I think Min-woo and…

675
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,457
-I think so too.
-Min-woo and Ha-bin.

676
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,793
Gwan-hee looks like
a professional athlete with his headband.

677
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,752
You're right.

678
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,756
Men, please walk over
to the starting point.

679
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,383
-Gosh.
-Let's go.

680
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,759
Is that the finish line?

681
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,887
-Good luck, guys.
-Thanks.

682
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,054
Don't get hurt.

683
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,474
This is a simple race,

684
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,436
-but their pride is at stake, right?
-You're right.

685
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,313
Plus, it's hard to run uphill.

686
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,566
Let's check out how the guys look
as they cross the finish line.

687
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,484
It's important.

688
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,820
-They can't show how tired they are.
-Precisely.

689
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,363
They need to play it cool.

690
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,931
Please start running
once you hear the signal.

691
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,766
Get ready.

692
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,063
-It must be tough to run this far.
-It's really far.

693
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,440
-You would know.
-Yes.

694
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,109
-We got off easy with our game.
-I know, right?

695
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,152
Get ready.

696
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,925
The three quickly took the lead.

697
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,393
-They're on their way.
-My gosh!

698
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,770
-Really?
-Oh, gosh.

699
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,021
-Gosh.
-I'm nervous.

700
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,940
-So am I.
-I can't watch this.

701
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,204
-He's really fast.
-Gwan-hee.

702
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,330
I knew he'd be good.

703
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,456
He's so fast.

704
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,589
-Ha-bin is in second place.
-Ha-bin?

705
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,800
-I told you he's an athlete.
-He's in second?

706
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,218
I bet he does track and field.

707
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,963
I can't do this.

708
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,090
My knees hurt.

709
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,468
Jin-seok.

710
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,595
-Good call, Jin-seok.
-It's okay.

711
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,721
It's all right.

712
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,682
-Save that energy to woo the women later.
-Yes.

713
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,450
-He just looked back!
-Hey!

714
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,911
-All right!
-Look at that confidence!

715
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,841
Ha-bin's tired. His legs are giving out.

716
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,635
Gosh, Ha-bin.

717
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,607
-It's a fight for third place. Oh, no.
-It's between Won-ik and Ha-bin.

718
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,652
-Come on, Ha-bin.
-Ha-bin, please.

719
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,830
They're almost here.

720
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,123
Do you see them?

721
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,833
-I wonder who will win.
-I can't watch this.

722
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,084
They're here already?

723
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,262
-I can hear them run.
-I hear them now.

724
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,638
I see orange shorts!

725
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,516
No, I was wrong.

726
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,725
I think it's Gwan-hee.

727
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,026
Gwan-hee.

728
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:50,823
That's so cool.

729
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,158
-That was cool.
-It was.

730
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,577
-It really was.
-That was pretty cool.

731
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,789
1ST PLACE: LEE GWAN-HEE

732
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,249
Gwan-hee.

733
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,421
He won by a wide margin.

734
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,548
2ND PLACE: PARK MIN-KYU

735
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,634
3RD PLACE: SON WON-IK

736
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,886
Won-ik did it again.

737
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,305
-He's quite athletic.
-He's good at most things.

738
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,764
It's because he's fit.

739
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,025
Great job, guys.

740
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,283
Jin-seok isn't here yet.

741
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,827
Is he walking?

742
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,078
What is Jin-seok doing?

743
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,788
-I think he's walking.
-He must be.

744
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,166
Really? I wonder if he's injured.

745
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,045
-Jin-seok.
-Oh, no.

746
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,546
He's taking a stroll.

747
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,841
-He should limp a little.
-Yes, he should blame it on his knees.

748
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,387
-He's really walking.
-Goodness.

749
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,597
He's really walking.

750
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,350
Jin-seok.

751
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,101
Good job!

752
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,189
I couldn't run because of my knees.

753
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,274
That's right. He said he had bad knees.

754
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,988
-What?
-Who did he wink at?

755
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,198
At Min-young?

756
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,118
My gosh.

757
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,788
Why did he wink at me?

758
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,665
-That's so cringe.
-What?

759
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,708
-What happened?
-Jin-seok winked at her.

760
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,252
I missed that.

761
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,130
They look so tired.

762
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,508
You guys are so fast.

763
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,593
-They're really fast.
-That was impressive.

764
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,391
I found his headband funny,
but then, he ran so fast.

765
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,560
I was quite impressed by him.

766
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,145
Gwan-hee is an athlete,

767
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,690
so I knew he would come in first.

768
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,527
It'd be nice to go to Paradise
with Gwan-hee…

769
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,280
But I'm not so sure about him yet.

770
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,243
Just who will Gwan-hee pick?

771
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,578
I can't even guess.

772
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,622
-He has a really important choice to make.
-Right.

773
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:08,752
Who he chooses today
will reveal who he is leaning toward.

774
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,963
-It will make things clear.
-You're right.

775
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,923
-They only have three days left.
-Right.

776
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,759
It'll be Hye-seon,
Ha-jeong, or Min-ji, right?

777
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:16,677
-Yes.
-Yes.

778
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,847
-He hasn't been to Paradise with Min-ji.
-That's right.

779
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,434
But he's heard a few things
that could change his mind.

780
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,562
Regardless of what he heard,

781
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,814
if Gwan-hee has feelings for Hye-seon,

782
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:32,151
he might talk to her in Paradise
and find out how she feels.

783
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:35,195
I doubt what he heard
will affect his decision.

784
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,197
-But…
-He seemed quite shaken up though.

785
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,742
-He was.
-He seemed shaken up by what he heard.

786
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,995
But if Gwan-hee chooses Min-ji
instead of Hye-seon,

787
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,331
I doubt Hye-seon
will give him another chance.

788
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,832
-I agree.
-You're right.

789
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,127
How will Ha-jeong feel
if he chooses Min-ji?

790
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,172
If that happens, it'll break my heart.

791
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,929
-Sit wherever you like.
-I want to sit in the shade.

792
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,891
-Sure.
-Right here.

793
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:04,933
What?

794
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,977
I'm glad they decided to talk.

795
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,022
Did you have fun in Paradise?

796
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,066
You looked like you had fun.

797
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,776
Fun?

798
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,694
It was more comfortable than fun.

799
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,698
I see. I'm glad you had a good time.

800
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:26,455
I actually wanted to talk to you
when you got back,

801
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,916
but it seemed like you didn't want to.

802
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,626
What are you talking about?

803
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,461
-You wouldn't look me in the eye.
-Me?

804
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,296
-Yes.
-I don't usually make eye contact.

805
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:39,593
Anyway, I took it as a sign
that you didn't want to talk to me.

806
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,762
No, I did think we needed to talk.

807
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,263
Well, that's how I took it.

808
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,265
What about now?

809
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,477
I knew you'd make that choice
when it was your turn to pick.

810
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,480
But when I saw you leave with Won-ik,

811
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,066
it occurred to me

812
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:58,070
that you might also want me
to choose someone else.

813
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:01,990
I'm serious. I thought there was a chance…

814
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,785
-I'd pick you?
-I thought there was a 10% chance.

815
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,995
Because of what I said before?

816
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,957
Yes, that was why I had that thought.

817
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,999
You're upset.

818
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,547
Do you remember when I got back
from Paradise with Ha-jeong?

819
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,384
I asked if you were bothered by it,
and you seemed like you were sulking.

820
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:25,055
So it felt like you wanted me to sulk
now that the tables had turned.

821
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:33,313
And the thing is, I asked around

822
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,482
a lot about you.

823
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,360
And everyone said

824
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,280
-that you had your eyes on Won-ik.
-Really?

825
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,198
-That was what they told me.
-Really?

826
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,700
So I was

827
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:46,952
quite shocked.

828
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,374
-So I…
-Are you serious?

829
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,544
Now that you're back from Paradise,

830
00:45:55,627 --> 00:46:01,008
I want to know how you honestly feel.

831
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,804
Well, I really don't know.

832
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,806
I know that he's a good person,

833
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,976
but I'm not sure if I'm attracted to him.

834
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,937
-You're not sure yet?
-No, I'm not.

835
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:20,486
When I was with him,
I didn't feel any chemistry between us.

836
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,030
I really don't know.

837
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,201
In my own way,
I tried to show you how I felt

838
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:31,288
when you fell during the game yesterday.

839
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,206
DURING WOMEN'S GAME YESTERDAY

840
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,373
There's something in your hair.

841
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,458
Your hair.

842
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,419
Hye-seon. Are you all right?

843
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,839
I didn't brush anything off
of Gyu-ri when she fell.

844
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,634
But when you fell,
I was the first one to run over.

845
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:47,387
It was my way of telling you
how I felt about you.

846
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,182
And it's something
only you would've noticed.

847
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,809
-Yes, I noticed it.
-Among the six of you,

848
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,811
only you would've noticed it.

849
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,064
So I was shocked to hear
what others thought.

850
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,817
In any case, I'm drawn to you the most.

851
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:06,406
When you fell during the game,
I was concerned about you.

852
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,160
Even when we eat,
if I feel like you're too quiet,

853
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,370
I get concerned.

854
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:17,042
That's how I feel about you.

855
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,504
I can't say I didn't notice any of that,

856
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,799
but I sort of wanted to play hard to get.

857
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,386
I guess I'm not too sure.

858
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,014
-I think I understand--
-What I do know is this.

859
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,434
Compared to Won-ik,

860
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,353
I have stronger feelings for you.

861
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,483
I noticed something.

862
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,821
I act differently when I talk to you
compared to when I talk to Won-ik.

863
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,366
Do you have more fun with him?

864
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,368
He's not the fun type.

865
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,953
But regardless,

866
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,623
I wouldn't mind you choosing Min-ji
or someone other than myself today.

867
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,292
Because…

868
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,210
What?

869
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,171
-She's confusing him again.
-She seems too confident.

870
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,757
Because we'll still
have a chance tomorrow.

871
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,343
-We can pick each other tomorrow.
-Tomorrow…

872
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,596
Are you saying
I should go with Min-ji today

873
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:14,099
and keep going with someone else

874
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,768
until we finally reunite on the last day?

875
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,437
Is that what you're saying?

876
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,063
We went together once,

877
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,108
so do you want to enjoy your time
and just meet in the end?

878
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,693
-What…
-Something like that.

879
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,695
-What are you saying?
-I mean…

880
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,072
-Don't you think you'll regret it?
-Regret what?

881
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:33,327
I assumed you'd go with Min-ji or Gyu-ri.

882
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,455
-Because…
-No, Gyu-ri isn't for me.

883
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,124
I told you I wanted to get to know her,

884
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,877
so I went and talked to her,
but that was it.

885
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,922
We had a chat, and that was enough for me.

886
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,466
I see.

887
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,469
Are you settling for me

888
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,846
because the others
don't seem right for you?

889
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,681
Do I look like that type?

890
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,058
No, not really.

891
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,684
-But still…
-Not at all.

892
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,062
-Really?
-Really.

893
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,193
I had no idea
he felt so strongly about Hye-seon.

894
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,487
He's gentle as a lamb around her.

895
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,907
-He is.
-He's really calm and doesn't joke around.

896
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,619
She said she wouldn't mind
if he went to Paradise with Min-ji.

897
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,454
Do you think she really meant that?

898
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:21,124
I think by saying that, she made it
more impossible to go with Min-ji.

899
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,503
There's something about Hye-seon
that's hard to explain.

900
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,838
It's hard to put into words.

901
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,548
-Her aura?
-She's very charismatic.

902
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,550
-Yes, you can feel it.
-You can.

903
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:34,304
That's why Gwan-hee
is trying not to cross that line.

904
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:38,308
Do you remember what they said
when they first went to Paradise together?

905
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,519
-They promised to meet in the end.
-Yes, exactly.

906
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,436
DAY 1 PARADISE

907
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,648
I'd appreciate it more if you told me
that even after meeting the others,

908
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,441
you still like me the best.

909
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,110
It'd be more genuine.

910
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,195
That goes for me as well.

911
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,364
So you want to reunite on the last day?

912
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:56,243
We can share the chocolate
they left us on the last day.

913
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,412
Here's my take.

914
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,707
-He hasn't been to Paradise with Min-ji.
-No.

915
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,627
So she could be saying they should
get to know everyone they're attracted to

916
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,630
and see if they'll still like each other.

917
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:12,509
It seems like she is quite confident.

918
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,764
When it comes to someone like Gwan-hee,
you shouldn't be too clingy

919
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,349
or open up too much.

920
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,809
-He'll find it boring.
-Right.

921
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,270
But you can't play too hard to get.

922
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,439
He doesn't like that either.

923
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,983
Hye-seon is doing a good job
keeping that balance.

924
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,445
-Hye-seon--
-She shows interest but plays hard to get.

925
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,404
-Right.
-Right?

926
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:37,951
Hye-seon may be playing her cards right
because she's figured him out.

927
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:41,580
Or it may be
that she's just not that into him.

928
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,123
You know what I think?

929
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,917
If he's someone that will change his mind

930
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,128
after one trip to Paradise,

931
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,755
-she may not want him.
-Right.

932
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,798
-Don't you think so?
-That could be it.

933
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,968
Gwan-hee must be so confused
after talking to Hye-seon.

934
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,220
-He must be.
-There are so many twists.

935
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,138
I'm totally hooked.

936
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,310
How are you doing?

937
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,020
-What about you?
-I'm doing good.

938
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,732
-Why did you want to talk?
-Because we need to.

939
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,026
Did you feel obligated?

940
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,527
No, it's not that.

941
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,614
"Look at the time.
I guess I should talk to Min-ji now."

942
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,115
-That's not it.
-Whatever.

943
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,867
You're upset.

944
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,535
-I'm not.
-You are.

945
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,621
I think you are quite upset.

946
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,709
-I felt a bit uncomfortable yesterday.
-Okay.

947
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,587
Out of everyone here,
I've gotten closest to you and Min-woo.

948
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,505
I see.

949
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:35,926
So I was relying on you two,
but Min-woo left, and you…

950
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,135
I was also--

951
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,514
I wanted to talk to you,
but it was hard to approach you.

952
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,058
You can talk to me.
They were just messing around.

953
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,019
I mean, no one's committed to anyone yet.

954
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:46,978
Right.

955
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,356
It seems like you are committed though.

956
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,984
I'm not committed to anyone right now.

957
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,111
They were just teasing me.

958
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,405
I told them too. You're the only one

959
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,158
I've been attracted to
other than Min-young.

960
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,410
I think they were surprised

961
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:06,581
because they haven't seen me
talk to anyone else.

962
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,708
I really haven't talked to anyone else.

963
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:12,087
I don't approach
someone I'm not attracted to.

964
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,422
I only talk to those I'm attracted to.

965
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,424
You're not attracted to the others?

966
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,052
-To be honest, no.
-Really?

967
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,555
I don't feel that attraction.

968
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:27,227
I'm not particularly attracted
to anyone else at this moment.

969
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,980
I'm not really the type to try.

970
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:34,317
-Are you trying to make me feel better?
-Of course I am.

971
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,736
-It's going to take you four days.
-I want to…

972
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,071
How many days do we have?

973
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:42,742
-You have to try until we leave.
-I'm trying to, but aside from that,

974
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,747
I personally find you attractive.

975
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,417
-I am attractive, right?
-You are?

976
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,210
-Gosh.
-That was smooth.

977
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:53,920
Did you see that?

978
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,464
She's mastered the art of flirting.

979
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,342
"I am attractive, right?"

980
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,760
It wasn't like that.

981
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,887
That wasn't it.

982
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,180
You lack the innocence she has.

983
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,018
Guys know when girls are just flirting,
but a wink like that

984
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,811
-shakes them up, right?
-Of course.

985
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,022
-Of course. Just look at him.
-Absolutely.

986
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:13,857
I am attractive, right?

987
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,025
-You are?
-I am.

988
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,447
I even told the girls

989
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,158
that I shouldn't care
and just pursue you again.

990
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,411
What? Can I not say that?

991
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,662
Of course you can.

992
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,164
Do you like talking to me?

993
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:30,624
I do like talking to you.

994
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,834
It's nice.

995
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,502
-Of course--
-It's fun, right?

996
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,046
Yes, it's fun to talk to you.

997
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,256
-I said a lot of good things about you.
-Really?

998
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,926
He seems a bit dazed.

999
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,594
Jin-seok is a bit out of it.

1000
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,015
-You're a good runner.
-Really?

1001
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:49,809
-You said you like running, right?
-Right.

1002
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,062
How do you feel about the win?

1003
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:55,231
It would've been nice
if I had ranked higher.

1004
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,905
I wanted to come in first.

1005
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,409
I would've been able
to have the first pick.

1006
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,327
That's true.

1007
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:12,832
You would have.

1008
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:17,128
I can tell that Si-eun
is trying to distance herself from him.

1009
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,422
She's really bad at hiding her emotions.

1010
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,633
-She's very different around him.
-She is.

1011
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,678
Did you expect the girls
who won first and second place

1012
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,806
to choose who they did yesterday?

1013
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,016
Yes, somewhat.

1014
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:33,979
Who would you have gone with
if you had placed first?

1015
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,188
-Me?
-Yes.

1016
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:40,110
I think I would've chosen
someone I haven't gone with.

1017
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,905
-I see.
-Yes.

1018
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,248
If I don't go with someone new,
I feel like I might regret it later

1019
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,375
-when we make our final decision.
-Right.

1020
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:59,504
Well… Yes, that's what I would've done.

1021
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,725
-Si-eun is very transparent.
-She is.

1022
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:15,186
-She may be telling him not to pick her.
-Right.

1023
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,439
-I see.
-I feel bad for Won-ik.

1024
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,316
They don't have much time left,
so I think it's better.

1025
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,359
You're right.

1026
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,488
I want to talk to both Si-eun and Gyu-ri.

1027
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,489
I see.

1028
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,160
Maybe I should talk to Gyu-ri now.

1029
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,287
Go ahead. I'll talk to Min-young too.

1030
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,457
There's no one else for me to talk to.

1031
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,916
-Is this Gyu-ri's room?
-Yes.

1032
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,170
Right now, Si-eun is trying to make sure

1033
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,964
-Won-ik doesn't get the wrong idea.
-You're right.

1034
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,800
-He should talk to Si-eun.
-What are you doing, Min-woo?

1035
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,802
-Come in.
-Come in.

1036
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:49,763
Look who's here.

1037
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,347
Is Gyu-ri in? Let's talk.

1038
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,227
Were you busy?

1039
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,271
Me? Was I busy?

1040
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,274
I was avoiding the heat.
Can you hold my hand for a second?

1041
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,237
-He held her hand.
-He held her hand.

1042
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,822
What if Si-eun sees this?

1043
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,699
No, she can't see this.

1044
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,077
Have fun.

1045
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,372
I want to come and watch.

1046
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:20,627
The shade is…

1047
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,212
This side looks better.

1048
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,129
Thanks.

1049
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,261
I like your outfit.

1050
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,763
-This?
-Yes.

1051
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:36,267
I really had a great time
chatting with you in Paradise.

1052
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:41,231
You've been on my mind ever since,
so I wanted to talk to you.

1053
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,319
-That trip must've been nice.
-It must've played a big part.

1054
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,948
-His mind changes just like that?
-Out of sight, out of mind.

1055
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,825
I guess that's the case.

1056
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,410
The timing is always off
with Min-woo and Si-eun.

1057
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,331
The Paradise I went to with you
was the most fun.

1058
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:01,793
The thing is…

1059
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,213
I get nervous whenever I talk to you.

1060
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,967
I become a lot more nervous
than I do around others.

1061
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,261
It's just how I feel.

1062
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,471
Me too.

1063
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,099
We really bonded a lot yesterday.

1064
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:19,018
-We did.
-Doesn't it feel different now?

1065
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,770
Compared to that time in Inferno…

1066
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,274
-Inferno?
-Yes, things do feel different now.

1067
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,900
Yes, I remember that day.

1068
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,736
I wasn't very talkative on the first day.

1069
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,238
-Right.
-You weren't either.

1070
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,323
I find you fascinating.

1071
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,493
I keep noticing different sides of you.

1072
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,913
And that sparks curiosity, right?

1073
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,498
Yes, you're right.

1074
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,627
I just can't help but feel nervous

1075
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,672
since you're so popular.

1076
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,966
-I'm not.
-I bet you'll go to Paradise again.

1077
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,093
-Do you think so?
-I just…

1078
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,721
I'd rather stay here today.

1079
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:55,722
-Really?
-Yes.

1080
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,602
-That was just…
-She's really expressing herself.

1081
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,687
I'd rather stay here today.

1082
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,230
-Really?
-Yes.

1083
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,611
I'd love it if you stayed here too.

1084
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,905
Then we'd get to chat some more.

1085
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:16,409
I mean, we're really running out of time.
There's not much time left.

1086
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:20,246
So I'm going to be more honest
about my feelings now.

1087
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,958
Sometimes you need to be.

1088
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,627
-Right?
-Yes, right.

1089
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,088
I'm not saying this because
you might leave for Paradise.

1090
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,006
Okay.

1091
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,927
I just wanted to make good use
of the little time we have left.

1092
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,640
-Gyu-ri's gaze is intense.
-Seriously.

1093
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:42,519
She has a different kind of charisma
compared to Min-ji.

1094
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,437
She's looking at him intently.

1095
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,898
But I'm not so sure.

1096
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,192
Do you really think I'll go?

1097
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,818
It's just my guess.

1098
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,070
What if I end up going?

1099
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,071
If you go?

1100
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,617
What can I do?
It's not like I can stop you.

1101
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,952
I can't beg you to stay.

1102
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,874
If I end up going, stay put and lie low.

1103
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,459
Of course I will.

1104
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,254
We're all stuck here.
We'll probably just eat.

1105
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,339
Don't do anything funny.

1106
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,258
If you end up going?

1107
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,221
She's telling him
not to talk to other women.

1108
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,138
-Right.
-Yes.

1109
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,976
It looks like Min-woo is
completely drawn to Gyu-ri.

1110
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,269
-Yes, after Paradise.
-Yes.

1111
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,937
-He really likes her.
-Yes, Paradise.

1112
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,524
He beat around the bush
and didn't express his feelings.

1113
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,110
But now,
he even called her out for a chat.

1114
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,903
He had feelings for Si-eun,

1115
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:37,782
but it now looks like he's set on Gyu-ri
after their trip to Paradise.

1116
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,284
-Right?
-What did it?

1117
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,410
The bedtime talk?

1118
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,370
-I think that was it.
-Right?

1119
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,913
They seemed to have more fun

1120
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,541
talking before bed
than they did on the yacht.

1121
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,126
And while they were talking,

1122
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,587
Min-woo kept tossing and turning.

1123
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,089
He kept putting the blanket
between his legs

1124
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,133
then covering them back.

1125
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,050
Right.

1126
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,886
It just seemed so strange to me,
but now I get it.

1127
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,347
-It was because he liked her so much.
-Exactly.

1128
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,849
-The blanket…
-He felt giddy.

1129
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,935
Yes, and while he was feeling that way,
Gyu-ri suddenly said,

1130
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,895
-"You're so cute."
-Exactly!

1131
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,399
-That's what she said.
-My gosh.

1132
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,985
-Gosh.
-This is how Gyu-ri talks.

1133
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,237
"Really?"

1134
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,155
Right.

1135
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,323
"Have you eaten yet?"

1136
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,451
"You're so cute."

1137
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,621
She has a way of melting your heart
when she talks.

1138
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,997
This is just too much.

1139
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,999
But this is pretty insane.

1140
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:30,877
-Min-woo is head over heels for her.
-I know.

1141
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,379
-He's mesmerized.
-Yes, he's gone head over heels.

1142
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,339
She got him good.

1143
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,759
Min-kyu. He's like a puppy too.

1144
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,719
Yes, his eyes are set on Gyu-ri.

1145
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,220
Let's go inside.

1146
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,640
Let's talk while I curl my hair
in my room.

1147
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,434
-Is that okay?
-What do you want to talk about?

1148
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:49,354
-What good is it sitting out here? Come.
-Okay, fine.

1149
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,273
Curl her hair?

1150
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,567
-It's time to talk strategy.
-Right.

1151
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,572
What was that big sigh for?

1152
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,033
I don't know how…

1153
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:05,203
Because it feels like
Gyu-ri is going back and forth

1154
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,579
between you and Min-woo?

1155
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:09,332
It's so obvious!

1156
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:10,792
She's being swayed.

1157
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,752
-So is that why?
-Yes.

1158
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,547
Then you should be a man
and do something about it.

1159
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,925
It might make her feel uncomfortable.

1160
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,969
No, even if that's the case,
at least you won't regret it.

1161
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,471
-Right.
-Yes.

1162
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,682
Who are you set on?

1163
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:26,933
-Me?
-Yes.

1164
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,267
Ha-bin, right?

1165
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,268
No, it's Gwan-hee.

1166
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:30,728
What?

1167
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,855
-Seriously?
-Yes.

1168
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,483
If I want something, I go for it.

1169
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:36,401
I see.

1170
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,319
So I told him too.

1171
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,574
-You're really the best.
-Why?

1172
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,954
Yes, it's better to tell him
before someone starts spreading fake news.

1173
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,914
-They're both set on one person.
-Right.

1174
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,792
Will you catch that fly for me?

1175
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,671
How do you expect me to catch a fly?
With what?

1176
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,590
-They're fast, unlike mosquitoes.
-Catch the fly, will you?

1177
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,300
It suddenly came inside.

1178
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,763
-She's here.
-She's back.

1179
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,558
Look at that smile on your face.

1180
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:11,477
-Hi.
-Hi, am I interrupting?

1181
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,395
-No.
-No.

1182
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:15,231
-I told him to watch me do my hair.
-I got kidnapped.

1183
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,774
Yes, I invited him in.

1184
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,318
I had to curl my hair,
so I told him to watch.

1185
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,446
-I was bored.
-Is it hot?

1186
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,072
It is.

1187
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,909
-You look more sunburnt today.
-Me?

1188
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,828
-I've been getting so sunburnt.
-Hey, wait.

1189
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,246
There's a fly in our room.

1190
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,247
I'm way too sunburnt.

1191
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,124
-I'll catch it for you later.
-Really?

1192
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,752
When I asked you,
you told me you couldn't.

1193
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,546
You're so willing to catch it
now that Gyu-ri is here.

1194
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,341
-He offered to catch it for her.
-This is fun.

1195
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,761
-You said you couldn't.
-I just tried to be sweet.

1196
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,138
Like I said, flies are too fast.

1197
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:49,557
-Unbelievable.
-Did you have to comment on that?

1198
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,434
You never let things slide.

1199
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,979
-You're unbelievable.
-You look way better with wavy hair.

1200
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,564
-Really?
-Gyu-ri, can we chat?

1201
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,107
Let's talk in the other room.

1202
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,942
-No one's there.
-There's an empty room?

1203
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,236
Our room is probably empty.
No one was there.

1204
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,529
Really?

1205
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,865
Is my face that sunburnt? That's not good.

1206
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,158
Yes, you're pretty sunburnt.

1207
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,411
Hey, get the fly before you leave.

1208
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,704
Where is it?

1209
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:13,873
Let me go chat, please.

1210
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:17,168
Gosh, just…

1211
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,795
Figure it out yourself.

1212
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,255
-Bye.
-Are you serious?

1213
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,299
-I'll help you later.
-You're just awful.

1214
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,177
-My gosh, Ha-jeong.
-What's with her hair?

1215
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,386
-Oh, no.
-She's so cute.

1216
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,305
-She messed up her hair.
-Seriously.

1217
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,226
She's really something.

1218
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,061
-She's adorable.
-She really is.

1219
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:41,442
If you'd made it
to the top three in today's race,

1220
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,985
who would you have picked?

1221
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,490
I can't decide.

1222
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,658
Between the two?

1223
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,618
Yes, at the moment.

1224
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,577
Really?

1225
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,038
You must've had fun yesterday.

1226
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,164
It was great.

1227
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,250
Is that why? Did it have a big impact?

1228
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,292
Yes, very much.

1229
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,336
That's why Paradise is a big deal.

1230
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,589
-You should go with Si-eun too.
-Yes, that'll help you decide.

1231
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,091
Then I should've won.

1232
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,008
Right?

1233
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,094
-They're all so athletic.
-Exactly.

1234
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,679
-He's so cute.
-Look at Jin-seok.

1235
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,889
He looks super athletic,
but he didn't win.

1236
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,475
-You're right.
-They're finally back.

1237
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,311
-Isn't the sun too strong?
-It is.

1238
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:21,607
What are you up to?

1239
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,234
-Just chatting.
-Matching colors.

1240
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,443
-Are you having fun?
-Yes.

1241
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:27,029
Without me? How could you?

1242
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,448
Do you want to chat?

1243
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,536
You're leaving as soon as you're back.
Have fun.

1244
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:36,038
-She looks so happy.
-She looks different.

1245
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,374
-She's so into him.
-Oh, dear.

1246
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,501
-See you guys later.
-Bye.

1247
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,419
Have fun.

1248
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,170
-I can send everyone off.
-Really?

1249
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,882
I should've just gone over
to ask you to chat there.

1250
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:47,800
-I know.
-They're so cute.

1251
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,135
This is embarrassing.

1252
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,178
-How cute.
-He's finally talking more.

1253
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,471
He's adorable.

1254
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,892
We're wearing the same color.

1255
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:56,809
You're right.

1256
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,729
-What?
-What took you so long to ask?

1257
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:03,024
Won-ik kept you all to himself.

1258
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,070
So did you have fun yesterday?

1259
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:09,864
-Me?
-Yes.

1260
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,490
What do you think?

1261
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,870
-Are you making fun of me?
-No, not at all.

1262
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,496
Come on. I would never.

1263
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,832
-How was it?
-What?

1264
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,209
Nothing much.

1265
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,253
I just talked and stuff.

1266
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,254
Did you have fun?

1267
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,715
Yes, I guess.

1268
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:30,676
I'm sure you also had fun.
After all, it's Paradise.

1269
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,553
-Us?
-Yes.

1270
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:35,806
We both just talked about
what was on our minds.

1271
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,434
-So you talked a lot?
-Yes, we talked a lot.

1272
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,395
I had no idea
we'd end up playing a game today.

1273
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,814
Yes, I'm sure you wanted to win.

1274
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,442
They were all too good.

1275
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,277
-Really?
-Yes, they all run so fast.

1276
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,779
You're smiling a lot today.

1277
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,365
-Today?
-Yes. You look way better when you smile.

1278
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,241
Thanks. You have a nice smile too.

1279
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:55,910
The way your lips perk up.

1280
01:05:58,579 --> 01:05:59,413
Thanks.

1281
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,999
Did you have a good talk with Won-ik?

1282
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,376
Yes.

1283
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,545
I guess you'll probably go today.

1284
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,132
-I think you'll end up going.
-Our timing was off again.

1285
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,093
We're short on time again today.

1286
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:13,052
Today?

1287
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,391
-Yesterday--
-We don't have that many days left.

1288
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:19,725
I know. You're right.

1289
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,646
We're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1290
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,440
Gosh. Let's go.

1291
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,401
We're out of time.

1292
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:30,486
Let's go.

1293
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,949
Gosh, let them talk for a bit longer.

1294
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:37,910
-Time isn't on their side.
-Are they doing this on purpose?

1295
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,001
I'm back.

1296
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,965
-I think you'll go with Won-ik.
-What?

1297
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:52,967
I think you're going to Paradise.

1298
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,261
-With whom?
-What's wrong?

1299
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,846
-What? With Won-ik?
-Are you crying?

1300
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:57,763
No.

1301
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,306
Oh, no. What happened?

1302
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,225
What's going on?

1303
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,811
-She's crying?
-She must be upset.

1304
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:05,730
-Exactly.
-She must be upset.

1305
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:06,939
Yes, really.

1306
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,107
Oh, no.

1307
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,402
I don't want to go out for this.

1308
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,989
-You should cry here.
-Okay.

1309
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,373
Don't be upset.

1310
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,752
-I'll go over there.
-Okay.

1311
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:35,926
I didn't think I'd end up crying here.

1312
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,386
But you're still crying.

1313
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:40,139
What is it? Is it frustrating?

1314
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:43,809
Well, we were given time to talk,

1315
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,145
-so I went and talked to him.
-Who?

1316
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:47,730
Won-ik.

1317
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,442
After that, I talked to Min-woo.

1318
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:55,321
-Are you torn between them?
-I wouldn't call it that.

1319
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,073
It's not about making a decision.

1320
01:07:57,156 --> 01:08:00,284
I just want a chance to talk,
but our timing's always off.

1321
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:04,955
When you talk to someone, you know
whether to keep pushing forward with them.

1322
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,041
I really don't want to…

1323
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,376
You don't want to go?

1324
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,337
-I want to get some rest.
-I see.

1325
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,131
It's just frustrating. That's all.

1326
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:24,266
But I don't think
Won-ik will choose Si-eun today.

1327
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,726
-What if he does?
-He won't.

1328
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,478
-I think…
-I know it.

1329
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:30,064
-That's just what you want.
-No, seriously.

1330
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:32,108
-He caught on to how Si-eun feels.
-Right.

1331
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:36,320
I think he understood what she meant
when they were talking earlier.

1332
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:37,905
He seems quick on the uptake.

1333
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:42,701
But will he still take her to Paradise
and try his best to win her heart?

1334
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,495
Or will he respect her feelings?

1335
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,580
-That's for Won-ik to decide.
-Yes.

1336
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:49,291
I hope Won-ik takes Ha-bin.

1337
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,293
-Seriously.
-Me too.

1338
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,671
-Take Ha-bin instead.
-You're so mean.

1339
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:55,756
-They should go and get hammered.
-Exactly.

1340
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,716
And talk about how they really feel.

1341
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,468
The winner gets to choose first.

1342
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,345
-Yes, Gwan-hee.
-Out of the three…

1343
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:03,639
No. Who will he choose between the two?

1344
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:04,682
Hye-seon.

1345
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:05,975
-Hye-seon?
-Yes.

1346
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:09,228
The Gwan-hee we know
would normally choose Min-ji.

1347
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,565
Hye-seon was totally cool
about him choosing Min-ji.

1348
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,108
She was too cool about it.

1349
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:16,152
Gwan-hee was taken aback by it.

1350
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,528
I think it got to him.

1351
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,781
Will they really
eventually end up together?

1352
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:23,033
-Seriously.
-He goes with Min-ji this time.

1353
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,202
And they choose each other
for the last one.

1354
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:28,622
This is unimaginable for me.

1355
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:32,293
I'm dying to find out.

1356
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:37,840
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1357
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,979
Starting with Lee Gwan-hee,
who came in first,

1358
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:56,400
please select the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

1359
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,069
I'm dying to find out.

1360
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,779
-I wonder who it'll be.
-Me too.

1361
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,540
Who do you think Gwan-hee will pick?

1362
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:12,625
-I think…
-Min-ji?

1363
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,710
He'll probably pick Min-ji.

1364
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:16,045
Or maybe Hye-seon.

1365
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,546
Either Min-ji or Hye-seon.

1366
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,558
The person I'd like to go

1367
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,394
to Paradise with is…

1368
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,358
I think

1369
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:39,401
I like you the most.

1370
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:40,736
-Me?
-Yes.

1371
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,322
During my time here…

1372
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:47,159
You've had the biggest impact on me

1373
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,496
and made me feel
a lot of different emotions.

1374
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:55,125
Why didn't you show me how you felt?

1375
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,878
If I was talking to another woman--

1376
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,756
I'd still approach you and ask to chat.

1377
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:03,050
I'm curious about your job now.

1378
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:03,968
Me?

1379
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,973
-I told you I like to be honest, right?
-Yes.

1380
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,975
I still find you the most attractive.

1381
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,393
-Me?
-Yes.

1382
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:15,271
In any case, I'm drawn to you the most.

1383
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:20,859
When you fell during the game,
I was concerned about you.

1384
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,486
That's how I feel about you.

1385
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,533
The person I'd like to go

1386
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,119
to Paradise with is…

1387
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,793
I can be myself when I'm with you.

1388
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,378
I'm not faking anything now.

1389
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,088
It feels different this time around.

1390

NEXT EPISODE

1391
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,258
Everything's up to you now.

1392
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:47,553
I could end up with the person I like
if I keep trying.

1393
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,805
I'll clear things up for you.

1394
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:52,099
Are you going to bed?

1395
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:54,935
Is it nice?

1396
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:58,480
Paradise didn't mean much to me.
But it feels completely different today.

1397
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,857
I felt something special.

1398
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:03,444
I had the hardest time
trying to figure you out.

1399
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:05,904
It was hard to really be sure.

1400
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:07,906
Want to sleep in the same bed?

1401
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,284
Okay.

1402
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,621
NEXT EPISODE

1403
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,915
Am I a decent woman?

1404
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,834
Yes, you're definitely attractive.

1405
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,462
I missed you a bit.

1406
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:25,632
Will you look at me?
You won't look at me anymore.

1407
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,968
A little bit of tension
is necessary for you.

1408
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:31,221
There was someone else
I wanted to talk to.

1409
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,682
But after this conversation,
I decided not to.

1410
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,977
I'm closer to making my final decision.

1411
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:39,271
I think I'm all good now.

1412
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:13,305
