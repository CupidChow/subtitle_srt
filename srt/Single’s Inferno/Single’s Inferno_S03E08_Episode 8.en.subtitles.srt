1
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,061
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,357
The person I'd like to go

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,193
to Paradise with is…

4
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,825
Cho Min-ji.

5
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,787
-I told you.
-I knew he'd pick Min-ji.

6
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,248
-Jin-kyung, you should've known.
-Exactly.

7
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,207
You're right.

8
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,086
For a moment there,
I forgot who we were dealing with.

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,963
It just slipped my mind.

10
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,631
-It's Gwan-hee.
-Right.

11
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,383
-He hasn't been there with her.
-It's Gwan-hee.

12
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,843
-It's Gwan-hee.
-He needs this.

13
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,387
-He does.
-Sorry. I thought it was another Gwan-hee.

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,889
But it was Lee Gwan-hee.

15
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,059
Lee Gwan-hee has selected

16
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,477
Cho Min-ji.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,394
I knew it!

18
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,605
Cho Min-ji,
please hold Lee Gwan-hee's hand

19
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,315
-and leave for Paradise.
-Have fun!

20
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,567
-Have fun there.
-I'll talk to him a lot

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,694
and ask him about his job and age.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,197
Hye-seon managed to keep a smile on.

23
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:17,077
I think he might have
let go of his feelings for Hye-seon.

24
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,870
-Who? Gwan-hee?
-Yes.

25
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,546
-Oh, dear.
-Poor Ha-jeong.

26
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,548
-That's a normal response.
-Right.

27
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,592
I'm sure they're both disappointed.

28
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,892
Which way do we go?

29
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,644
Let's go.

30
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,775
Thank you.

31
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,819
Let's go.

32
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,736
My gosh!

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,654
Let's go.

34
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,452
-Are we supposed to hold hands?
-Yes, let's do that.

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,288
Hold onto my thumb.

36
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,623
Your thumb? Okay.

37
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,002
You didn't expect to go with me, did you?

38
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,295
No, I had no idea.

39
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,804
Hye-seon started it
by going to Paradise with Won-ik.

40
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:22,642
So I just returned the favor
by giving her a taste of her own medicine.

41
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:26,646
I think this trip to Paradise
will set things straight

42
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:31,401
between me and Min-ji
as well as with Hye-seon.

43
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,404
Was there ever a participant
who got to know all the women?

44
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,531
-It's impressive.
-But he won't regret it.

45
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,907
-Right.
-No regrets at all.

46
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,285
-He's enjoyed every minute.
-I see no regret.

47
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,123
Next is Park Min-kyu, who came in second.

48
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,461
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

49
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,715
He'll probably choose Gyu-ri.

50
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,634
Wait. It might not be her.

51
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,430
Kim Gyu-ri.

52
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,600
Right, of course.

53
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,227
Kim Gyu-ri.

54
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,937
-See you.
-Kim Gyu-ri,

55
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,231
-Have fun.
-please hold Park Min-kyu's hand

56
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,482
and leave for Paradise.

57
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,776
This is interesting.

58
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,530
It's a shame
I can't hang out with you all.

59
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,617
-Don't say things like that.
-Sorry.

60
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,452
That's called a happy dilemma.

61
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,369
Bye.

62
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,662
-Goodbye.
-See you guys.

63
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,084
Things just got complicated.

64
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,095
Let me take your hand.

65
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,430
Let's go.

66
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,476
Can I hold your other hand?

67
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,394
Sorry.

68
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,774
I really wanted to come in first.

69
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,067
I'm sorry that I didn't.

70
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,444
It's basically the same.

71
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,614
Right, it wouldn't matter
as long as I could pick you.

72
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:05,370
There was a part of me
that wanted to talk to Min-woo.

73
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,748
So I thought it was a bit of a shame

74
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,126
that I couldn't stay behind this time.

75
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,588
Lastly, we have Son Won-ik,
who came in third.

76
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:22,220
Son Won-ik, please select the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

77
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,016
It's Won-ik.

78
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,103
-This is an important decision.
-Yes, it is.

79
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,608
He'll definitely choose you
since Min-woo's here. If he wasn't…

80
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,526
I don't know.

81
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,403
There could've been a small chance,

82
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,863
but as long as Min-woo is here,
he'll choose you.

83
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,118
I'm so nervous.

84
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,745
My heart actually hurts.

85
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,751
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

86
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,046
He might choose her.

87
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,144
Yu Si-eun.

88
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,772
-Right.
-I knew it.

89
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,441
-He has no other choice.
-Right.

90
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,985
-Their timing is always off.
-Oh, dear.

91
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,241
Son Won-ik has selected Yu Si-eun.

92
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,785
Yu Si-eun.

93
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:32,332
Yu Si-eun, please hold Son Won-ik's hand
and leave for Paradise.

94
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,292
Try to enjoy yourself.

95
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,293
Okay. I'll try.

96
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,627
-Let's talk tomorrow.
-Okay.

97
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,255
You have the whole room
to yourself, so sleep well.

98
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,633
No surprises this time.

99
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,844
None at all.

100
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,182
I was hoping either Gyu-ri
or Si-eun would stay behind.

101
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,896
You know what?
He's a male version of Cho Min-ji.

102
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,272
Come on.

103
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,859
Jin-kyung, you don't place
all your bets on one person here.

104
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,528
-Come on, it's not illegal.
-I'm sorry.

105
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,573
-He's just human.
-I got too worked up.

106
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:34,685
Did you ever expect
to go to Paradise with me twice?

107
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,021
-Did you?
-No, not at all.

108
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,232
-I know, right? And yesterday,
-Right.

109
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,735
we wouldn't have been able to go
even if you had won first place.

110
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,656
Jeez, this is just…

111
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,492
But this is what's best for Won-ik.

112
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,827
-You're right.
-Absolutely.

113
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,499
Anyway, Min-woo has feelings
for both Si-eun and Gyu-ri,

114
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,626
-but they're both gone.
-Right.

115
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,087
We won't hear a peep from Min-woo today.

116
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,548
This round of Inferno
is the real deal for him.

117
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,091
-Yes.
-Right.

118
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,884
The weather is amazing.

119
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,469
-I know, right?
-Right.

120
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,682
What?

121
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,394
After what you did yesterday…

122
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,271
What are you talking about?

123
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,188
Jeez.

124
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,491
-What?
-What?

125
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,788
I don't know anymore.

126
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,998
About what?

127
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,709
You meanie.

128
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,420
-No, you are a meanie.
-Why is that?

129
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,256
-I badmouthed you yesterday.
-You did? What did you say?

130
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,718
I expressed my feelings as you said,
but now you say I shouldn't.

131
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,635
So frustrating.

132
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,345
What? When did I…

133
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,346
Jeez.

134
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,766
-That's not what I meant.
-Okay.

135
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,194
Oh, come on!

136
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,403
What?

137
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,697
What is it? What did I do?

138
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,533
What's going on?

139
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,494
-I think he likes Min-young too.
-Right.

140
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,411
Yes.

141
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,330
Stop sulking.

142
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,331
I'm not sulking.

143
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,415
Yes, you are.

144
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,374
-Me?
-Yes.

145
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,376
-I'm really not.
-Really?

146
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,836
What's there to sulk about?

147
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,921
I don't know.

148
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,589
Stop saying you don't know.

149
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,924
What's bothering you?

150
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,675
-Nothing.
-Then, what is it?

151
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,472
Let's make up then.

152
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,473
We already did.

153
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,058
I'm not upset or anything.

154
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,686
My point was it'd be good
to talk to lots of people,

155
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,688
-which is why I told you to do so.
-Okay.

156
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,482
-Right.
-I see.

157
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,068
I'm not interested in anyone.

158
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,362
Except for you.

159
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,741
You're all everyone talks about.

160
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,742
-Me?
-Yes.

161
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,494
They're all fans of yours.

162
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,411
-Really?
-Yes.

163
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,955
They all set me straight.

164
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,915
Good. You needed that.

165
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,041
How come?

166
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,502
Why?

167
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,672
You were so confused in the beginning.

168
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,881
No, I wasn't!

169
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,508
-I kept--
-That's what you said.

170
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,552
I kept telling you the whole time.

171
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,929
I'm going to talk to everyone now.

172
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,180
Fine, then. Go ahead.

173
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,100
Do whatever you want.
I'll see how it goes.

174
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,309
I'll talk to everyone.

175
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,644
Go right on ahead.

176
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,688
Okay, you've consented.

177
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,273
I take it back.

178
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,941
You can only hang out with me.

179
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,361
Why are you being like this?

180
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,904
It'll depend on you.

181
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,656
Here you go again.

182
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,949
I'm playing hard to get.

183
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,200
You're doing it weird.

184
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,618
-Why is it weird?
-It just is.

185
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,786
I'm doing it wholesomely.

186
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:39,829
No, you aren't.

187
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,962
Min-young seems more composed now.

188
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,339
-She's cute.
-Yes.

189
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:56,137
-I want to go on a trip with you.
-Yes. Same here.

190
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,473
-I could've gone if I'd won today.
-I know, right?

191
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,058
I might've not gone with you.

192
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,560
I'm leaving now.

193
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,978
All right. I'm sorry.

194
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,522
Seriously, stop saying stuff like that.

195
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,566
What if I didn't pick you?

196
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,026
-If you didn't pick me?
-Yes.

197
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,069
I would've said, "He's so dead."

198
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,738
"What's the matter with him?"

199
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,824
"Seriously, what's wrong with him?"

200
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,659
You're so annoying.

201
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,871
I have a love-hate relationship with you.

202
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,289
-A love-hate relationship?
-Yes.

203
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,881
Gosh, Min-young.

204
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:39,055
Min-young is finally starting
to express herself more directly.

205
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,682
She kept beating around the bush before.

206
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,352
But now, she's being very clear.

207
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,187
-The tables have turned now.
-Yes.

208
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,438
-I agree.
-You're right.

209
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,523
Before this, Jin-seok was at a loss.

210
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,777
But now, Min-young is the one
who doesn't know what to do.

211
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,447
After making that mistake
with the candy vote…

212
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,574
-She's suffering the consequences.
-She is.

213
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,951
I've noticed a comfortable attraction

214
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,538
between Jin-seok and Min-ji
when they're together.

215
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,415
But he also enjoys spending time

216
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,708
-with Min-young.
-Right.

217
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,585
-I think that's confusing him.
-Yes.

218
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,629
Maybe it's because she was his first.

219
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,880
-Don't you think?
-Right.

220
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,131
-Yes.
-I agree.

221
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,386
PARADISE
LEE GWAN-HEE & CHO MIN-JI

222
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,721
Enjoy your meal.

223
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,473
Bon appétit.

224
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,101
Is this ricotta cheese?

225
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,979
It feels weird eating good food
because it's been so long.

226
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,273
I know, right?

227
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,775
We should get used to it.

228
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,985
Actually, we shouldn't.

229
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,363
We'll get depressed
when we return to Inferno.

230
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,489
Right.

231
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,453
Eating the food here makes me…

232
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,579
It makes you happy?

233
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,790
It makes me think of Jin-seok and Ha-bin.

234
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,252
It's nice that you're thinking of them.

235
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,421
I'm worried about them.

236
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,381
I see.

237
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,342
Only one person is left in our room.
Like me yesterday.

238
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,760
Who's alone today?

239
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,804
-It's Hye-seon.
-I see.

240
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,308
The three of us have never slept together.

241
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:17,153
I came to Paradise
on my first and second day,

242
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,363
-and I couldn't really eat then.
-I see.

243
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,490
But it feels different this time around.

244
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,493
Is that when you came with Ha-jeong?

245
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,745
That was with Hye-seon.

246
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,329
-With Hye-seon?
-Yes.

247
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,539
I see.

248
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,374
And then Ha-jeong?

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,501
-Yes.
-I see.

250
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,465
The food tastes better today, right?

251
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,841
Yes. Absolutely.

252
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,093
I think I can eat a lot tonight.

253
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,970
Let's eat a lot, then.

254
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,433
By the way, don't you have
any questions for me?

255
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,810
I already know.

256
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,604
What? You don't know anything.

257
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,650
You're wrong.
Whatever it is you're thinking is wrong.

258
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,653
-Ask me.
-You're 27, right?

259
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,655
Twenty-seven.

260
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,948
No, I'm not.

261
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,158
Then, are you 26?

262
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,870
-You're 26?
-Yes.

263
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,997
-The Year of the Tiger.
-Wait, then…

264
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,458
So you were born in 1998.
When's your birthday?

265
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,294
What?

266
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,796
Wait. Were you born in 1998?

267
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,255
Well, I mean…

268
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,757
I don't know.

269
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,425
What do you mean?

270
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,677
When were you born?

271
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,596
-What month were you born?
-April.

272
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,431
April what?

273
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,475
April 20th.

274
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,851
-April 20th?
-Yes.

275
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,395
I see. I was born in April too.

276
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:34,772
April 1998?

277
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,857
Is it April 1998?

278
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,275
My birthday is April 29th.

279
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,236
So I'm older than you.

280
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,197
Hey, you. Bring me some water.

281
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,575
He was born in 1988.

282
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,619
How old do I look?

283
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,830
You said we're the same age.

284
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,333
-No, I didn't.
-You said you were born in 1998.

285
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,418
-I only told you the month.
-Really?

286
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,419
Yes.

287
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,463
Wait. Were you born in 1999?

288
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,465
Don't tell me you were born in 2000.

289
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,551
Please don't say 2000.

290
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,969
That's not it, right?

291
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,513
Is it 2000?

292
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,474
Wait. You weren't born in 2003, were you?

293
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,688
-Are you serious?
-No.

294
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,567
This is hilarious.

295
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,027
My birthday is April 29th, 1988.

296
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,696
My gosh! Oh, sorry.

297
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,448
-Seriously?
-Yes.

298
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,076
But you don't look that old.

299
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,120
Are you serious?

300
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,955
-Yes.
-I see.

301
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,041
That's interesting.

302
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,418
Guess what my job is.

303
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,920
-A pro runner?
-A basketball player.

304
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,922
I'm being serious right now.

305
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,799
Well, I'm actually…

306
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,594
I'm a pro athlete. I play basketball.

307
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,972
So I was right.

308
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,223
Yes.

309
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,183
-I play basketball.
-I can't imagine you

310
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,519
being anything
other than a basketball player.

311
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,897
Nothing else really suits you.

312
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,732
Nothing else other than basketball?

313
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,984
That's all I could think of.

314
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,320
I see. So you're a basketball player?

315
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,113
-Seriously?
-Yes.

316
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,619
Your face has gotten red.

317
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,163
-Yes, I think I'm drunk.
-You…

318
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,998
I finished this by myself.

319
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,377
I'm drunk, so please excuse me
if I say anything mean.

320
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,214
You're supposed to say
nice things to pretty people.

321
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,511
I told you that your outfit
wasn't too bad today.

322
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,389
But "not too bad"
isn't the same as "pretty."

323
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,102
In my dictionary, it means "super pretty."

324
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,395
-Really?
-Yes.

325
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,442
I asked some of the guys about you.

326
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,112
"So who do you think
Min-ji is interested in?"

327
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,906
Who did they say?

328
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,619
Two of them said it was Jin-seok.

329
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,706
I just took their word for it.

330
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,626
I see.

331
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:13,597
But I think when people
assume things, they're always wrong.

332
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,980
I mean, wouldn't it bug you
if someone told you how you felt

333
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,524
when you didn't even know yourself?

334
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,861
But I'm sure you're also curious
about my thoughts.

335
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,738
Not just mine but Min-woo's too.

336
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,201
No. I'm most curious about how I feel,
and I just want to have a good time here.

337
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:44,420
So I need more
than a couple of days to decide.

338
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,006
Feelings change
depending on who comes and goes

339
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,258
and how you get to spend time with them.

340
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,135
-Absolutely.
-So that's how…

341
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,514
I think that's how I figure things out
and narrow down my choices.

342
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,558
So…

343
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,852
I'll clear things up for you.

344
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,603
Let's just have fun.

345
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,903
Tonight,

346
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,489
don't expect to get any sleep.

347
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,324
-Really?
-Yes.

348
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,784
Shall we go?

349
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,661
-Sure. Are you done eating?
-Yes.

350
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,621
You'll regret not finishing the pizza.

351
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,291
"Shall we go?"

352
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,834
My gosh.

353
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,254
Goodness. You end up watching
on the edge of your seat.

354
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,591
Min-ji is really straightforward.

355
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,218
Gwan-hee has been going to Paradise

356
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,471
-with the 1998 Trio.
-"The 1998 Trio"?

357
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,139
Hye-seon, Ha-jeong and Min-ji.

358
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,891
-They were all born in 1998?
-Yes.

359
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,934
Maybe his type is someone born in 1998.

360
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,937
Gwan-hee seems
a bit more reserved with Min-ji.

361
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,775
When he said he might say
something mean because he was drunk,

362
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,028
it made me wonder
what mean things he might say.

363
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,865
But he chose his words
rather carefully with her.

364
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,285
It made me think
that he treats everyone differently.

365
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,953
Yes. He's different with Hye-seon.

366
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,205
-Right.
-And Ha-jeong too.

367
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,623
He's different with everyone.

368
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:07,503
PARADISE
SON WON-IK & YU SI-EUN

369
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,423
I'll be completely honest with you.

370
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,341
Okay.

371
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,385
I really wanted to finish
in the top three,

372
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:21,809
and I wanted to run faster
than one particular person.

373
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,851
Who?

374
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:29,983
Min-woo.

375
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,698
Oh, no.

376
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,033
He singled out Min-woo.

377
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,538
My timing is always off with Min-woo.

378
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,042
Whenever we had a chance
to have a one-on-one conversation,

379
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,045
I always ended up
spending most of that time with you.

380
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,049
So I never really got a chance
to talk to anyone else.

381
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,137
Earlier today, Min-woo asked
to chat with me right away.

382
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,054
Right.

383
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,014
So I went to chat with him for a bit,

384
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,684
but we ran out of time
and had to come back.

385
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:10,482
So we never really had a chance
to have a proper conversation.

386
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,025
Our timing is always off.

387
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,030
I'm not deliberately doing this

388
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,075
to stop you from talking to someone else.

389
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,076
I know.

390
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,828
I'm not trying to hold you back.

391
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,039
-I know.
-I just wanted to chat with you.

392
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,834
And as for today,

393
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,921
I could have come to Paradise
with someone else.

394
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:37,301
But I just wanted to spend time with you…

395
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,596
here in Paradise.

396
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,271
-Because he likes her.
-That's how he feels.

397
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,355
-Yes.
-That's true.

398
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,525
-It's not his fault, you know.
-Right.

399
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,319
But it appears that way right now.

400
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,778
It's not his fault at all.

401
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,073
Well, in any case,

402
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:05,204
if you get a chance
to work out the timing issue,

403
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,415
you'd probably like

404
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,128
to talk to him properly
at least once, right?

405
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,507
Actually, hold on.

406
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,761
On second thought,
let me take back that question.

407
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,679
I think it might be best

408
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,766
if I don't hear the answer
to that question.

409
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,769
And it might be better for you
not to answer as well.

410
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,568
On the other hand,

411
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,655
if I'm being totally selfish
and honest with you,

412
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,283
I'm grateful that the timing
was off between you two.

413
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:55,295
There aren't many days left now,
but I hope that this bad timing continues.

414
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,256
-He's being honest.
-Right.

415
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,007
Yes, he's just being honest.

416
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,392
-Have you had enough to eat?
-Yes.

417
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,311
-Let's go upstairs, then.
-Okay.

418
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,816
It seems that Si-eun is really bad
at hiding her feelings.

419
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,067
-Right.
-It totally shows.

420
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,653
-It does.
-Her expression is so serious.

421
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,738
Yes. It won't be easy for Won-ik.

422
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,740
PARADISE
PARK MIN-KYU & KIM GYU-RI

423
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,492
-It's pretty, isn't it?
-It is.

424
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,704
My gosh. This isn't just finger food.

425
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,705
What is all this?

426
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,040
-It's caviar.
-Look at this.

427
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,209
Cheers.

428
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,757
-Is it good?
-Yes.

429
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,760
Did you think I'd choose you?

430
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,680
Well, I wasn't entirely sure.

431
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,557
I had my doubts.

432
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,017
Why did you doubt it?

433
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,395
I mean, I went to Paradise with Min-woo.

434
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,025
I've been curious about that.

435
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,028
You never told me why you chose Min-woo,

436
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,614
so I was wondering
if what I'd said was true after all.

437
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,075
Did you want to get to know him?

438
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,456
-I wanted to talk with him properly.
-That's totally understandable.

439
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,541
-I was…
-Yes?

440
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,918
I was curious about him.

441
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,802
Min-woo isn't much
of a talker, you know. That's why.

442
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,724
Who did you cheer for during the race?

443
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,894
-During the race?
-Yes.

444
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,022
I'm not sure.

445
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,525
-That means it wasn't him.
-Poor Min-kyu.

446
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,031
You're not sure?

447
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,036
That's why I didn't come in first.

448
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,997
I would've come in first
if you'd cheered for me.

449
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,999
That's why I didn't make first place.

450
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,757
I'm happy to be in Paradise with you.

451
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,550
-Really?
-Yes, I mean it.

452
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,011
I'm also happy that I kept my promise.

453
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,263
-Right.
-Even though I didn't win first place.

454
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,265
TWO DAYS AGO

455
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:16,603
And I promise I'll get us another chance
to go to Paradise together.

456
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:22,734
I know you weren't the first person
I went to Paradise with,

457
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,362
but I want you to be
the last one I go there with.

458
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,032
After our chat, I thought to myself,

459
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,577
"I should choose Gyu-ri."

460
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,996
That was my first thought.

461
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,914
Really?

462
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:41,628
When I go on a date with Min-kyu,

463
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:46,716
I'm not entirely sure
if I get butterflies in my stomach.

464
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:51,054
Being in Paradise with Min-kyu
is very relaxing.

465
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,765
But when I went to Paradise with Min-woo,

466
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,226
it was uncomfortable but still nice.

467
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,437
INFERNO

468
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,313
Hey, it's soybean paste stew.

469
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,109
They're finally gone.

470
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,781
-Use your hands for that.
-Doesn't it bother you?

471
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,032
-Them leaving?
-Yes.

472
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,409
Of course, I'm bothered.

473
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,035
Which couple bothers you more?

474
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,037
Stop asking me which one.

475
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,791
-They both left.
-Exactly.

476
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,293
I bet he's bothered by both.

477
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,462
It's going to keep Min-woo up all night.

478
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,881
He'll end up looking like a zombie.

479
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,840
A zombie?

480
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:32,721
Min-kyu pretty much belongs in Paradise.

481
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,889
-You're right.
-Totally.

482
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,142
-Min-kyu must be tired of going there.
-Exactly.

483
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,227
But he went with…

484
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,854
-With someone he likes…
-Stop it.

485
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,647
Min-woo's right here.

486
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,107
What?

487
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,402
That was the biggest reaction
we've seen from you.

488
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,904
-It was.
-Totally.

489
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,364
The more you deny it, the more true it is.

490
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,159
This is fun.

491
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,496
So can you give us a ratio?

492
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,040
-Affection-wise.
-Let him eat.

493
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:00,999
Fifty-fifty?

494
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,460
I'll tell you after I'm done eating.

495
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,670
Min-woo, let's eat and head inside.

496
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,297
-Maybe I should.
-No.

497
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,840
-I'll protect you.
-No way.

498
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,634
Then we'll chat in his room.

499
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,887
We'll whisper in his ear
until he falls asleep.

500
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,598
"What's the ratio?
Who are you leaning toward?"

501
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,896
But we want to know the answer
to Ha-jeong's question too.

502
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:23,813
-Yes.
-Right.

503
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,651
-The ratio between Si-eun and Gyu-ri.
-Yes, I'm really curious.

504
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,446
Doesn't it seem like Gyu-ri
has a higher percentage right now?

505
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,031
-Maybe sixty-forty?
-Right.

506
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,032
Right.

507
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,701
I think going to Paradise with Gyu-ri

508
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,328
had a huge impact on him.

509
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,288
-He totally fell for her.
-Totally.

510
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,083
Her voice is so soothing.

511
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,210
-And she blinks like a doe.
-Right.

512
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,170
She doesn't blink like this.

513
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,213
It's more like…

514
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,716
Can you show us again?

515
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,926
This is what she does.

516
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,511
-You just look sleepy.
-No.

517
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,054
-But…
-She has misty eyes.

518
00:25:56,137 --> 00:26:00,392
At first, it seemed like
Min-woo distanced himself from her,

519
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,643
but not anymore.

520
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,019
-You're right.
-I agree.

521
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,399
PARADISE
LEE GWAN-HEE & CHO MIN-JI

522
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,942
I love this!

523
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,318
I'm so excited.

524
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,488
How about changing into something comfy?

525
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,906
All I have are my pajamas.

526
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,199
Maybe a bit later.

527
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,701
-Later?
-Yes, after we eat.

528
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,703
It's okay to wear pajamas.

529
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,122
But I want to keep looking pretty.

530
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,375
-And…
-You've been more than pretty all day.

531
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,711
What's that?

532
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,921
-They were white before.
-Guess which is the flower.

533
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,089
This one.

534
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,218
"Guess which is the flower"?
Did you hear that?

535
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,679
My gosh. I should take notes.

536
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,348
-Only Min-ji can pull that off.
-Let's write it down.

537
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,809
Let's look around.

538
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,853
This was my spot whenever I came here.

539
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:45,895
Your spot?

540
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,314
Whenever you come?

541
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,357
-Yes, I'll…
-I want this spot.

542
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,360
Could you put my stuff here?

543
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,404
Yes, ma'am.

544
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,072
As you wish.

545
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,783
-Where do you want this? Here?
-Yes. Here.

546
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,036
I'm so happy right now!

547
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,500
Hey, look. Let's have this.

548
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,002
Please wash them.

549
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,725
He's washing them.

550
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,644
Without a word.

551
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,396
He's not the type to just do as he's told.

552
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,939
-I know, right?
-Totally.

553
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,566
Imagine if it were Ha-jeong.

554
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,401
-"Wash them yourself."
-"You do it."

555
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,987
She'd glare at him and wash them.

556
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,280
-Right.
-Definitely.

557
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,241
He'd tell her to do it herself.

558
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,999
The slippers are…

559
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,795
-Are you going to change?
-Yes.

560
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,172
Then get changed in here.
I'll go over there.

561
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,882
Is there another bath--

562
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,218
-And put on these slippers.
-Thanks.

563
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,604
Did you wash the fruit?

564
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,732
-They came pre-washed, right?
-You told me to.

565
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,234
-You really washed them?
-Yes.

566
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,111
Come and take your pick.

567
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,155
-Her pajamas…
-Those are her pajamas?

568
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,866
-What?
-She wants to look pretty.

569
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,702
A cool back will help her sleep.

570
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,870
-We should take notes.
-Is her back bare?

571
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,872
Where can I buy that pajamas?

572
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,627
Here, have a taste of capitalism.

573
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,254
I'll try this then.

574
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,089
-What are you eating?
-A cherry.

575
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,716
-Here, give me the seed.
-No.

576
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,342
-Spit it out here.
-Okay.

577
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,556
-He's so sweet.
-Goodness.

578
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,598
Oh, my.

579
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,767
I didn't know he was so thoughtful.

580
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,104
-His personality keeps changing.
-Seriously.

581
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,195
This is good.

582
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,530
It is.

583
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,742
I'm not sure what wine it is,
but it's good.

584
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,536
It's sweet.

585
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,249
Today, I'll try to

586
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,002
enjoy my time here before I go to bed.

587
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,715
-What do you mean?
-I'll enjoy it before going to bed.

588
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,473
I bet you have a certain type, don't you?

589
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,933
I thought you liked
strong, independent women.

590
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,979
Well, my ideal type of girl

591
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,483
is someone who has big eyes
and is cute and affectionate.

592
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,445
That's been my type for ten years.

593
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,571
Big eyes…

594
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,990
And someone who's cute and affectionate.

595
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,200
That's me.

596
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,913
Is your head spinning?

597
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,289
It definitely is.

598
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,665
I need to get a grip.

599
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,544
That's me.

600
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,840
Thanks for that.

601
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,051
So that's my type.

602
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,969
And…

603
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:06,930
That's what it is.

604
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,684
Anyway, I think
first impressions matter a lot.

605
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,229
-I see.
-But I'm worried

606
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,525
that your first impression
of me wasn't that great.

607
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,611
When we talked back then,

608
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,863
it wasn't that I had
a bad first impression.

609
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,324
It was more like,
"This guy could be pretty fun,

610
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,243
but he's not friendly toward me."

611
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,622
I was a little offended

612
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:37,502
and thought it was a shame
because you seemed like a fun guy.

613
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,672
Well, in any case…

614
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,425
We got off to a bad start…

615
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,388
but I'm glad…

616
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,351
things worked out like this.
That's how I feel.

617
00:30:56,229 --> 00:31:00,900
I think I'm almost ready
to make up my mind.

618
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,570
Do you think you'll know
in a couple of more days?

619
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,904
Yes, of course.

620
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,240
Do you want to know how I feel?

621
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,953
I wasn't that curious
about your job or age,

622
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,831
because I was more interested
in how you felt.

623
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:18,126
But honestly,
if I was attracted to Jin-seok,

624
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,253
I wouldn't care about anything else.

625
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:23,590
I'd probably say to myself,
"Let's shake things up a little."

626
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,341
-Seriously.
-I see.

627
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,342
Yes.

628
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,761
-Okay, then…
-Yes?

629
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,180
Even if it's obvious

630
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,350
that the person you like
has a crush on someone else…

631
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,185
-It doesn't matter.
-It doesn't?

632
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,270
No. I mean…

633
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,771
I just feel like

634
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,942
I could end up with the person I like
if I keep trying.

635
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,111
Because you're that confident?

636
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,989
But I agree.

637
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,367
If I like someone
and decide to pursue them,

638
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,537
I think I have what it takes
to change their mind

639
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,415
even if they're attracted to someone else.

640
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,543
But whenever I talk to you…

641
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,461
Yes?

642
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,006
I often find myself startled
by the things you say.

643
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,467
-Me?
-Because we're so similar in that sense.

644
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,384
I see.

645
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,015
-They really are alike.
-Yes.

646
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,683
They're our top players.

647
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,018
-Yes.
-They're well-suited.

648
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,436
-Top-notch.
-I agree.

649
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,230
-Go ahead and eat.
-Okay.

650
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,523
Try it.

651
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,067
I'm so happy right now.

652
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,361
It's been forever
since I had an iced coffee.

653
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,696
Hasn't it only been two days?

654
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,073
Oh, whatever.

655
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,206
-Try this.
-What? Oh, thanks.

656
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,841
I should've asked for more forks.

657
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,510
I wonder what this is.

658
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,719
-Which one?
-Try it.

659
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,722
-They're peanuts.
-Peanuts?

660
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,058
-I like nuts.
-You can have them all.

661
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,104
It's really good, right?

662
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,647
-This is amazing.
-It's sublime.

663
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,485
When did I tell you
that I wanted to talk to you?

664
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,028
Was it yesterday?

665
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,656
Yesterday? Yes, I think so.

666
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,995
We talked so much yesterday afternoon.

667
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,248
-Right.
-And we're here in Paradise today…

668
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,793
It's all thanks to you, in a way.

669
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,170
-Because you made the first move.
-Right.

670
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:32,885
And I think that made me
want to choose you.

671
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,262
Be good to me then.

672
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,932
-So…
-Where are you looking?

673
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,272
-Oh, my.
-We should really write that down.

674
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,525
"Where are you looking?"
And "Guess which one's the flower."

675
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,736
Her one-liners are just killing me.

676
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,363
My head is spinning too.

677
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,656
Yes, same here.

678
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,117
Where are you looking?

679
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,911
So anyway…

680
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,788
What? Who are you talking to?

681
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,956
Right. Anyway…

682
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,376
Now that we're here…

683
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,715
Since you took the first big step,

684
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,384
I won't expect anything
like that again from now on.

685
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:18,222
I won't expect you
to start a conversation with me

686
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:23,019
or be the first to express
your feelings for me.

687
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,980
I think I'll come looking for you
before you do.

688
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,108
I think it's because I feel

689
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:35,490
that I should try harder
for the effort you put in.

690
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,118
It would've been nice
if you'd been here from the start.

691
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,912
-Me?
-Yes.

692
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,123
If you'd been here from the start,

693
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:48,920
I think things would've worked out better
regardless of when we went to Paradise.

694
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,799
I just found it surprising.

695
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,929
Will you come watch me play
if I invite you to a game?

696
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,013
Of course.

697
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,767
I'll go there looking super pretty

698
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,645
and make you so proud
that you grin from ear to ear.

699
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,813
Seriously? You will?

700
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,068
You said you're very competitive.
You don't like losing, do you?

701
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:12,985
I hate it.

702
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,780
Really? Then you don't give in
to your girlfriend too?

703
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,076
I make an exception
for the people I love and care about.

704
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,580
My job is really important to me.

705
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,542
So other than my work and my girlfriend,

706
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,418
I don't care about anything else.

707
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,922
That's why when I date someone,
I try hard not to stress her out.

708
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:37,468
The worst type of stress
is related to friends of the opposite sex

709
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,970
and alcohol.

710
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,931
I've always thought to myself

711
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,600
to never upset my girlfriend
over these things

712
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,770
because I also don't like
worrying over that kind of stuff.

713
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,233
I wouldn't want that kind of stress,
so I try harder in that sense.

714
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,360
So…

715
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,028
It got serious all of a sudden.

716
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,572
-So since I…
-I see.

717
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,866
-Since I'm set in my ways,
-Yes, sir.

718
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,243
it's easy for other people to judge me

719
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,662
and see me for who they think I am.

720
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,583
You're the only person I've told this.

721
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,460
-In order to get to know me this well…
-Am I the only one?

722
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:15,464
-It would normally take years
-Really?

723
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,343
for me to open up and talk like this.

724
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,891
So you feel like
you've known me for years.

725
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,352
Yes, it feels like that.

726
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,645
So that's how you feel.

727
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,402
She won him over in two days.

728
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,737
-I know, right?
-Two days.

729
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,780
-He's never planned a future.
-Right.

730
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,365
For them to connect like this

731
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,034
-all of a sudden…
-I know, right?

732
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,327
Remember when Gwan-hee said,

733
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,205
-"This one, that one, and this one"?
-Yes.

734
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,958
Back then, he said he thought someone
would approach him if he did that.

735
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,460
-Right.
-So maybe he really was

736
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,045
waiting for someone like that.

737
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,630
-I agree.
-Just look at them.

738
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,800
I think the biggest reason why
Gwan-hee and Min-ji hit it off so well

739
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,844
is that they're on the same wavelength.

740
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,806
While listening to them,
I realized they weren't just flirting.

741
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,142
They're at a point where they're saying

742
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,312
how they could be a good
boyfriend or girlfriend material.

743
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,980
It surprised me.

744
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,690
I hope they keep hitting it off.

745
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,359
Seriously.

746
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,277
But Hye-seon…

747
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,779
-Right?
-It'd still be fun.

748
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,322
-But if…
-Don't forget Ha-jeong.

749
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,240
Right.

750
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,994
INFERNO

751
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:31,999
Gwan-hee keeps saying, "I think
my mind will be made up by tomorrow."

752
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,543
"I'll know by tomorrow or the day after."

753
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,880
But after saying all that,
he still hasn't figured things out.

754
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,173
That's just how he is.

755
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,424
-Right.
-Yes.

756
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,884
"That's just how he is."

757
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,013
I hope he makes his way back to me.

758
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,056
Right.

759
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,392
-She likes him that much?
-Still?

760
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,434
That's right.

761
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,103
She said that before.

762
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,104
-Yes.
-Right.

763
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,107
I hope he circles back.

764
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,652
"Circle back to Ha-jeong."
Something like that.

765
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,613
Hye-seon is coming.

766
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,824
Come on over.

767
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,662
It's almost over now.

768
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,707
Looking back on things,
I can't help but think…

769
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:18,421
I keep wondering
if I've been treating him wrong.

770
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,588
No, not at all.

771
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,675
The way I see it,
he's going back and forth too.

772
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,176
I think he's just confused.

773
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,096
Some people leave good impressions
because they're nice.

774
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,140
He told me we gave off different vibes.

775
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,224
Right.

776
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,144
And there's some
whom you argue with all the time

777
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,897
but still feel attracted to
even though you're incompatible.

778
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,609
I think Min-ji might win Gwan-hee's heart.
She approached him first.

779
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,320
She's not his type,

780
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,655
-but he might open up because of that.
-Totally.

781
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,451
That's interesting. You know what?

782
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,078
You know I was here first
on our third day.

783
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,205
When I saw you next to Gwan-hee,

784
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,042
I thought that maybe he likes
bright and cheerful girls.

785
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,793
That was my immediate thought.

786
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,211
Someone who's energetic.

787
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,714
Like someone who can take the lead?

788
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,674
Yes, something like that.

789
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,968
Min-ji is really cute and charming,

790
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,512
but I'm not sure if that's in her nature.

791
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,640
I think the trip to Paradise
on our very first day

792
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,517
has a big impact on the outcome.

793
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,435
I think so too.

794
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,397
To be honest,
I wasn't really concerned about Min-ji.

795
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,733
I felt that compared to Min-ji,

796
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:24,695
I had built a good rapport with Gwan-hee
over a longer period of time.

797
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:30,409
I also thought
that I was more his type in a way.

798
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,538
Gwan-hee is amazing.

799
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,540
He just made a surprise comeback.

800
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,877
Remember what happened
in the women's lodging?

801
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,795
It was crazy.

802
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,213
-They were so mad.
-He got burnt.

803
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,964
They burned him at the stake.

804
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,425
-It was a fake pyre.
-I mean, is he a phoenix?

805
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,637
It's like he rose from the ashes.

806
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,805
He came back to life.

807
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,684
Can we talk while walking around here?

808
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,602
Let's do it.

809
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,812
PARADISE
LEE GWAN-HEE & CHO MIN-JI

810
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,939
Let's go around the room.

811
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,482
It'll be a nice stroll.

812
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,734
We can even jog here.

813
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,240
I think this is helping me digest.

814
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,575
-Maybe after 50 laps.
-After 50 laps?

815
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,786
I think even five laps will help.

816
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,957
Are they really walking around the room?
Like a stroll?

817
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,170
Where do you usually hang out?

818
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,798
There's this great chicken place

819
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,757
-in Yeouido.
-I see.

820
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,927
-I go there a lot.
-Will you treat me to some?

821
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,846
If you come to Yeouido.

822
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,223
-There's lots of good food there, right?
-Yes.

823
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,892
Isn't Yeouido famous for something?

824
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,478
Like what? Cho Min-ji?

825
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,234
-Your level of confidence…
-What?

826
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,736
It's like looking in the mirror.

827
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,282
Are you ready to make my wish come true?

828
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,784
So if I win,

829
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,911
-you have to grant me a wish.
-Okay.

830
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,955
If you win, I'll grant your wish.

831
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:58,956
Okay.

832
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,957
They're all wrong.

833
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,376
What? No way.

834
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,545
-All of them.
-Stop lying.

835
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,130
You got everything wrong.

836
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:07,631
What's your wish?

837
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,135
-We'll be back in Inferno tomorrow, right?
-Yes.

838
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:15,556
I want you to write me a letter
in under ten words.

839
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,515
A letter?

840
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,268
But there's a ten-word limit.
That's doable, right?

841
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,227
Sure.

842
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,104
Do you know that I'm talking to you

843
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,648
as if you have eyes
on the back of your head?

844
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,067
I just replied to the back of your head.

845
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:27,985
Really?

846
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,653
-Go on ahead then.
-Okay.

847
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,573
But now you'll be talking
to the back of my head.

848
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,910
Alright, how about
you walk backward like this?

849
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:37,912
But it's dangerous.

850
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,123
There's just no way for us
to walk side by side.

851
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,709
This is hilarious.

852
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,170
-But it's better to digest, right?
-Hold on.

853
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,463
-Stand right there.
-Okay.

854
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,049
Start there, and I'll start here.
Let's walk in circles.

855
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,968
What do you think?

856
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,180
They're just having so much fun.

857
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,348
-Yes.
-Right.

858
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:01,477
They're just walking around the table,
but they're having a blast.

859
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,939
Let's walk in circles.

860
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,650
What do you think?

861
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,694
It's good. It'll help us digest.

862
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,364
If you get dizzy,
go in the opposite direction.

863
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,866
-Go the other way.
-Wait, this isn't it.

864
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,743
Hold on.

865
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,162
Have you taken your sunglasses?

866
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,205
No, I haven't.

867
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,582
It's okay. I'll just take yours.

868
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,501
No, seriously.

869
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,753
I bet they're there.

870
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,297
Just tell me what'll happen
if they're not here.

871
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,675
-Are they here or not?
-What?

872
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:33,884
Are they there or not?

873
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,011
I don't know. My gosh!

874
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,012
You're going to…

875
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,141
-These two are no joke.
-Totally.

876
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,978
I don't know. My gosh!

877
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,104
You're going to…

878
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,772
I thought you'd really choke me.

879
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,107
-They're there, right?
-Yes.

880
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,068
But you wouldn't kill me
if they weren't, right?

881
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,736
I love the color of your bag.

882
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,447
I really like pastel colors like that.

883
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,366
-Really?
-Like your clothes and bag.

884
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,659
-And my pajamas.
-Right.

885
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,829
Did you do some research on me
before coming here?

886
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:02,955
I just…

887
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,498
Did I? Maybe.

888
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,416
"Maybe"?

889
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,795
INFERNO

890
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,385
Min-woo is intimidated by us.

891
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:20,180
I think the resident ghosts of Inferno

892
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,223
scared him off.

893
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,601
Come on, leave Min-woo alone.

894
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,853
Can't you see how anxious he is right now?

895
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,354
He just lost both of them.

896
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,318
But I think things will work out
for Min-woo in the end.

897
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,862
But with whom? I'm kind of curious.

898
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,530
-We don't know.
-I say Si-eun.

899
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,448
Same here.

900
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,159
I think he's a better match
with Si-eun too.

901
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:44,246
Won-ik really needs
to change his course right now

902
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,873
and come to me.

903
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,125
That was subtle.

904
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,503
I wasn't trying to be subtle.

905
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,256
I told him I wanted to have
good food today.

906
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,136
-She said she wanted to go to Paradise.
-I asked him to take me, and he said okay.

907
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,971
He gave me hope by saying that.

908
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,265
Then he left me behind.

909
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,189
I got my hopes up, you know.

910
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,274
You have a great personality.

911
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,360
-This is fun.
-So funny.

912
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,737
Do Ha-jeong and I give off similar vibes?

913
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,655
-Ha-jeong?
-Yes.

914
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,198
-Not at all.
-Totally different.

915
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,324
-Really?
-Yes.

916
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,618
She's a bit…

917
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,828
Well, she kind of…

918
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,789
She comes on to people pretty strong.

919
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,500
You just have a bright personality.

920
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,543
-What about me?
-I don't come on strong.

921
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,503
Well, I mean…

922
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,546
You're assertive. Like, "Let's talk."

923
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,340
-Look, you're nonchalant.
-Totally.

924
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,883
-Super nonchalant.
-Right.

925
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:38,967
She's so nonchalant.

926
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,719
-And you're bright.
-My tone…

927
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,304
It's the tone of my voice.

928
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,931
No, you're flirtatious.

929
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,809
It's not just that.
You're flirtatious from head to toe.

930
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,519
-You just don't know it.
-Right.

931
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,938
This is how you looked at me
when we first met.

932
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,525
You were like, "Welcome."

933
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,778
Honestly, I wasn't sure

934
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:02,700
if you were flirtatious
or if you were just scared.

935
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,910
This is what your face looks like, okay?

936
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:09,081
PARADISE
LEE GWAN-HEE & CHO MIN-JI

937
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,791
Bed time.

938
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,169
What's that? Medicine?

939
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,802
Rub it in.

940
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,013
-Three times already.
-Isn't this the third time?

941
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,014
It is.

942
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,808
I bet it rubbed off on the sheets.

943
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,271
The nape of your neck too.

944
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,356
It'll feel tingly.

945
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,899
What is it?

946
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,195
Essential oil.

947
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,905
Oh, essential oil.

948
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,867
I really like aromatic scents.

949
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:45,784
I see.

950
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,915
It's 2:10 a.m. Do you want to turn in?

951
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,667
Thank you.

952
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,462
-Sleep well.
-Okay.

953
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,838
I'll wake you up.

954
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,008
Tiptoe when you come.

955
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:01,967
Okay.

956
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:20,319
FINAL DECISION
D-2

957
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,155
There isn't much time left.

958
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,700
What time is it? We can make it.

959
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,454
-Stay calm.
-What's that on your pants?

960
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,413
What?

961
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,832
I think you got some makeup on the back.

962
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,501
-What is it?
-Oh, my god.

963
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,337
I don't know. This is…

964
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,089
I think it's foundation. What do I do?

965
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,383
-These are brand new.
-Give them to me.

966
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,718
I'll try to get it off.

967
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,679
-What?
-He's going to wash it for her?

968
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,972
-My gosh.
-Gwan-hee will?

969
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,265
That was unexpected.

970
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,399
These are my pajama pants.
Put these on for now.

971
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,986
Change into these and give me your pants.
I'll stay here.

972
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,658
-Are you done?
-Yes, but what is this?

973
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,161
I guess I got something on it
and the chair too.

974
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,413
Those shorts look great on you.

975
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,750
Go ahead and do your makeup.

976
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,752
Thank you.

977
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,348
Thank you, Gwan-hee.

978
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,100
-It's still there.
-What?

979
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,977
It's okay. Really.

980
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,729
-It's totally fine.
-I can put a bandage on it if you want.

981
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,606
No, that'll make it look weirder.

982
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,817
But thank you so much.

983
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,780
We've never seen this side

984
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,282
-of Gwan-hee before.
-Right.

985
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,992
-I'm mind-blown.
-Seriously.

986
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,661
I'm speechless.

987
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,246
I don't know what to say.

988
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:57,416
I think Gwan-hee
has already decided on Min-ji.

989
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,459
-He's fallen for her.
-He's already…

990
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,419
He's fallen hard.

991
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,795
-I know, right?
-Yes.

992
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:06,884
INFERNO

993
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,804
You held my hand on our way there.
Why not on the way back?

994
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,805
-Hold my hand.
-Okay.

995
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,390
You can hold my thumb.

996
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,310
I'm sorry, but your thumb looks so weak

997
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,562
-compared to your arm.
-It's the biggest finger.

998
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,191
Isn't it a little too quiet
around here today?

999
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,028
-What if they all disappeared?
-That'd be nice.

1000
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,654
You wish they all disappeared?

1001
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,073
Why? Is there someone
you want to keep around?

1002
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,784
-Gosh, don't say that.
-Please stop.

1003
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,911
Stop it.

1004
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,163
-Just stop.
-That made him sound petty.

1005
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,748
-Keep a straight face.
-Do what?

1006
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:38,957
Like it wasn't fun.

1007
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,085
Hey, you're back.

1008
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,587
Ha-bin.

1009
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,504
Hey, buddy.

1010
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,672
How was yesterday?

1011
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,757
I just chilled.

1012
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,468
-You went to bed early, right?
-Yes, we were all tired.

1013
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,471
So how was it with Min-ji?
I'm curious about how it went.

1014
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,681
She was exactly how I thought she'd be.

1015
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,183
Just as I expected.

1016
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,226
-I think I know what you mean.
-With maybe

1017
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,729
an extra dose of fun
and cuteness mixed in.

1018
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:01,730
I see.

1019
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,359
The rest of us here talked for a bit
and then went to bed.

1020
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,652
What did Hye-seon do?

1021
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,570
Hye-seon? I don't know.

1022
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,573
I didn't talk much with Hye-seon.

1023
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,825
-I purposely didn't.
-Did she talk to someone?

1024
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,327
Talk to whom?

1025
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,288
Maybe Jin-seok or Min-woo?

1026
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,999
No, we just got together
and talked as a group.

1027
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,877
I wonder if she was okay.

1028
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,672
-Hye-seon?
-What are you? Casanova?

1029
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,800
I'm worried about her for some reason.

1030
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,343
It's just that…

1031
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,263
-Interesting.
-Hye-seon? But why?

1032
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,140
-What's with him?
-I know, right?

1033
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,142
So how was it? I'm really curious.

1034
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,519
-What did you do?
-Really?

1035
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,562
-We ate at the restaurant,
-Right.

1036
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,648
and we talked a lot.

1037
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:48,402
I felt at ease and had a lot of fun,
so I thought it was great.

1038
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,446
-I see.
-When he told me about his job,

1039
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,323
I felt really relieved.

1040
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,741
-How come?
-Really? Why?

1041
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:59,329
I like people with
a clear vision of their career.

1042
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,747
I said that was my type.

1043
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,876
Of course I like fun guys.
But I also like guys who work hard

1044
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,421
and have solid values as well.

1045
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,340
And I realized he's close to my ideal.

1046
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,675
-So that was nice.
-I see.

1047
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:15,137
And he did say things
that made me a bit uncomfortable,

1048
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,223
but when I asked him not to,
he got the message and stopped.

1049
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,767
The way he stopped right away like that

1050
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,520
is another thing I liked about him.

1051
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,106
-I see.
-I thought you two might hit it off.

1052
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:30,610
I didn't think there'd be much chemistry
between Min-ji and Gwan-hee,

1053
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,196
so I wasn't that curious about their trip.

1054
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,533
But Min-ji really seemed to like him,

1055
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,203
so things are a bit uncertain now.

1056
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,705
I'll have to wait and see.

1057
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:47,294
We'll need to see
how Gwan-hee was with Min-ji.

1058
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,589
I don't think Min-ji made
much of an impression on him.

1059
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,759
-Oh, Ha-jeong…
-You're so wrong.

1060
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,553
She shouldn't underestimate her.

1061
00:50:56,636 --> 00:51:00,974
I think Gwan-hee might choose Min-ji
if she keeps expressing her feelings.

1062
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,771
I think Gwan-hee prefers girls
who express their feelings for him.

1063
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:09,775
He wants to meet someone
who can come up and say, "I like you."

1064
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,610
But that's what I did.

1065
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,320
-Not in the beginning.
-Yes, I did.

1066
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,446
From the start, then?

1067
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,199
-Before we went to Paradise,
-Yes?

1068
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,118
he asked who I wanted to go with,
and I said, "With you."

1069
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,704
But the thing is,
you like to tease other people

1070
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,539
when we eat together and such.

1071
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,084
So maybe he can't take you seriously.

1072
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,877
He might think you're just joking.

1073
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,378
But he does the same thing.

1074
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,716
Why are you trying to act like Gwan-hee?

1075
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,927
It's because I'm curious.

1076
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,888
I mean, he's not the only one
who's curious. So am I.

1077
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:40,806
I'm curious too!

1078
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,350
I want to go to Paradise
with other people too.

1079
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,643
Right.

1080
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,853
You two are adorable.

1081
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,856
There's nothing more to say.

1082
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,316
What now?

1083
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,988
Today, the women will play a game

1084
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,532
to win a date in Paradise.

1085
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,493
You absolutely have to win.

1086
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,494
But I…

1087
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,163
But if you don't win first place,

1088
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,250
ask whoever places higher than you
not to choose Min-woo.

1089
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,584
-My gosh!
-Seriously.

1090
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,502
I'm so serious.

1091
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,628
That's ridiculous.

1092
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:12,671
How come?

1093
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,631
Let's go, Si-eun.

1094
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,717
I'm really pulling for Si-eun this time.

1095
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,762
Everyone, please gather in the forest.

1096
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,180
-Forest?
-The forest?

1097
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,348
Let's go.

1098
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,433
Come on. Let's go.

1099
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,815
It's another ball draw.

1100
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,402
I look forward to watching it.

1101
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,989
-I wonder what it'll be like.
-It wouldn't be anything dangerous.

1102
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:39,906
They're here.

1103
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,035
Things are about to get heated.

1104
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,413
Don't look at me.

1105
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,081
Seriously, don't look at me.

1106
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,332
I promise not to laugh.

1107
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,711
Why come out first
if you don't want us to look at you?

1108
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,047
Go easy on them, Gyu-ri.

1109
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,299
Don't win again.

1110
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,050
-She will.
-Give the others a chance.

1111
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,719
-He's right.
-Good luck.

1112
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,472
Today, the women
will be competing in a game

1113
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,308
for a date in Paradise.

1114
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,604
The top three contestants,
in order of rank,

1115
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:15,275
will get to choose the men
they'd like to go to Paradise with.

1116
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,319
Today's game will be

1117
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,446
a chicken fight.

1118
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,031
A chicken fight?

1119
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,699
-Oh, no.
-It's anyone's game.

1120
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,662
-I really hope Si-eun wins.
-I hope so too.

1121
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,997
She has to beat Gyu-ri.

1122
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,707
-Gyu-ri's pretty strong.
-Right.

1123
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:31,791
-She is.
-She's good.

1124
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,129
Are taller people at a disadvantage?

1125
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,339
You never know.

1126
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,591
At the sound of the signal,

1127
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:43,386
the women must grasp one of their legs
and attack their opponents.

1128
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,640
Whoever is the first
to let go of their leg

1129
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,516
or fall over will be eliminated.

1130
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,770
Preliminary rounds
will be held tournament-style.

1131
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:55,482
Each player will choose their opponent
and order by drawing a ball.

1132
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,152
Beginning with Yun Ha-jeong,
please draw a ball.

1133
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,034
YUN HA-JEONG: YELLOW BALL

1134
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,332
-Hey, it's red.
-I'm scared.

1135
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,501
-Anything but red.
-I'm so scared.

1136
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:21,758
RED BALL
CHOI HYE-SEON VS. KIM GYU-RI

1137
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,095
They're the top contenders.

1138
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,055
-This is practically the finals.
-Right.

1139
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,394
Come on, Min-young.

1140
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:33,895
It's a blue one.

1141
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:34,980
AN MIN-YOUNG: BLUE BALL

1142
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,190
I don't want to fight Si-eun.

1143
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:47,701
BLUE BALL
CHO MIN-JI VS. AN MIN-YOUNG

1144
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,706
Aren't we the weaklings here?

1145
00:54:56,584 --> 00:55:00,297
YELLOW BALL
YU SI-EUN VS. YUN HA-JEONG

1146
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,631
You're finished, Ha-jeong.

1147
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,716
It's game over.

1148
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,217
You never know.

1149
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,510
-Yes.
-She might do well.

1150
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,762
Don't forget that it's okay to just quit.

1151
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,307
Come on, you guys…

1152
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,852
Red ball players,
Kim Gyu-ri and Choi Hye-seon,

1153
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,770
please enter the ring.

1154
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,523
How is it that they're matched?

1155
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,027
-We might as well call this the finals.
-It really is.

1156
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,194
Right.

1157
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,822
This is going to be intense.

1158
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,949
DAY 5
WOMEN'S MATCH FINALS

1159
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,200
Wait.

1160
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,995
She's really strong.

1161
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:34,956
No! Wait!

1162
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,796
Choi Hye-seon is out.

1163
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,217
Please begin when you hear the signal.

1164
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,177
Ready.

1165
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,731
I think they'll do well.

1166
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,859
Are you guys meditating?

1167
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,366
-I'm scared.
-Hye-seon is scary.

1168
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,702
I can't breathe.

1169
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,456
Who…

1170
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,793
Are they waiting it out?

1171
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,003
Nobody's making the first move.

1172
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,173
Min-woo, I'm scared.

1173
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,803
-Look at Hye-seon's face.
-They'll run out of energy.

1174
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,389
I can practically feel the tension.

1175
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,723
It's giving me chills.

1176
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,350
-Right?
-It's scary.

1177
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,603
They're both intense.

1178
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,358
Isn't it harder to stand still like that?

1179
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,068
One wrong move,

1180
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,820
-Right.
-and you might lose.

1181
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,991
Excuse me, is this a yoga…

1182
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,828
Is this a mountain yoga retreat?

1183
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,878
There she goes.

1184
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,258
Be careful.

1185
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,322
I don't want to fight Hye-seon.

1186
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,206
-She pushed down.
-It's a skill.

1187
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,041
-My gosh.
-Hye-seon is good.

1188
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,607
Are you okay?

1189
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,983
Choi Hye-seon wins.

1190
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,401
Gosh, Hye-seon.

1191
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,487
-That was no joke.
-She dominated the game.

1192
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,363
-She's so good.
-She totally won.

1193
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,574
-The way she pushed her.
-Right.

1194
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,284
Since she's tall…

1195
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,702
-She has long legs.
-Right.

1196
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,830
Ha-jeong, show us some kung fu moves.

1197
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,916
The second match.

1198
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,877
Yellow ball players,
Yun Ha-jeong and Yu Si-eun,

1199
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,921
please enter the ring.

1200
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,714
-Let's go, girls.
-Good luck.

1201
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,090
Keep your abs tight.

1202
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,300
Good luck.

1203
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,638
-I want to see Si-eun win.
-Yes.

1204
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,015
Don't give up, Ha-jeong.

1205
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,142
I'm not going to.

1206
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,980
Come on, Ha-jeong.
Put some effort in for once.

1207
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,692
Please begin when you hear the signal.

1208
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,610
Ready.

1209
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,112
-Fold your leg.
-You got this.

1210
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,094
Oh, no.

1211
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,557
Ha-jeong is a spitfire.

1212
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,808
Come on, get in there.

1213
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:25,979
Oh, no.

1214
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,235
Here comes the spitfire.

1215
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,820
Get in there and make a move!

1216
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,531
Oh, no.

1217
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,784
-Watch your hands.
-No hands allowed.

1218
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:41,035
No hands.

1219
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,120
You can't use them.

1220
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,205
-Watch your hands.
-No hands allowed.

1221
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,040
No hands allowed. What's going on?

1222
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,710
This is insane.

1223
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,794
She's using her arm!

1224
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,546
What's going on?

1225
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,843
Yun Ha-jeong wins.

1226
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:05,893
Ha-jeong won.

1227
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,647
-Ha-jeong, I rooted for you.
-The third match.

1228
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,815
-You bet on me?
-Yes.

1229
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:14,569
Blue ball players, An Min-young
and Cho Min-ji, please enter the ring.

1230
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,486
Okay.

1231
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:22,785
Go easy on me.

1232
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,704
Sorry, but I'm going to do my best.

1233
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,334
Please begin when you hear the signal.

1234
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,335
Ready.

1235
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,545
-Get ready.
-Grab your leg.

1236
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,921
My legs are…

1237
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,967
-No hands allowed.
-Got it.

1238
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,350
Min-young!

1239
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,186
Min-young!

1240
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,525
We bumped our heads!

1241
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:55,985
Are you okay?

1242
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,739
Then rams into her right away.

1243
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,824
Oh, dear.

1244
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,369
Check on each other later.

1245
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,412
Oh, no.

1246
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,252
-She's losing.
-Here we go.

1247
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,008
Cho Min-ji wins.

1248
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:20,843
Nice job, Min-ji!

1249
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,180
-You can't lose your grip on your leg.
-No, you can't.

1250
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,144
-Min-ji held out.
-She did well.

1251
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,021
-She held out all the way.
-Right.

1252
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,690
Min-ji is amazing.

1253
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:36,234
-She's going to Paradise again.
-She held out.

1254
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,193
Yes.

1255
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:39,779
The final match
will be a three-person game.

1256
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:43,825
Choi Hye-seon, Yun Ha-jeong
and Cho Min-ji.

1257
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,493
The final match will begin now.

1258
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,388
Wait. Choi Hye-seon,
Yun Ha-jeong, and Cho Min-ji?

1259
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,181
-Gwan-hee…
-It's a battle for Gwan-hee!

1260
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,099
-It is.
-Right.

1261
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,892
Gosh, this is insane.

1262
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:12,311
I could tell right away.

1263
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,149
I knew this rivalry match was about me.

1264
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,483
"The Lee Gwan-Hee Derby."

1265
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,822
Right. A derby.

1266
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:27,535
Whatever the outcome,
I'll be going to Paradise today.

1267
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,998
So I'll make sure to do a good job
of packing my things for the trip.

1268
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,250
-Let's go, Ha-jeong.
-Go, Hye-seon!

1269
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,627
-Let's do this.
-You looked amazing out there.

1270
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,259
The look in Hye-seon's eyes scares me.

1271
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,969
Just look at her.

1272
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:47,138
She has warrior blood in her veins.

1273
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:52,018
I would like to go to Paradise
with Lee Gwan-hee today.

1274
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:56,898
I was afraid that if I Iost to Min-ji,
she'd take Gwan-hee to Paradise.

1275
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,817
So I thought I had to beat her,
no matter what.

1276
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,238
My first pick is Gwan-hee,

1277
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:07,909
but it looked like Hye-seon
also wanted to go to Paradise with him.

1278
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:10,912
So I was determined
to beat Hye-seon no matter what.

1279
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:14,916
But she looked so strong
that I started doubting whether I could.

1280
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:20,046
I have feelings for Gwan-hee,

1281
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,381
but Hye-seon looked too intimidating,

1282
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,927
so my plan was to get rid of Min-ji first.

1283
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,638
-The Gwan-hee Derby.
-Gwan-hee…

1284
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,644
It's okay, Min-ji.

1285
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,354
-Don't be nervous.
-Me? I'm not.

1286
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:38,356
Oh, really? My bad.

1287
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:39,690
Impressive.

1288
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,152
I can't watch.

1289
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,322
I'm so nervous.

1290
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,951
Please begin when you hear the signal.

1291
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:51,369
Ready.

1292
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:52,411
I'm so nervous.

1293
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,374
-I'm so nervous.
-Right?

1294
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,091
Gosh, this is tense.

1295
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,427
Gwan-hee looks so happy.

1296
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:13,933
Three beautiful women are
fighting over him right now.

1297
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,268
Yes, he must be excited.

1298
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,394
I can't even imagine.

1299
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,604
-It's a great ego boost.
-Right.

1300
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,617
My gosh. Hye-seon's eyes are scary.

1301
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:34,579
Look at her face.

1302
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,089
That look in her eyes…

1303
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,341
Eliminate Ha-jeong first?

1304
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,142
This is scary.

1305
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,436
I think you'll both attack me.

1306
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,565
I'm getting chills.

1307
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,652
Dragging this out might work against you.

1308
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,070
It'll drain your energy.

1309
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,115
Shouldn't we close in a bit?

1310
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,954
Maybe we should get two steps closer.

1311
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,790
Two steps. One, two.

1312
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,167
Hey, no one else moved.

1313
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,794
-Move back.
-Come on, you guys.

1314
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,088
Don't mind them. Do whatever you want.

1315
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,506
There's plenty of time.

1316
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:42,438
Here she comes.

1317
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,731
The warrior is coming!

1318
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:44,774
No, Ha-jeong…

1319
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:22,186
