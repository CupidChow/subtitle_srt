1
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,103
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,813
-You'd better make a move.
-Right.

3
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,115
Here she comes.

4
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,408
The warrior is coming!

5
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,451
No, Ha-jeong…

6
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,922
Someone, help her!

7
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,847
-Cho Min-ji is out.
-Are you okay?

8
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,682
Gosh, she tried so hard!

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,309
She got hit in the stomach.

10
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,654
-Ha-jeong!
-Ha-jeong!

11
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,991
Ha-jeong is a real spitfire.

12
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,659
-Go, Ha-jeong!
-Yes!

13
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,581
Ha-jeong!

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,376
-Ha-jeong!
-Ha-jeong!

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,753
-Ha-jeong!
-Ha-jeong!

16
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,299
-Ha-jeong!
-Oh, gosh!

17
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,217
Ha-jeong!

18
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,928
-Ha-jeong!
-Oh, gosh!

19
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,887
Ha-jeong!

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,514
Yun Ha-jeong is out.

21
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,016
-Ha-jeong!
-Oh, my gosh!

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,267
Ha-jeong…

23
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,644
Goodness.

24
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,104
Yun Ha-jeong is out.

25
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,522
Good job.

26
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,023
You did well.

27
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,024
Ha-jeong!

28
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,609
Yun Ha-jeong is out.

29
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,568
You did well.

30
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,946
-It must hurt.
-Oh, second place.

31
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,280
Goodness.

32
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,032
Ha-jeong…

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,410
-It's always like that for her.
-Ha-jeong…

34
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,247
Things never end well for her.

35
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,791
-Oh, second place.
-You did well.

36
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,417
Gosh, it must've hurt.

37
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,086
It's okay.

38
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,379
-Don't cry.
-I'm fine.

39
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,338
I'm okay.

40
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,633
-You're okay, right?
-I'm okay. It's fine.

41
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,592
Are you okay?

42
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,719
Gosh, you're upset.

43
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,721
-No, I'm not.
-Are you okay?

44
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,643
I realized I might not be able to go

45
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,645
to Paradise with the person I wanted.

46
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,355
It's okay.

47
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,273
It's okay.

48
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,692
I know you're upset,
but at least you get to go.

49
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,028
"At least you get to go."

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,822
Gosh, she must be really upset.

51
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:42,287
The top three contestants of today's game

52
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:47,000
will each pick the man they wish
to go to Paradise with this afternoon.

53
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,338
-Good game, everyone.
-Are you okay?

54
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,298
Yes, I'm fine.

55
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,632
-You're not hurt, right?
-I'm okay.

56
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,925
-I feel so bad.
-No, don't.

57
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,179
It's okay. You didn't do it on purpose.

58
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,893
Min-ji, you're not hurt, right?
You're just upset, right?

59
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,060
-You did well.
-No.

60
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,104
-It's okay to be upset.
-I'm crying out of joy.

61
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,689
-You get to go to Paradise.
-Exactly.

62
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,649
I'll eat good food again.

63
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,985
-Yes, you did well.
-You shouldn't have gone for her.

64
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,570
I did my best, though.

65
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,779
You did a great job.

66
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,617
Gosh, I held my breath during that fight.

67
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,785
-Seriously.
-Yes, it really was.

68
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,747
But the fact that it was a match
between the three girls

69
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,125
who wanted to go to Paradise
with Gwan-hee is a funny coincidence.

70
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,587
-This episode is all about Gwan-hee.
-Yes, seriously.

71
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,298
-We can't escape from him.
-I know.

72
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,469
I'm curious about their picks.

73
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,264
Hye-seon won first place,
Ha-jeong won second place,

74
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,434
-and Min-ji won third place.
-I wonder who Hye-seon will pick.

75
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,648
I think it'll be Won-ik.

76
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,650
-What?
-Me too.

77
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,401
Either you or Gwan-hee.

78
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,987
No, here's what I think.

79
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,448
I already went there once with Hye-seon.

80
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:04,535
And after we came back,
I just felt super comfortable with her.

81
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,413
I felt at ease with her,
but there was no excitement.

82
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,874
I bet Hye-seon felt that too.

83
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,628
I'm sure she also noticed
that there was no excitement on my end.

84
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,173
-My head hurts.
-I'm sure she felt that.

85
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,511
Gwan-hee, I thought you were into Min-ji.

86
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,056
-I thought you liked her.
-It's either Min-ji or Hye-seon for me.

87
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,142
-I see.
-I don't know how things will go

88
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,644
if Hye-seon picks me today.

89
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,729
But if she doesn't pick me today,

90
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,941
I'll probably go for Min-ji.

91
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,655
Gwan-hee seems to care more
about how the other person treats him

92
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,824
rather than how he feels
about that person.

93
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,619
-He'll be upset if he's not picked.
-I think he cares too much about his ego.

94
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,914
-Instead of focusing on how he feels,
-Right.

95
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:54,168
he makes his decisions based on
how the other person feels about him.

96
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,503
Do you know what's funny?

97
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,213
Five minutes before the shoot,

98
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,590
he said he was being
too harsh on Gwan-hee.

99
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,050
But as soon as we began…

100
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,721
-That's how much I care about him.
-Yes, exactly.

101
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,556
-He cares.
-Yes, that's right.

102
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,516
I'm sure we all feel the same way.

103
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,810
-Right.
-I want to say nice things about him,

104
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,856
but I become furious again
whenever he says stuff like that.

105
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,486
-I think Si-eun really wanted to win.
-I know.

106
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,114
I could tell
she desperately wanted to win.

107
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:28,119
I think Hye-seon might go for Min-woo.

108
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,704
-Either Min-woo or…
-What?

109
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,663
Yes.

110
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,707
I want to stay in Inferno today.

111
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,085
Tell her that you don't want to go
and that she should go alone.

112
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,671
-I'm so upset.
-Who have you gone with?

113
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,589
Min-kyu.

114
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:44,427
I think I might cry
if anyone takes Min-woo.

115
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,012
I have a feeling he will go.

116
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,514
-Don't say that.
-Okay.

117
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,813
I was worried that if I lost,
someone would swipe our chance to talk.

118
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:00,026
I was worried
that our timing might be off again.

119
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,153
It was really hard for me.

120
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,242
Come in.

121
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,037
-Are you busy? Want to chat?
-Sure.

122
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,332
-Are you busy? Want to chat?
-Sure.

123
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,255
-One second.
-Anywhere is fine.

124
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,842
-It's Min-woo and Si-eun.
-Yes, find a moment to chat.

125
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,679
This place is really…

126
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,598
I was always busy talking to Si-eun,

127
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,059
so I never noticed how quiet it is here.

128
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,185
It is.

129
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:38,231
I heard you said I kept Si-eun isolated
as if I were her bodyguard or something.

130
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,148
-Me?
-Yes.

131
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,566
-No, I didn't.
-Who was it?

132
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,818
It was hilarious.

133
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,780
-I think it was someone from our room.
-Really?

134
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,493
I guess that's how it seemed to people.

135
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:56,082
I didn't even know
I spent so much time talking to her.

136
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,213
-The breeze is nice and cool.
-Yes, it is.

137
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,215
Have you been well?

138
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,300
-Me? I've been well.
-Good.

139
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,094
How was yesterday? Was it fun?

140
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,223
Yesterday? Well, it was okay.

141
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,766
It was okay? Just okay?

142
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,684
Yes.

143
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,352
She's become so brighten up.

144
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,520
Oh, my.

145
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,272
Si-eun should never play poker.

146
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,024
-Poker?
-She shouldn't.

147
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,026
At first, she seemed rather cold,

148
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,821
but more of her charm showed
throughout the episodes

149
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:30,074
as she became more honest
about her feelings for Min-woo.

150
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,873
How was today's game?

151
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,040
I was upset.

152
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,001
-Why?
-I wanted to win first place.

153
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,128
-I see.
-But I failed.

154
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,880
You still did your best.

155
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,173
My gosh.

156
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,757
Right, I did.

157
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,094
Going to Paradise isn't what's important.

158
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,012
You're right.

159
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,765
What's important is talking
with the person you want to talk to.

160
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,936
-You've changed so much overnight.
-What do you mean?

161
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,063
You're quite the smooth talker now.

162
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,107
-What? Why?
-I'm about to feel shy now.

163
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,943
I liked how you expressed yourself well.

164
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:06,986
-Really?
-Yes.

165
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,321
-Well, for me…
-Yes?

166
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,240
I want to stay in Inferno today.

167
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,075
-Really?
-Yes, because of the results.

168
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,914
-We didn't get to talk at all yesterday.
-I know.

169
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,001
It was like a twist of fate.

170
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,711
It was just so…

171
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:28,049
The first person
I'd like to go to Paradise with is…

172
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,759
Choi Min-woo.

173
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,012
Choi Min-woo.

174
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,557
I didn't expect this.

175
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,184
-You didn't?
-No.

176
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,811
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is

177
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,271
Yu Si-eun.

178
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,112
It was sad that our timing was always off.

179
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,406
-Are you crying?
-No.

180
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,033
Oh, no. What happened?

181
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,035
What's going on?

182
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,286
YESTERDAY

183
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,664
-I didn't know that happened.
-Yes.

184
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,999
-It must've been tough.
-I had a lot on my mind.

185
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,803
I've been thinking since yesterday.

186
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,347
When we first talked,

187
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,266
-I said you felt like my age.
-Yes.

188
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,935
It felt comfortable,
as if we were already friends.

189
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,981
So it made me wonder
if I only thought of you that way.

190
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,025
But you have been on my mind a lot.

191
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,071
I kept thinking about you
and wanted to get to know you more.

192
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,323
-Right.
-So I realized I had feelings for you.

193
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,241
I see.

194
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,743
To be completely honest with you,

195
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,246
I missed you yesterday.

196
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,124
I'm just being honest.

197
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,126
-Really?
-Yes.

198
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,170
He talks so well now.

199
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,548
-Seriously.
-What happened to Min-woo?

200
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,799
He's changed.

201
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,218
Really? I missed you too.

202
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,136
Really?

203
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,348
I hope there's more time for us
to chat like this.

204
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,226
-We can talk if we both stay.
-Don't go.

205
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,811
-I'm sure we'll both stay.
-Yes.

206
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,606
-Don't go.
-I'll stay no matter what.

207
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,774
-You have to stay.
-I will.

208
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,692
Promise me.

209
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,570
-You promise?
-Of course.

210
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,364
-Inferno will be a lot more fun today.
-I think so too.

211
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,327
I should just hold onto you.

212
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,705
What is it?

213
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,873
I'm feeling shy.

214
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,834
-What's going on?
-What?

215
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,002
-I'm really…
-What?

216
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,087
I'll just hold on.

217
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,259
Should we just stay here until dawn?

218
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,802
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

219
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,347
-Don't go even if someone picks you.
-All right.

220
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,266
-Let's swim and run away from here.
-Let's eat dinner here.

221
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,267
Okay.

222
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,479
She just asked him to run away with her.

223
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,522
-Are they going to elope?
-I know, right?

224
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,818
-I feel like it's all or nothing now.
-It's all or nothing?

225
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:58,157
Yes, I feel like I'm saying everything
I want to say even though I feel shy.

226
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,325
-I see.
-Yes.

227
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,912
Now, I should tell you
everything on my mind

228
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,747
because I don't want you
to go to Paradise.

229
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,665
I won't.

230
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,460
-Let's stay behind and have lots of fun.
-Yes.

231
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,504
I want to make fun memories with you.

232
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,422
Let's do everything we couldn't do.

233
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,216
Okay.

234
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,176
They're really expressing themselves.

235
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,513
-They're letting everything out.
-Exactly.

236
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,973
Inferno is quite pretty.

237
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,351
-It looks so pretty today.
-Right.

238
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,104
-Isn't it pretty?
-Yes, it's pretty.

239
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,148
The view is wonderful,
and so is the weather.

240
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,109
The island is pretty.

241
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,443
Where? There?

242
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,237
That island is so pretty.

243
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,698
It's so rugged and pretty.

244
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,825
-Right?
-Yes.

245
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,497
There was someone else
I wanted to talk to.

246
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,415
Okay.

247
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,962
But after this conversation,
I decided not to.

248
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,341
He's so cool.

249
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,926
That's it.

250
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,847
He better stick to what he just said.

251
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,933
-She's sensitive about stuff like this.
-Right.

252
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,185
It's great to be young and in love.

253
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,355
Let me rephrase that.
I'm not going to talk to her.

254
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,191
Why are you suddenly so driven?

255
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,818
-What?
-Really?

256
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,362
I feel like my feelings for you
just keep growing.

257
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,156
That's how I feel.

258
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,034
Right. What took us so long to meet?

259
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,539
Imagine how it would've been
if we had met from the start.

260
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,542
Our Paradise would've been here.

261
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,544
Yes, you're right.

262
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,715
I think I'm all good now.

263
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,509
-All set?
-I'm done thinking.

264
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,679
I'll say it.

265
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,930
-He's all set.
-He's done.

266
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,683
-They've both become certain.
-He's done thinking.

267
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,978
The fact that he made his decision
based on this short chat

268
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,648
even after his trip to Paradise
shows that he's pretty serious.

269
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,650
He looks much more at ease.

270
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,779
If I were him
and had made up my mind like that,

271
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:04,742
I'd go to Hye-seon, Ha-jeong and Min-ji
and ask them not to pick me today.

272
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:09,288
But what if they tell you
that they weren't going to anyway?

273
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,372
"Thanks."

274
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,169
Do I look pretty today?

275
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,881
-You looked better on our trip.
-Jeez.

276
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,842
I can't say you look prettier today
when you're not going with me.

277
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,637
Fine. Then I guess I still look pretty.

278
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,180
Well…

279
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,766
-You don't need to answer.
-A little.

280
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,813
I'm not wearing the heart ring today.

281
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,606
-You're not?
-There's no one to win over.

282
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,400
Don't wear the teddy bear
when you're with another guy.

283
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,736
-I won't.
-I really like that one.

284
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,532
Read it in your room.

285
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,117
Read it in your room.

286
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,537
Are you ready to make my wish come true?

287
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,579
LAST NIGHT

288
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,208
-We'll be back in Inferno tomorrow, right?
-Yes.

289
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:58,671
I want you to write me a letter
in under ten words.

290
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,588
A letter?

291
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,299
Read it in your room.

292
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,301
-In my room?
-No, read it now.

293
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,719
Now? Okay.

294
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,222
That's how I feel.

295
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,765
"There's no one else for me."

296
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,434
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE FOR ME

297
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,937
-Min-ji has also made up her mind.
-Right.

298
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,022
She's giving him assurance.

299
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,526
I tried so hard to win earlier.

300
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,614
Yes, I wanted to tell you earlier.
You shouldn't have gone after her.

301
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,285
You would've won second place
if you hadn't.

302
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,621
I only cared
about winning first place. Like you.

303
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,082
That's my mindset.

304
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,543
-But third place isn't so bad.
-Are you happy?

305
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,337
-I don't want you to wear green.
-This? Why not?

306
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,300
-I don't look good in green?
-It's not that.

307
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,218
-Don't I…
-Someone's also wearing green.

308
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,513
-Really?
-I feel like she might pick you.

309
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,890
Someone who might pick me?

310
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,391
Who?

311
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,852
Hye-seon.

312
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,645
-Hye-seon is wearing green?
-Yes.

313
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,650
I see.

314
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,987
But all the other guys
are assuming that she'll pick Won-ik.

315
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,702
I don't think she'll pick me.

316
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,704
Do you want her to not pick you?

317
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,623
I was getting ready to go with you.

318
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,629
But you came in third place,

319
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,090
so I figured you might end up
going with Jin-seok.

320
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,842
That's why I wrote you that note.

321
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,137
I didn't want you
to get the wrong idea after you left.

322
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,891
I'm not left with much of a choice.

323
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:40,731
If I end up leaving with someone else
before you even get to choose,

324
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,358
who are you planning to pick?

325
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,528
There's no one else I want to pick.
That's why I got upset and cried earlier.

326
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:51,784
I felt really bad earlier
when you lost and were about to cry.

327
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,661
Whatever.

328
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,289
You still need to think of someone
just in case that happens.

329
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,833
Probably Min-kyu or Jin-seok.

330
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,169
I'll talk to them
and consider whom to choose.

331
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,547
I think you should go with Jin-seok.

332
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,049
Why?

333
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,302
Because I trust
that he will be open with me

334
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,556
about how he feels about you
and what you guys did together

335
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,351
after you guys come back from the trip.

336
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:22,189
But Min-kyu and Won-ik
aren't the type to do that.

337
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,483
So is it because
you need to know everything?

338
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,484
-In writing?
-No.

339
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,070
-I don't care about how they feel.
-Okay.

340
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,824
I just want to know how you are with them.

341
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,493
Min-kyu is already set on someone.

342
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,912
-He was pretty much Gyu-ri's bodyguard.
-Yes.

343
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,040
So if I go with Min-kyu,
it's mostly to have a good time.

344
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,251
We'll just have fun and eat good food.

345
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,129
I don't think anything else will happen.

346
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,965
Well, but I still think

347
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,718
that it might be better for you
to go with Jin-seok.

348
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,554
Are you trying to confuse me again?

349
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,474
No, that's not my intention at all.

350
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:02,479
But if it's also in your heart
not to send me any mixed signals,

351
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,356
I suggest you go with Jin-seok.

352
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,482
-Really?
-Yes.

353
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,317
Are you saying he's no competition?

354
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,485
-No.
-Are you?

355
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,488
No, it's because I know
that Jin-seok is interested in you.

356
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,366
-Okay.
-So if he tells me

357
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,202
that he's actually set on you
after the trip…

358
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,871
Then what?

359
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,207
Then, I'll probably decide
to compete against him man-to-man.

360
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,625
-Really?
-Yes.

361
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,626
That's a surprise.

362
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,380
I really didn't expect
the conversation to pan out like this.

363
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,759
To put it simply,
I get why you think it might be better

364
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,261
to go with a person
who's already set on someone.

365
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,347
-Right.
-But this is an unusual situation.

366
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,225
-So I think…
-Is it because I'm too charming?

367
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,144
-Does that make you feel nervous?
-Well…

368
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,062
Yes, a little.

369
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,356
You're also worried
someone else might pick me.

370
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,194
I already know what's going to happen.
Someone else is going to pick you.

371
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,279
So you think Hye-seon will pick me?

372
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,655
Yes, I think so.

373
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,492
I mean, it's hard to say for certain.

374
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,286
And if she doesn't, then…

375
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,498
-What if she does pick me?
-Then, just sleep.

376
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,542
-Just sleep.
-Can I go inside the hot tub?

377
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,960
No, that's forbidden.

378
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,378
-Is that not allowed?
-No.

379
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,674
If you end up going with Min-kyu,
and I go with Hye-seon,

380
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,552
and the four of us sit side by side
in the helicopter,

381
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,806
imagine how suffocating it's going to be.

382
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,934
No, I think Min-kyu and I
will just be glad.

383
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,353
We won't expect much from each other.

384
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,188
We haven't even talked much.

385
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,191
I don't think I'd feel too happy about it.

386
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,234
Really? Min-kyu?

387
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,487
Anyway, thanks for keeping
your promise with the letter.

388
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,573
I thought you had forgotten.

389
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,409
I may not show it, but I never forget.

390
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,371
See you in the helicopter.

391
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,249
Don't be too nice to your partner.

392
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,337
Min-ji showed him her honest feelings

393
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,673
by writing him,
"There's no one else for me."

394
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:57,261
Do you think that made Gwan-hee
lean toward choosing Min-ji?

395
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,972
It's definitely affected him.

396
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,182
I'm sure it'll have a positive effect

397
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:06,103
since he's probably waited for her
to assertively express her feelings.

398
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,521
But here's the problem.

399
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,940
Gwan-hee took it a bit too far

400
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,860
by telling her to go with the guy
he chose for her.

401
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,738
And I don't think Min-ji understood
why that was so necessary.

402
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,033
-Does he think of Min-kyu as his rival?
-Do you think so?

403
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,785
-Because he's tall and fit?
-Right.

404
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:26,665
And maybe he feels bad
that he may end up going with Hye-seon.

405
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,336
What's bothering you?

406
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,629
I don't know what to do.

407
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,090
-Remember that talk I had with Gwan-hee?
-Yes.

408
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,386
Apparently, he didn't know how I felt
and couldn't quite figure me out.

409
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,597
When I was with him,

410
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,557
-he thought I was mature and calm.
-Okay.

411
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,559
And that's what he liked about me.

412
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,562
But I wasn't like that
when we were in a group,

413
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:52,232
-which left him feeling confused.
-Right.

414
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,027
But isn't it good that I'm calm
when we're alone

415
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,196
and more cheerful
when we're around others?

416
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,197
Oh, no.

417
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,532
-How cute.
-Ha-jeong.

418
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,203
As time goes by,
Ha-jeong's becoming more tame.

419
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:08,248
-It's so funny.
-But it's cute how she's ranting about it.

420
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,458
-Exactly.
-She's so cute.

421
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,918
She's not as feisty.

422
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,671
But isn't it good that I'm calm
when we're alone

423
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,965
and more cheerful
when we're around others?

424
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,051
He didn't think that was a good trait.

425
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,011
-I see.
-Anyway, that's how it is.

426
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,346
I don't know what to do,

427
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:27,559
and I feel like Gwan-hee
has been avoiding me since that talk.

428
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,647
Plus, he said he would tell me
about his decision in two days,

429
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,982
whether or not he decides to choose me.

430
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,068
-And that's today.
-Okay.

431
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,779
But he just left to talk to Min-ji.

432
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,367
-I see.
-Yes.

433
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:49,248
I still kind of hope that Gwan-hee
will choose me after he spends time

434
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,708
with all the other girls.

435
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,626
Right.

436
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,087
But I have no idea how he feels right now.

437
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,884
What can I do to make him mine?

438
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,471
What does he say when he's with the guys?

439
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,806
I can't tell you that.

440
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,307
-Why not?
-What?

441
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,142
-Why can't you tell me?
-I just can't.

442
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,936
It's a secret.

443
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,064
Jeez, I just poured my heart out.

444
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,734
-It's not my place to say.
-That's true.

445
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,529
Okay, I'll figure it out on my own.

446
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,827
And how he feels isn't what's important,
which is why I'd rather not say.

447
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,662
-I see.
-What counts is how you feel.

448
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,663
That's true.

449
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,583
It's not like you'll give up
if he likes someone else.

450
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,584
You're right.

451
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,838
-You never know how things will go.
-Exactly.

452
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:44,052
And who knows what will happen
if Min-ji chooses me instead of Gwan-hee?

453
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,888
I think Min-ji wants
to give it a shot with you,

454
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,183
but she probably can't
because it seems like you're already set.

455
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:55,314
I am interested in Min-ji,
especially after our time together.

456
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,231
Right.

457
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,650
But it's hard to say for sure how I feel.

458
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,819
I think you should talk to Min-ji.

459
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,280
-I'll talk to Gwan-hee.
-Sure, okay.

460
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,283
I should've won first place.

461
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,494
-It would've been fun if you won.
-Right?

462
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,457
Let's win over the person we like.

463
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,211
I guess they're already done talking.

464
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,006
Ask Min-ji to come with you,

465
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,633
and I'll ask Gwan-hee to talk.
How about that?

466
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,969
-Are they coming this way?
-Who?

467
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,180
Are you two done talking?

468
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,389
Yes, we're done.

469
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,266
-We should go somewhere else.
-Okay.

470
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,688
Congratulations on winning.
You'll finally get to go to Paradise.

471
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:41,485
It's a shame that I lost my balance
and fell. I could've won first place.

472
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,946
Have you decided who to pick?

473
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,866
Have I decided? What about you?

474
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,202
-Me?
-Have you decided?

475
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,746
-I don't get to choose.
-Are you settled on someone?

476
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,373
You said you'd tell me.

477
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,793
Well…

478
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,965
-Right.
-Just be honest with her.

479
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,884
Well…

480
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,347
I feel like things between us

481
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,810
after we returned from Paradise became…

482
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,731
You suddenly apologized to me,

483
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,735
but we never got a chance
to really talk about our feelings.

484
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,904
I think that caused us to become distant.

485
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,114
Okay.

486
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,199
So right now,

487
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,452
I feel rather distant from you.

488
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,496
-I see.
-That's how I feel.

489
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,165
It seemed that's how you felt.

490
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:43,046
After we had that argument,

491
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,467
I found myself getting upset at you.

492
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,513
I obviously wouldn't have felt that way
if I didn't like you in the first place.

493
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,641
But before I even got a chance
to talk about those feelings,

494
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,978
you just came to me and apologized.

495
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,189
So I never got an opportunity
to share how I felt.

496
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,232
I see.

497
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,985
I think that's

498
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,989
what may have caused us to…

499
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:14,244
-Become distant?
-I think that's why I feel so distant.

500
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,412
Because I apologized?

501
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,747
Or was it even before that?

502
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:25,088
I think things may have been different
if we had actually talked about it.

503
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,800
But you suddenly apologized
for everything so seriously.

504
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,344
So things became awkward for me.

505
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,262
I could tell.

506
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,598
I could feel that you were avoiding me.

507
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,185
I feel like we could've resolved
the issue naturally

508
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,729
by acting as if nothing had happened.

509
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,690
I thought you would've wanted…

510
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,277
You said you wanted me
to approach you more,

511
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,365
which is why I thought
it'd be a good idea to apologize first.

512
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:56,411
I figured I should approach you first
and tell you how I feel.

513
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,872
That's why I did what I did.

514
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,373
You really didn't have to.

515
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,709
I wouldn't have minded.

516
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,421
It just kept bothering me.

517
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,049
That's why I apologized.

518
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,678
-Does that mean…
-You shouldn't have gotten so angry.

519
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,596
Me?

520
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,474
I can't help it.
I get so angry whenever I talk to you.

521
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,393
You keep teasing me.

522
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,938
-Did I make you that angry?
-Yes.

523
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,943
You and I are similar in a way,
which is why I got so angry at first.

524
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,446
But I understand now that I know
where you're coming from.

525
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:38,286
I know we kind of grew apart
over the past couple of days,

526
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,747
but I still remember
the good times we had.

527
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,834
I remember how much fun we had
in the helicopter and even before that.

528
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,546
I feel the same way.

529
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,258
The best time I've had so far
was with you.

530
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,676
-Really?
-Yes.

531
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,136
And you're still the one
I'm most curious about.

532
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,513
-Me?
-Yes.

533
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,933
I wonder who you will choose in the end.

534
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,059
-In the end?
-Yes.

535
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,144
Who do you think I'll pick?

536
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,145
-You?
-Yes.

537
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,272
I hope it'll be me.

538
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,697
As we're watching the footage,

539
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,326
I keep hearing Kyuhyun sighing next to me.

540
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,036
-Why?
-He feels so bad for her.

541
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,080
I find myself rooting for Ha-jeong,

542
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,083
hoping things will work out
for her and Gwan-hee.

543
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,335
Ha-jeong didn't even do anything wrong.

544
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,422
-Gwan-hee was the one who acted out.
-Yes, exactly.

545
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,673
-So she told him.
-Yes.

546
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,300
Here's what I think.

547
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:37,012
Gwan-hee made it clear
and said that he felt distant from her.

548
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,764
-Right.
-Then, he listed all the reasons why.

549
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,310
He blamed her for apologizing to him
and bad timing.

550
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,146
-It makes no sense.
-But it was all meaningless talk.

551
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,065
I think he was just not that into her.

552
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:53,236
He could've just told her
that he had feelings for someone else,

553
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,572
but he kept beating around the bush.

554
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,365
Maybe he just felt bad.

555
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,826
-Yes, I think so too.
-After all that he's done?

556
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,581
I guess he felt sorry to tell her
that he had feelings for someone else.

557
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,167
He could've told her
that he liked someone else,

558
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,419
but he blamed her for getting mad at him

559
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:13,131
-Yes, that was a bit…
-and said she shouldn't have apologized.

560
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:17,135
-He made things more difficult for her.
-That made me angry too.

561
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,803
They're all just excuses.

562
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,390
What's worse is that Ha-jeong
keeps trying to find the cause of it all.

563
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,392
"Was it because I apologized?"

564
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,519
"Was it because the timing was off?"

565
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,439
It breaks my heart
because it makes her question herself.

566
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:33,693
The person who ends up getting hurt
is always the one who's more in love.

567
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,737
-Yes, that's true.
-They get hurt more.

568
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,992
Today's conversation
made a big difference.

569
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,535
-Totally.
-It really did.

570
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,870
I want to walk with you.

571
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,538
-Right?
-Yes.

572
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,956
I want to take a walk too.

573
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,002
-Watch your step when you go down.
-Okay.

574
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,047
-Should I hold your hand?
-Yes.

575
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,384
Your hand is so cold.

576
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,301
-Me?
-Yes.

577
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,928
My hands are usually cold.

578
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,013
-It's our first time holding hands.
-It is?

579
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,307
Because we never went
to Paradise together.

580
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,809
Let's think we're going now.

581
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:06,726
Okay.

582
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,603
This is our Paradise.

583
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,521
Yes.

584
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,440
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

585
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,652
-The weather is so nice.
-Should we walk here?

586
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,611
Here?

587
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,947
-Your feet don't hurt?
-Yes, they're fine.

588
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,450
Should we walk back and forth around here?

589
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,493
Back and forth?

590
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,037
That's so funny.

591
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,873
It really made up for all the tough times.

592
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,291
It was wonderful.

593
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:35,672
Whenever I talk to Min-woo,
this place turns from Inferno to Paradise.

594
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,216
Yes, I was happy.

595
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,054
I felt something new
when I went to Paradise with Gyu-ri,

596
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,389
and we had a great time.

597
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,726
But I couldn't figure out
what exactly was on her mind.

598
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,145
On the other hand,
Si-eun was completely honest

599
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,230
and told me how she felt about me.

600
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,024
So I've decided to pick Si-eun.

601
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,988
Do men also prefer women
who are more honest about their feelings

602
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,741
than women who act coy?

603
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,285
I think it's all about the timing.

604
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:09,330
There needs to be a definite moment
where the woman begins to express herself.

605
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,917
But I don't think
Min-woo felt that with Gyu-ri.

606
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,754
-I see.
-It probably made him feel confused.

607
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,841
That probably led him to think
that he and Gyu-ri aren't a good match

608
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,551
and made him choose Si-eun.

609
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,846
-Right.
-I wonder if he'll stick to his decision.

610
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,640
-If Gyu-ri approaches him
-Exactly.

611
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,477
and starts flirting with him again,
things could change.

612
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,438
-I don't think it'll sway him.
-Gyu-ri's staying in Inferno too.

613
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:37,734
-Right.
-So he'll get a chance to talk to her.

614
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,111
-Things could change.
-He'll run into her

615
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,489
unless he hides from her.

616
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,866
He's way too tall to hide himself.

617
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,705
I wonder if there's anyone at the table.

618
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,626
I was thinking the same thing.
I was hoping no one would be there.

619
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,127
-That's what I thought.
-Yes.

620
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,921
Please.

621
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,051
-Hello.
-Hello.

622
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,805
-You seem to have a lot on your mind.
-Nothing's on my mind.

623
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,765
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

624
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,059
-It doesn't seem that way.
-No, I'm fine.

625
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,310
-Si-eun.
-Yes?

626
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,937
Take me to Paradise today.

627
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,106
-Right. You didn't win third place.
-No, I didn't.

628
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,235
-Are you teasing me?
-You tried so hard, though.

629
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,196
Today, Paradise is here in Inferno for me.

630
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,282
I can't say why, though.

631
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,701
Will you be staying here
with the man you like?

632
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,662
Who knows if he can't or won't go?

633
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,917
I need to go to my room.

634
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,210
-Sure.
-I need my lip balm.

635
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,010
Why aren't you out there?

636
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,929
-What?
-I got to talk to him.

637
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,472
Min-woo? How was it?

638
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,975
He really knows how to make

639
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,268
-What?
-my heart flutter.

640
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,144
Really?

641
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,063
Well…

642
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,440
-We felt the same.
-She's excited.

643
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,987
Si-eun's trying to tell Hye-seon something
by telling her that her heart fluttered.

644
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,989
-You're right.
-It's a smart move.

645
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,866
-Hye-seon can't pick Min-woo.
-No.

646
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,034
-She can't.
-She can't pick him after this.

647
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,411
Well…

648
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,204
-You were with him until now?
-Yes.

649
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,373
What was there to talk about for so long?

650
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,791
Gosh, seriously.

651
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,253
What did I come here for?
Oh, right. Lipstick.

652
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,546
I feel so…

653
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,381
-How was it?
-What?

654
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,340
How was it?

655
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,341
I loved it.

656
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,385
Oh my god.

657
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,678
What did you talk about?

658
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,933
Things like what took us so long to meet.

659
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,060
And…

660
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:37,896
Min-woo said that?

661
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,355
Yes, we both did.

662
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,485
That and… He also said he missed me.

663
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,612
My gosh.

664
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,907
So I think I'll be fine
even if someone picks him today.

665
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,034
He must've really reassured you.

666
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,870
My heart raced like crazy the whole time.

667
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,540
My gosh. That's crazy.

668
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,834
Gosh, this is so huge.

669
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,004
After this…

670
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,592
After this, I hope Si-eun
also tells Ha-jeong

671
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,719
that her heart raced like crazy.

672
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,347
-I hope she tells Min-ji too.
-Me too.

673
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,564
Who's Hye-seon talking to?

674
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,525
Hye-seon is probably alone in her room.

675
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,985
You should talk to her.

676
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,070
Is she in her room?

677
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,282
Hye-seon looks…

678
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,242
-I guess she's still deciding.
-Right.

679
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,412
Go talk to her.
You're wearing the same color.

680
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,791
-You're wearing matching outfits.
-You look happy.

681
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,708
No, I don't.

682
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,503
-Look at that smile.
-Is she alone in her room?

683
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,717
Are you sick?

684
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,635
No.

685
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,303
Why are you here?

686
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,346
No reason.

687
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,098
You seem to be in a good mood.

688
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,642
-What do you mean?
-You look happy.

689
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,186
-I thought you'd be talking to someone.
-No.

690
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,105
Why are you inside?

691
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,440
I just…

692
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,985
-What is it?
-I just feel so drained.

693
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,655
-What's this rabbit? It's cute.
-Isn't it?

694
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,615
-Whose is this?
-Si-eun.

695
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,118
She will be sleeping here alone tonight,

696
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,161
so she'll sleep with that next to her.

697
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,707
I like the color of your outfit.

698
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,208
It looks nice, doesn't it?

699
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,835
We're wearing the same color.

700
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,129
You have lots of green clothes.

701
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,755
I just grabbed whatever.

702
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,798
-So you wore that?
-Yes.

703
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,050
-I like the color.
-Yes, so I put it on.

704
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,678
Have you made up your mind?

705
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,056
-No idea.
-Not yet?

706
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,436
I haven't, but I have a feeling
that I'm holding the cards.

707
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,354
Did you chat with anyone?

708
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,857
No, I didn't feel like
I had to talk to anyone.

709
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,568
Then, did you stay in here the whole time?

710
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,611
-No, I spoke briefly to Won-ik.
-Won-ik?

711
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,529
Yes.

712
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,241
Do you want to go?

713
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,369
Paradise is my home at this point.

714
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,372
I just go there, eat what I always eat,

715
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,958
and sleep where I always sleep.

716
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:08,212
I figured you might think that way,
so it got a little annoying.

717
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,672
Seriously.

718
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,885
Min-ji told me that she had so much fun
when she went with you.

719
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,262
On top of that, she's your type.

720
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:20,767
You like women who approach you first
and make the first move.

721
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,893
So I thought…

722
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,228
What's going on?

723
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,688
Isn't this my room?

724
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,192
-Why was she startled? Who was that?
-Min-ji.

725
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,152
-Is this her room?
-Yes, that's her bed.

726
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,195
This is her bed?

727
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,780
I see.

728
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,742
-That's just what I thought.
-I see.

729
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,661
I actually wanted to ask you something.

730
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,497
-I'll ask you this and go.
-Okay.

731
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,124
It's about how you chose Won-ik.

732
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,422
If you could turn back time,
would you still have gone with Won-ik?

733
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,344
His questions are starting to exhaust me.

734
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,013
-Yes, it's exhausting.
-Very much.

735
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,307
He keeps asking for confirmation.

736
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,517
-Yes, continuously.
-Yes.

737
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,145
…would you still have gone with Won-ik?

738
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,857
Yes, I think so.

739
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,025
-With Won-ik?
-Yes.

740
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,236
It's… But why?

741
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,779
Nothing.

742
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,869
Gosh, seriously.

743
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,955
Why does Gwan-hee keep doing that?

744
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,748
He doesn't need to be like that.

745
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,501
-He's already doing pretty well.
-Exactly.

746
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,586
Oh, my goodness.

747
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,257
I just don't understand his behavior.

748
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,677
I feel like all he's doing right now
is making Hye-seon think

749
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,930
that there's still a chance for things
to work out between them.

750
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,933
-Right.
-But think about what he said to Min-ji.

751
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,018
So I don't get why he's giving her hope

752
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,979
-when he should be avoiding her.
-Right.

753
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,815
-He's just keeping his options open.
-He is.

754
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,983
-He's back at it?
-Yes.

755
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,901
Is it a split of 51 to 49?

756
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,278
I think so.

757
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,239
I think he's keeping
that window open for her.

758
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,784
We're all familiar with the way
he constantly wants reassurance,

759
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,787
and it looks like Hye-seon knows it too.

760
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,249
And I think she's pondering
whether to play along with it or not.

761
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,585
With Ha-jeong, he made himself clear

762
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,045
that things won't work out between them.

763
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:19,051
But with Hye-seon, it feels like
he wants to keep the possibility open.

764
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,013
Instead of having an honest
and open conversation,

765
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,141
he keeps beating around the bush
and asking her about Won-ik.

766
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,601
-He's cowardly.
-Yes.

767
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,853
-He's being such a coward.
-Right.

768
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,231
Da-hee usually isn't the type
to get angry like this.

769
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,442
But she's pretty mad right now.

770
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,444
-She wanted to call him out.
-Right.

771
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,572
Gwan-hee deserves it, though.

772
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,784
But on a serious note,
I can't help but agree with you.

773
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,580
He never expresses his feelings,
but he expects the other person to do so.

774
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,374
Yes, it's really self-centered.

775
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,543
Hey, did you have a good chat?

776
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,253
What's wrong?

777
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,298
-There wasn't much to talk about.
-I was worried.

778
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,008
You kind of looked down.

779
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,765
Now that I've talked to Hye-seon,
I feel a bit…

780
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,308
You're impossible!

781
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,853
-Unbelievable.
-He really makes things interesting.

782
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,731
After I talked to Min-ji,

783
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,192
my mind was pretty much set.

784
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,778
-Set on whom?
-Did she feel like a little sister?

785
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,908
-I was pretty much set on Min-ji, but…
-I see.

786
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,576
-You were set?
-Yes.

787
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,788
That's why I had no plan
to talk to Hye-seon.

788
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,165
Because I didn't think she'd pick me.

789
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,043
But I went looking for her out of concern.

790
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,379
And once we got around to talking…

791
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,132
Hye-seon was the first person
I went to Paradise with.

792
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:45,972
-I remembered the time we spent together.
-That's pretty significant.

793
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,308
And I still can't forget
our first encounter by the beach.

794
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,852
She was really considerate of me.

795
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,770
Right.

796
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,481
-It all came back to me again.
-I see.

797
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,149
So…

798
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,569
It just felt kind of weird.

799
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,071
I get it.

800
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:07,910
Min-ji handed me a note
during our one-on-one date,

801
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:12,498
and it said, "There's no one else for me."

802
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,002
The fact that she decided
to take another step forward

803
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:21,590
is one of the many reasons why
I keep leaning toward choosing her.

804
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,135
I don't care who approaches me anymore.

805
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,680
I just don't want
my feelings for Min-ji to change.

806
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:34,061
But if I go to Paradise with Hye-seon,
I know for sure that I'll get swayed.

807
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:39,650
So based on how I currently feel,
I'd rather not go with Hye-seon.

808
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,947
In order not to get swayed?

809
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,283
Yes, he knows he'll get swayed.

810
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,829
-I guess he just knows himself very well.
-Exactly.

811
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,581
-"I know I'll get swayed."
-Right.

812
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,500
-That was an honest interview.
-That's why.

813
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,462
-I mean, people can easily get tempted.
-Of course.

814
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,922
Let's say you know for a fact
that you'll end up

815
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,508
spending time with other women
if you go clubbing,

816
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,093
and that's why you never go.

817
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,304
-It's the same logic.
-You're right.

818
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,306
-It's his way of staying faithful.
-Yes.

819
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,308
-Everyone is so intriguing.
-Yes.

820
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,104
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

821
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,272
PARADISE-BOUND COUPLE MATCHING BEGINS

822
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,633
Starting with Choi Hye-seon,
who came in first,

823
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,345
please select the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

824
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,474
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

825
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,230
If Hye-seon doesn't choose Gwan-hee,

826
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,981
I think I will.

827
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,115
I had fun when I went
to Paradise with Gwan-hee.

828
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,200
I want to create more memories there.

829
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,911
I'm hoping things will go my way.

830
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,916
-I have a connection to all three of them.
-That's right.

831
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,710
It must be nerve-racking
being caught in the middle.

832
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,968
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

833
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,429
-Who is it?
-Lee Gwan-hee?

834
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,639
-I have no idea.
-I think she'll choose him.

835
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,475
-It'll be Gwan-hee.
-She'll choose Gwan-hee.

836
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,906
Lee Gwan-hee.

837
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,788
-Hye-seon is going with Gwan-hee.
-That makes sense.

838
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,752
Her decision is going to have
a huge impact on the outcome of this show.

839
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,297
-In that moment?
-Yes, it'll change things up.

840
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,508
-He has no choice but to go clubbing now.
-That's right.

841
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,636
What's going to happen?

842
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,847
Lee Gwan-hee.

843
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,766
Lee Gwan-hee.

844
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,859
Choi Hye-seon has selected Lee Gwan-hee.

845
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,571
Lee Gwan-hee,
please hold Choi Hye-seon's hand

846
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,282
-and leave for Paradise.
-Have fun in Paradise.

847
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,159
Enjoy the sirloin.

848
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,547
Let's go.

849
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,731
That was a surprise.

850
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,151
This feels kind of odd.

851
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,152
Why?

852
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,279
It just feels odd.

853
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,572
What do you mean?

854
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,449
Well…

855
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,954
A part of me wanted you to pick me.

856
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:25,000
And it kind of feels like
we've circled back to each other.

857
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,127
That's just how I feel.

858
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,095
This brings back memories
of us swimming together.

859
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,849
I remember everything you said to me
in the hot tub that night.

860
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,726
What did I say?

861
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,231
You said your feelings wouldn't change
even if you met other women.

862
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,315
Right.

863
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,486
That makes it sound like
I'm a player or something.

864
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,583
Next is Yun Ha-jeong, who came in second.

865
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:11,005
Yun Ha-jeong, please select the person
you'd like to go to Paradise with.

866
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,718
-Why are you nervous?
-This is intense.

867
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,931
I wonder who she'll choose.

868
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,352
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is

869
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,355
Yun Ha-bin.

870
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,193
Yun Ha-jeong has selected Yun Ha-bin.

871
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,194
Yun Ha-bin,

872
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,698
please hold Yun Ha-jeong's hand
and leave for Paradise.

873
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:38,991
Ha-bin!

874
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,118
-I'll see you when I get back.
-Goodness!

875
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,328
Have fun.

876
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,872
I hope you have a great time.

877
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,418
I can't believe this.

878
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,588
-Finally.
-We'll get to find out what he does.

879
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,007
-Everyone is clapping for him.
-His age as well.

880
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,474
-Let's go.
-Okay.

881
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,269
You're going to Paradise, thanks to me.

882
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:13,692
You should be taking me,
not the other way around.

883
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,486
I thought I would win.

884
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,280
You should've fought tooth and nail
to win that race.

885
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,158
-Tooth and nail…
-You should've picked up your pace.

886
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,497
Lastly, we have Cho Min-ji,
who came in third.

887
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,625
I think she'll pick Jin-seok.

888
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,795
-I wonder who Min-ji will pick.
-Me too.

889
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,088
I'm really curious.

890
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,549
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

891
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,595
-Will she do as Gwan-hee asked?
-Oh, right.

892
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,098
-I think she'll choose Jin-seok.
-Jin-seok.

893
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,933
She might pick Min-kyu.

894
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,309
-Yes.
-There's a chance.

895
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,736
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

896
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,323
Park Min-kyu.

897
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,076
Park Min-kyu.

898
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,163
Park Min-kyu, please hold
Cho Min-ji's hand and leave for Paradise.

899
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,791
Park Min-kyu.

900
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,337
Park Min-kyu, please hold
Cho Min-ji's hand and leave for Paradise.

901
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,300
Jin-seok looks disappointed.

902
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,052
He does look disappointed.

903
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:27,099
Park Min-kyu, please hold
Cho Min-ji's hand and leave for Paradise.

904
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,519
Did Min-ji and Min-kyu have a thing?

905
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,770
I don't know.

906
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,650
-Gosh. I really--
-I want to eat good food

907
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,194
-and just have a good time.
-Of course.

908
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,155
-You know?
-Let's eat lots of good food.

909
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,656
That sounds great.

910
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,746
Min-ji didn't pick the person
Gwan-hee asked her to pick.

911
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,038
-She picked Min-kyu.
-Yes.

912
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,959
But Gwan-hee made it clear
that he didn't want her to pick Min-kyu.

913
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:58,172
I think Min-ji's choice
will cause a big fuss.

914
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,131
Really?

915
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:05,095
Gwan-hee would've felt assured
only if Min-ji had picked Jin-seok,

916
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,264
but Min-ji picked Min-kyu.

917
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:11,977
So he'll probably keep his options open
and enjoy Paradise with Hye-seon.

918
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,896
-Knowing Gwan-hee,
-Yes.

919
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:17,483
he'll be taken aback
because he asked her to go with Jin-seok.

920
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,400
Exactly.

921
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,694
She chose not to listen to him

922
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,821
-Right.
-and picked Min-kyu instead.

923
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,950
-He may go for Hye-seon--
-He could be offended by her choice.

924
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,454
-She doesn't have to do what he says.
-That's true, but it's Gwan-hee.

925
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,456
-Gwan-hee…
-He's just that type of guy.

926
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,832
My goodness.

927
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,294
But how could you let
every little thing get to you like that?

928
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,587
I don't think he'll…

929
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,591
-Are you sure?
-Maybe we're being too harsh on him.

930
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:46,178
-No, I think it'll be important to him.
-I agree.

931
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,639
-Min-ji's choice will matter to him.
-Really?

932
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,896
So this is what the view looks like
from up here.

933
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,665
-Oh, my.
-Min-ji just tapped him on the arm.

934
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,500
-What…
-She just poked him.

935
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,636
-Oh, dear.
-See? Look at Gwan-hee!

936
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,513
This is so crazy!

937
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,474
-Min-kyu just saw that.
-It's crazy!

938
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,809
Hold on a second.

939
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,659
Is she crying?

940
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,703
-Oh, no.
-Goodness.

941
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,705
It's because Gwan-hee is ignoring her.

942
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,665
What's going on?

943
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,388
We're spending
the first and last dates together.

944
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,559
It's not so bad, right?

945
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,687
I think it's bad.

946
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,771
Why?

947
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,703
I feel so bad for Min-kyu.

948
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,080
-What…
-"Wipe your tears."

949
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,249
-He offered his shirt.
-Oh, no.

950
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,377
What on earth is going on right now?

951
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,803
I picked you, but I'm crying like this.
I'm sorry.

952
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,016
Min-ji, there's nothing to feel bad about.

953
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:01,396
I don't care about my shirt,
so just use this to wipe your tears, okay?

954
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,371
Who would offer their shirt like that?

955
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,956
This is hilarious.

956
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,667
If she was going to cry
and be so heartbroken,

957
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,211
she should've picked Jin-seok
like Gwan-hee asked.

958
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,380
-Exactly.
-Why did she pick Min-kyu

959
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,548
if she would be like that?

960
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,176
-How would Min-kyu feel?
-She's even crying.

961
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,094
I know.

962
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,637
-Min-kyu's just…
-He must feel--

963
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,972
He's so nice, though.

964
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,391
I think Min-kyu's tearing up a bit too.

965
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,393
Hye-seon didn't see that, right?

966
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,978
She didn't see it.

967
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:49,361
I cried because up until yesterday,
Gwan-hee was…

968
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,696
No, not even yesterday.

969
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:55,826
He was very sweet and nice to me
until this morning,

970
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,997
but when I chose Min-kyu,
he seemed very disappointed in me.

971
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,500
I think that's why
he acted so cold toward me,

972
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,377
and that made me so upset.

973
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,587
There was no one else for me.

974
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:12,384
I made the best decision I could,
so it hurt when he didn't understand me.

975
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:17,055
Gwan-hee's own feelings
don't seem to matter too much to him.

976
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,976
-He's affected by how others treat him.
-It affects him a lot.

977
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,644
-You're right.
-That's how he is.

978
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,021
That's so exhausting.

979
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:28,066
If he has a great time
in Paradise with Hye-seon,

980
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,901
-he may fall for her again.
-Right.

981
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,738
But when he returns
and spends quality time with Min-ji,

982
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,114
he may fall for Min-ji.

983
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,575
-You never know.
-We won't know until the end.

984
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,411
The last person to talk to him
may win him over.

985
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,372
-We can't assume anything just yet.
-You just need to wait.

986
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,041
-We can't?
-No, we can't.

987
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,334
-It's not over until it's over.
-It's not over.

988
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,920
PARADISE
CHOI HYE-SEON & LEE GWAN-HEE

989
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,380
This place looks different.

990
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,465
Is it a different room?

991
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,509
Look at the welcome gift.
I've been looking forward to this.

992
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,345
-I'm so happy.
-They didn't have this last night.

993
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,014
It's just like our first night.

994
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,182
-It is.
-It's macarons.

995
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,101
Are these Korean melons and mangoes?
I was right!

996
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,478
It's like our first date.

997
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,021
I really missed this.

998
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,690
They set up everything
just like our first date.

999
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,400
Those flowers are gorgeous.

1000
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:14,029
There are two beds in here.
You won't have to sleep on the couch.

1001
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,573
-How was it last time?
-We only had one big bed.

1002
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,033
-One?
-Yes.

1003
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:22,079
-You can sleep in the bedroom tonight.
-Since you won, I'll do as you say.

1004
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,873
I'll sleep anywhere you tell me to.

1005
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,250
If I tell you to,
will you sleep on the floor?

1006
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,293
Yes, of course.

1007
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,424
Let's wash our hands
and eat the welcome food.

1008
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,383
Sounds great.

1009
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,719
All right!

1010
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,265
I think I was here this morning.

1011
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,810
This may be the room
I stayed in last night.

1012
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,020
Lucky you.

1013
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,023
-You're using the same room
-I know.

1014
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,485
-with two different women.
-Same room but different partners, right?

1015
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,987
How long has it been?

1016
00:51:56,071 --> 00:52:00,200
I think it's been about a week.
It took a whole week for us to come back.

1017
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,536
You're right. Goodness.

1018
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,164
-It took us six days to get back together.
-I know.

1019
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,919
It sounds like a short period of time,
but so many things have happened.

1020
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:14,589
I know.

1021
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,009
When we walked into the room,

1022
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:22,556
we saw the same snacks
we had on our first date together.

1023
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,517
It brought back a lot of memories for me,

1024
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,018
and it felt special.

1025
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:30,480
She was the first person
I went to Paradise with,

1026
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,151
and also the last person
I went to Paradise with.

1027
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:38,738
That was quite meaningful to me.

1028
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:44,452
I had a good impression of her
from the beginning.

1029
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,705
I think that's why I felt the way I did.

1030
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:50,417
He might think it's fate
and that they're meant to be together.

1031
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,086
I may be wrong.

1032
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,297
How do I back him up?

1033
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,174
Gwan-hee.

1034
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,717
"How do I back him up?"

1035
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,553
Oh, my.

1036
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,764
This looks so good.

1037
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,517
It looks delicious. This is crazy.

1038
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,854
Hold on. What should I try first?

1039
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,273
-Try this one.
-This?

1040
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,488
It's so good.

1041
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,033
-Is it?
-Yes.

1042
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,999
This is so good.

1043
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,796
I haven't been with you in a while,
so I'm not used to your energy.

1044
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:42,385
I want you to know
that you don't have to match my energy.

1045
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,185
Didn't you want to come
to Paradise with Won-ik again?

1046
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:55,190
Won-ik and I talk about so many things,

1047
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,735
but I never remember anything.

1048
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,240
I see you grinning.

1049
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:13,959
Won-ik is great. He's interesting,
and I like talking to him.

1050
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:18,463
He's nice, gentle,
and a great guy overall.

1051
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:23,802
But I don't think I'm myself
when I'm with him.

1052
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:27,180
There was this one time
I talked to you right after Won-ik.

1053
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:32,185
That's when it dawned on me
that I can be myself when I'm with you,

1054
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,853
without putting on a front.

1055
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,691
I like the fact that I can be myself.

1056
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,278
So when I talked to you on that couch,
I had already decided.

1057
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,864
It didn't matter
who you went to Paradise with.

1058
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,825
My mind was set on you.

1059
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,410
So…

1060
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:54,582
If I had gone to Paradise
with Ha-jeong or Min-ji today,

1061
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,794
-would you…
-It wouldn't have changed my mind.

1062
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,713
It wouldn't?

1063
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:00,630
No.

1064
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:08,305
To be completely honest with you,

1065
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,683
-I hoped you wouldn't pick me.
-Why not?

1066
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,852
Well…

1067
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,647
I didn't want to complicate things.

1068
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,065
-Complicate what?
-I mean…

1069
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,902
You started avoiding me
after going to Paradise with Won-ik.

1070
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,822
So I thought we were growing apart.

1071
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,533
-I see.
-That's when Min-ji approached me

1072
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,744
and wanted to talk to me.

1073
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,497
Even though I didn't make the first move,

1074
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,334
she still came and approached me first.

1075
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:41,171
That's when my curiosity for her
turned into attraction.

1076
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,381
-I think I get it.
-At that time,

1077
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,509
-you were out of the picture.
-Right.

1078
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:52,849
On top of that, everyone thought
that you had your eyes on Won-ik.

1079
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,518
It felt like things were going that way.

1080
00:55:55,602 --> 00:56:01,733
So I figured what you told me
was a white lie to make me feel better.

1081
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,152
-Not at all.
-It made me think so.

1082
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:10,867
I already knew how I would feel tomorrow

1083
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:14,037
if I went to Paradise with you,
so that's why

1084
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,539
I wanted to avoid you.

1085
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:27,675
The thing I don't get
is why I keep thinking about you.

1086
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,928
I really don't know.

1087
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,055
-It's because I'm the cutest.
-I didn't miss you.

1088
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,267
Ever since then, I haven't missed you,
but you're somehow on my mind.

1089
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,144
Because you find me the cutest.

1090
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:43,274
If you had gone to Paradise
with me instead of Won-ik,

1091
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,902
I would've been set on you.

1092
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:50,990
I was just about to seal the deal,
but I looked away for a split second.

1093
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:56,413
It's as if I was gone for a short moment,
and things just turned out this way.

1094
00:56:56,496 --> 00:57:00,083
That was how I felt.

1095
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,170
Well, I didn't think that through.

1096
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,297
I don't usually overthink things.

1097
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,466
I just thought you'd be okay with it

1098
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,261
since I told you
that I wasn't going to go with you.

1099
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:14,472
I knew you'd be disappointed,
but I thought you'd let it go.

1100
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:20,728
From my perspective, I could deal
with the fact that you picked Won-ik.

1101
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,981
-But that's when--
-Everyone started talking?

1102
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:27,068
Everyone started talking,
but no one was mentioning me.

1103
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,528
I didn't tell anyone.

1104
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:32,365
When they were talking about you,
I wasn't even in the picture.

1105
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:37,454
Everyone said that you were set on Won-ik,
and that's when Min-ji approached me.

1106
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:44,836
I was disappointed in you
for letting things get to that point.

1107
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,921
Basically, you're super upset with me.

1108
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,343
No, I'm not upset.

1109
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:57,015
At any rate,
I went to Paradise with Min-ji.

1110
00:57:57,098 --> 00:58:00,602
I'm telling you all of this
so you understand where I'm coming from.

1111
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:04,105
-You want me to be on my toes, don't you?
-You were the last person

1112
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:08,860
I wanted to share this with,
but I have no choice since we're here.

1113
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:16,743
I don't think I've shared this with you.

1114
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,829
-Well…
-There's more you haven't told me?

1115
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,290
What is it this time?

1116
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,504
You know I'm the outgoing type.

1117
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:31,925
I like to express myself
and can relate to others easily.

1118
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,553
But when I actually need
to express how I feel,

1119
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,598
I tend to shy away from doing so.

1120
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,730
Even after the race,
when you were standing next to me,

1121
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:49,025
I didn't know what to do,
so I just looked at your pants.

1122
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,902
I couldn't look you in the eye.

1123
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:55,114
You keep saying that I avoided you, but…

1124
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,244
-Why did you avoid me?
-If I'm being honest,

1125
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,871
I don't know why, but I was shy.

1126
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,874
It wasn't easy for me
to look you in the eye.

1127
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,670
When you came back,
you could've told me how it went.

1128
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,256
You could've just said hello,
but you avoided me.

1129
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,799
What was I supposed to think?

1130
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,300
I wanted you to talk to me.

1131
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:17,262
Should I have when you were avoiding me?

1132
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,263
Yes.

1133
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:21,474
When I was out on a date
with the other guys,

1134
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:26,980
I think I was hoping
you'd come over and talk to me.

1135
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,444
I think you knew how I felt
because you'd come and talk to me.

1136
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,447
You're right. I did.

1137
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:41,327
Have you ever had
a fishbone stuck in your throat?

1138
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,832
You're like a fishbone
that I just can't seem to get rid of.

1139
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,376
It's such a shame

1140
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,630
that this whole situation
unfolded the way it did.

1141
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,048
Do you know what I'm like?

1142
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,762
It may sound weird
because you're older than me,

1143
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:04,851
but when I'm seeing someone

1144
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,563
or when I'm attracted to
or interested in a person,

1145
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:13,109
I tend to try to look after them.

1146
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,279
I think I'm kind of like that with you.

1147
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,285
You have a way…

1148
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,122
of moving me.

1149
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:31,252
That's why it's really tough for me

1150
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,714
to push you away.

1151
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,467
So this is…

1152
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,722
I have no idea what to do at this point.

1153
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,100
Everything's up to you now.

1154
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,485
It seems Gwan-hee has no idea
how he feels right now.

1155
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:59,238
-He likes both Hye-seon and Min-ji.
-He likes them both.

1156
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,407
Here's what I think is happening.

1157
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:05,495
Gwan-hee liked Hye-seon from the start,

1158
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:08,206
but Ha-jeong and Min-ji
made their moves on him.

1159
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:12,710
When the two ladies approached him,
he didn't exactly hate it.

1160
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,630
That's why he didn't turn them down,

1161
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:18,216
but deep down,
he's had feelings for Hye-seon.

1162
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:22,303
As Hye-seon mentioned,
it's all up to Gwan-hee now.

1163
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,932
Hye-seon made it clear to him
that since the beginning,

1164
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:29,018
it's always been him for her.

1165
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,437
Why are all these women
attracted to Gwan-hee?

1166
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,815
He has a way of drawing people in.

1167
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,775
-I guess so.
-He's quite funny.

1168
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,568
-He's funny.
-He's fun to be around.

1169
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,196
He's the only one
who doesn't try to act cool.

1170
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:43,533
We should give him some credit
and stop bad-mouthing him.

1171
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:44,951
-Right.
-I give him credit.

1172
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,036
We shouldn't be so critical of him.

1173
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,372
-He's starting to earn my respect.
-Right.

1174
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,167
You never imagined
you'd be in Paradise with me, right?

1175
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,169
You must've been surprised.

1176
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,546
Why would I be? I just--

1177
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,131
I suddenly burst out crying.

1178
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,966
I saw you tapping him.

1179
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:24,157
I don't understand
how he could be so harsh.

1180
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,783
I was taken aback.

1181
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,453
-Right?
-Right. He acted so cold.

1182
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,414
This morning, I had something on my pants.

1183
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,082
Your foundation, right?

1184
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,168
Gwan-hee was the first to notice.

1185
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,296
He told me to wear his shorts

1186
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:41,340
while he tried to get the stain off,
but he wasn't able to.

1187
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,510
What? That doesn't sound like him at all.

1188
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,597
-Right? That's why--
-That's really unexpected.

1189
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,140
I really loved that.

1190
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,641
You get it, right?

1191
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,144
Yes, that was really nice of him.

1192
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,440
I understand why you fell for him, Min-ji.

1193
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:01,110
He probably did that
because he was into me.

1194
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,695
You're both into each other.

1195
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,990
Oh, I see.

1196
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,909
I was really touched.

1197
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:11,120
I get why you acted that way
on the helicopter ride.

1198
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,457
He's probably having
a great time right now.

1199
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:20,713
What am I going to do tomorrow?
I don't want to ride the helicopter.

1200
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,423
I'd rather swim back.

1201
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,342
Don't worry.

1202
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:27,345
-Don't worry.
-How can I not? I'm worried sick.

1203
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:30,139
I have to look pretty tomorrow.
I should stop eating.

1204
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,601
-After this.
-You must like him a lot.

1205
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,853
You must like Gwan-hee a lot.

1206
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,528
Did it feel like Gwan-hee
was acting too cold toward you?

1207
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:46,739
He wasn't like that this morning,
so that made me feel worse.

1208
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,990
I totally understand.

1209
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,244
-You shouldn't cry.
-I won't.

1210
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,996
-It's nothing to cry over.
-Right.

1211
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,291
Just tell him how you feel
and clear things up tomorrow.

1212
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:02,171
And I'll tell him how much you like him.

1213
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,297
-I'd love that.
-Right?

1214
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,299
-Very much.
-He'll be happy to hear that.

1215
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,634
I told you not to cry.

1216
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:08,761
Stay here. I'll go grab tissues.

1217
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,392
Here, take some.

1218
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:16,060
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1219
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,105
-Grab some more.
-More? Okay.

1220
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,106
Good.

1221
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,067
-Stop crying.
-I will.

1222
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:29,198
I'll tell him how you feel,
so don't worry about it too much.

1223
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:34,328
If Gwan-hee hadn't been upset
when we parted ways,

1224
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:37,290
I would've felt more assured
about the situation.

1225
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,709
But he was upset with me when he left,

1226
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,961
so that kept bothering me.

1227
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,881
But there was nothing I could do,

1228
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:48,217
so I was going to tell him
how I felt the next day.

1229
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,970
I wanted to clear up
any misunderstandings.

1230
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,473
PARADISE
CHOI HYE-SEON & LEE GWAN-HEE

1231
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,144
This smells nice.

1232
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,313
It's tiny, so can I use it alone?

1233
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,816
-Should I stand over here?
-Yes, just stand there.

1234
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,819
-Oh, no! The hot tub.
-He said he wouldn't.

1235
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:07,904
The tub's dangerous.

1236
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,947
Gwan-hee isn't concerned at all.

1237
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,824
She told him not to use the hot tub.

1238
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,160
You can go in first.

1239
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,711
-Is the water hot?
-It's warm.

1240
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,549
It's a bit hot.

1241
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,968
It's getting warmer.

1242
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,470
The tub is really tiny.

1243
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,182
Oh, no. He's in the tub.

1244
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,977
He didn't even hesitate.

1245
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,189
I blinked once, and he was already in.

1246
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,609
Gosh, it's hot.

1247
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,613
Cover me with rose petals.
I'm embarrassed.

1248
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,615
Cover me with petals.

1249
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,659
Are these real rose petals?

1250
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,828
-Yes, it feels real.
-This is awesome.

1251
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,248
It looks like chest hair.

1252
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:03,376
I know. It's fine.

1253
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,294
Just cover me with rose petals.

1254
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,173
This is nice.

1255
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:10,257
Look at him.

1256
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,051
What's he doing?

1257
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,554
Why are your…

1258
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,307
You're too big to fit in here.

1259
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,394
I've never seen such long shins.

1260
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,562
-My shins?
-Yes, this part.

1261
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,356
That's most people's entire leg.

1262
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:26,482
It's so long.

1263
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,280
This is nice.

1264
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,199
You're hilarious.

1265
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,203
-Is it hot over there?
-What?

1266
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:42,206
-Is it hot over there?
-No, I'm fine. Do you want this spot?

1267
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:44,333
No, I was worried
it might be too hot for you.

1268
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,418
No, I'm fine.

1269
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:55,302
It feels a little odd to spend
this last trip to Paradise together.

1270
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:01,058
It felt so strange earlier
because when we walked in,

1271
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,978
we saw the same snacks
that we had the last time we came.

1272
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:07,356
It reminded me of our first date,
so it felt a bit special.

1273
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,483
You used this room last night.

1274
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:13,029
I did stay in this room last night,

1275
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,615
but when I saw
the snacks we had last time…

1276
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,577
-Did it bring back memories?
-Yes, it felt different.

1277
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,958
I need to talk to Min-ji tomorrow.

1278
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,918
What if you talk to Min-ji tomorrow

1279
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,421
and she says things
that make your heart flutter?

1280
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:33,799
What if she tells you
that she enjoyed Paradise only with you?

1281
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,303
What would you say
if she tells you she likes you the best?

1282
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:41,348
-I'd ask if she was serious.
-What if people said

1283
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:46,270
that you, me and Min-ji
were in a love triangle?

1284
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,981
And ask you who you're going to pick?

1285
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:52,109
I think I would ask Min-ji first.

1286
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:56,405
I'd ask her if she would've picked me
if she had won first place.

1287
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,740
Let's say she said yes.

1288
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,158
-She said yes?
-Yes.

1289
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,078
Look at that smile.

1290
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,871
-So she said yes?
-Yes.

1291
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:11,212
I told you earlier that I knew
how I'd feel if I came here with you.

1292
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:12,379
So I feel like…

1293
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:17,051
I think I have an idea now.

1294
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,845
He's exhausting.

1295
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,056
I don't care anymore.

1296
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:25,601
Gwan-hee is vague when he speaks.
He uses words like "I think" a lot.

1297
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:27,144
And he has petals on his chest.

1298
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,772
He seems to be keeping his options open.

1299
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,818
I think I really know. I do.

1300
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,487
I think I know.

1301
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:40,032
Who knows? They might tell me,

1302
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:45,121
"Choi Hye-seon, you may not leave Inferno
as you have not been selected by anyone."

1303
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:50,334
"Please remain in Inferno."
I'll be stuck in Inferno making bonfires.

1304
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,169
Okay, let's assume that happened.

1305
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:56,340
Would you still have a meal with me
if I asked you to after this show?

1306
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:57,341
Block!

1307
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,885
-Really?
-Yes, I would.

1308
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,849
This is basically a shirt made of roses.

1309
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,060
I should be covering you up.

1310
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,563
-You took all the petals.
-But I'm too shy to look.

1311
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:16,527
Do you enjoy steam baths?

1312
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,363
It wouldn't be my first pick.

1313
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:20,447
I see.

1314
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,368
-If you take a steam bath daily,
-Yes?

1315
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:29,665
they say you become younger by the day.

1316
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:31,041
-Really?
-Yes.

1317
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,004
That must be his charm.

1318
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:36,213
Yes, he's funny.

1319
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,048
He is funny.

1320
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,968
-Let's leave in a minute.
-Okay.

1321
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,182
I got bingsu for you.

1322
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,268
This is awesome.
How many mangoes are in here?

1323
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:52,104
About two, I think.

1324
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,107
Gosh, this one looks great too.

1325
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:57,401
Try this mango.

1326
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,654
-It's absolutely delicious.
-Oh, my.

1327
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,200
This is so good.

1328
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:07,494
I'm so happy right now.

1329
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:14,335
People are a bit sad
because they think time is flying.

1330
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:18,422
But at the end of the day,
the outcome is what matters the most.

1331
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:21,967
-For this to be a good memory?
-I think that's what matters.

1332
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:29,225
For example, if the person I like
doesn't end up picking me,

1333
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,936
I'd be so disappointed.

1334
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,355
I don't have any expectations.

1335
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:37,816
I'm not too worried about the outcome.

1336
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,654
If I don't get chosen,
I'll go to the deserted island alone.

1337
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,948
I'm okay with not finding a match.

1338
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:48,369
I don't think I'd pick someone
just because I think they'd pick me.

1339
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:52,665
I want to follow my heart no matter
who the other person may choose.

1340
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:58,128
If you get to go on a date tomorrow,
who do you think you'll choose first?

1341
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:01,924
"Think."

1342
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,217
-"If."
-"If."

1343
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,135
He's the If Boy.

1344
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,553
-The If Boy.
-Yes.

1345
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:12,059
If you get to go on a date tomorrow,
who do you think you'll choose first?

1346
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,938
I don't think I want to go with anyone.

1347
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,983
Are you saying
I'm the only one you're interested in?

1348
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,990
-Yes.
-How do you feel, exactly?

1349
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,283
There's no one else.

1350
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:31,036
I don't want to get to know anyone else.
I already told you.

1351
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,788
So you'll take a nap instead?

1352
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:34,331
Yes, pretty much.

1353
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,918
After you talk to Min-ji,
I'll come over and check on you.

1354
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,712
-You'll check on me?
-Yes.

1355
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,297
Is this like an inspection?

1356
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:45,968
I'll check on you, but other than that…

1357
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:51,056
That must be why she began to look relaxed
from a certain point.

1358
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,433
-Right.
-Yes.

1359
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:56,353
Being with you here
the second time does feel different.

1360
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,524
Yes, it does.
I finally get why people say that.

1361
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:04,903
I wonder what will happen
tomorrow at lunch.

1362
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,293
I don't know why
I've been so concerned about you.

1363
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:21,003
-What?
-I keep thinking about you.

1364
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:25,090
Stop falling over, okay?

1365
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,018
These two also look good together.

1366
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,270
-They do.
-They really do.

1367
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,690
When I see Hye-seon and Gwan-hee together,

1368
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,610
it feels that it doesn't matter
how much he teases her.

1369
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,320
No matter what he says,

1370
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:50,449
Hye-seon is able to take it all in
and accept him for who he is.

1371
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,826
And she also tells him his strengths.

1372
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,704
-I think they're a good match.
-They are.

1373
01:12:55,788 --> 01:13:00,542
How can I put this?
She's the type who can look after him.

1374
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,544
It's a good sign that he's concerned.

1375
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,130
I found his actions quite significant.

1376
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,173
This?

1377
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:08,092
He tapped her forehead like this.

1378
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:13,722
It felt like he was babying her.
That's how I saw it.

1379
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:19,186
When a man starts
to treat his woman like a baby,

1380
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:21,438
I think he's head over heels for her.

1381
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:25,818
-I agree.
-So when Gwan-hee did that,

1382
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,070
I felt like he was really into Hye-seon.

1383
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:32,449
I think Gwan-hee likes Hye-seon the most.

1384
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:35,661
-That's how I felt as I watched them.
-Right.

1385
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:36,787
Yes.

1386
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,336
Are you really sleeping out there?

1387
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,881
Just sleep in the bed.
It's our last night here.

1388
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:50,134
I want you to be comfortable.

1389
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,468
I'm fine, really.

1390
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,847
-I might roll over like this in my sleep.
-I'll just…

1391
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,890
-Like this.
-In that case,

1392
01:13:56,974 --> 01:14:00,769
let's just keep the extra bed,
and I'll wake you if you get too loud.

1393
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,354
Too loud?

1394
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,273
I'll wake you if you're too loud.

1395
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:05,232
So sleep here.

1396
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:06,650
-If I'm too loud?
-Yes.

1397
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:09,319
-That's even worse.
-You don't want me to wake you?

1398
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,029
I honestly…

1399
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:16,577
I don't feel uncomfortable at all.
I don't care if you snore or whatever.

1400
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,953
But you'll be uncomfortable.

1401
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,997
I'd be really fine.

1402
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,499
-You snored a lot--
-Want to sleep in the same bed?

1403
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,918
Want to sleep in the same bed?

1404
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,092
I found myself leaning toward you.

1405
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,802
I wanted to be by your side.

1406
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,554
We're a couple the day we leave.

1407
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,764
Min-ji is closer to my ideal type.

1408
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,350
If I considered marriage,
I'd choose Hye-seon.

1409
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,227
Then you should pick Min-ji.

1410
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:46,064
I don't want to be with someone
who doesn't know what he wants.

1411
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,150
NEXT EPISODE

1412
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:52,696
I told you to behave yourself.

1413
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:54,907
So why didn't you listen?

1414
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,702
You're a bit like Gwan-hee, aren't you?

1415
01:14:58,785 --> 01:15:00,746
I trusted Min-woo.

1416
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,081
Why am I crying?

1417
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:10,297
You will now make your final decision.

1418
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,298
-The person…
-The person…

1419
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:15,302
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1420
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:20,390
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1421
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:56,176
