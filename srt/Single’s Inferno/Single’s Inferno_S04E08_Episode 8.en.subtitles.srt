SINGLE'S INFERNO

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,927
It's a bit of a shame to sleep, right?

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,972
Yeah, maybe there's more
we could talk about.

17
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,437
It does feel a bit disappointing
to just go to sleep like this.

18
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,903
What was your first impression of me?

19
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,157
-What?
-Your first impression of me.

20
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,495
You were like a beast.

21
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,622
A beast? Because of my hair?

22
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,792
No, it was because of your actions too.

23
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,511
I thought they'd have some chemistry,
but I didn't expect this.

24
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,304
This is an explosion of chemistry.

25
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,890
They're stirring the imagination.

26
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,519
In any case, we aren't sure
of what actually happened.

27
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,478
No, we aren't.

28
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,897
I wish we could get rid of the blankets.

29
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,982
Aren't there any see-through blankets?

30
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,319
Because of the blankets… Jeez.
They're so annoying.

31
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,238
What actually happened?

32
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,697
-Right?
-The blankets…

33
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,574
-Yeah.
-They're in the way.

34
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,623
And up until now, Si-an has never shared
a bed with anyone in Paradise.

35
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,874
This is a first.

36
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,751
And I don't think it's just one person.

37
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,169
-It's both of them.
-Right.

38
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,296
They both opened up to each other.

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,593
This night is going to be
a huge turning point for these two.

40
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,428
That's what we can all predict.

41
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,763
Isn't it basically a done deal?

42
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,681
-Right?
-Yes.

43
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,974
-Really.
-I think so too.

44
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,476
Si-an has totally opened up
her heart to him.

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,436
But it's Si-an…

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,354
That's right.

47
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:30,024
It's not set in stone yet,
but he's climbed to the top spot.

48
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,151
He took the lead.

49
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,570
-But the others are still in the race.
-They are.

50
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,823
-The order could change at any time.
-They could climb back on top.

KIM A-RIN & KOOK DONG-HO

52
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,711
It's now starting to hit me
that we're in Paradise.

53
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,087
Yeah.

54
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,881
Yesterday was so…

55
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,217
It didn't feel real.

56
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,054
Talking to you was fun yesterday.

57
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,180
Yeah, it was so fun.

58
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,976
And things feel different
from our first conversation.

59
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,146
It felt different.

60
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,149
I felt so comfortable.

61
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,985
I think I let myself relax around you.

62
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:18,531
No. When we first talked,
I thought you were boring.

63
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,202
But you seemed like a calm person,

64
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,624
and when we talked,
you seemed like a deep person.

65
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,960
When we got comfortable
and talked yesterday…

66
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,253
I don't seem deep now?

67
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,171
What?

68
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,006
-No, that's not it.
-Do I seem shallow?

69
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,508
Not at all. It was…

70
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,220
I think we have the same sense of humor.

71
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,846
-That's a relief.
-Yeah.

72
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,765
-Conversations need to be fun.
-Yeah.

73
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,773
I really don't want to go back.

74
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,318
Just wait here and start cleaning.

75
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,570
Have everything cleaned up.

76
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,740
You weren't like this before.
At least in the beginning…

77
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,660
I feel like I've been conned.

78
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,331
I think I've been conned.
Something's gone wrong.

LEE SI-AN & YUK JUN-SEO

80
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,093
-So that night's over.
-Morning has come.

81
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,761
I wonder what happened.

82
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,820
Did you sleep well?

83
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,823
-My eyes…
-Yeah.

84
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,950
-The sun is so bright.
-Yeah.

85
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,915
I can't breathe.

86
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,917
-What?
-I can't breathe.

87
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,919
Is she resting on his arm?

88
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,546
Seriously?

89
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,755
-She is.
-You're right.

90
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,090
She's resting on his arm.

91
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,385
Who are you?

92
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,806
Just kidding. I can't even see.

93
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,668
-Sleep a bit more.
-What?

94
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,546
I'll wash up first.

95
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,635
I always lose my mind on these two.

96
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,095
-Right?
-Wait, the cameras…

97
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,847
Were the cameras rolling all night?

98
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,515
-Nothing happened…
-Nothing should.

99
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,392
-There are cameras.
-We're all adults.

100
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,644
Jun-seo's the youngest though.

101
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,979
Right, he's the youngest.

102
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,400
I thought Jun-seo was
a really shy and reserved type of person.

103
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,735
-But in bed…
-He can be forward.

104
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,112
I guess it's true
that still waters run deep.

105
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,363
He is a beast.

106
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,616
-He was a beast after all.
-He was a beast.

107
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,620
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

108
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,541
How do I look?
Today's the first time I dressed nicely.

109
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,293
-You look nice.
-I do?

110
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,588
Hold on.

111
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,924
I'm a little scared.

112
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,175
This is kind of scary.

113
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,134
Okay.

114
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,428
-Jun-seo, you wanted…
-Yes.

115
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,931
Straightened hair
with a little volume, right?

116
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,934
-How hot is it now?
-It's 200 degrees Celsius.

117
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,018
It's 200 degrees Celsius?

118
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,063
My hair's going to turn into a broom.

119
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,149
-No, this is how you make it straight.
-Really?

120
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,195
-Hold on.
-What?

121
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,655
It's becoming too straight.

122
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,532
-Stay still.
-Hold on.

123
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,326
Stay still.
Let's straighten it all out first.

124
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,747
You sure this is right?

125
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,210
-Wait, stay still.
-I can tuck it back better now.

126
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,461
This is fun.

127
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,674
-Does doing that add volume?
-Yeah.

128
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,764
I look like a well-groomed dog.

129
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,099
Hey!

130
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,977
-Hey!
-Am I in a rock band now?

131
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,478
-Hey.
-Am I?

132
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,605
You want me to do some headbanging?

133
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,523
Let me see.

134
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,191
Hey, hold on.

135
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,318
Hold on a second.

136
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,154
Lift your chin up.

137
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,238
Look.

138
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,323
It does straighten hair well.

139
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,325
-Right?
-Yeah, it's cool.

140
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,703
What do you think? Do you like it?

141
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,204
I think it's okay.

142
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,873
-For real?
-Yeah.

143
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,041
I look pure and innocent…

144
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,335
with this long, straight hair.

145
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,129
The guys are going to fall for me.

146
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,505
I'm in trouble.

147
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,924
There will be eight girls today.

148
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,718
You're so annoying.

149
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,096
What do you think?

150
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,475
-It's not bad.
-Are you sure?

151
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,934
Good job.

152
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:02,982
It's so hot.

153
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,276
Spending one night together
makes a huge difference.

154
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,777
Paradise made a huge impact.

155
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,945
It's huge.

156
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,165
Wow, you straightened your hair.

157
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,209
Your hair is so soft, like a puppy.

158
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,752
-Isn't it like a puppy?
-Yeah.

159
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,212
You remind me of our family's dog.

160
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,797
I checked the mirror
and looked like a well-groomed dog.

161
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,382
Your hair is so soft and nice.

162
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,510
Straight hair suits you well.

163
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,597
You used to look a bit wild,
but now you seem tamed.

164
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,892
-I guess he's been tamed.
-The wolf became a puppy.

165
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,813
-Thanks, Si-an.
-Sure thing.

166
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,650
I ended up getting all the attention.

167
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,992
Gosh, how did this even happen?

168
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:40,871
Si-an and Jun-seo have basically
returned as a couple now.

169
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,166
Yes. I think there's no going back now.

170
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,545
-I think Jun-seo is all in now.
-I don't think his feelings will change.

171
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,589
-I agree.
-Si-an is also pretty much…

172
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,173
-Yeah, pretty much.
-Yeah.

173
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,550
-Because…
-Yes.

174
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,595
They shared the same bed,
and her head rested on his arm, which is…

175
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,512
Of course.

176
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,847
-It's a big deal.
-It is.

177
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,765
-Yeah.
-It's a thing that swayed her a lot.

178
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,934
But I think she could still waver.

179
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,269
-I agree.
-Yeah.

180
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,854
Everyone has different standards.

181
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:10,026
Si-an may believe in her mind
she resisted his physical contact.

182
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,444
But she seemed to have liked it.

183
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,154
-Right.
-If she didn't, she'd never…

184
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,574
But one thing is
Si-an didn't initiate any contact.

185
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,783
She didn't.

186
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,661
-So that may show a chance to be swayed.
-Right.

187
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,247
That's why I think
it's still unclear for now.

188
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,627
INFERNO

189
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,299
I'm feeling unsettled.

190
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,093
Why? What's bothering you?

191
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:41,182
I think it'd be good to have
a lot of conversations today.

192
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:45,061
Honestly, I haven't been able to
talk much with Dong-ho.

193
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,813
-Make sure you do it today.
-Except for the second day.

194
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,817
And A-rin probably knows
everything by now, right?

195
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,112
-About what?
-About your feelings.

196
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,822
Yeah.

197
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:02,578
It might be upsetting
to overlap with a close roommate.

198
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,331
-I wasn't bothered before.
-Yeah.

199
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,291
Rather than upsetting,

200
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,670
I think it just bothers me.

201
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,756
But of course, it would bother you.

202
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,133
What do I do?

203
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,218
When A-rin comes back,

204
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,721
I don't want to hear
about how things were for her.

205
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,598
Then, don't listen.

206
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,100
She'll probably bring it up.

207
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,976
Then, just don't ask to begin with.

208
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,562
She'll just talk about how it went.

209
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,648
We don't want to know.

210
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,692
We really don't want to know,

211
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,821
especially if it's with someone
I'm interested in.

212
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,865
I wonder what they're up to.

213
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,992
Aren't you hungry?

214
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,577
I'm not hungry at all.

215
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,829
-Why not?
-I'm hungover.

216
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,372
-You're hungover?
-Yeah.

217
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,377
Why did we drink so much?

218
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,795
We drank really quickly too.

219
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,713
They went down easily last night.

220
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,006
-That's true.
-Yeah.

221
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,469
-They're here.
-What?

222
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,804
-They're here.
-What?

223
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,849
-They're early.
-Right?

224
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,769
Hey.

225
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,563
Yo.

226
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,398
Hi.

227
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,484
What are you eating?

228
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,781
They're earlier than we expected.

229
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,203
Right. We thought you'd come back
at around lunch.

230
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,247
-You were just hanging out?
-What were you up to?

231
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,502
-Hi.
-Hey, did you have fun?

232
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,587
Hi.

233
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,590
Goodness.

234
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,842
Did you have breakfast?

235
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,885
We did.

236
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,986
Did you have fun?

237
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,822
-I've gone so many times…
-Is that why?

238
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,283
We only drank water.

239
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,619
I feel like I'm going to die
from this hangover.

240
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,828
You have to hear this.

241
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,079
How much did you drink?

242
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,539
-What did you drink?
-I'm not even joking.

243
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,084
We had 80 proof whiskey.

244
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,253
-You said you can't drink.
-About half a bottle.

245
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,215
-We drank that.
-You drank half a bottle?

246
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,884
Apparently, they were having
separate conversations.

247
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,347
We were asleep but also talking.
They were different conversations.

248
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,891
They weren't conversations.
We were just saying things.

249
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,392
She would talk. Then, I would talk.

250
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,313
We'd clearly be asleep.
But he would talk to me, so I'd respond.

251
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,732
-Two separate conversations.
-Then, we'd sleep again.

252
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,277
I really wasn't interested,
but I was also curious.

253
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,614
I really didn't want to know
what they did.

254
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,242
But of course, I was curious.

255
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,618
What did you two do?

256
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,911
We went swimming.

257
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,580
Gosh. That must've been fun.

258
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,707
Man, it was as cold as winter.

259
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,918
-Seriously, I was freezing.
-Really?

260
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,253
You hate swimming though.

261
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,879
-At the pool?
-But you went swimming?

262
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,548
We were walking around.

263
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,508
It was like what we did during the game.

264
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,052
-It was so cold.
-It was freezing.

265
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,513
-We were shivering like this.
-Right.

266
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,848
But the fact that it was
my first time there…

267
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,225
-Yeah.
-That's right.

268
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,726
We had some amazing food.

269
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,936
We just ate and drank.

270
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,939
-Those two don't want to hear it.
-Exactly.

271
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,405
How was it?

272
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,366
I mean, what's there to say?

273
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,995
Dong-ho's face was just glowing.

274
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,622
-No, it's not like that.
-Yeah, right.

275
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,040
But we talked a lot.

276
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,918
He seems to enjoy talking.

277
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,378
-That's surprising.
-Yeah.

278
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,921
Isn't that similar to you?

279
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,673
-You love to talk too.
-Yeah.

280
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,883
-I love talking.
-You do.

281
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,343
He seems to enjoy it as much as I do.

282
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,553
You seem to get along well.

283
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,890
That's why it was great.
I felt so many new things.

284
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,516
We joked around a lot.

285
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,976
You two got really close.

286
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,978
Yeah, I think we did.

287
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,814
-Going to Paradise really changes things.
-I guess so.

288
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,066
Maybe that's why
everyone says you have to go.

289
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,527
How about you, Hae-lin?

290
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,614
I've made up my mind now.

291
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,532
Already? You've made up your mind?

292
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:14,955
-I was debating between two people.
-Yeah.

293
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,125
But after talking with Jeong-su,
I made up my mind.

294
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,084
To pick Jeong-su?

295
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,836
No, I'm not sure about that.

296
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,588
I don't think I can tell you that yet.

297
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,672
Okay.

298
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,261
Si-an, hurry and tell us.
What happened after drinking like that?

299
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,847
-I can't wrap my head around it.
-No.

300
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,143
-What?
-No, it wasn't like that.

301
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,354
I just got a little emotional. That's all.

302
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,356
Why did you get emotional?

303
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,815
Maybe I'm really losing it?

304
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,526
This is too funny. I'm so curious.

305
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,154
I'd been holding a lot inside,

306
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,698
and Jun-seo kept…

307
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,617
-Did he draw them out?
-Yeah, he did.

308
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,161
He drew out the emotions I was holding in.

309
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,121
Did he comfort you?

310
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,999
He just kept saying
it's good to be honest.

311
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,209
I see.

312
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,379
Earlier, you were sitting
right in front of us on the helicopter.

313
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,673
After dozing off for a bit,
I opened my eyes.

314
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,883
And right as I was
about to close them again,

315
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,510
I saw it happen.

316
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:14,098
Jun-seo grabbed Si-an's head
and rammed it onto his shoulder.

317
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,349
That's right.

318
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:16,892
I was startled.

319
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,228
So I acted like I didn't see
and closed my eyes again.

320
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,523
After seeing that, I thought,
"They've become really close."

321
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:28,570
Jun-seo has a way of making you swoon.

322
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,865
He just does what he wants
without hesitation.

323
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,993
I think that's what makes you swoon.

324
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,538
He even comes right out
and says he likes you.

325
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,289
That's it. It's just that.

326
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,791
Nothing else matters.

327
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,501
After coming back from Paradise,

328
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:46,088
I felt like things had been cleared up,
so I felt more at ease.

329
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,757
There were a lot of moments
that made my heart race.

330
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,926
My interest in him has shot up.

331
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,680
It ended up like this.

332
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,392
How was it talking with Te-hwan?

333
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,896
-Come on and tell us.
-Spill the beans.

334
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,648
Did you guys drink at night?

335
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,650
Just a tiny bit of champagne.

336
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,028
I was upset after hearing
about those two though.

337
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:09,987
To be honest…

338
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,948
For us, we just had dinner
and went swimming.

339
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,826
And when we went to bed,
we only said a few words and fell asleep.

340
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,786
But according to what Si-an said,

341
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,456
he kept talking to her the whole time
while lying down.

342
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,207
But they were both really drunk.

343
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,459
-Really?
-Yeah, so…

344
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,586
They were just rambling while drunk.

345
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,671
Right. They did drink whiskey after all.

346
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,340
Should I go to Paradise too
and have some whiskey?

347
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,258
Seriously.

348
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,552
I can't handle whiskey at all though.

349
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,804
I guess Jun-seo is really on your mind.

350
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,806
Isn't that obvious?

351
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,727
I'm grinding my teeth right now.

352
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,814
-How was it, Te-hwan?
-Me? I loved it.

353
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,232
-You did?
-Seriously.

354
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,484
That's awesome.

355
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,486
We talked a lot.

356
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:56,033
We exchanged our timelines
and everything we've experienced

357
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,869
from the beginning
until yesterday in Paradise.

358
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:04,041
We reflected on the times
we missed each other.

359
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,251
We talked a bit
about our dating styles too.

360
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,337
It was really fun. We talked a lot.

361
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,089
I kept thinking, "Time flies."

362
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,006
Yeah.

363
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,218
Today, the men
will be competing in a game…

364
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,302
It's for Paradise.

365
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,887
…for a date in Paradise.

366
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,937
Everyone, please gather
at the Korean wrestling arena.

367
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,065
Here it comes.

368
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,234
-This is going to be so intense.
-Yeah.

369
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,194
Jun-seo and Theo.

370
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,071
-You're right.
-It'll be intense.

371
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,824
-I think Jong-hoon will do his best too.
-You're right.

372
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,752
They're actually going to wrestle?

373
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,213
This is going to be
such a physical battle.

374
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,339
-For real.
-Right?

375
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:53,966
My goodness.

376
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,176
Here they come.

377
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,742
Why am I getting nervous too?

378
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,835
Today, the men will be competing in a game
for a date in Paradise.

379
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,091
Only the top three winners in order
of their ranking can each pick a woman

380
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,677
to take on a date to Paradise.

381
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,555
Today's game is…

382
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,018
-Wrestling.
-Of course.

383
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,103
I knew it would be wrestling.

384
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:54,151
If any part of their body above the knee
touches the ground first,

385
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,528
or if a contestant steps outside the ring,

386
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,280
they lose the match.

387
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:05,162
The three winners of the preliminaries
will advance to the finals.

388
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,332
We just need to win one round.

389
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,083
-Yeah.
-You're right.

390
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,045
The matchups will be crucial.

391
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,715
The matchups will be decided
by drawing balls.

392
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,385
Kim Jeong-su, please select a ball.

393
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,389
KIM JEONG-SU - GREEN BALL

394
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,062
YUK JUN-SEO - RED BALL

395
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,774
JANG THEO - YELLOW BALL

396
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,442
They all picked different ones.

397
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,826
KOOK DONG-HO - RED BALL

398
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,703
It's Yuk.

399
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,622
Kook and Yuk.

400
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,249
-That's tough.
-Yes.

401
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,881
Oh no.

402
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,841
This isn't going to be easy.

403
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,635
RED BALL - JUN-SEO VS DONG-HO

404
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,808
AN JONG-HOON - GREEN BALL

405
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,186
GREEN BALL - JEONG-SU VS JONG-HOON

406
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,397
I drew the ball I didn't want to draw.

407
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,109
Today's not going to be easy.

408
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,365
It's the Si-an derby for them.

409
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,409
They have to win to move up.

410
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,952
-Both have great physiques.
-Yes.

411
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,788
-Yellow by default?
-By default?

412
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,248
Theo and Te-hwan.

413
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,542
It's a battle between the two Ts.

414
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,964
YELLOW BALL - THEO VS TE-HWAN

415
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,513
We will begin the first match.

416
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,557
Kim Jeong-su and An Jong-hoon.

417
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,726
Please step into the ring.

418
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,940
I can't predict who will win.

419
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,653
Gosh.

420
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,657
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

421
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,367
-Good luck!
-You can do it!

422
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,203
-You can do it!
-Hey!

423
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,332
Please start when the whistle blows.

424
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,333
Get ready.

425
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,130
Look at his thighs.

426
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,048
Yeah.

427
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,181
I have no idea who'll win.

428
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,059
They seem evenly matched.

429
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,031
You can do it.

430
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,661
You can do it.

431
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,830
-This is no joke.
-This is intense.

432
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,628
This is intense.

433
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,796
It could go either way.

434
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,713
This is amazing.

435
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,467
My gosh.

436
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,094
It's like a finals match.

437
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,804
I'm worried they'll fall out of bounds.

438
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,182
-My goodness.
-My gosh.

439
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,309
I'm worried they'll fall out of bounds.

440
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,937
Wow, look at Jeong-su.

441
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,107
I can't tell who'll win.

442
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,526
-You can't get tired.
-Exactly.

443
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,236
-They're tired.
-Hang in there.

444
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,584
His foot went out.

445
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,087
He didn't get to try any techniques.

446
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,797
-It's such a shame.
-Right.

447
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,138
Kim Jeong-su wins.

448
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,934
Great job.

449
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,604
Unbelievable.

450
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:10,198
Next, the contestants who drew red balls,
Yuk Jun-seo and Kook Dong-ho.

451
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,033
Please step into the ring.

452
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,785
You can do it.

453
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,623
Let's go.

454
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,710
You never know.

455
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,587
-Dong-ho might be stronger.
-Right.

456
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,463
-He could be good at it.
-He's tall too.

457
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,382
He might have been
on the wrestling team too.

458
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,511
Jun-seo looks like he'd be really strong.

459
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,180
-He's super sturdy.
-Yeah.

460
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,605
Just don't get hurt.

461
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,857
You can do it!

462
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,532
Please start when the whistle blows.

463
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,533
Get ready.

464
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,712
This is scary.

465
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:19,768
They're like bulls.

466
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,103
They're just bulls.

467
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,899
Look at them hold their ground.

468
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,944
He's stronger than I expected.

469
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,196
-Dong-ho?
-The weight class difference.

470
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,006
Yuk Jun-seo wins.

471
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,467
He took him down.

472
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,553
It ended without anyone getting hurt,
so that's good.

473
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,597
Look over there.

474
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,516
Look. It's all dug up.

475
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,184
-Both are so competitive.
-Nice.

476
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,103
-Nice. Good job.
-Great match.

477
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,480
That was cool.

478
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,564
He wouldn't budge.

479
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,233
Brush off your chest.

480
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,777
They're both fiercely competitive.

481
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,404
He's like a bull.

482
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,243
The contestants who drew yellow balls,
Jang Theo and Kim Te-hwan.

483
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,245
Please step into the ring.

484
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,335
-I'm interested in this match too.
-Theo.

485
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,671
-Show us, Theo.
-Please, Theo.

486
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,634
You can do it.

487
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,684
But the height difference…
One of them is taller…

488
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,977
Being taller is an advantage.

489
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,021
-Is Te-hwan strong?
-He's strong.

490
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,901
I have a feeling Theo will do well.

491
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,320
He looks strong.

492
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,322
Having long legs could be a disadvantage.

493
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,407
Yeah, the center of gravity is higher.

494
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,121
Please start when the whistle blows.

495
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,873
Get ready.

496
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,708
Who's going to win?

497
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,293
You can do it.

498
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,617
Kim Te-hwan wins.

499
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,663
Kim Te-hwan wins.

500
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,299
Gosh, what's Theo going to do now?

501
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,926
He's falling further behind.

502
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,469
Yeah, what's he going to do?

503
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,305
Te-hwan is strong.

504
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,100
-That was quick.
-He's good.

505
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,479
The three who advanced to the finals

506
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,525
are Yuk Jun-seo, Kim Te-hwan,
and Kim Jeong-su.

507
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,116
The final match will be…

508
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,413
-A wrestling showdown.
-What?

509
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,789
-"Showdown"?
-What's that?

510
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,791
-A wrestling showdown.
-What?

511
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,042
-"Showdown"?
-What's that?

512
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,253
-The three of them together?
-They're all competing?

513
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:38,591
If one person defeats the other two
and secures two wins,

514
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,510
the game will end.

515
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,636
…the game will end.

516
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,637
It's a tournament.

517
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,723
They're making it a tournament.

518
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,230
So if they all keep ending up
with one win and one loss,

519
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,107
they could be wrestling all day.

520
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,942
-Isn't this a test of endurance?
-Yes.

521
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,236
I guess that's why it's called
"a wrestling showdown."

522
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,197
-This is going to be intense.
-Yeah.

523
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,659
We will begin the first match.

524
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,619
Kim Jeong-su and Kim Te-hwan.

525
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,038
Please step into the ring.

526
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,025
Jeong-su has a good balance.

527
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,902
-He has a good sense of balance.
-Yeah.

528
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:39,986
And good energy too.

529
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,031
This is all about energy.

530
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,451
Please start when the whistle blows.

531
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,119
Get ready.

532
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,292
Gosh.

533
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,509
-Spread the legs.
-There you go!

534
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,760
He went for the inner leg.

535
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,862
He's going for the spin?

536
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,249
My goodness.

537
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,546
-My goodness.
-What happened?

538
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,382
That must have hurt.

539
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,717
What happened?

540
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,011
Kim Jeong-su wins.

541
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,930
They're all so serious.

542
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,308
It's so intense.

543
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,436
That must hurt.

544
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,363
We will begin the second match.

545
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,784
Yuk Jun-seo and Kim Te-hwan.
Please step into the ring.

546
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,702
Good luck.

547
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,619
You can do it.

548
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,043
This is going to be fun.

549
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,588
I think he'll lift him up.

550
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,506
-Is he going to flip him?
-Lift and…

551
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,637
If Te-hwan wins, it'll be epic.

552
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,222
This will be fun to watch.

553
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,851
Please start when the whistle blows.

554
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,060
Get ready.

555
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,037
There's pride at stake
in front of the women they like.

556
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,414
-Getting lifted is humiliating.
-It's embarrassing.

557
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,416
Te-hwan can't back down now.

558
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,681
Wow, he won.

559
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,016
Yuk Jun-seo wins.

560
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,519
-Unbelievable.
-Amazing.

561
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,065
Wow, he won.

562
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,316
Yuk Jun-seo wins.

563
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,651
Wow, you're so strong.

564
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,152
-Unbelievable.
-Amazing.

565
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,988
As expected.

566
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,285
FINAL RANK OF 3RD PLACE
TE-HWAN - 2 LOSSES

567
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,287
We will begin the last match.

568
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,123
Kim Jeong-su and Yuk Jun-seo.

569
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,501
Please step into the ring.

570
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,419
-The winner…
-He gets to go.

571
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,504
-He gets to go.
-Yes.

572
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,173
One way or another,
Si-an will go to Paradise again.

573
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,549
-Yes.
-It seems so.

574
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,513
They came in first and second
in the first game.

575
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,264
You're right.

576
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,475
Jun-seo?

577
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,394
I think Jeong-su will win.

578
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,187
He doesn't budge.

579
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,438
There's nothing you can do.

580
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,317
But you may never know.
I've felt Jun-seo's strength.

581
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:15,034
When Jeong-su was my opponent,
I tried harder to give it my best.

582
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,081
I think you never really know
until you're up against them.

583
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,709
And I'm not lacking in strength either.

584
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,669
So I thought I'd be able to win.

585
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,098
If you lose the game, you lose her.

586
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,057
-For real.
-Yeah.

587
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,812
Please start when the whistle blows.

588
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,522
Get ready.

589
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,715
Wow, they're so steady.

590
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,475
I was rooting for Yuk Jun-seo.

591
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,605
I'd like to go with him again

592
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,358
and spend a little more time together.

593
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,377
It's over.

594
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,921
-Someone spun the other.
-Who was it?

595
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:50,838
That's right.

596
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,905
Yuk Jun-seo wins.

597
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:16,823
Incredible!

598
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,909
That was no joke.

599
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,372
-That was a proper throw.
-Yeah.

600
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,706
That was real wrestling.

601
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,916
You're right.

602
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,296
As expected, he's the strongest one.

603
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,966
He's too strong.

604
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,634
-He lifted me.
-He's a bull.

605
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,180
It must be tiring.

606
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,807
Right?

607
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,852
The men's game to win a date in Paradise.

608
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,521
First place is Yuk Jun-seo.

609
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,107
1ST PLACE, YUK JUN-SEO - 2 WINS

610
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,570
Second place is Kim Jeong-su.

611
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,613
2ND PLACE, KIM JEONG-SU - 1 WIN, 1 LOSS

612
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,742
Third place is Kim Te-hwan.

613
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,494
3RD PLACE, KIM TE-HWAN - 2 LOSSES

614
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:09,709
The top three men from this game

615
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,921
will each choose a woman
in the afternoon to go to Paradise with.

616
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,511
I'm curious to see who they'll pick.

617
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,865
I really wanted to go with Si-an,

618
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,951
but I was frustrated and angry
about not being able to go.

619
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,663
So I kept grumbling to myself about it.

620
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,877
Gosh, nothing's working out for him.

621
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,545
-Honestly…
-There's not much he can do.

622
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,381
-There really isn't.
-The only thing he can do is hide her bag.

623
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,925
He can just hide her bag.

624
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,384
That's…

625
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,261
-There's no other way.
-Si-an's travel bag?

626
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,096
Yes, that's the only solution.

627
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,265
Or he can go and hide inside her bag.

628
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,017
One of the two.

629
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,603
It's a really tough situation.

630
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,022
-I feel so bad for Theo.
-It's not easy.

631
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:23,449
Starting now, enjoy a date
with the person of your choice.

632
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,244
Bye.

633
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,371
-I booked a reservation.
-Good luck!

634
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,122
-With who?
-Dong-ho.

635
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,376
They're jumping right into it.

636
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,169
You have to make use of this spare time.

637
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,548
Si-an, come on out.

638
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,758
Si-an, come on out.

639
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,926
You scared me!

640
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,720
-He came right over.
-That's the way.

641
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,722
He has to be quick and find a way.

642
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,516
Where are you?

643
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,977
You want to come in?

644
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,436
It's your first time here, right?

645
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,188
Yeah, I've never been
in the men's room.

646
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,564
-Where's your bed?
-This is mine.

647
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,565
-Here?
-Yeah.

648
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:02,738
What?

649
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,824
-What?
-What is it?

650
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,450
-What?
-Why are you so awkward?

651
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,953
-It's awkward! I don't know.
-What is?

652
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,871
-It's awkward.
-Why are you suddenly awkward?

653
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,290
-What?
-Why are you being awkward?

654
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,709
Well?

655
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,838
-I don't know.
-You seem to have gotten prettier.

656
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,215
-What happened?
-Here we go again.

657
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,467
Do you want a flower?

658
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,469
I hid it here for you.

659
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,017
"I missed you."

660
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,729
-I'm leaving.
-Bye.

661
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,605
Take this with you.

662
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,690
What?

663
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,781
I MISSED YOU!!

664
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,117
-A surprise for her.
-My goodness.

665
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,327
Surprises are his specialty.

666
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,584
I wanted to say I missed you earlier,
but I felt embarrassed.

667
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,089
Why are you so awkward all of a sudden?

668
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,761
I don't know.

669
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,387
Don't know what?

670
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,139
I don't know.

671
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,559
She feels bad.

672
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,227
-She feels a bit bad, right?
-Yeah.

673
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,479
-She feels bad.
-I think so.

674
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,064
It's because Theo's such a good guy.

675
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,190
-Exactly.
-So…

676
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:23,861
She's been wavering a lot
and feeling so confused,

677
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:29,033
but he keeps expressing to her
the same feelings he's had from the start.

678
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,160
So I think she genuinely
feels sorry about it.

679
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,454
-Does your head hurt?
-Yeah.

680
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,039
It's understandable.

681
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,750
I'm confused.

682
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,168
-You're confused?
-Yeah.

683
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,712
About what? Your feelings or…

684
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,343
Yeah.

685
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,306
We weren't given a lot of time,
so just do what you want.

686
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,772
For me…

687
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:01,857
it's always been you.

688
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,032
That doesn't mean
I want you to keep me in mind.

689
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,369
This is your life,
and this is your choice.

690
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,996
I like you, so of course…

691
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,332
if you choose me, I'd be so happy.

692
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,794
But I don't want
to put any pressure on you

693
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,630
or influence your decision like that.

694
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,258
You get what I mean?

695
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,011
Even if the outcome
isn't what I'd hoped for…

696
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,221
Yeah.

697
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:35,433
I'd obviously be sad.
I'd probably cry a little in the shower.

698
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,642
Damn it.

699
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,811
I'm kidding.

700
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,354
-I'm sure you know…
-Right.

701
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:45,192
But put your own thoughts,
satisfaction, and happiness first.

702
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,485
-Right.
-Yeah.

703
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,614
-Okay.
-Yeah.

704
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,163
Don't feel too pressured.

705
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,623
-Go with your gut.
-Yeah.

706
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,708
Yeah.

707
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,335
You never put pressure on me though.

708
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,047
-Always…
-Yeah?

709
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,594
I'm grateful to you the most.

710
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,558
Gosh, Theo is just…

711
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,643
He's too amazing to just move on from.

712
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,978
He's admirable.

713
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,271
-That's right.
-Yeah.

714
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:27,902
What?

715
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,445
-Theo.
-Switch.

716
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,362
What?

717
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,406
Theo, come out for a second.

718
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,325
Me? Not Si-an?

719
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,826
Go on a date, you two.

720
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,586
-The two of them are going to talk?
-I guess he wanted to chat with him.

721
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,882
How much did you
talk about with Si-an just now?

722
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,134
Well, she seemed to have
a lot on her mind.

723
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,135
Yeah.

724
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,346
-I told her to do what she wants.
-You did?

725
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,306
I said I didn't have any regrets anyway.

726
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,440
Si-an had a lot on her mind.

727
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,650
I know, right?

728
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,944
Well, I won't get into the details.

729
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,988
-You can just hear it from Si-an.
-Yeah.

730
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,950
I think she's taking this
more seriously than expected.

731
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,618
I really like that attitude.

732
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,536
Yeah.

733
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,664
So I thought maybe I should

734
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,000
-try my chances with Si-an too.
-Yeah.

735
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,002
-That's what I thought yesterday.
-Right.

736
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,837
I wanted to share this with you.

737
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,714
This whole time,

738
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:34,385
you've created a lot of connections
and had a lot of conversations with her.

739
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,719
-Yeah.
-Right?

740
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,388
That's why.

741
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,310
I think her feelings for you
are pretty strong.

742
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,645
-Yeah.
-But in any case…

743
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,356
-I'm just going to do what I want.
-You should.

744
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,817
I'm going to go full steam ahead,
like a real man.

745
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,235
I hope you'll do the same.

746
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,820
-I've been doing that.
-Yeah?

747
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,990
To be honest,

748
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:01,120
I've expressed my feelings
to her a lot from the very beginning.

749
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,497
When Si-an came into my heart,

750
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,668
I locked the door behind her
so no one else could come in.

751
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,087
But honestly, on the flip side,

752
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,922
Si-an can leave whenever she wants.

753
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,591
The door opens from the inside.

754
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,260
So in my opinion…

755
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,803
-It's her choice.
-Right.

756
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,765
The thing about people's feelings is
even if I give it my all here,

757
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,642
that doesn't mean she'll choose me.

758
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,437
You can do the same,
and she might not choose you either.

759
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,856
-She could even choose Jeong-su.
-Yeah.

760
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,400
In any case, let's both try our best.

761
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,819
Yeah, okay. We have to give it our all.

762
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,154
Let's do our best.

763
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,364
-We'll give it our best shot.
-Sounds good.

764
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,160
-They're both so cool.
-Yeah, seriously.

765
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,037
-Those two are so cool.
-Yeah.

766
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,831
-She stole the hearts of such great guys.
-They're amazing.

767
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,499
Si-an is one lucky girl.

768
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,043
-Exactly.
-She's the real winner.

769
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,085
Yeah.

770
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,547
This is like a fair and honorable battle
between two men.

771
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,132
That's what it feels like.

772
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,552
But two guys have never had
a conversation like this before.

773
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,637
-That's true.
-Right?

774
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,847
-Exactly.
-That's why it was more impressive.

775
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,225
They're both amazing.
Honestly, Si-an's so lucky.

776
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,021
But if Jeong-su gets involved here,
it'll become a love square.

777
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,272
I think it'll be tough

778
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,025
-for Jeong-su to find a way in.
-Yeah, in the current situation.

779
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,318
There's no room for him.

780
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,445
But you said Si-an likes Jeong-su.

781
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:21,283
I said she could waver. Things may change
depending on what Jeong-su does.

782
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,911
So if he shows up
with his bangs down again, she'll swoon?

783
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,914
Let's hope she doesn't do that.

784
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,625
With Si-an's feelings,
it's not over until it's over.

785
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,668
-Right.
-Yes.

786
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,252
-Right.
-Not until the final decision.

787
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,587
Yes, I think so.

788
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,756
This is so complicated.

789
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,134
Is…

790
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,095
Is there any place you want to go to?

791
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,262
Where should we go?

792
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,348
-Where do you want to go?
-We can go anywhere.

793
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,058
-This spot in the shade…
-Paradise.

794
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,267
Paradise?

795
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,561
I lost more of my voice, right?

796
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,979
Yeah, I was going to say that.

797
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,190
-I like it here.
-Yeah.

798
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,358
-It's in the shade.
-Great.

799
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,735
How was it?

800
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,320
-How was it?
-Long time no see.

801
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,781
-Right?
-Doesn't a day here feel super long?

802
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,698
Yeah.

803
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,786
That's right.

804
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,330
-Yesterday was my first day on Inferno.
-Yeah.

805
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:09,915
I was bored.

806
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,752
-Everyone said they had a great time.
-Says who?

807
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,754
I think everyone was just pretending.

808
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,423
-So it wasn't fun?
-It wasn't for me.

809
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,507
Really?

810
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,636
How have you been?

811
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:23,846
Paradise…

812
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,681
Did you have fun? Was it different?

813
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,558
I had a good time.

814
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,393
That's what everyone always says.

815
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,855
Yesterday, I picked you
to go to Paradise with.

816
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,192
You didn't know, right?
Did you think I'd pick you?

817
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,862
I thought you'd pick Jeong-su.

818
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,364
Really? I actually picked you.

819
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,536
Honestly,

820
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,164
I don't think
my feelings will change much.

821
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,624
How many days are left now? Four? Three?

822
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,670
I've never expressed my feelings
so directly to anyone before.

823
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:04,803
He's confused.

824
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,847
-It's written all over his face.
-It's obvious.

825
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,601
Why is this so funny?

826
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:11,894
He's wavering.

827
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,563
When you talked with other guys,

828
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,149
there wasn't anyone else
you wanted to get to know?

829
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,150
Nope.

830
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,156
At this point, my feelings for you

831
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,075
will either go up or go down.

832
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,327
That's all there will be.

833
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,121
So if I get a chance to go to Paradise,

834
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,414
I'm going to pick you.

835
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,374
Keep that in mind.

836
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:39,129
But do tell me this.
Tell me if you don't want that.

837
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,715
But that's…

838
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,760
No, I want to go. I want to go with you.

839
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,137
That is what's different.

840
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,347
-That personality.
-For real.

841
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,015
-She has him all shaken up.
-Yeah.

842
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,059
It's something only Hae-lin could say.

843
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,019
No, I want to go. I want to go with you.

844
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,814
Yeah.

845
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,275
Feeling dizzy?

846
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,610
No, not at all.

847
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:04,363
We have to be open and honest.

848
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,989
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

849
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,116
Anyways, that's how I feel.

850
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,412
Here you are.

851
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,706
Gosh, You-jin.

852
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,250
It's You-jin.

853
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,087
Here you are.

854
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:23,715
Hi.

855
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,677
I want to talk with Dong-ho too.

856
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,555
-Let's talk.
-You're so popular.

857
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,557
-After you two…
-I'm not popular.

858
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,267
Where do you want to wait?

859
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,352
Should I call you over?

860
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,687
-Should we do that?
-Yeah.

861
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,398
-I'll be resting in our room.
-I'll head over there.

862
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,149
Let me know after you talk.

863
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,317
See you later.

864
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,612
Yeah, You-jin needs to talk to him too.

865
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,782
-Right.
-I hope You-jin gets a chance as well.

866
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,158
She finally found the courage.

867
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,410
-Yes.
-Right.

868
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,291
What's the right thing to do?

869
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,376
I heard all of your honest thoughts,

870
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,421
so I should think it over
and let you know, right?

871
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,006
I'd appreciate that.

872
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,716
I'd be thankful, but…

873
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,636
No matter how you feel,
I don't think my mind will change.

874
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,013
Yeah, I'll definitely

875
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,390
let you know.

876
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,351
Okay. You must have a lot to think about.

877
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,856
-Thanks. Let's go.
-Yeah.

878
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,234
Are you going to see You-jin?

879
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,527
-I think I should.
-Yeah.

880
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,784
I'll be back.

881
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,954
-Nice outfit.
-What were you up to?

882
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,414
-Thanks.
-No, I mean…

883
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,582
What?

884
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,500
I meant Te-hwan's Paradise outfit.

885
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,877
Your Paradise outfit looks nice.

886
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,630
You look good too.

887
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,256
-What?
-I do?

888
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,174
-I…
-What?

889
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,550
He said, "Nice outfit."

890
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,969
So I thanked him,
but he was talking about Te-hwan.

891
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,805
-You look good too.
-Thanks.

892
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:54,973
Let's go talk.

893
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,397
How was it?

894
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,566
We haven't had a chance to talk,

895
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,528
and in the meantime,
you've been to Paradise twice.

896
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,323
-Right. Our timeline ended up like that.
-Yeah.

897
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,575
-Him and his darn timelines again.
-"Timeline."

898
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,912
-He's a numbers guy.
-Time is important to him.

899
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,372
I was really disappointed.

900
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,500
I tend to be pretty honest.

901
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,293
-So…
-Right, you are.

902
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,796
I'll be even more straightforward.

903
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,547
So…

904
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,176
Since I've waited this long,

905
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:36,181
I plan to try really hard
to win you over starting from today.

906
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,307
-But…
-Right.

907
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,810
But from your perspective,

908
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:43,563
if you're pretty certain
about your feelings, you could…

909
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,149
feel uncomfortable if I cross that line.

910
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,277
It could also be rude if I did that.

911
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,699
So that's what I'm going to do,

912
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:58,328
but if it gets too uncomfortable…

913
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,790
Honestly, it's not uncomfortable.

914
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,834
You're always nice and considerate.

915
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,752
-Right.
-But it makes me wonder.

916
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:11,591
Were my actions unclear and ambiguous,
so everyone was…

917
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,719
Did I do something wrong?

918
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,972
Not at all. We just have
our ideal types in mind.

919
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:22,728
And I haven't talked too in-depth
about this with A-rin,

920
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,147
but I briefly discussed it with Hae-lin.

921
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:29,317
She said her ideal type
in terms of personality

922
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,653
seemed to match up with you a lot.

923
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:35,449
Anyways, they've both been
to Paradise with you.

924
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,784
-You're right.
-I haven't had that chance.

925
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,453
-Right.
-Yeah.

926
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,413
You're right.

927
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,499
Right, they've already gone.

928
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:50,464
I think I'll need to quickly decide
so we can all have a peace of mind.

929
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,009
Really? I was secretly hoping
you wouldn't decide so quickly.

930
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,722
I secretly was hoping.

931
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,182
-Someone save me.
-Can't you decide

932
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,642
after going to Paradise with me?

933
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,481
I feel like I'm the only one
without any information.

934
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,025
So that's a bit disappointing.

935
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,653
If everything hasn't been settled yet

936
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,280
and you're still considering things…

937
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:20,035
If you decide right away
under these circumstances,

938
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,370
I think I'd be disappointed.

939
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,751
So I secretly hope
you don't make up your mind.

940
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:33,799
If one of the three winners
can take A-rin to Paradise,

941
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:40,764
I'd like to spend time alone with Dong-ho
on Inferno for a while without her around.

942
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,266
I think that's what I immediately thought.

943
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,686
"Can't someone take A-rin away for a bit?"

944
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,107
A quick decision means no chance for her.

945
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,025
-Right.
-Yes.

946
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,109
-She's not wrong.
-Right.

947
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,154
If he makes a decision now,
it means he's rejecting her.

948
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,365
They haven't connected in any way.

949
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,492
-You-jin expressed herself so well.
-Yes.

950
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,702
And Dong-ho didn't mean to mislead anyone.

951
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,539
You-jin had him in mind
but just couldn't express her feelings.

952
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,290
Dong-ho didn't even realize that.

953
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,669
Suddenly, he has three women
saying they like him.

954
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,878
He was flustered.

955
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,339
He thought, "Did I do something wrong?"

956
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,091
He thought, "Did I lead them on?"

957
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,176
But it's not that. He's just a good guy.

958
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,094
-Right.
-Right.

959
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,637
That's why they all like him.

960
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,139
How are you feeling?

961
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,268
Dong-ho seems really busy right now.

962
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,437
There were women
who wanted to talk to him.

963
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:34,150
You-jin and the game changer
seemed to be leaning toward him.

964
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,152
They went to Paradise together, right?

965
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,571
He's so popular.

966
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:42,284
You just spent time
with the popular guy in Paradise then.

967
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,621
I've already had enough conversations.

968
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,876
At this point, I don't think it's right
to approach Jun-seo first.

969
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,879
I think now would be a good time
to give it a try though.

970
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,798
They're passing by.

971
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,675
Who is it?

972
00:52:58,758 --> 00:52:59,968
No idea. I can't see.

973
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,095
Jun-seo…

974
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:03,930
All I can see is Jun-seo.

975
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,557
Is that Jeong-su next to him?

976
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,851
It can't be Theo.

977
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,604
-What?
-Why aren't you all talking?

978
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,355
Did you already have talks?

979
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,940
Yeah, I had some.

980
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,191
Really?

981
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,109
Come in.

982
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:18,778
What's going on?

983
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:22,115
Where are your sunglasses today?
You're wearing glasses instead.

984
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,116
Is that right?

985
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,161
How is it here, Min-seol?

986
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,871
-Here?
-Are you having fun? Yeah.

987
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,456
-Here on Inferno?
-Yeah.

988
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,082
It's fun.

989
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,208
-It is?
-Yeah.

990
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,002
I enjoyed watching the game today.

991
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,837
-You did?
-It was fun.

992
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,339
I looked pretty cool, right?

993
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,634
Jeez.

994
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,885
Yeah, it was cool.

995
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,930
Is Min-seol wearing a sock on her hand?

996
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,598
-Really?
-Could you replay that?

997
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,352
Jeez.

998
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,728
Yeah, it was cool.

999
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,272
-Really?
-It is a sock.

1000
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,398
Is that really a sock?

1001
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,443
-She has a sock on her hand.
-That's our youngest member.

1002
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,195
-That's so cute.
-She's cute.

1003
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,405
Gosh, not even a puppy could be this cute.

1004
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,157
I'm Yuk Jun-seo.

1005
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,951
-What?
-I'm Yuk Jun-seo.

1006
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,039
Yuk, like numbers six, seven, eight, nine…

1007
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:14,250
You know, I've never liked
the number six that much.

1008
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,171
You think you'll get to go to Paradise?

1009
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,255
Yeah.

1010
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,882
-Really?
-Yeah.

1011
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,926
It's all about confidence.

1012
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,928
Are you done talking with everyone?

1013
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,430
Not yet. I'm about to now.

1014
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:29,933
Go on, then.

1015
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,726
Come on, let's go.

1016
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,895
Come on, let's go.

1017
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,022
Okay. Jeez.

1018
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,319
Look how happy she is.

1019
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,113
-She's so transparent.
-Yeah.

1020
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,948
Min-seol said she'd stay here.

1021
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,992
-But she's leaving after all.
-You're right.

1022
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,327
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

1023
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,580
She's like a little kid.

1024
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,623
What?

1025
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,792
What about me?

1026
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,461
-It's the way you're smiling right now.
-Exactly.

1027
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,171
-You were so down moments ago.
-Exactly.

1028
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,172
"Jeez!"

1029
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,717
-Then, you put on lipstick.
-"Jeez!" Then, suddenly…

1030
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,218
"This is kind of annoying."

1031
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,261
I'll be back.

1032
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,055
-Should we go to the back over there?
-Sure.

1033
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,310
-Are you doing all right here?
-Totally.

1034
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,104
-Really?
-I've adapted just fine.

1035
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,857
You're always carrying
that bag around. It's so cute.

1036
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,568
I look good with it too, right?

1037
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,486
-Don't you think?
-Yeah. It's yours then.

1038
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,408
I'll take that.

1039
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,035
Thanks.

1040
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,624
Are you still worried about me?

1041
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,002
You think
I haven't been able to settle in?

1042
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:39,919
A little bit.

1043
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,921
I'm doing fine.

1044
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,131
-Really?
-Yeah.

1045
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,382
-It's just…
-Yeah.

1046
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,469
When we're hanging out,
I can tell what they're like.

1047
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:50,055
I don't need to talk to someone
unless I'm curious about them.

1048
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,222
Who are you curious about?

1049
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:53,808
-My choices?
-Yeah.

1050
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,185
The guys don't talk about this.

1051
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,978
-Really?
-No, we don't talk.

1052
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,230
I'm interested in you and Jong-hoon.

1053
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,524
Jong-hoon?
So you're interested in him a bit?

1054
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,402
Well…

1055
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,653
I see.

1056
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,323
The other person you want to
talk with is Jong-hoon?

1057
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,407
No, not anymore.

1058
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,117
So that's what you wanted to know.

1059
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,535
Okay, I got it.

1060
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,457
He asked me about Jong-hoon.

1061
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,043
He asked what I thought of Jong-hoon.

1062
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,003
Why did he want to know?

1063
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,302
-What did you do yesterday?
-Yesterday?

1064
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,970
I heard you drank whiskey.

1065
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,181
We had dinner and drinks yesterday.
That's it.

1066
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,433
-Really?
-Yeah.

1067
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,726
We talked a little.

1068
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,105
-You drank whiskey?
-Yeah.

1069
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,357
-It was 80 proof.
-You promised to drink it with me.

1070
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,691
It was whiskey.

1071
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,110
But it wasn't Johnnie Walker.

1072
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,904
-You didn't drink Johnnie Walker yet?
-No, it was something else.

1073
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,493
-Honestly, I can't figure you out.
-Me?

1074
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,122
We're headed towards the end,
but don't tell me.

1075
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,623
Okay.

1076
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,085
-Knowing would spoil things.
-True.

1077
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,837
I guess everyone feels that way.

1078
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,465
It must be nice to always go to Paradise.

1079
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,801
-This will be your fourth time, right?
-Yeah.

1080
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,762
Do you want to go to Paradise?

1081
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,180
Of course, I do.

1082
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,974
I've been saying that all along.

1083
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:16,933
-Why?
-What?

1084
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:17,851
Why?

1085
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:24,023
It's fun, and you get more time
to talk and connect there than here.

1086
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,152
-That's true.
-Yeah.

1087
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:30,947
Okay, I got it.

1088
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,283
Can I take this with me?

1089
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:34,826
What on earth?

1090
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,828
-That's all you wanted to talk about?
-Yeah.

1091
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,745
You're no fun.

1092
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:41,916
You… You only asked
what you wanted to know!

1093
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,753
I mean, you…
What's with you? Fine, then.

1094
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,132
Jun-seo?

1095
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,093
I think he'll pick me.

1096
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,139
He went with Si-an yesterday.
He wouldn't go with her again.

1097
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,683
Shouldn't he go
one more time with me today?

1098
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,853
If he doesn't end up picking me,
I'll be so embarrassed about this.

1099
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,273
Si-an, where are you going?

1100
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,316
Let's talk here.

1101
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,614
And we're here.

1102
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,532
Gosh.

1103
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,954
Goodness.

1104
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,790
It looks like your hair's curly again.

1105
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:26,377
Yeah, I showered because I was so sweaty.

1106
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,047
But I worked so hard to straighten it.

1107
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,673
Right?

1108
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,385
I didn't think they'd make us play
right at noon. We didn't even eat lunch.

1109
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,265
It was impressive. I'll admit it.

1110
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,934
-It was?
-Yeah, totally.

1111
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,645
I admit it was cool.

1112
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,235
Do you want to go again today?

1113
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,029
-Do what you want.
-Yeah.

1114
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,197
I will.

1115
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,448
-Yeah.
-I'm just asking.

1116
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,366
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1117
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:57,951
Of course, I want to go.

1118
00:58:58,826 --> 00:58:59,661
Got it.

1119
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,415
Jeez.

1120
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,293
I'd…

1121
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,798
Honestly, I'd like to go
with Jun-seo again.

1122
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,801
I feel like something special
could happen if we go this time.

1123
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:18,972
He asked Min-seol the same thing.

1124
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:19,889
-Right.
-Yeah.

1125
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,725
Whoever's not picked is bound to be upset,

1126
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,269
whether it's Si-an or Min-seol.

1127
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,396
With Min-seol, it was different.

1128
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:29,899
He asked if she wanted to go
and just ended the conversation there.

1129
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,442
That felt like he meant,

1130
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,611
"Yeah, I'm taking you today."

1131
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,154
But if he doesn't pick her, then…

1132
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,239
It'd be awkward.

1133
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:39,659
From her perspective, that would turn
Jun-seo into a bit of a jerk.

1134
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:43,705
So I think he'll take Min-seol
with him to Paradise today.

1135
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,790
But he had that conversation with Si-an.

1136
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:48,876
She told him to do what he wants,
but she said she wants to go too.

1137
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,046
If she didn't say that,
I think he'd pick Min-seol.

1138
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,339
But Si-an was clear on that.

1139
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,382
-Right.
-Exactly.

1140
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:57,594
It feels like Jun-seo has no choice
but to pick Si-an now.

1141
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,722
If Si-an was that clear
about wanting to go

1142
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,682
but he ends up picking Min-seol,

1143
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,517
Si-an might be a little shocked.

1144
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,019
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1145
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,563
But Jeong-su will probably take Si-an,

1146
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:12,817
so she's destined to go
to Paradise anyway.

1147
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,777
-True.
-It's a matter of who she'll go with.

1148
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,945
Exactly.

1149
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,493
I noticed earlier during the game,
you didn't look so good.

1150
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,370
I was a bit worried.

1151
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,538
Really?

1152
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:29,626
I suddenly felt dizzy
and was a bit out of it.

1153
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,836
We can't have you stay in the heat.

1154
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,172
-But I'm okay.
-You should head to Paradise.

1155
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,381
Gosh.

1156
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,926
Are you going to pick me?

1157
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,053
-Of course.
-Really?

1158
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,012
-Yeah.
-I see.

1159
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,305
"Of course."

1160
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,475
-Of course.
-Really?

1161
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,392
-Yeah.
-I see.

1162
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,311
-Why?
-You don't want to go with someone else?

1163
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,146
No. Did you think I would?

1164
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,856
No, I didn't but…

1165
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,233
I actually wanted to mention this.

1166
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,276
Yeah.

1167
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,444
Well…

1168
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,490
-We just went to Paradise yesterday.
-Yeah.

1169
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,993
-And don't take this the wrong way.
-Okay.

1170
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:08,414
-But you got the chance to go again today.
-Right.

1171
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:13,670
And the whole purpose
of going to Paradise is about…

1172
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,005
-You know…
-Getting to know people?

1173
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,509
-Yeah, it's honestly meant for us to…
-Right.

1174
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,761
…get to know everyone a bit better.

1175
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:22,679
Right.

1176
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:26,265
So I was actually
going to bring this up today.

1177
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,059
-Right. To not pick you?
-Earlier…

1178
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,352
No, that's not it…

1179
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:30,770
Is that the direct way to put it?

1180
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,731
-Maybe you should go with someone else.
-With someone else?

1181
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:37,068
Because that could help you see
if your feelings change.

1182
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,985
Yeah.

1183
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,904
Honestly, you never know, right?

1184
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,656
-Really? You think so?
-Of course.

1185
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,075
-You think they'll change?
-They could.

1186
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,702
Or while you're there,

1187
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:49,330
you could miss me so much
that I'd constantly be on your mind.

1188
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,874
It could be a chance to figure that out.

1189
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,502
Should I try that then?

1190
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,338
Do whatever you'd like.

1191
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,465
I'm just letting you know.

1192
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,717
-It's just a suggestion.
-But…

1193
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,552
What if I just choose you again?

1194
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:03,886
Well, then…

1195
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,680
I'd happily follow along.

1196
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,014
-I see.
-Yeah.

1197
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,850
I'd say, "Thank you"
and follow along.

1198
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:09,934
-Really?
-Yeah.

1199
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,936
Or you don't want to go?

1200
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,312
No, that's not it.

1201
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,772
-That isn't why at all.
-Okay.

1202
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,441
-But I get it though.
-You do, right?

1203
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:19,277
You haven't connected much
with anyone else.

1204
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,028
-Right.
-The same goes for me.

1205
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,197
We've only been talking to each other.

1206
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,241
-And it's mostly been the two of us.
-True.

1207
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:28,619
We don't have
many days left now until this ends.

1208
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:33,708
I felt like if we let it end like this
without talking a lot with others,

1209
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,127
it'd be disappointing.

1210
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,086
-True.
-Yeah.

1211
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:40,590
Is this a test?

1212
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:45,928
How adorable.

1213
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,639
This is why we thought he was so young.

1214
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,516
-Exactly.
-He looks young too.

1215
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,434
Is this a test?

1216
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,061
-It's not a test.
-It's not?

1217
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,397
You think it's a test?

1218
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,232
How cute.

1219
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,317
I thought it was a test.

1220
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,526
-It wasn't.
-It wasn't?

1221
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,612
-No.
-Okay, I get it.

1222
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,117
But what if he actually goes
with someone else?

1223
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,452
-She's encouraging him.
-Yes.

1224
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:10,870
-What?
-It's with pure intentions.

1225
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,663
-For real.
-She's trying to be considerate.

1226
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,999
Isn't Ji-yeon being too relaxed
about Te-hwan?

1227
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:20,505
No, I think she genuinely wants him
to get to know other people

1228
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,590
without any ill intent.

1229
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,635
-Because they went to Paradise yesterday.
-Yes.

1230
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,512
But even though Ji-yeon said that,

1231
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,305
if I were her,

1232
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:33,643
I'd secretly hope deep down inside
that Te-hwan would still choose me.

1233
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,437
-Right.
-But she doesn't want to pressure him.

1234
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,648
-I'm so tired.
-Welcome back.

1235
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,441
I'm so tired.

1236
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,902
What if I can't go after all this?

1237
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:45,196
What did you talk about? Is he taking you?

1238
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:46,322
-To Paradise?
-Yeah.

1239
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:47,240
With who?

1240
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,241
-Jun-seo?
-Jun-seo.

1241
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,158
He didn't say.

1242
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,076
-Really?
-Really?

1243
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,578
We thought Jun-seo would tell you that.

1244
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:53,663
That he'd take me?

1245
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:56,040
-"Let's go. It's been a while."
-So, they had whiskey.

1246
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:58,125
I asked him why he had whiskey without me.

1247
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:00,169
And he likes Johnnie Walker.

1248
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,588
He told me
he didn't have any Johnnie Walker.

1249
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,966
So he said we should go
and have it next time.

1250
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,176
Doesn't that mean he's taking you?

1251
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,011
That's what he said,

1252
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:12,431
but I still have no idea
what he'll actually do today.

1253
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:22,024
Your choice might change
depending on who Jun-seo chooses.

1254
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,359
It could.

1255
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,321
I wonder who Jun-seo will pick.

1256
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,156
I'm curious about his choice.

1257
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,241
Right?

1258
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,910
I think it'll be either Min-seol or Si-an.

1259
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:39,750
But if Jun-seo picks Si-an,

1260
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,836
who will Jeong-su choose?

1261
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:45,047
-Jeong-su?
-Isn't it going to be Hae-lin?

1262
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,092
The only connections he's had
are with Hae-lin and Hye-jin.

1263
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,844
"Want to hang out with me again?"

1264
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:52,263
-I think he'll pick Hae-lin.
-It won't be Hye-jin.

1265
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:53,180
-Hae-lin?
-I agree.

1266
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,849
-Hae-lin.
-I think it'll be Hae-lin.

1267
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:55,766
Yes.

1268
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,437
-I'm most curious about Jun-seo's choice.
-Exactly. It's important.

1269
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:10,364
Now, we're going to match the couples
who will go on a date in Paradise.

1270
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,993
The winners of the men's game
who earned dates in Paradise,

1271
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:17,705
Yuk Jun-seo, Kim Jeong-su,
and Kim Te-hwan.

1272
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:20,041
Please come outside.

1273
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,417
-Have fun.
-Have fun.

1274
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,335
Thank you.

1275
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,878
Go and enjoy yourself.

1276
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:26,172
Let us know what kind
of good food you had tomorrow.

1277
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,757
-Okay. I'll go and relax.
-Bye.

1278
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,926
-Bye.
-See you later.

1279
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,844
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

1280
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,513
Let's go, first-place winner Yuk Jun-seo.

1281
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,514
Let's go.

1282
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,645
I wonder who he'll pick.

1283
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,897
I put a lot of effort
into packing my bags.

1284
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,150
But if I end up staying behind…

1285
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:47,985
No, you're 100% going.

1286
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,028
You think so?

1287
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,322
I'm going to end up
alone in our room today!

1288
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,546
We'll begin with first-place winner,
Yuk Jun-seo.

1289
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,968
Please choose the person you'd like to
go on a date with in Paradise.

1290
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:16,138
Lee Si-an,
who I went to Paradise with yesterday,

1291
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,016
and Kim Min-seol
are the two people I'm torn between.

1292
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,901
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1293
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,613
Yuk Jun-seo has selected…

1294
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,826
I keep biting my nails.

1295
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,453
I think it'll be Min-seol.

1296
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,622
Min-seol. I think it'll be her.

1297
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,251
-My heart is racing.
-It's Min-seol.

1298
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,252
Have fun.

1299
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,381
I think Min-seol will be the one going.

1300
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:51,799
Yeah, Si-an went yesterday.

1301
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:52,717
-Right.
-Yeah.

1302
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,970
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1303
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,354
Is he going to double down?
Will he go with Si-an?

1304
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:06,522
No way.

1305
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,984
Yuk Jun-seo has selected…

1306
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,785
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

1307
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,871
Lee Si-an.

1308
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:40,848
Let's go.

1309
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,101
-We're going right away?
-Yeah.

1310
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:45,644
All right.

1311
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,568
I want to talk.

1312
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:53,778
You two should go then.

1313
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:54,862
NEXT EPISODE

1314
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:56,530
I thought the sun was going to rise.

1315
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,948
I almost went to bed.

1316
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,910
This is really nerve-racking
and mentally exhausting.

1317
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:04,080
I've wanted to go to Paradise with you.

1318
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,956
What? Do you want to go today?

1319
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:07,708
Let's go together.

1320
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,752
You're so popular.

1321
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,128
It makes me worried.

1322
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,881
I've said everything I needed to say.

1323
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,092
What's going on?

1324
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,551
This is insane.

1325
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:18,469
Hi.

1326
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:19,929
Something's a little different.

1327
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,347
Just a little bit.

1328
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,681
What? Was he flirting?

1329
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,476
But it's a bit a bit crooked… Hey.

1330
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:27,770
-Hey, think it through before you act.
-Jun-seo.

1331
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:29,980
Can't you treat me a bit more kindly?

1332
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,690
I don't want you to feel pressured.

1333
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,734
But I do want you to think of me.

1334
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,277
It's been weighing on my mind.

1335
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,530
You miss Si-an, don't you?

1336
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,115
Hi, Si-an.

1337
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,159
As I get to know Theo more,
I see how sincere he is.

1338
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,120
Am I doing something wrong here?

1339
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:48,415
This confusion I'm feeling…
I'm not going crazy, am I?

1340
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,908
