1
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,103
SINGLE'S INFERNO

2
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,280
There he goes.

3
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,823
Who will he talk to first?

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,328
He's here.

5
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,539
It's Gwan-hee.

6
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,754
Expecting someone? It's me.

7
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,386
She knew what Min-ji was thinking.

8
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,429
-Oh, no.
-She's scary.

9
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,181
-She was so blunt about it.
-Exactly.

10
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,224
Expecting someone? It's me.

11
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,436
Sorry, but I knew.

12
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,979
-Really?
-I was expecting you.

13
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,814
-Is no one outside yet?
-No.

14
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,899
She said, "Sorry."

15
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,068
-That was a lie.
-She's not giving in.

16
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,694
The score is even now.

17
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,282
-I think everyone is wary.
-Right.

18
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,243
It's our last date,
and we need to make the most of it.

19
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,496
You can only have a date
with one person at a time,

20
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,539
so I think everyone's waiting instead.

21
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,423
Nobody is hiding their feelings anymore.

22
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,841
It's all out in the open.

23
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,597
Why aren't the girls coming out?

24
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,684
In my case,

25
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,313
Min-ji and Hye-seon share the same room.

26
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,233
So if I knock, they'll both look at me.

27
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,109
That's going to be intense.

28
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,736
So I can't call either out.

29
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,405
Today, I won't approach anyone first.

30
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,323
Neither will I.

31
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,327
I really don't know
how I'm going to get out of this pickle.

32
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,957
This is the place we fought.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,625
Yes, it was fierce.

34
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,006
What?

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,008
It's time to make the final--

36
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,343
Do I make you smile?

37
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,388
-It's time to make the final choice.
-Fine, pretend you didn't hear me.

38
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,181
-But seriously.
-You're right.

39
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,976
Have you made up your mind?

40
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,144
-My mind?
-Yes.

41
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,437
-Yes, I have.
-I see.

42
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,649
-I'm not telling you my decision.
-Fine, don't.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,776
But it's obvious.

44
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,611
How can you be sure?

45
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,363
Will you stop?

46
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,991
I'm growing tired of this.

47
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,284
What do you mean?

48
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,079
-I want us to get along.
-Okay.

49
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,038
-Okay?
-Okay.

50
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,373
Stop making me cry.

51
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,917
-When did I make you cry?
-You always tease me.

52
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,419
Why are you holding my hand?

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,796
We grabbed at the same time.

54
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,340
Fine. I won't.

55
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,140
It's bittersweet.

56
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,766
-Now?
-Yes, that's how I feel.

57
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,897
What?

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,690
-Thank you.
-For what?

59
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,483
A lot of things.

60
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,613
You better not cry.

61
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,573
Don't cry. Don't make it your thing.

62
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,616
It's not my thing.

63
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,118
Stop trying to make it your thing.
Just don't.

64
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,457
-He caught her.
-I can't believe he said that.

65
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,167
-Come on, man.
-"Your thing."

66
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,127
Just when it was going well.

67
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,671
-It's because he feels awkward.
-Right.

68
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,090
-Just don't.
-I'm just saying thank you.

69
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,216
I thank you too.

70
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:38,927
But just a little.

71
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,969
Like, this much.

72
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,721
Gosh, you just won't stop.

73
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,848
I only thank you a teeny weeny bit.

74
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,772
I'm sure it wasn't easy,
but thank you for putting up with me here.

75
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,234
-I enjoyed it, thanks to you.
-Right.

76
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,318
I mean it.

77
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,486
Same goes for me.

78
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,706
What is it now?

79
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,875
Why are you crying? Come here.

80
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,044
It'll ruin your makeup.

81
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,922
How pathetic.

82
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,633
-Don't say that.
-All right.

83
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,845
What's wrong?

84
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,306
-Why are you crying?
-I don't know.

85
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,268
Stop it. Don't cry.

86
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,812
Come here, don't move.

87
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,234
It was fun because of you.

88
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,403
Same here.

89
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,282
-Did you have fun arguing with me?
-Yes.

90
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,076
Stop crying. It's making me feel bad.

91
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,540
Okay?

92
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,541
Okay.

93
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,921
This isn't farewell,
even though we may not become a match.

94
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,510
-He's just joking.
-I think so too.

95
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,263
He needs to take her seriously now.

96
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,183
I wanted to be nice
and tell you how grateful I was

97
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,311
and how much I enjoyed your company.

98
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,979
And it made me tear up.

99
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:13,896
Right.

100
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,940
But hearing you say that makes me feel…

101
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,567
I can't believe you said that.

102
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,360
Seriously.

103
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,781
It's not over until it's over.
That's just how it is.

104
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,949
Jeez.

105
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,872
Don't be such a tease.

106
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,790
Give me your hand.

107
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,501
-Stop being such a tease.
-Okay, fine.

108
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,211
-Okay?
-Okay.

109
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,429
I had fun too, thanks to you.

110
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,597
Thank you.

111
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,643
-They also circled back.
-Yes.

112
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,063
-Yes, they circled back.
-They really did.

113
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,692
-What is it?
-Nothing.

114
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,990
Who is Ha-jeong looking at right now?

115
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,992
-We know that glance.
-Who is it?

116
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,166
Is it Gwan-hee? Yes, it is.

117
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,376
-Maybe there's still hope.
-Maybe.

118
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,337
I haven't seen that glance in a while.

119
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:27,303
Ha-jeong, do you have any last words
that you'd like to say to me?

120
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,473
Circle back to me.

121
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,144
-Circle back to Ha-jeong.
-"Circle back to Ha-jeong."

122
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,022
-Ha-jeong is very much devoted to him.
-Right.

123
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,149
Circle back to me.

124
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,154
-In the end?
-Yes.

125
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,367
Remember "Circle back to Ha-jeong"?

126
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,831
Any last words for me?

127
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,249
For you?

128
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,378
-I do, in three words.
-What?

129
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,462
What is it?

130
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,924
I loved you.

131
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,051
I loved you.

132
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,849
He said "loved."

133
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,101
I loved you.

134
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,855
Seriously? You loved me?

135
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,022
-Really?
-Well…

136
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:25,695
When it comes to those short moments
that make you fall in love,

137
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,449
you had the most significant impact on me,
and I liked you the most.

138
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,870
We first met outside the hotel lobby.

139
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,580
-Right.
-I still remember how I felt

140
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,748
while waiting for you in the car.

141
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,834
-You left the most powerful impression.
-Right.

142
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,419
Where are we going?

143
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,465
I'm guessing we're headed to Inferno.

144
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,927
I also remember
the helicopter ride with you.

145
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,600
-Let me have some.
-It's medication.

146
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,018
They're prescription meds.

147
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,440
Same goes for me.

148
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,235
I also told people
that you were the only person here

149
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,946
that I actually developed feelings for.

150
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,909
But those feelings aren't
as strong as they used to be, so…

151
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,368
For you, maybe, but not me.

152
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,956
Anyway, we never really talked after that,

153
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,125
and things kind of turned awkward for us.

154
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,253
-Right.
-But if I had to put it in words,

155
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,590
I think that's how I'd describe it.

156
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,509
Thanks.

157
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,012
I thought it was just me
who felt that way,

158
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,306
so it's nice to know
that you felt the same.

159
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,185
That's good enough for me,
regardless of whom you choose.

160
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,439
What's with you guys?
Why have you become so amicable?

161
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,152
When Gwan-hee told me all those things,

162
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:52,698
I remembered all those moments
we had shared together.

163
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,411
He let me sleep on his shoulder
when I got sleepy,

164
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,457
and we had so much fun
talking about a lot of things.

165
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,419
I just kept thinking about
the fun times we had spent together.

166
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,587
Here, care for this?

167
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,672
I think

168
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,217
I like you the most.

169
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,651
-Gosh, she's crying.
-Oh, no.

170
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,111
Oh, no. Is she crying?

171
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,283
Oh, gosh.

172
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,745
It's bittersweet.

173
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,622
That's how it feels.

174
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,752
I also feel grateful
that he felt the same way.

175
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,764
It's really over now.

176
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,685
-Gwan-hee made himself clear to Ha-jeong.
-Right.

177
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,438
-And Ha-jeong looks like she understands.
-Yes.

178
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,858
-She's become so soft in just a week.
-Yes, really.

179
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,153
-Her feistiness is gone.
-Yes, she did a full detox.

180
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,614
-More so today than ever.
-Yes.

181
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,465
-They both haven't left?
-My goodness.

182
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,634
-Neither is giving in.
-They're staying inside.

183
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,926
Why though?

184
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,804
They know the last one to talk
will have a bigger impact.

185
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,057
-So they both want to talk to him last?
-Yes.

186
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,683
It's intense.

187
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,563
There's nothing more to say.

188
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,316
For me, at least.

189
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,360
Well, I guess you're right.

190
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,320
What time did you sleep last night?

191
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,656
Yesterday?

192
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,616
We slept at 12:30 a.m.

193
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,618
-At 12:30 a.m.?
-Yes.

194
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,536
We slept at 11:00 p.m.

195
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,706
Because… You know I went
to Paradise the day before.

196
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,709
The place was huge,
so we walked around the room.

197
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,544
-The room?
-There was nothing else to do.

198
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,296
It's not like we could work out.

199
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,006
So we just kept walking around.

200
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,967
We fell asleep pretty late that night

201
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,719
-That's cute.
-because we kept walking.

202
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,930
Won-ik apparently loves to take walks.

203
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,723
-Won-ik?
-Yes.

204
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,020
-Is she talking him up?
-My gosh.

205
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,022
Won-ik apparently loves to take walks.

206
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,899
-Won-ik?
-Yes.

207
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,943
Should I suddenly go for Won-ik?

208
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,822
-"Shall we take a walk?"
-But he's seriously not that bad.

209
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,617
-Have you ever talked to him?
-No, not even once.

210
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,036
-You should try.
-I doubt I'd regret it though.

211
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,581
-I want to make the right choice.
-He's different once you talk to him.

212
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,378
Really? But then,
I'd have to go to his room.

213
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,088
-Won-ik? Really?
-Yes.

214
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,548
Son Won-ik, right?

215
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,092
-No, I don't want to be in the sun.
-Right.

216
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,638
By the way, I've never really

217
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:06,058
openly told anyone
about whom I actually like.

218
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:10,354
But everyone seems to think
that I have something for Won-ik.

219
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,316
I know I said some good stuff about him,
but I don't think I ever did anything

220
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,235
-to make people think that way.
-Right.

221
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,071
I don't think anyone here

222
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:24,910
can say for certain who they really like.

223
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,120
Apart from me.

224
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,456
I was pretty clear about myself.

225
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,333
-But--
-I think he'll want to chat with you.

226
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,879
-He'll probably want to talk to us both.
-Right.

227
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,181
No one's making a move.

228
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,309
It wouldn't be so bad
for the three of them to talk together.

229
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,520
Did you talk to Min-ji?

230
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,646
No.

231
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,815
-Neither of us has made the first move.
-Really?

232
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,984
You're all just waiting?

233
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,863
Who will be the first to come outside?

234
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,200
Don't you want to talk to Hye-seon?

235
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:06,911
Do you need help?

236
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,871
-Do you?
-A little.

237
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,915
Help me out once we get there.

238
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,124
Over there?

239
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,336
Gosh, why aren't they coming outside?

240
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,755
But what should I talk about?

241
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,465
-With Hye-seon?
-Yes.

242
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,801
I'll ask Hye-seon to chat.

243
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,190
Gwan-hee is the only one
you want to talk to, right?

244
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,109
Not necessarily,
since we were together all day yesterday.

245
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,946
-Really?
-I don't have much to say to him.

246
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,531
Come in.

247
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,368
-What are you guys up to?
-Just talking.

248
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,870
-Are you all outside?
-No, no one's here now.

249
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,205
No one's outside anymore?

250
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,962
-There's one person.
-Just one guy.

251
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,588
-Just Gwan-hee.
-Yes.

252
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,677
-Are you bored?
-A little.

253
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,220
-You two can talk.
-Come here.

254
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,139
You two can talk in here.
I was going to leave anyway.

255
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,853
-Are you going to talk to her?
-Min-woo, come on in.

256
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,278
Those are new sunglasses.

257
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,446
Well, yes.

258
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,910
Min-woo, should we talk outside
so we know what everyone's up to?

259
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,203
-Should we--
-Here is fine.

260
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,246
Is it okay here?

261
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,001
This is her bed. Sit here.

262
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,628
Is it okay to sit here?

263
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,380
I don't think she'll mind.

264
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,302
This is someone else's room. Is it okay?

265
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,388
-It's fine. It doesn't matter.
-Right.

266
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,599
Place my shoes outside, please.

267
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,268
-Jeez.
-What?

268
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,228
Are you a princess?

269
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,146
Aren't I?

270
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,939
Of course not.

271
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,817
Forget it.

272
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,076
Do you have nothing to say?

273
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,998
Yesterday,

274
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,875
I began to question

275
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:24,214
if your feelings for me
were truly sincere.

276
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,341
I see.

277
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,258
And…

278
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,094
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON

279
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,182
But if it's also in your heart
not to send me any mixed signals,

280
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,100
I suggest you go with Jin-seok.

281
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,018
-Really?
-Yes.

282
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,019
That's a surprise.

283
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,522
I really didn't expect
the conversation to pan out like this.

284
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,944
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

285
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,528
Park Min-kyu.

286
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,865
That's just how I felt.

287
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,161
So…

288
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,330
I see.

289
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,333
Well…

290
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,709
Why are you crying?

291
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,044
What's wrong?

292
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,504
Why are you crying?

293
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,883
I'm okay with you getting confused
about your feelings.

294
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,176
Okay.

295
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,096
That much I can understand. But I'm…

296
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,433
I'm upset that you still doubt
my feelings for you.

297
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,436
I even wrote you a note
saying there's no one else for me.

298
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,439
-She was always clear with him.
-That's right.

299
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,567
-She's very logical.
-She was always straightforward.

300
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,949
If I'd won the game,
I would've picked you,

301
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,492
and I even gave you that note.

302
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,494
I also explained myself.

303
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,539
I really thought
I was an open book with you.

304
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:42,292
But you suddenly started to ignore me,

305
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,003
and that made me so sad.

306
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,089
I thought we really had
a lot of fun together in Paradise.

307
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,508
That's why I was upset.

308
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,928
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

309
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,722
All right. I'm sorry.

310
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,725
-He's become all soft again.
-Right.

311
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,394
Stop crying.

312
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,312
I get what you mean.

313
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:08,068
I didn't know that you cried
in the helicopter yesterday.

314
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,738
I looked the other way
because I was mad at you.

315
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,323
Then I noticed that you two were talking.

316
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,659
But you were talking to him
with your head down,

317
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,120
so it looked like you were
talking to his chest.

318
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,955
I had no idea what was going on.

319
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,584
Min-kyu was so nice about it.
He got concerned because I kept crying.

320
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,670
I really had no idea what was going on.

321
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,884
But as I was sitting next to you

322
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,428
-in the helicopter,
-Yes?

323
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,431
I found myself leaning toward you.

324
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,562
I just felt like I wanted to be
by your side.

325
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,276
Okay.

326
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,696
-So it's still ongoing?
-Of course.

327
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,908
-Isn't this the last episode?
-Don't let your guard down.

328
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,910
-It's not over until it's over.
-Gosh.

329
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,244
He's the worst.

330
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,622
-He really is the worst.
-Seriously.

331
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,708
I told you, it's like a Möbius strip.

332
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,211
-It's not over yet.
-This will never end.

333
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,091
After all, I'm obviously aware
of my feelings for you.

334
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:13,926
I know.

335
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,722
But I was really upset earlier
when you said you doubted my sincerity.

336
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,309
-It's just how I felt.
-No one here is as sincere as I am.

337
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,811
I swear, no one.

338
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,687
I just felt…

339
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:30,025
I didn't think Min-kyu would tell me
anything that happened with you.

340
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,653
But he was considerate enough to tell me

341
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,405
that you two had fun like siblings.

342
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,865
So once I heard that,

343
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,742
it really cleared the air for me.

344
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,161
I'm all good now.

345
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,415
So I get what you mean.

346
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,003
Anyway, I'm sorry.

347
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,758
Forget it. I guess I was the only one
who thought our time together was special.

348
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,719
It was obviously special for me too.

349
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,763
-It really was.
-But not anymore?

350
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,723
Hye-seon told me lots of things.

351
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,893
While I cried over you,

352
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,647
I heard you were having fun in a hot tub
on a different floor.

353
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,732
And what else did you do? Get a massage?

354
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,695
We spent some time in a hot tub,
both got a massage, then went back.

355
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,363
You didn't do anything with me.

356
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,284
-How about we go today?
-Today? You want to escape?

357
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:24,163
How about we leave holding hands
and head straight to Paradise tonight?

358
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,081
-Then let's get a massage.
-Jeez.

359
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,918
He's really something.

360
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,176
Hye-seon and I spent

361
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,262
a great time together.

362
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,015
But it wasn't enough
to make me forget you.

363
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,475
I couldn't help but think of you there

364
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:50,689
because it was the exact same room
that we stayed in the night before.

365
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,983
Hye-seon and I stayed in the same room.

366
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:57,529
There were traces of us there,
so it felt a bit odd.

367
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,949
-Did you think of me a lot?
-Very much.

368
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,619
I remembered
how we walked around together.

369
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,704
Yes, we walked.

370
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,753
Don't hate me so much.

371
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,341
I don't hate you.
I never did. I was just upset.

372
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,386
I don't know how honest I should be,

373
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,098
but between the two of you,
you're closer to my ideal type.

374
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,392
You're much closer to my type.

375
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,313
And I feel grateful that someone
who's closest to my ideal type

376
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,858
was able to change my feelings.

377
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,778
I want to thank you for that.

378
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,863
I mean it.

379
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,910
I'll be good to you
so that you don't get confused.

380
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,415
Let's say we became a match
and left the island together.

381
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,042
If we did,

382
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,545
would you consider that day
our first day as a couple or…

383
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,339
We're a couple the day we leave.

384
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,054
I'm really upfront, aren't I?

385
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,722
I'm so cute, yet upfront.

386
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,777
-He's so happy.
-He's totally genuine.

387
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,737
Gwan-hee always lives in the moment,

388
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,782
and in that moment,
his feelings are nothing but sincere.

389
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,575
Stop trying to cover for him.

390
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,620
-You keep doing that.
-I think…

391
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,830
-Stop.
-That's enough.

392
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,457
-Right now, he's in love with Min-ji.
-He is.

393
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,584
But you know, I seriously…

394
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,461
Here's what bothers me.

395
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,796
He's such a coward.

396
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,341
He finds reasons in the other person
for his indecisiveness.

397
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,427
His excuse is always in another person.

398
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,387
That's what makes me so angry.

399
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,305
The thing is…

400
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,181
-He shifts the blame.
-Yes, right.

401
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,850
But it didn't work with Min-ji,

402
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,977
-so he finally apologized.
-He apologized.

403
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,145
He's not the worst.

404
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,063
He apologizes when it's necessary.

405
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,815
-He says sorry.
-He's not the worst?

406
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,944
Plus, Min-ji seems to know
how to deal with Gwan-hee.

407
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,154
-She does.
-Yes.

408
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,490
She keeps reassuring him
and telling him what he wants to hear.

409
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,909
-That's why Gwan-hee said what he said.
-Exactly.

410
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,205
I feel like he was almost ready
to end things with Min-ji at first.

411
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,123
Right.

412
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,207
But all of a sudden…

413
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,710
-The tables turned.
-Min-ji was too cute and adorable.

414
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,627
You're right.

415
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,796
And his heart completely melted

416
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,382
-when he heard that she cried.
-It played a big part.

417
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,426
-Then she cried again just now.
-She did.

418
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,679
Do you think Gwan-hee's final decision
is going to be Min-ji?

419
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,930
Right now, Min-ji…

420
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,099
I know this question is meaningless.

421
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,102
-Let's compare this to a race.
-Okay.

422
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,772
Hye-seon was in the lead,
but Min-ji just took over.

423
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,732
-She really did.
-That's what happened.

424
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,489
-Let's talk inside where it's cooler.
-Sure.

425
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:53,121
When I went to Paradise
with Si-eun and Min-ji,

426
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,123
I always thought of you.

427
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,754
I thought of you whenever I had good food,

428
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,966
and I thought of you
even as I talked to them.

429
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,720
It would've been a lot more fun
if you were there.

430
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,767
And if I could choose,
I would've just stayed here with you.

431
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,519
I mean it.

432
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,106
Then we would've
at least been able to talk more.

433
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,859
We still have time today.

434
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,403
And in the future.

435
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,197
-Right.
-Right?

436
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,491
I hope that's the case.

437
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,246
It's such a shame
that this is our last day.

438
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,455
Yes, you're right.

439
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:39,960
I realized that he's very dependable.

440
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:45,465
He's the type of person
who always tries to keep his word.

441
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:50,554
I've slowly come to realize that.

442
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,848
That's what I thought.

443
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,516
I met them twice.

444
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,934
-I didn't even once.
-Not me.

445
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,477
How many people are in there?

446
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,613
-There were a lot of people?
-Yes, about eight.

447
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,323
Why is no one in the other room?

448
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,660
You two should talk.

449
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,913
-Are you all done talking?
-Yes.

450
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:17,831
Okay then.

451
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,917
-Do you have something to say?
-Gosh.

452
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,295
He's the one who wants to talk.

453
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,090
He hit the nail on the head.

454
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,592
-He got him.
-That felt good.

455
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,387
I'd like to talk inside,
but all the rooms are…

456
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,722
I'll go inside.

457
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,348
-Is that room occupied?
-Talk here.

458
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,266
No.

459
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,351
You can talk here.

460
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,065
How sad is this?

461
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,902
What did you talk about with the guys?

462
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,446
I had my chance to play the queen bee.

463
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,033
Have you talked to Min-ji?

464
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,868
Well, yes.

465
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,162
It was nothing special.

466
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,372
Nothing extraordinary.

467
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,796
How was it for Min-ji?

468
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,133
She apparently cried while eating and…

469
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,968
-She cried?
-Well, yes.

470
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,262
I heard she cried
while talking with Min-kyu.

471
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,932
-Why?
-They went to bed early at 11:00 p.m.

472
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,810
They both told me
that they just hung out like siblings.

473
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,814
I wonder why she cried.
I guess something really upset her.

474
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,984
Maybe something triggered her
as they were talking.

475
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:39,246
-How do you think this is going to end?
-You mean your final choice?

476
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,706
-Another question.
-Here he goes again.

477
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,792
-It's another "what if" question.
-Exactly.

478
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,001
-Again.
-The If Boy.

479
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,544
He really does this often.

480
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:50,840
-How do you think this is going to end?
-You mean your final choice?

481
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,635
As for me,

482
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,973
I already told you,
I don't plan on changing my mind.

483
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:02,811
I think yesterday's trip
had a significant impact on me.

484
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,938
It was pretty significant for me.

485
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,898
Yesterday, it occurred to me

486
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:12,487
that maybe it would've been better
to pick you instead of Won-ik last time.

487
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,582
Remember how I told you
that I didn't want to go?

488
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,252
So it was a bit…

489
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,508
The fact that things turned out this way
makes me feel a bit…

490
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,551
Are you upset?

491
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,764
Yes, I'm upset that you chose
to go with Won-ik instead of me.

492
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:47,230
I'm starting to realize
that I was wrong about a lot of things.

493
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,859
I let my guard down a little.

494
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,110
In a way, I was…

495
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,696
It was because I knew
I wasn't going to change.

496
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,697
But then…

497
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,163
That's why.

498
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,503
I thought I'd quickly make up my mind.

499
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,048
I said I'd tell you the moment I was sure.

500
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,508
I didn't know I'd be unsure
until the very end.

501
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:21,514
So I feel bad that I can't tell you
what you want to hear.

502
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,059
-What?
-The thing is…

503
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,312
Min-ji never beat around the bush.

504
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:33,651
Even today, she was straightforward
about her feelings for me.

505
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,656
No one was ever like that with me here.

506
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,284
But Hye-seon was straightforward too.

507
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,244
-She was.
-Right.

508
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,914
-This could get exhausting for Hye-seon.
-It already did.

509
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:51,086
No one was ever like that with me here.

510
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,590
And it really affects me a lot.

511
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,514
So I wanted to figure things out
and tell you guys my final decision,

512
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:09,813
but I was unable to do that
with you or Min-ji.

513
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,942
Do you get it?

514
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,152
No?

515
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,454
Is Hye-seon just dumbstruck?

516
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,165
I think she's collecting her thoughts.

517
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,524
Then you should pick Min-ji.

518
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,193
I thought I was worth
more to you than that.

519
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:01,030
We went to Paradise together twice,
but you're still torn.

520
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,451
We even talked about
our potential relationship after all this

521
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,954
over dinner yesterday
and even this morning.

522
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:12,417
But if Min-ji is still on your mind,
I think you're better off with her.

523
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,045
I don't want to be with someone
who doesn't know what he wants.

524
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:23,052
I'm not saying I'm confused.

525
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:30,018
After I heard the guys talk about you,
I thought things were done between us.

526
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,229
-That's when Min-ji approached--
-I've explained enough about that.

527
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:37,609
Right now, it just feels like
you're leaning toward her

528
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:41,029
because you know for certain
that she's going to pick you.

529
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,365
This is out of my hands now.

530
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,951
I'm done trying.

531
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,829
-Yes.
-She said all the right things.

532
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,581
-She's right.
-That was spot on.

533
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,957
-Really.
-That felt good.

534
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,418
-Hye-seon knows when to draw a line.
-Yes.

535
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:59,380
-That was her limit.
-What more does he want from her?

536
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,298
Exactly.

537
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,148
No, I'm not saying
it swayed me or anything.

538
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,610
Come on.

539
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,362
Maybe this is what Hye-seon meant

540
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,365
when she said
he can sometimes be a bit pathetic.

541
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,491
Oh, no.

542
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:35,250
No, I'm not saying
it swayed me or anything.

543
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,504
It's just that Min-ji told me
that I was her one and only choice,

544
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:44,133
and I'm just trying to tell you
that it bothers me a little.

545
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,720
All right, thank you
for being honest and telling me that.

546
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,138
I appreciate your honesty.

547
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,515
But my point is this.

548
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,225
If that alone was enough

549
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:56,062
to make you reconsider
your final decision,

550
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,732
then I think the right choice
would be to pick her.

551
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:04,112
No, I'm not saying
it made me change my decision.

552
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:10,076
I was trying really hard
to word things correctly,

553
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,871
so please don't be mad.

554
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,213
-Okay?
-Okay.

555
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,174
That's just how I felt.

556
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,136
My gosh.

557
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,846
By any chance,

558
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,931
did I make you nervous?

559
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,474
-I'm always nervous.
-Really?

560
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,809
Yes, I'm like that.

561
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,521
My gosh.

562
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,566
I'm sorry.

563
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,567
It's okay.

564
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,947
Ha-jeong got mad at me as well
while talking to me once,

565
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,826
and Min-ji also got upset today,
so I'm starting to think I'm the problem.

566
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,830
That's a huge epiphany.

567
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,542
This is why I think it's hard
to hate Gwan-hee.

568
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,210
He can be cute sometimes.

569
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,129
-He's the treasure of this show.
-Yes.

570
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,886
Seeing that I upset all three of you
at least once during a conversation,

571
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,262
I must be the problem.

572
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,183
-You got a chance to reflect on yourself.
-Yes.

573
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,186
I guess I'm just that kind of guy.

574
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,396
That's my take on this.

575
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,154
This is really difficult.

576
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,907
If I had to choose someone tonight…

577
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,868
I'd just choose Min-young

578
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:38,539
and swim my way out of Inferno.
That's how hard it is.

579
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,466
What did Min-young ever do to him?

580
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,761
-She was never once involved with him.
-Right.

581
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,639
I'm not even close to making up my mind.

582
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:59,060
Every time I had a serious conversation
with Hye-seon or Min-ji,

583
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,646
they either got angry at me or cried.

584
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:06,234
So it made me realize
that I was the one at fault.

585
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,612
I may have denied it, but I realized

586
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:14,784
that maybe I've been comparing them
and weighing my options a bit too much.

587
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,956
He's right on point.

588
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,583
-He's learned his lesson.
-Yes, he has.

589
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,293
Gwan-hee has changed.

590
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:28,423
Gwan-hee is going to become
a much better person after this show.

591
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,633
Seriously.

592
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,428
He seems like the type

593
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,347
who finds it hard
to say uncomfortable things to people.

594
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,851
He keeps switching his stance
whenever the conversation gets uneasy.

595
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,852
Right.

596
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,979
-Wait, no.
-Is he too nice?

597
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,566
-He turned down Ha-jeong just fine.
-Yes, exactly.

598
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:50,778
To be completely blunt,
he put Hye-seon and Min-ji on a scale,

599
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,574
and now he wants to know
if Hye-seon has more to offer than Min-ji.

600
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,950
That's what it feels like.

601
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,076
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

602
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,829
But Hye-seon straight up told him
that she was done

603
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,998
and that it was out of her hands now.

604
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,543
She told him to pick the other girl,
which is why he was taken aback.

605
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,961
That's what it seems like.

606
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:11,299
I honestly think he said those things
to deal with the situation

607
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,010
and soothe her anger.

608
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,929
But he's genuinely leaning toward Min-ji.

609
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,308
Min-ji is the only one
who hasn't gotten mad at him.

610
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,561
In that aspect,
he may end up choosing her.

611
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:27,023
Hye-seon reacted so coldly,
which probably left him flustered.

612
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:30,234
It just seemed like
he was trying to get out of the situation.

613
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,571
Will it be Hye-seon or Min-ji?
I have no idea at this point.

614
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,247
This is our last night.

615
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,791
It's our last time together.

616
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,334
-It is.
-Right?

617
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,462
Gosh, it's so pretty.

618
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,010
Everyone, please grab a seat.

619
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,470
I'm going to sit here.

620
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,641
-I'm going to drink Hoegaarden.
-We're to throw this in as is.

621
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,476
-Without opening it?
-Yes.

622
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,393
Okay.

623
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,854
-The thing that makes colorful fire?
-There are snacks.

624
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:08,940
You're beside me again.

625
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,568
It's hot.

626
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,736
Sure, if you want.

627
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,197
She's sitting next to him.

628
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,283
She had to sit next to him
despite the heat.

629
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,203
It doesn't matter. Sit down.

630
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,080
-"It doesn't matter."
-Take a seat.

631
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,041
-Do you want this or that?
-I don't know what's what.

632
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,168
The one that tastes better.

633
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,503
I'll have the blue one.

634
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,796
This looks better.

635
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,506
I think this one looks better.

636
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,550
It suits your outfit.

637
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,136
-Ha-bin, what do you want?
-That one.

638
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,227
I realized that Min-ji was
a lot more persistent than I had expected.

639
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:51,440
She seemed determined to stay beside him
for as long as she could.

640
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,443
And in a way, I just wanted to watch.

641
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,322
She chose not to intervene.

642
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,324
Good choice. She already did her best.

643
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,664
I want to take a photo.

644
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,585
Whenever you want to take a photo,

645
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,005
-do this and wait three seconds.
-Okay.

646
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,506
Then the image will linger.

647
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,133
-Really?
-That's what I heard.

648
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,762
Whenever I see something pretty,
I do this and count to three.

649
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,390
-I should sit elsewhere.
-Then it lingers in my mind.

650
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,309
-Stay here.
-I don't think I can.

651
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,313
-How about a toast, guys?
-Sounds good.

652
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,230
All right, guys.

653
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,065
-Okay, it's time.
-Ready, guys?

654
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,108
Is everyone ready?

655
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,026
Okay, cheers!

656
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,111
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

657
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,115
-It's our last day.
-It was fun, guys.

658
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,284
You guys all did great here.

659
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,373
I can't believe it's coming to an end.
Seriously. I can't believe it.

660
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,541
-Same here.
-Right?

661
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,919
Let's say our ages. Guys first.

662
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,545
-Nice.
-We're revealing our ages?

663
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,380
-They're going to tell us.
-I'm nervous.

664
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,424
-I really want to know how old he is.
-Me too.

665
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,426
-Seriously.
-I can't wait to find out.

666
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,011
He could be younger than me.

667
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,973
-Si-eun doesn't know?
-Si-eun doesn't know how old he is.

668
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,142
-I forgot that Si-eun doesn't know.
-Right.

669
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,811
-She'll be shocked.
-She'll be so shocked.

670
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,855
-You don't know his age?
-I don't.

671
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,233
We never got to go to Paradise together.

672
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,154
Wait, I can't do this.

673
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:21,989
You're that nervous?

674
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,617
How cute.

675
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,703
First off,

676
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,538
I'm 24.

677
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,791
I'm 24.

678
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,462
We were all shocked too.

679
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,966
She's really shocked.

680
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,551
I'm 24.

681
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,224
-Min-woo!
-See? I told you he'd be young.

682
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,142
-Really?
-I knew you'd be younger, but…

683
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,228
-Min-woo!
-So you were born in 2000?

684
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:53,896
Yes, I was.

685
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,149
-Really?
-Min-woo, you were born in 2000?

686
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,652
-Everyone suddenly stood up.
-I see.

687
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,071
-This is so shocking.
-Gosh, but seriously…

688
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,325
He's the handsome younger guy.

689
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,577
Why do you assume he's younger?

690
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,998
-We might be the same age.
-Right.

691
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,792
I was really surprised
when I heard how old he was.

692
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:19,255
But it also made me realize
that he's very mature for his age.

693
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,009
And it was amazing how we clicked so well
even though we never got a chance

694
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,969
to share any personal information.

695
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,763
It made me realize
those things weren't as important,

696
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,433
and it only made me see things
in a brighter light.

697
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,563
I can't wait to hear Si-eun's age.
It's tough to tell.

698
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,773
Well, first off,

699
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,610
I'm 27 years old.

700
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,070
Twenty-seven.

701
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,239
She's older than you.

702
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,949
-Seriously?
-You're with someone older.

703
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,871
He's three years younger.

704
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,794
I thought he'd be my age.

705
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,171
Min-woo's in for a ride.

706
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,135
After I talked to Si-eun
and found out her age and occupation,

707
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,180
I was actually glad
because I'm into older women.

708
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,683
Gwan-hee's turn.

709
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,770
-I think he's the oldest one here.
-Yes.

710
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,023
I was born

711
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,775
in 1988.

712
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,109
-In 1988?
-My brother's age.

713
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,569
-So how old is he?
-He's 36.

714
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,196
-Two years older?
-You look so young.

715
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,323
All right. We know who's the oldest now.

716
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,325
We haven't heard from everyone.

717
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,660
You're 12 years older than Min-woo.

718
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,913
-Twelve years?
-Yes.

719
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,623
-You're 12 years apart?
-Yes.

720
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,625
-That's crazy.
-Really?

721
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,418
And as for my job,

722
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,421
-I'm a basketball player.
-Oh, no wonder.

723
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,299
-I still play professionally.
-I see.

724
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,676
-That's cool.
-I'm an athlete.

725
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,264
I think the guys should talk about
how to address each other now.

726
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,599
-Yes, sir.
-Let's do that.

727
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,017
-So old-fashioned.
-Yes, sir.

728
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,018
All right, sir.

729
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,853
Did you hear what he just said?

730
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,649
Min-kyu, stop crossing your legs.

731
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,109
Of course. I'm sorry.

732
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,152
He's doing this already?

733
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,613
All right.

734
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,533
I have a question for Gwan-hee.

735
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,743
I know you had a lot on your mind today.

736
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,372
Have you made up your mind,
or are you still thinking?

737
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,801
Not yet.

738
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,429
I haven't made up my mind yet.

739
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,724
-I totally understand.
-Now, we…

740
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,309
-We get it now.
-Yes.

741
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,436
He's being honest.

742
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,355
I would've been surprised
if his mind was already set.

743
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,440
-Yes.
-Right.

744
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,692
That wouldn't be the Gwan-hee I know.

745
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:45,985
He's just being honest.

746
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,779
Not yet.

747
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,323
I haven't made up my mind yet.

748
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,374
Why can't you decide?

749
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,176
Good question.

750
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,260
Well, I…

751
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,679
No comment.

752
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,650
-Neither of them can be happy about that.
-Of course.

753
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,902
This is troubling.

754
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,823
I have a question for Hye-seon.

755
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:39,413
If you could turn back time
to a certain moment, when would it be?

756
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,054
Is this about Won-ik again?

757
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,515
He wants her to say that it's the moment

758
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,141
-that she chose Won-ik?
-Maybe?

759
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,061
I feel like he wants
to hear a certain answer.

760
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,188
-No way.
-I hope that's not why he asked.

761
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,356
I hope that's not why.

762
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,911
The first day.

763
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,454
The first day?

764
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,291
The first day?

765
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,835
-What does that mean?
-It could mean a lot of things.

766
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,629
There are many ways to interpret it.

767
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:32,091
-Does she want to start over?
-Perhaps she wants a clean slate.

768
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,843
-She went to Paradise with him that day.
-Yes, she did.

769
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,304
Maybe she wants to undo
what happened that day.

770
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,558
-On the contrary, perhaps she loved it.
-She could be reminiscing.

771
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,352
-You can interpret it in different ways.
-You're right.

772
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,563
-It's open to interpretation.
-It is.

773
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,399
The first day.

774
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,441
The first day?

775
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,999
I think he expected me to say
that I'd like to go back to the day

776
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,626
that I went to Paradise with Won-ik,

777
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,504
but I didn't want
to give him that satisfaction.

778
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,132
That's why I picked the first day.

779
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,552
-She knew.
-Hye-seon already knew it all.

780
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,054
-She sees right through him.
-Exactly.

781
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,681
Hye-seon is quite sharp.

782
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,018
Gwan-hee's easily influenced
by things like this.

783
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,894
-Right.
-So I wonder how he feels.

784
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:26,812
Me too.

785
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:30,524
-He doesn't look too happy right now.
-He doesn't.

786
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,444
Is it my turn?

787
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,238
Hey, Min-ji.

788
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,908
-You had to join us in the middle.
-Yes.

789
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,202
I'm sure you talked to a lot of people.

790
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,454
I did.

791
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:46,040
Have you made up your mind?

792
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:46,957
Me?

793
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,710
Have I made up my mind?

794
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,215
Yes, I have.

795
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,594
I just hope I made the right decision.

796
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,232
I have a question for Hye-seon.

797
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,111
A lot of things have happened
since we got here.

798
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,406
Out of all those moments,
when did your heart flutter the most?

799
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,413
Because of a guy?

800
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,706
Yes, because of a guy.

801
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,712
I can't think of anything.

802
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,508
She can't think of anything.

803
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,635
She won't give him the answer he wants.

804
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,594
No.

805
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,596
-Hye-seon seems upset.
-Right.

806
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,640
-I think she's exhausted.
-Yes.

807
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:48,185
She no longer wants to stroke his ego,
especially on the last night.

808
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,437
That has to be awkward.

809
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,027
Really?

810
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,030
You never felt anything?

811
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,532
No.

812
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,743
If you say so.

813
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,671
Well done, everyone.

814
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,467
Everyone, I hope…

815
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,680
He's the youngest one here.

816
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:25,931
How sweet.

817
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,141
"How sweet."

818
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,936
I just wanted to say I hope we'll all meet

819
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:34,398
as often as we can after we leave here.

820
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:40,404
I had a lot of shortcomings,
so thank you for looking after me.

821
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,532
-He's so cute.
-You didn't have any shortcomings.

822
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:50,998
It's been six years
since I started my business,

823
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,167
and this was my first vacation.

824
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:58,672
Thank you for making this vacation
so meaningful for me.

825
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,926
I don't think
I'll ever forget my time here.

826
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,219
Thank you.

827
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,683
-Don't cry.
-Okay.

828
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,644
-Well…
-No, don't.

829
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,356
It's too early to cry.
We still have tomorrow.

830
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:27,201
Well, I'm just grateful for everything.

831
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,921
I think it's amazing
that everyone here is so nice.

832
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,886
I'm so grateful
that I got to meet all of you.

833
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,933
I had a great time.

834
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:57,397
I'm grateful for every single moment
I spent with all of you.

835
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,278
Goodness.

836
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,281
Are you crying?

837
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,409
Gwan-hee.

838
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,578
-He's crying?
-Seriously?

839
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,915
-What? Really?
-This is crazy.

840
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,417
-I love Gwan-hee.
-I just can't figure him out.

841
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,920
-That's why people like him.
-That's right.

842
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,755
-He's sweet.
-He really is.

843
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,466
-Gwan-hee.
-Oh, no.

844
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,386
-Gwan-hee.
-I get why he's crying.

845
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,638
What's wrong?

846
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,228
-Things could change again.
-Those tears…

847
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,565
Those tears may bring them back together.

848
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,316
-Yes, that may happen.
-Right?

849
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,195
What's wrong?

850
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,614
Hey, babe.

851
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,949
Babe, don't cry.

852
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,409
Are you the emotional type?

853
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,005
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

854
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,257
Goodness.

855
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,219
Well…

856
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:15,726
Over the course of my career
as a professional athlete,

857
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,230
I've always found
the training really hard.

858
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,071
And next week, I'll start training again.

859
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:32,451
I'll treasure the memories
and the good times we shared here

860
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,453
as I go through all the hard training.

861
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,874
Once the season begins this winter,

862
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,709
come watch me play.

863
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,592
Is he crying
because he doesn't want to train?

864
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,678
-Because it's too tough?
-Maybe.

865
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,806
-He has to go back to training.
-He had so much fun here.

866
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,600
The dreadful training awaits him.

867
00:48:56,683 --> 00:49:01,021
I guess Gwan-hee had
a lot of ups and downs during this period.

868
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,398
Yes, I doubt he cried
because of the training.

869
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:04,858
Right.

870
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,154
You did great, Gwan-hee.

871
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,822
You did great.

872
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,685
It seems like he really is pure at heart.

873
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,769
The reason being,

874
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,107
we're not asking him to marry one of them.

875
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,900
But he takes it very seriously.

876
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,985
-He's sincere.
-He's so pure.

877
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:53,031
We knew this would happen,
but he said he hadn't made up his mind.

878
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,534
I wonder how that made
Hye-seon and Min-ji feel.

879
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,202
I would've been annoyed.

880
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,371
"You still haven't made up your mind?"

881
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,624
-That's how I would feel.
-Right.

882
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,043
-Hye-seon seemed exhausted.
-She did.

883
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:10,632
I think I get why. Hye-seon no longer
wants to humor Gwan-hee at this point.

884
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:14,010
If she said her heart fluttered,
Gwan-hee would've been happy.

885
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:17,973
But I don't think
she wants that to be why he chooses her.

886
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:23,520
And I think she knows Gwan-hee
better than anybody there.

887
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,732
She knows him too well
and doesn't want to humor him anymore.

888
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,735
-She's done more than enough.
-She has.

889
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,654
"Do I need to go this far
just to date someone like him?"

890
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,364
-She may feel that way.
-She's tired.

891
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,657
-She's exhausted.
-Right.

892
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,514
Hey, you're here.

893
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:05,896
Why did you cry?

894
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,606
-What?
-Why did you cry so much?

895
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,821
Why did you cry?

896
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,991
I know. It's so embarrassing.

897
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,245
Man, this is going to ruin my reputation.

898
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,920
Once you started crying,
everyone after you cried.

899
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,588
Not that many people cried.

900
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:39,429
Anyway, what's the matter?
Have you not decided yet?

901
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,474
-I have.
-And?

902
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,937
Did you feel bad
with Min-ji right next to you?

903
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,317
It's both you and Min-ji.

904
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:56,655
I didn't want to share my decision
with everyone there.

905
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,240
It wasn't easy for me

906
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,326
to come to a decision.

907
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,577
That's why…

908
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,373
I just didn't want to share it openly.

909
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:18,051
There's one last thing I want to tell you.

910
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:25,600
Among the people I met here,

911
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,563
you are the most warm-hearted person.

912
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:35,819
I can also tell
that you're very considerate.

913
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:44,911
There were quite a few things
I learned from you.

914
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,251
I just wanted to tell you…

915
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:57,632
that you're a far greater person
than you may think you are.

916
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,510
So…

917
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,641
I wanted to tell you that before we left.

918
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,188
Thank you.

919
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:24,576
I feel bad for what I put Min-ji through,

920
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:28,121
but I feel worse
for what I put you through.

921
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,792
We spent more time together.

922
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,879
I feel like…

923
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,019
I hurt you, and I feel horrible.

924
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:05,241
People may think
I was weighing my options.

925
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,912
And if you thought the same,
I wouldn't be able to argue with it.

926
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,792
Right.

927
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,130
So that's that.

928
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,133
Is this because I got mad at you earlier?

929
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,347
Well, I guess a little bit.

930
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:40,235
The emotions I felt when I was with you
and the moments we shared together

931
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,322
were much more special
than anything I did or felt

932
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,658
with anyone here.

933
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,299
I didn't expect to see him cry.

934
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,593
I think he made up his mind.

935
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,846
-It felt like a goodbye to me.
-It did.

936
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:12,976
Are you saying that's his way
of telling her he won't pick her?

937
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,186
-Yes.
-Is that what this conversation means?

938
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,981
"I'm so sorry I'm not choosing you."

939
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,650
"But you're such a nice person."

940
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,194
I honestly think Gwan-hee had no idea

941
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,031
-how he felt up until now.
-Right.

942
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,366
That's why he's blaming himself

943
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,702
-You're right.
-and realizing what he did wrong.

944
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,663
-I think he'll pick Min-ji.
-So far, it's Min-ji.

945
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,207
-We don't know what will happen tomorrow.
-I think…

946
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,085
-I think he'll choose Hye-seon.
-What?

947
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,045
-Really?
-Yes.

948
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,629
-Really?
-I think he'll pick her.

949
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,590
It's hard to say why,

950
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,508
-but I think so too.
-You do?

951
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,594
-I mean, think about it.
-Okay.

952
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:51,222
If he wasn't going to pick her,
he may feel bad about it.

953
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,059
-Right.
-But he wouldn't cry like that.

954
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,643
He's still attached to her.

955
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,811
He's still attached?

956
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,355
-He still has feelings for her.
-He liked her so much.

957
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,191
That's why I think he'll pick her.

958
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,027
This is how I interpreted
Gwan-hee's behavior.

959
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,237
-He had feelings for two women,
-Right.

960
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,199
-but he finally decided to let go of one.
-Exactly.

961
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,994
I think he was ending it with Hye-seon
so he could focus on Min-ji.

962
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:16,706
But at the end of the day,
I think he's drawn to Hye-seon more.

963
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:22,212
When Hye-seon started to cry,
he also shed some tears.

964
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,964
I think there was a connection there.

965
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,549
-Tears of connection.
-Exactly.

966
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,344
People don't cry that easily.

967
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:33,014
-They need to be moved or touched.
-That's right.

968
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,432
They had a connection.

969
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,559
-I don't know.
-We have different opinions.

970
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,688
-Have we disagreed on something this much?
-I wonder what will happen.

971
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,815
It's a first, I think.

972
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,863
-The final day.
-The final.

973
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,949
-Everything circles back.
-The last day.

974
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,660
Today's the day.

975
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:26,651
My gosh.

976
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,780
I want to leave this place,
but it feels odd.

977
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,452
I know. I think this place will leave

978
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,787
a lasting impact on us. Right?

979
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,706
It'll leave a huge impact.

980
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,752
If he's out for a walk,

981
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,714
-it means he's still undecided.
-He's still thinking.

982
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,716
If he had made up his mind,

983
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,135
he wouldn't be out walking.
He'd be at peace.

984
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,095
-You're right.
-He hasn't decided yet.

985
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,764
It's really our last day.

986
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,600
I know.

987
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,436
-I'm curious about Gwan-hee.
-Right.

988
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,439
Who he'll pick?

989
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,107
Yes, I'm really curious.

990
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,694
I feel so nervous.

991
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,284
I'm dying to find out too.

992
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,036
This is so unpredictable.

993
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,519
YU SI-EUN

994
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,437
SON WON-IK

995
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,525
This is your last day in the hottest
inferno in the world, Single's Inferno.

996
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,484
KIM GYU-RI

997
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,570
PARK MIN-KYU

998
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:57,617
You will now make your final decision.

999
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,619
AN MIN-YOUNG

1000
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,205
LEE JIN-SEOK

1001
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,583
CHO MIN-JI

1002
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,086
LEE GWAN-HEE

1003
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,964
CHOI HYE-SEON

1004
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,383
YUN HA-JEONG

1005
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,219
YUN HA-BIN

1006
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:17,887
Are you nervous?

1007
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,764
Yes, a little.

1008
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,980
Lee Jin-seok.

1009
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,983
Please proceed to the Gates of Inferno.

1010
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,795
I'm so nervous.

1011
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,719
Ladies, if Lee Jin-seok
is your final choice,

1012
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,513
please go stand in front of him.

1013
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,348
-So that's how this works.
-I see.

1014
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,184
Min-young will go, right?

1015
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,272
I get it now.

1016
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,943
-Oh, so it's random.
-My goodness.

1017
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,320
Yes, she's going.

1018
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,573
Goodbye.

1019
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:19,657
-I'll be back.
-Bye.

1020
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,951
-See you.
-I don't think you'll be coming back.

1021
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,745
-I won't?
-You'll leave.

1022
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:26,247
Jin-seok will be so thrilled.

1023
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,640
I'm nervous.

1024
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:48,936
Jin-seok.

1025
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,399
Thank you for being so nice to me.

1026
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:58,363
This place would've been
a literal inferno without you here.

1027
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,282
Bake me some bread when we go out.

1028
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:07,830
Min-young.

1029
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:09,957
Thank you.

1030
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:14,921
The end.

1031
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:15,838
Jeez.

1032
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,638
Lee Jin-seok,
please reveal your final decision.

1033
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:33,272
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1034
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,322
An Min-young.

1035
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,453
-Goodness.
-I'm so happy for them.

1036
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,084
-They're a cute couple.
-They are.

1037
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,377
An Min-young.

1038
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:58,840
Nice.

1039
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,427
We already knew this would happen.

1040
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,511
Of course.

1041
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,396
You better listen to me.

1042
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,273
-You should too.
-I will.

1043
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,817
-Don't be so mean to me.
-I won't.

1044
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,824
They look like newlyweds.

1045
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:25,742
They do.

1046
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,244
She learned her lesson
after playing hard to get.

1047
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,704
-That's right.
-She did.

1048
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:31,414
-Totally.
-A huge lesson.

1049
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,790
She only has eyes for him now.

1050
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,459
It was cute to see her change.

1051
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,794
-Yes, it was.
-The way she changed was cute.

1052
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,593
Kim Gyu-ri.

1053
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,845
Please proceed to the Gates of Inferno.

1054
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,313
-It's Gyu-ri's turn.
-I don't know what will happen.

1055
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,034
Gentlemen, if Kim Gyu-ri
is your final choice,

1056
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,787
please go stand in front of her.

1057
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,164
Bye.

1058
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,960
She's the only one for him.

1059
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,879
-Min-kyu's a great guy.
-He is.

1060
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,350
Hey, Gyu-ri.

1061
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,858
We've been to Paradise together twice,

1062
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,361
and I had fun talking to you there.

1063
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,865
I also had a great time
with you in Inferno.

1064
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,661
I felt my heart flutter
for the first time in a while.

1065
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,329
Thank you.

1066
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,043
-I also want to thank you.
-Okay.

1067
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,754
I hope we get along well.

1068
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:02,713
Okay.

1069
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,718
-I have a good feeling.
-Gosh, I…

1070
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,595
What? You don't think so?

1071
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,557
She wants to get along with him.

1072
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,683
Yes, she said that.

1073
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,434
-But maybe just as friends.
-What?

1074
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,811
It could mean two things.

1075
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:19,230
-As friends or as a couple.
-Right.

1076
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,192
Kim Gyu-ri,
please reveal your final decision.

1077
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:27,321
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1078
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,127
Park Min-kyu.

1079
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,379
Park Min-kyu.

1080
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,093
There we go.

1081
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,636
-It's a relief.
-I'm glad.

1082
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,139
Park Min-kyu.

1083
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:05,735
I'll buy you blueberry pie.

1084
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,862
How many slices?

1085
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:09,071
As many as you want.

1086
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,157
Until you get sick of them.

1087
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,958
He never had a change of heart.

1088
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,169
-It finally worked out for him.
-It did.

1089
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:26,631
Yu Si-eun.

1090
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,300
Please proceed to the Gates of Inferno.

1091
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,469
Good luck.

1092
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,407
Gentlemen, if Yu Si-eun
is your final choice,

1093
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,202
please go stand in front of her.

1094
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,053
Right.

1095
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,263
-He already knows what will happen.
-He does.

1096
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,817
First off, Si-eun,

1097
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:32,363
as I continued to talk to you,

1098
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:38,119
I was able to discover new sides to you
as well as all your positive traits.

1099
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:42,957
And I feel like
that's what made my heart flutter.

1100
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,503
I'm grateful for the emotions
that I felt through you.

1101
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,841
Thank you for everything in Paradise…

1102
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:53,009
I mean, in Inferno.

1103
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:59,390
I guess this was Paradise for him.

1104
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,808
This was Paradise for him.

1105
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:05,062
Our timing was continuously off,

1106
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:07,148
and things were so difficult for us.

1107
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:11,277
But I'm so glad that we were able
to talk a lot eventually.

1108
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,404
I was really happy.

1109
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,822
I won't ever forget it.

1110
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:16,907
Thank you.

1111
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:22,955
The conversations we had were really nice.

1112
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,458
I enjoyed it.

1113
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,003
And you did a great job here.

1114
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:36,093
After we first arrived
at Inferno together,

1115
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:40,306
you and I spent the most time together
and really talked a lot.

1116
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,059
I learned a lot from you.

1117
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,146
We made a lot of great memories.

1118
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,356
You were great. Thank you.

1119
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:57,823
Yu Si-eun,
please reveal your final decision.

1120
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:04,371
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1121
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,796
Choi Min-woo.

1122
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,339
Choi Min-woo.

1123
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:18,302
-Okay.
-Yes, she made her choice.

1124
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:21,722
-Goodness.
-They make a good couple.

1125
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,182
It's a shame for Won-ik.

1126
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,684
Choi Min-woo.

1127
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,189
Let's go.

1128
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,275
You did great.

1129
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,819
You too.

1130
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,495
-We're all dressed up today.
-I know, right?

1131
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,831
-How do I look?
-You look like a princess.

1132
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,124
-Do I?
-Yes.

1133
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,375
You're like a prince.

1134
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,543
-Really?
-Yes.

1135
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,129
Is the prince here for the princess?

1136
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,464
-Yes, of course.
-Where are we going now?

1137
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:59,468
Aren't they the first couple
who never went to Paradise together?

1138
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,096
-Gosh.
-You're right.

1139
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:05,808
They became a match just by talking
and hanging out in Inferno.

1140
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:08,018
-I didn't know this could happen.
-Exactly.

1141
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:20,531
I'd like to tell her that I liked her
a lot more than I'd expected.

1142
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:33,878
Are you all right?

1143
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:35,087
I feel so bad.

1144
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:10,831
Lee Gwan-hee.

1145
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:13,626
Please proceed to the Gates of Inferno.

1146
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,131
-Gosh.
-This is huge.

1147
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:22,593
The moment we've all been waiting for.

1148
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:03,384
Ladies, if Lee Gwan-hee
is your final choice,

1149
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:06,220
please go stand in front of him.

1150
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:35,207
I hope he makes the right choice.

1151
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,971
Here she comes.

1152
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,982
Oh, gosh.

1153
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:01,400
Ha-jeong.

1154
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:05,904
That automatically means
Ha-bin won't make it.

1155
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,698
He'll have to stay with Won-ik.

1156
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:19,335
-It's good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

1157
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,442
-What?
-She isn't getting up.

1158
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,361
Really?

1159
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,863
Things will change completely

1160
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:50,115
-What?
-if Hye-seon doesn't go.

1161
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,842
-There she goes.
-Yes, of course.

1162
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:11,261
I knew it.

1163
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:20,539
The best decision I made here in Inferno

1164
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,333
was that I went up to talk to you first.

1165
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,085
You really made my heart flutter.

1166
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:36,847
I don't think I'll ever forget
how I felt when we first met.

1167
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:42,060
And I have faith in the mutual feelings
we had for each other.

1168
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:54,323
I think you're the one
I've talked to the most

1169
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:57,409
and really shared my feelings with
since the beginning.

1170
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:03,874
I could tell that you're a great guy
who's sweet and warm-hearted.

1171
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:09,338
And thank you for telling me
that I'm also a nice person.

1172
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:29,483
Well… Min-ji,
I like the color of your dress.

1173
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:30,901
My gosh.

1174
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:32,819
-I know.
-You see…

1175
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:39,034
You're very close to my ideal type.

1176
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:46,250
And I felt bad that I wasn't able
to treat you better.

1177
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,168
I wanted to tell you that yesterday.

1178
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:53,048
I'm sure I sometimes made you happy
and sometimes made you sad.

1179
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:56,426
I know I put you
on an emotional roller-coaster,

1180
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,680
and I'd like to apologize for that.

1181
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:10,566
I really had feelings for you, Ha-jeong.

1182
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,402
I hope we get to grab a meal together

1183
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,072
after we leave this place.

1184
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:25,289
Hye-seon, make sure you don't trip or fall
even though I'm not around,

1185
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,083
and don't eat by yourself.

1186
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:30,544
And don't cry alone either.

1187
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:35,424
I know you'll do well without me.

1188
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,686
-I guess he's going to pick Min-ji.
-It's Min-ji.

1189
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:49,521
No, I think it'll be Hye-seon.

1190
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:54,735
Lee Gwan-hee,
please reveal your final decision.

1191
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:03,035
Who do you think he'll pick?

1192
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,786
I think…

1193
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:06,455
I have no idea.

1194
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:07,414
Either Hye-seon…

1195
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:09,416
-He keeps confusing me.
-Right.

1196
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:10,709
I think it'll be Min-ji.

1197
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:30,187
The person I'd like
to leave Inferno with is…

1198
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:35,317
Ha-jeong?

1199
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:38,362
-None of us are sure.
-Ha-jeong?

1200
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,489
Choi Hye-seon.

1201
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,158
Choi Hye-seon.

1202
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,457
-I told you!
-See?

1203
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,667
Really?

1204
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,876
See?

1205
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,170
Yes, I really sensed something.

1206
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,840
He didn't cry because he was sorry.

1207
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:41,466
-Of course not.
-Those tears?

1208
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,343
I felt it at that very moment.

1209
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:48,140
What did I tell you?

1210
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:50,892
Jin-kyung.

1211
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,228
-I knew it.
-We were right.

1212
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:56,481
You guys were too simple-minded.

1213
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,275
-Yes, exactly.
-This is crazy.

1214
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:00,861
-You have a long way to go.
-He played us until the end.

1215
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:01,778
Seriously.

1216
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,697
Gwan-hee! You can't be like this!

1217
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,366
But he really drained us until the end.

1218
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,826
-Seriously.
-He's unbelievable.

1219
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,161
He really is amazing.

1220
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,789
Choi Hye-seon.

1221
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,091
I can't believe it.

1222
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:40,817
You're holding my hand firmly today.

1223
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,736
Why wouldn't I?

1224
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,871
You're ridiculous.

1225
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,290
You did great.

1226
01:19:56,958 --> 01:20:01,338
The conversations we had
yesterday and in Paradise were

1227
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:04,966
the ones you could only have
with someone you connect with.

1228
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,260
I think that's why I couldn't get over her

1229
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:11,389
and constantly found myself
caring about her.

1230
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:16,436
If I chose Min-ji,
I knew I'd think of Hye-seon.

1231
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,938
But if I chose Hye-seon,

1232
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:21,900
I had a feeling that
I wouldn't think of Min-ji as much,

1233
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:26,154
which is why I picked Hye-seon
without any hesitation.

1234
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:36,540
I get it.

1235
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:38,959
But how could this happen?

1236
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:51,388
This is so shocking. I had no idea.

1237
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:53,181
-What?
-I really had no idea.

1238
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,433
-About what?
-That this would happen.

1239
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,935
-You didn't expect this?
-No.

1240
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:00,564
I already knew he wasn't going to pick me.

1241
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:04,693
Gosh, this is crazy.

1242
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:08,738
Hi.

1243
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:16,037
My final choice is…

1244
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,459
Yun Ha-jeong.

1245
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:22,794
YUN HA-JEONG

1246
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:29,259
She made me feel
a lot of different emotions here.

1247
01:21:29,342 --> 01:21:34,139
I should've been more of a man with her.

1248
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:37,225
I regret it a lot, and I feel bad
for not having done more.

1249
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:42,188
I learned a lot through her,
and I'd like to thank her for that.

1250
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:55,076
Every decision I made here
was made out of sincerity,

1251
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,245
and it was never on a whim.

1252
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:00,206
So nothing would change
even if I were to go back in time.

1253
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:03,835
I was able to get my feelings across,

1254
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:05,754
and that's all that matters to me.

1255
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:10,383
I was always honest with my feelings,
so I have no regrets.

1256
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,178
-All right.
-Okay.

1257
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,512
Gosh.

1258
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:22,145
Single's Inferno was hotter
and more eventful than ever,

1259
01:22:22,228 --> 01:22:24,147
and we ended with four couples.

1260
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:26,107
Congratulations to all.

1261
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,484
Congratulations.

1262
01:22:27,567 --> 01:22:32,113
We couldn't relax until the final moment.

1263
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,783
What did you all think of this season?

1264
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:37,786
As a participant in the second season,

1265
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:42,958
I tried really hard
to think of things in their shoes.

1266
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:45,794
I know there were moments
that were hard to understand,

1267
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:51,132
but as a former participant,
I could relate to them quite a bit.

1268
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:56,554
Because when you're there,
that place naturally becomes your world.

1269
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,348
You become that immersed.

1270
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:00,517
You turn into a racehorse, right?

1271
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,726
Yes, right.

1272
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,645
You're focused on one goal.

1273
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,271
-Only one goal?
-That's right.

1274
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:07,273
On the final choice.

1275
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:10,652
Once again, we thank the participants
for doing their best.

1276
01:23:10,735 --> 01:23:11,653
-Totally.
-Yes.

1277
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:14,948
-Everyone did a great job.
-I would've cried every day there.

1278
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:16,408
-Yes, every night.
-Right.

1279
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:13,840
