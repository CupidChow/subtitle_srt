YUK JUN-SEO

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,334
AN JONG-HOON

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,925
SINGLE'S INFERNO

15
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,012
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

16
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,014
Lee Si-an.

17
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,148
Lee Si-an.

18
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,109
No way.

19
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,487
-Lee Si-an.
-What?

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,905
I told you so.

21
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,451
Yeah, she got her hopes up way too high.

22
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,911
He is doubling down.

23
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,454
-Why did he ask her then?
-Really?

24
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,747
-Yeah, why did he ask?
-Right?

25
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,875
-Yeah.
-He got Min-seol's hopes up too much.

26
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,544
Jun-seo's heart had been leaning
more towards Si-an.

27
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,754
It couldn't be helped.

28
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,422
No way.

29
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,550
-My palms are sweaty.
-Off you go again.

30
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,346
Damn.

31
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,556
That gave me the chills.

32
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,025
Let's go.

33
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,736
-We're going right away?
-Yeah.

34
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,321
All right.

35
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,083
We're going to Paradise two days in a row.

36
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,417
What will we do today?

37
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,128
I bet it'll be different.

38
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,421
-It does feel like it'll be different.
-Yeah.

39
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,348
You said I was going!

40
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,351
-I thought you would.
-Exactly.

41
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,978
But they just went yesterday.

42
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,312
-Right?
-I thought I'd go too.

43
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,607
Since they went yesterday,
I figured it'd be even more likely.

44
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,442
-But I guess not.
-Seriously, what is this?

45
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,987
Now, I'm so curious to see
who Jeong-su will pick.

46
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,197
Yeah, because Si-an's already gone.

47
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,495
Next is the second-place winner,
Kim Jeong-su.

48
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,958
Please choose the person you'd like to
go on a date with in Paradise.

49
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,420
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

50
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,006
What is Jeong-su going to do now?

51
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:53,923
I know, right?

52
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,883
He looks pale.

53
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,301
Who is he going to choose?

54
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,639
I'm dying to know who he'll pick.

55
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,266
-Hae-lin?
-It'll be Hae-lin.

56
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,434
It's Hae-lin or you.

57
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,476
No, it'll be Hae-lin.

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,480
Because he's only been
on a two-on-one date with her so far.

59
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,113
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

60
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,992
Chung You-jin.

61
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,911
-Chung You-jin.
-What?

62
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,956
-What?
-What?

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,874
What?

64
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,626
You-jin?

65
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,128
Chung You-jin.

66
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,297
Chung You-jin.

67
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,214
What?

68
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,800
Hurry up and go.

69
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,093
Did you pack everything?

70
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,678
Hey, good thing you dressed up.

71
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,846
-Hurry and go!
-Right?

72
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,723
-No, wait.
-Have fun!

73
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,724
What?

74
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,309
Unbelievable.

75
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,145
I must have been a lot of fun yesterday

76
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,813
-in Jeong-su's mind.
-Right?

77
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,398
Just how fun was she?

78
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,110
He must have thought
she was really fun to have picked her.

79
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,862
It's because You-jin is cheerful.

80
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:05,203
If I go with Hae-lin or Hye-jin,

81
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:10,583
they'll realize there's no more room
left in my heart for them.

82
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,795
I'd feel sorry
if I made them feel that way.

83
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,049
So I'd rather go and have a good time
with someone fun like You-jin.

84
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,975
-Hey, there.
-Hi.

85
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,560
-Let's go.
-Let's go, Donald Duck.

86
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,854
Want me to carry that?

87
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,815
-What? Thanks.
-Give me the heavy one.

88
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,108
It's not that heavy.

89
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,818
-Then…
-It's not, right?

90
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,278
I'll carry it for you then.

91
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,279
Thanks.

92
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,656
Wow, unbelievable.

93
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,368
I bet You-jin was caught off guard.

94
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,036
She probably thought, "Why me?"

95
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,872
Wow, this is really interesting.

96
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,999
Exactly.

97
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,044
Last is the third-place winner,
Kim Te-hwan.

98
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,634
What I'm curious about
is if he chose Ji-yeon or not.

99
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,637
If not, I'll be even more curious
about who he chose.

100
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:13,313
Today, I felt like
it wasn't my time to go.

101
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,316
Since I just went yesterday,

102
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,111
I thought taking a break
instead of going twice in a row

103
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,781
would give us both some time
to reflect on our feelings.

104
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,451
But I think

105
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,871
Te-hwan will still choose Ji-yeon
despite what she said.

106
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,872
-Really?
-Yeah.

107
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,374
And to be honest,
he doesn't have other options.

108
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,459
He doesn't.

109
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,420
No one had even a bit
of chemistry with Te-hwan.

110
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,546
Honestly, there's no one.

111
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,964
-No one.
-No one at all.

112
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,342
The person I'd like to go
to Paradise with is…

113
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,677
Bae Ji-yeon.

114
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,012
-Bae Ji-yeon.
-What?

115
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,475
Right.

116
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,311
-Seriously.
-Now, this will…

117
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,812
-It'll feel better.
-It will.

118
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,147
-That'll make her happy?
-Yes.

119
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,190
-Really?
-Of course.

120
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,608
It'll make her feel good.

121
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,026
-Bae Ji-yeon.
-What?

122
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:08,910
I'm not curious about anyone
other than Ji-yeon.

123
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,747
I don't think I'd enjoy it
if I went to Paradise with anyone else.

124
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,713
-Hi.
-Hi.

125
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,631
Hi.

126
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,841
Thanks.

127
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,179
I thought about it a lot.

128
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,223
-I just…
-Yeah?

129
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,227
I was worried I came off too strong.

130
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,939
His feelings are set.

131
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,691
Now that it's turned out like this,
Ji-yeon must feel great.

132
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,611
She suggested he choose someone else,
but he chose her again.

133
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,238
-That would feel great.
-It's huge.

134
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,322
Really?

135
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:51,536
But after hearing Ji-yeon, I feel Te-hwan
might have made the wrong choice.

136
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,662
In what way?

137
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,705
At this current stage,

138
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,291
Ji-yeon seemed like she needed
to take a step back

139
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,086
to re-evaluate her feelings.

140
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,381
She communicated that to Te-hwan
without hurting his feelings.

141
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,801
But by choosing her,
Te-hwan isn't giving her space.

142
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,179
So it seems there's no time
to process things.

143
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,850
So you think it may be a bit overwhelming
from Ji-yeon's perspective?

144
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,309
-Yes.
-But to Ji-yeon,

145
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,895
not going would be good
because of the thoughtfulness.

146
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,441
And going would be good too.
I think she was okay with both.

147
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:25,653
So in the end,
Jun-seo went with Si-an again.

148
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,197
After the two go together today,

149
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,741
Si-an probably
won't feel confused anymore.

150
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,993
Right.

151
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,203
I bet their chemistry
will be through the roof.

152
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,538
Yeah.

153
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,998
I'm worried for Min-seol.

154
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,916
She's going to be muttering to herself.

155
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,545
-Gosh, she's going to be muttering a lot.
-Yes.

156
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,267
And I wore such a nice outfit today.

157
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,102
I guess I'll wear it for dinner.

158
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,437
It's such a waste.

159
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,063
-It's so cute.
-So I…

160
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,190
It's a look for Paradise.

161
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,983
I wore this thinking I'd go today.

162
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,986
I was saving this outfit for Paradise!

163
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,779
You have to change.

164
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,698
I told you she'd start grumbling.

165
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,868
Min-seol sounded like
a chick chirping when she was talking.

166
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,786
-Oh, dear.
-It's so cute.

167
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,415
I was saving this outfit for Paradise!

168
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,334
Why are you angry at me?

169
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,044
-I'm just talking to myself.
-Jun-seo!

170
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,172
So long, you jerks.

171
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,677
There are two lonely bags left outside!

172
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,847
Jeez, it's enough to make you cry.

173
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,682
Wait, what did he say?

174
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,767
What happened?

175
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,143
-Seriously.
-Come in and sit.

176
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,437
-I thought you were going.
-Me too.

177
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:46,734
Seriously, I'm going to tell you
exactly how our conversation went

178
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,195
-with absolutely no exaggerations.
-Okay.

179
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,865
We got there,
and he asked how I was doing on Inferno

180
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,951
and how it's been on Single's Inferno.

181
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,745
So I told him
I was having fun and it's been good.

182
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,914
Then, he asked if I had any concerns.

183
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,166
So I told him I didn't.

184
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,378
Then, he suddenly asks,
"Do you want to go to Paradise?"

185
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,837
I said I really wanted to go.

186
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,838
You made it clear.

187
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,007
Yeah, I said, "Of course, I do."

188
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,468
Then, I asked what he did there.

189
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,512
He said it was
just dinner and drinks. That's it.

190
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,055
He said he just went to eat.

191
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,515
"I went to eat dinner."

192
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,683
He said that?

193
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,600
Then I said,

194
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,728
"You promised to go to Paradise
with me and have whiskey."

195
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,522
"Why did you drink without me?"

196
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,025
And he said,
"I didn't have Johnnie Walker yet."

197
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,822
So I took that and thought
he meant he'd go with me to drink it.

198
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,825
But what do you make of this conversation?

199
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,246
I mean, it really meant nothing?

200
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,334
Gosh, that poor girl!

201
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,335
They can't lie.

202
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,837
When someone has a crush,

203
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,006
-they'll gather a few friends.
-Totally.

204
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,216
And they'll keep asking
to confirm their beliefs.

205
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,134
Exactly.

206
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,386
And the friends all end up exhausted.

207
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,805
-They look like the exhausted friends.
-Yeah.

208
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,810
Wasn't the conversation we had outside
pretty positive?

209
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,895
Right now, I'm not even…

210
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,148
I had a really good time talking.

211
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,070
Whatever. Let them do what they want.

212
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,449
I'm sorry, but I'm not here
to be played around with.

213
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,702
Why would I?

214
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,412
-You're already…
-After…

215
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,873
-Seriously…
-After you already had fun playing around?

216
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,124
She says this now.

217
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,251
-If he comes…
-But when he comes and asks to talk…

218
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,711
-"Hey, Min-seol."
-"Hold on."

219
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,962
"Seriously."

220
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,297
-"Wait."
-She puts on lipstick.

221
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,923
-It's so cute.
-It's almost like…

222
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,008
Because it's so obvious.

223
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,177
-Whatever she does…
-No, it's not!

224
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,136
No, it's obvious.

225
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,387
-Really?
-Yeah.

226
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,931
You sat up right away when he walked in.

227
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,392
Well, I had to sit up. I was lying down!

228
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,311
The corner of your mouth
was twitching up too.

229
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,395
"Come in."

230
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,648
I honestly thought I'd be going!

231
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,777
In any case, Min-seol seems pretty mad.

232
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,447
She's probably
still telling her friends about it.

233
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,616
Like, "Isn't it weird?"

234
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,493
"I'm telling you he likes Johnnie Walker"!

235
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,203
And even into the new year.

236
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,814
That's how they sat?

237
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,358
What is this?

238
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,158
What?

239
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,870
Can't you hear me?

240
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,289
Can't you hear me?

241
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,792
Are you crazy?

242
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,683
-He keeps paying attention to her.
-Yeah.

243
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,144
It seems like she doesn't care,
but she's conscious of him.

244
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,603
-I think so too.
-Yes.

245
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,606
-You can see from the corner of your eye.
-Exactly.

246
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,609
Exactly, I can see Jin-kyung right now.

247
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:21,866
We're here.

248
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,993
We are here.

249
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,302
-What?
-No.

250
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,345
Jun-seo is too relaxed right now.

251
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,852
-What?
-Have fun.

252
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,479
Okay.

253
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,236
-Jun-seo's so cute.
-His headphones are on.

254
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,030
He can't hear anything.

255
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,490
Let's go.

256
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,741
Vroom, vroom.

257
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,452
-Vroom, vroom. Let's go.
-Vroom, vroom.

258
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,746
-Are you opening the door for me?
-Let's go.

259
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,122
Yes, hop in.

260
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,665
Thank you.

261
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,543
-Please close the door yourself.
-Okay, I'll close it.

262
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,795
-I'm kidding.
-Okay, thank you.

263
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,718
Let's go!

264
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,137
Let's go eat a bunch of food.

265
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,309
Please!

266
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,603
-"Let's relax!"
-"Let's go eat a bunch of food"!

267
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,687
"Time to start relaxing!"

268
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,814
We need to learn how to do that.

269
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,650
We need to know how do that, Jin-kyung.

270
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,568
-Come on.
-"Vroom, vroom."

271
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,288
-Wow, finally.
-The food's here.

272
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,207
-I'm so happy.
-Me too.

273
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,917
Thank you for the food.

274
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,629
Let's just focus on eating for a bit.

275
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,713
I'd love that.

276
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,224
By the way, since you won your way here,

277
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,976
this must taste so sweet for you.

278
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,728
-Me?
-Yeah, you won this Paradise date.

279
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,398
I really wanted to come here today.

280
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,482
I see.

281
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,610
Yesterday,

282
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,446
my mind was all over the place.

283
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,364
Yeah.

284
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,076
You have to decide
within a day every time…

285
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,994
Right.

286
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,746
Whether you have feelings
for someone or not.

287
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,707
-It's really tough.
-That's true.

288
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,252
The person at the top of my list

289
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,296
is Si-an.

290
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,213
Right.

291
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,174
So today,

292
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,679
if I'd come in first,
I would've picked Si-an.

293
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,349
-I wanted to have a long chat with her.
-Right.

294
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,520
But we haven't had the time to do that.

295
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,438
Yeah.

296
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,278
But you were the one

297
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,822
who helped me the most
in clearing my head.

298
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,617
I kept on talking and talking.

299
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,743
But seriously…

300
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,495
I thought, "What this person says
feels so harmless."

301
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,955
-Yeah.
-That's what I thought.

302
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,124
Really?

303
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:21,795
So my idea was to have fun
with this harmless person

304
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,256
-and clear my head.
-Right.

305
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,551
That's the reason why
I decided to choose you.

306
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,262
-I feel like I made a good choice.
-Right.

307
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,514
I think I made the right choice.

308
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,515
Yeah.

309
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,685
I think…

310
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,398
The closer we get to the end,
the more my head hurts.

311
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:46,445
Yeah, it's a struggle
with your emotions so…

312
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,573
I can bear physical exhaustion.

313
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,160
But the mental strain you face here
is really tough.

314
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:56,997
That's right.

315
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,626
Well, in any case,

316
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,545
after hearing Jeong-su talk about Si-an,

317
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,673
it's clear he has no one else
on his mind but her.

318
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,715
-You're right.
-Yes.

319
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,175
He's not even thinking of Hae-lin.

320
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,385
-No one else matters.
-Right.

321
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,762
And your feelings tend to grow
as you talk about them.

322
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,723
The more he confesses,
the clearer it becomes.

323
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,058
"It was Si-an all along."

324
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,810
-"I'm sure of this."
-It's like that.

325
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,062
Not being able to meet often

326
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,649
made his feelings for Si-an
grow even stronger.

327
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,900
-I think that caused it.
-Yes.

328
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,653
I have another question.

329
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,739
What is it about Si-an

330
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,742
that's so captivating?

331
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,079
I'm going to be very honest here.

332
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,832
So…

333
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,919
We went to Paradise
for the first time together,

334
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:49,842
and we kept talking about love.

335
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,760
As we talked about things like that,

336
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,555
I could feel my heart race.

337
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,559
I hadn't dated for quite some time.

338
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,812
I didn't think I had
a romantic bone left in me.

339
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,233
I kept thinking it was over for me.

340
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,485
But when my heart started racing,

341
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,988
I was surprised at myself.

342
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,201
I realized I still do have
a romantic bone in me after all.

343
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,664
But just from a guy's perspective,

344
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,335
Si-an just has a lot of qualities
that most men would find attractive.

345
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,420
I see.

346
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,172
Like what?

347
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,550
She has a slightly cat-like face.

348
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,512
And when she smiles, it just disarms you.

349
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,557
-She looks so kind when she smiles.
-Yeah.

350
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,976
-When she smiles, she's so sweet.
-That's true.

351
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,520
-But she's scary when she's not smiling.
-Yeah.

352
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,149
Guys are often attracted
to that kind of look.

353
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,817
I see.

354
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,778
When you talk with her,

355
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,197
she goes along with everything at first.

356
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,656
-I see.
-But…

357
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,701
But the more you talk,
her stubbornness comes out.

358
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,203
I see.

359
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,080
That's how it is.

360
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,832
So…

361
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,796
I wanted to talk to her more, but…

362
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,381
It was a bit of a shame.

363
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,051
But I'm actually glad.

364
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,720
Why? Because you had time
to sort out your thoughts?

365
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,389
No, hanging out with you is so much fun.

366
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,017
I'm having a great time.

367
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,561
-Your harmlessness…
-Harmlessness.

368
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,979
It's like an Oompa Loompa.

369
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:30,025
I want to shrink you down
and carry you on my shoulder.

370
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:30,943
This big?

371
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:35,030
-Then, you'd chat away.
-Chat? Right.

372
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,242
-You'd say harmless things in my ear.
-Right. Just chatting.

373
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,244
I'd be like, "Quiet down!"

374
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,411
That's hilarious.

375
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,580
Jeong-su does look relaxed.

376
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,581
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

377
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,376
Why do I find this side of him
more attractive?

378
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,377
-Exactly.
-I agree.

379
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,130
Before, when he was
around Si-an or anyone else,

380
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,673
I'd think, "What's with him?"

381
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,091
-Yes.
-But now…

382
00:18:54,174 --> 00:19:00,013
Seeing him with You-jin
makes him seem really charming.

383
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,890
-That's how I felt.
-Yeah.

384
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,642
Looking back on things now,

385
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,728
at first, Jeong-su seemed very smooth.

386
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,105
But I guess he was very nervous.

387
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,022
-Right.
-Right.

388
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,525
That's why it seems
he was trying really hard

389
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,861
-and trying to focus.
-I think so too.

390
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,073
PARADISE
YUK JUN-SEO & LEE SI-AN

391
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,242
Wow, it looks so unique.

392
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,621
Thank you.

393
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,503
Is my hair better down?
Should I put it down?

394
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,006
I think you look better
with your hair down.

395
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,676
It totally changes your look.

396
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,012
Let's go.

397
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,019
How does it feel to be back
after only ten hours?

398
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,770
It took ten hours?

399
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,688
Yeah.

400
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,024
It feels like it took less time.

401
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,692
Exactly.

402
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,116
I'm so exhausted today though.

403
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,618
You used up all your energy.

404
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,620
How many matches did you have?

405
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,121
I only had three.

406
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,581
-Right, three rounds.
-Yeah.

407
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,213
The traffic lights here are so long.
The roads are so crowded too.

408
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,225
Do you think you resemble
a cat or a dog more?

409
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,686
What do you think?

410
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,604
A cat?

411
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,605
That's right.

412
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,065
Yes, I got it right.

413
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,149
You're…

414
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,985
You're kind of like a beast.

415
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,613
Why do you keep calling me a beast?

416
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,531
A beast.

417
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,334
This is insane.

418
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,255
My gosh.

419
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,465
Oh, my goodness.

420
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,716
Today is…

421
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,968
It's the best.

422
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,386
Thank you.

423
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,470
Eat up.

424
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,847
"Eat up."

425
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,351
This is for the winner.

426
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,396
-Eat up.
-Okay.

427
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,731
A little bit of wasabi.

428
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,150
Do you like wasabi?

429
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,944
It's not bad.

430
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,362
It goes well with beef.

431
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,289
-Jun-seo.
-Yeah?

432
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,667
-Try this.
-Is it radish?

433
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,461
Not the whole thing…

434
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,674
They're pretty close now.

435
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,509
When you watch the two of them,

436
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,803
their small touches and actions

437
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,014
aren't what people who like each other do.

438
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,391
It's what you see couples do.

439
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,475
-You're right.
-Yeah.

440
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,811
-The night before played a huge part.
-Right?

441
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,731
Even in the car earlier,
little touches like this are…

442
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,898
I'm sorry.

443
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,403
No, I…

444
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,488
Jin-kyung…

445
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,115
Jin-kyung rested her chin on her hand.

446
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,700
She was so caught off guard.

447
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,577
For a moment…

448
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,289
-These…
-These little touches…

449
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,373
Yes, that's right.

450
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,210
It's things like patting her back
in the restaurant or feeding each other.

451
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:21,006
-That's what couples do.
-Exactly. It looks so natural.

452
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,925
-It's like they've been dating for a year.
-Exactly.

453
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,678
The reward for first place sure is sweet.

454
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:29,931
Didn't I tell you?

455
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,434
I told you I'd win.

456
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,561
YESTERDAY EVENING

457
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,481
Don't think or worry about it too much.

458
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,524
You and I will come here one more time.

459
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,652
Tomorrow, I'm definitely going to win.

460
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,614
I said I'd win
and we'd come back, didn't I?

461
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,199
You didn't have any worries?

462
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,450
-I did.
-What?

463
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,828
-I'm kidding.
-Get out.

464
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,832
-If I win the women's game…
-Yeah?

465
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,417
I'll think about it.

466
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,134
Hey, how many times
have you been to Paradise now?

467
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,636
-What?
-How many times is this now?

468
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,055
Is it the fifth time?

469
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,556
I'm not sure.

470
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,518
You don't know how lucky you are.

471
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,853
Wait, when did I ever say…

472
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,563
You're so lucky.

473
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,954
Wow, this is delicious.

474
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,541
I really enjoyed this meal.

475
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,395
-Are you cold?
-Yeah.

476
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,481
Can't you ever bring a jacket with you?

477
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,152
I didn't bring enough jackets.

478
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:08,989
What a pretty bottle.

479
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,045
If you're done eating, let's go.

480
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,381
If you're done eating, let's go.

481
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,899
-She's speechless.
-Yeah, just now.

482
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,567
-It shows on her face.
-Yeah.

483
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,110
Jun-seo's a bit too relaxed.

484
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,404
That is how he's like though.

485
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,072
-Yes.
-That's right.

486
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,407
-You can't do that.
-Exactly.

487
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,284
-That's risky.
-The vibes feel off.

488
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,411
-Yes.
-It's like he's not paying attention.

489
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,662
Why is he being like that?

490
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,751
This is great.

491
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,883
-Let's say you didn't win.
-Okay.

492
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,301
-You came in second.
-Okay.

493
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,053
And I was already taken by the winner.

494
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:13,970
Okay.

495
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,680
Then, who would you have chosen?

496
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,352
If I did come in second,
I really think you would've been gone.

497
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,519
-It's the truth.
-Right.

498
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:25,440
So first, I just want to say
I'm glad I came in first.

499
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,818
But if you were gone
because I came in second,

500
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,865
then I probably would've chosen
the second girl I went to Paradise with.

501
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,076
-Min-seol?
-Min-seol.

502
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,459
Why? Can I ask why?

503
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,627
-Min-seol?
-Yeah.

504
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,421
It's been weighing on my mind.

505
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,176
-Really?
-Yeah.

506
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,805
Did you see her clench her teeth?

507
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,432
-It's when she said, "Really?"
-I saw.

508
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,101
The mood's getting awkward.

509
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,187
But Si-an has a lot
of people on her mind too.

510
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,648
-True.
-But saying it out loud is different.

511
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,191
-Really?
-It's to the other person.

512
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,070
-Really?
-Yeah.

513
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,406
-I really didn't know.
-Yeah.

514
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,532
I bet no one knows.

515
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:24,374
When I went to Paradise with her,

516
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,834
we talked a lot.

517
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,129
But most of it was about trivial stuff.

518
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,046
I see.

519
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,757
-So it was hilarious.
-Right.

520
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,759
-She's just funny.
-Yeah.

521
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,094
Her jokes always land.

522
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,722
But…

523
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,807
after I came back the next day,

524
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,602
I'd keep seeing her around.

525
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,440
And she seemed like she was down,
unlike when she was with me.

526
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,941
She denied it.

527
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,737
But I felt she wasn't acting like herself.

528
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,449
I cheered her on and said,
"You'll be really popular on Inferno."

529
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,076
But she didn't have that happen.

530
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,287
And time went on, so…

531
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,204
Yeah.

532
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:09,419
I kept looking her way out of guilt.

533
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,006
I see.

534
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,258
I didn't know.

535
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,515
I had a lot on my mind.

536
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,603
I guess I'd been thinking
about Min-seol more than I realized.

537
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:31,191
So I was honest with Si-an
and told her Min-seol was on my mind.

538
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:37,280
That's why I was unable to focus
entirely on Si-an during our date.

539
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,116
But…

540
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,412
Are you going to leave it
at just thinking about her?

541
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,790
-I don't know.
-Or do you plan to talk with her more?

542
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,375
Or anything like that?

543
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,876
I don't know.

544
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,879
I see.

545
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,340
-Why?
-What?

546
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,217
-Why are you asking?
-No reason.

547
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,762
Why are you asking about that?

548
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,680
-No reason.
-Okay.

549
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,142
Hey, why are you being so curt…

550
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,852
I have something to say too.

551
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,314
Honestly, you're being
really cold to me right now.

552
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,816
-Me? Why?
-Yeah.

553
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,901
Could you be a little bit nicer?

554
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,111
-Really?
-Yeah.

555
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,404
Was I being cold?

556
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,044
Can't you treat me a bit more kindly?

557
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,129
Why? How?

558
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,840
Aren't you getting
too comfortable too fast?

559
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,007
-Me?
-Yeah.

560
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:39,801
I'm not comfortable.

561
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,429
It's just…

562
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,597
Forget it.

563
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,266
I'm really not comfortable.

564
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,727
-Do I look that way?
-Yeah.

565
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,978
It's a bit…

566
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:51,980
Really?

567
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,696
Am I not being kind?

568
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,285
I'll just chalk it up
to you being tired today.

569
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,453
This is how I usually am.

570
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,330
-It has nothing to do with being tired.
-Really?

571
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,791
-That's how you usually are?
-Yeah.

572
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,792
Okay, then.

573
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,307
Am I doing something wrong here?

574
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,941
I suddenly had a lot on my mind.

575
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,611
I don't know how Jun-seo feels.

576
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:45,116
On our first date, he said a lot of things
that assured me of his feelings,

577
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,203
and I had my hopes up
for our Paradise date the next day.

578
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,038
But all we did was eat.

579
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:54,292
And then, he was like,
"If you're done eating, let's go."

580
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,714
He seemed so different
from our first time in Paradise,

581
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,216
so it threw me off a bit.

582
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,178
-Are they playing mind games?
-Yeah.

583
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,304
-For what though?
-Yeah.

584
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,639
-It feels like it, right?
-Yeah.

585
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,556
What's with them?

586
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,557
It kind of feels like

587
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,018
things were so intense at first
and maybe they've waned.

588
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,187
Si-an might think that way.

589
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,356
To be honest,
they got so close at the start.

590
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,357
And it surprised us.

591
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,151
-Jun-seo has a lot on his mind today too.
-Right.

592
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,862
And right now,
Si-an has no choice but to have

593
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,155
-a lot of options.
-Right.

594
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:29,869
So without realizing, she keeps
evaluating and weighing her options.

595
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,413
-Right.
-Because so many people like her.

596
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,706
-So many.
-Yeah.

597
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,000
If I were Jun-seo,
I'd be a little annoyed.

598
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,335
I'd slowly get more annoyed.

599
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,503
He's annoyed right now.

600
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,629
It feels like he is.

601
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,798
-Right, I'd be annoyed.
-He's a bit annoyed.

602
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,966
Like, "What's with her?"

603
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,719
-He didn't do anything wrong.
-He doesn't want to put up with it all.

604
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,596
-"I have my own feelings too."
-That's right.

605
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,889
"I have to only cater to her?"

606
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,768
When Si-an asked him to treat her kindly,

607
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,353
he could've conceded and said,

608
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,356
"I'm really sorry.
That wasn't my intention."

609
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,275
And he should've drawn her back in.

610
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,609
But instead, he said, "Really?"

611
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,820
If you do that, it fixes nothing.

612
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,989
Or is he really just exhausted?

613
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:10,326
He did say he drank a lot yesterday
and was hungover.

614
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,329
But I do think
it's because he had a lot on his mind.

615
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,956
He said, "This is how I usually am."

616
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,332
"I haven't done anything…"

617
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,501
-He did nothing wrong.
-"It's not because I'm tired."

618
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,379
"This is just who I am.
This is Yuk Jun-seo."

619
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,464
-Yeah.
-It's a delicate situation.

620
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,508
The vibe feels weird.
It isn't what we expected.

621
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,719
Yeah, it's a bit unnerving.

622
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,180
Should we go?

623
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,517
Are you cold?

624
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,185
Yeah.

625
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,438
-It's okay.
-Should I look for a blanket?

626
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,355
No, it's fine.

627
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,025
Would putting these on you help?

628
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,443
-Yeah, give it a try.
-Like this?

629
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,653
Let's cover you up.

630
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,448
-Did you wear cologne?
-No.

631
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,241
Then, what's that smell?

632
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,284
I never wear any.

633
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,661
You have a distinct scent.

634
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,747
What kind of scent?

635
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,333
I'm not sure. Maybe your natural scent?

636
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,127
I can tell when you pass by.

637
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,630
-Really?
-Yeah, you have a unique scent.

638
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,427
Doesn't it feel warmer here?

639
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,637
Yeah.

640
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,971
I'm warm now.

641
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,603
I'll spread them out as much as I can.

642
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,562
Okay.

643
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,537
-She's satisfied now.
-Right.

644
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,706
-Is this what you wanted?
-That kind of stuff?

645
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,125
She feels better now. Jeez.

646
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,210
Goodness gracious.

647
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,544
-He's being sweet now.
-Yeah.

648
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,845
How did this happen all of a sudden?

649
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,013
-What?
-With you.

650
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,974
-With me?
-Yeah.

651
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,727
-I think the timing was just right.
-Yeah.

652
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,689
-Yesterday and today.
-Yeah.

653
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,651
When you first arrived
at the hotel yesterday…

654
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,444
-Yeah?
-You were so mellow.

655
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,696
-Me?
-Yeah, your vibe.

656
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:10,613
Okay.

657
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,823
Why was that?

658
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,616
-I seemed mellow?
-Were you sleepy?

659
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,493
How was I mellow?

660
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,788
You know, with drowsy eyes,

661
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,250
you were grinning.

662
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,836
-And you were picking the rose petals.
-Okay.

663
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,004
That's what you did.

664
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,111
-What? What about it?
-What?

665
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,697
What about it? Did it make you swoon?

666
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,324
Yeah, I liked seeing that side of you.

667
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,328
Yeah, it was nice
to see you just sitting there,

668
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,207
doing nothing and being relaxed.

669
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:12,800
I came today hoping we'd have
a lot of good conversations again.

670
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,560
-Are they holding hands?
-Are they?

671
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,285
Why aren't you holding it right?

672
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,079
-What?
-Why aren't you holding it right?

673
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,498
You held it just fine yesterday.

674
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,415
I did?

675
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,422
I like people who are expressive.

676
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,925
-You like people who are expressive?
-Yeah.

677
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,136
Where do you go to learn how to do that?

678
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,431
No, just…

679
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,937
-What do you mean by "expressive"?
-What?

680
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,105
Like saying "I love you"?

681
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,816
-It's just an example.
-You love me?

682
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,611
I've used that phrase
only a handful of times in my life.

683
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,862
Oh, my gosh.

684
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,033
Without having to say it out loud…

685
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,910
-No.
-Can't you show it through actions?

686
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,830
Doing both would be nice.

687
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,747
Is that so?

688
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,252
Really?

689
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,504
You haven't said "I love you" often?

690
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,588
That's right.

691
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,391
Wait, looking at this now,

692
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,893
it seems the previous situation
was just a lovers' quarrels.

693
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,811
-Right.
-Really?

694
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,354
We didn't need to read into it.

695
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,273
-It was a lovers' spat.
-Were we too serious?

696
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,441
-She just wanted him to be nice.
-Yeah, exactly.

697
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,568
That's what she meant.

698
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,695
-It was to motivate him.
-"Give me more attention."

699
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,612
That's right.

700
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,948
-They really like each other.
-Yeah.

701
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,867
It was a small push to motivate him.

702
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,868
Jeez.

703
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,253
It's set up nicely here.

704
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,047
Darts.

705
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,091
How does this work?

706
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,346
We have to record ourselves too?

707
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,140
We both have to do it?

708
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,057
Yeah.

709
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,773
So this is the kind of place
we've come to.

710
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,692
Incredible.

711
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,068
This is great.

712
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,778
They're going to meet?

713
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,779
-What?
-Here?

714
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,575
-What?
-What?

715
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,911
-What?
-What?

716
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,537
What's going on?

717
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,206
This is insane.

718
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,874
It's so good to see you.

719
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,250
-My love, Jeong-su.
-This is so…

720
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,252
-My love, You-jin.
-Where have you been?

721
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,422
Can we finally drink now?

722
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,549
I thought I was going to
die from awkwardness.

723
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,051
Why? What was awkward?

724
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,510
Is this your Coke? Can I drink it?

725
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,429
It just came. Go ahead.
Drink what you want.

726
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,431
They set them up to meet like this?

727
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,475
Then…

728
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,561
This feels a bit risky.

729
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,979
This is an interesting scene.

730
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,522
Yeah, it's not a normal double date.

731
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,565
Yes, exactly.

732
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,234
There was a lack of warmth.

733
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,985
-But with Jeong-su here…
-It's here now.

734
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,654
If he does something sweet…

735
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,905
-Seriously.
-She'll waver.

736
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,031
-Again?
-Yeah.

737
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,407
It's an unexpected variable.

738
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,576
It's perfect timing to be swayed.

739
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,119
It's so good to see you.

740
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,788
Yeah, seeing you on the outside is so…

741
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,705
Yeah.

742
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,207
We went…

743
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,292
-on day one…
-We all went to Paradise on day one.

744
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,127
-Just the ones who went on day one.
-Really?

745
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,213
Something's a little different.

746
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,548
Then, should we switch seats?

747
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,842
-Sitting diagonally, like this.
-This arrangement is…

748
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,344
Diagonally.

749
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,262
And start.

750
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,806
Are we supposed to watch out
for each other's reactions?

751
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,061
On both occasions,
you two came in first and second.

752
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,021
-How do you feel about that?
-"I lost again."

753
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,439
"I lost again"?

754
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,941
-Yeah, he kept…
-That's how I feel.

755
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,694
He kept saying
he's the eternal runner-up.

756
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,071
I guess Jeong-su can't beat me.

757
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,240
I wanted to beat Jun-seo just once.

758
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:07,952
I'm so mad.

759
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:12,415
By the way, I didn't expect you
to pick You-jin at all.

760
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,457
-You-jin?
-Yeah.

761
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,460
-Did you have her in mind?
-She's my Oompa Loompa.

762
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:17,962
How did that happen?

763
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,172
He says he wants to
keep me in a glass jar.

764
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,257
Why?

765
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,925
What? Was he flirting?

766
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,386
I guess I was pretty funny
on Inferno yesterday.

767
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,470
Really?

768
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,472
I guess I was entertaining.

769
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,599
You're an incredible person.

770
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,101
Thanks.

771
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,353
I'll take that as a compliment.

772
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,023
You're charming.

773
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,065
Right.

774
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,400
You always make me laugh.

775
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,403
Cheers.

776
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,113
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

777
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,540
-It tastes better than I expected.
-It's so refreshing.

778
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,003
Do you want to try it?

779
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,087
Is it sweet?

780
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,881
Then, I'll try it.

781
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,883
Right, you like sweet things.

782
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,718
I'll try it if it's sweet.

783
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,345
I don't usually like sweet things.

784
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,348
She stole my drink.
I'll just have some Coke then.

785
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,936
-You like it? Should I order you one?
-Not really.

786
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,480
-I see.
-It's not your type?

787
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,357
-She doesn't like it.
-She doesn't?

788
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,566
He's being too nice.

789
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,236
Yeah, she told him to look at how kind
Jeong-su is. Like, "Watch and learn."

790
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,154
You like it?

791
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,864
-Should I order you one?
-Not really.

792
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,824
-I see.
-It's not your type?

793
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,036
How is it? Going to Paradise
two days straight was a first.

794
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,622
-He's just eating.
-Stop, Jun-seo!

795
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,083
-He's been eating all day.
-He ate earlier too.

796
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,918
Stop eating.

797
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,214
How is it? Going to Paradise
two days straight was a first.

798
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,216
Going to Paradise two days straight

799
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,592
-was a first.
-How is it?

800
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,970
Are you still able to talk?
Does it feel comfortable?

801
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,806
"Are you able to talk?"

802
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,684
Then, he says,
"I don't think it's working out."

803
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,645
We're talking a lot.

804
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,687
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

805
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,730
I think it's fun.

806
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,905
It definitely feels more comfortable
than the first time around.

807
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,666
Are you good at pool, Jeong-su?

808
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,875
Want to give it a try?

809
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,835
Let's play in teams.

810
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,212
I've only played three times in my life.

811
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,130
Really?

812
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,008
Great job.

813
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,510
-That wasn't bad.
-You did well.

814
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,719
-Right.
-Try it.

815
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,762
Hit the white ball?

816
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,764
Yeah, hit this one with the white ball.

817
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,474
-I'll try. Like this?
-Hold it like…

818
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,559
-Like this?
-You do know.

819
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,602
-She knows how to hold the cue!
-What?

820
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,979
You sure it was three times?

821
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,147
-That's what I said.
-But…

822
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,773
She got into the stance right away.

823
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,483
You said you've only played three times.

824
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,194
I told you not to trust her.

825
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,573
Aim slightly to the left of the center.

826
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,910
Gosh, this is getting tricky again.

827
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:55,953
-Right?
-Yeah.

828
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,121
This is making it so tough.

829
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,040
This would be tough, right?
Then, I won't be able to hit anything.

830
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,167
Then, spread these out.

831
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,376
Okay, sounds good.

832
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,128
This feels stiff.

833
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,255
I think you can do this too.

834
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,298
-Like this?
-Yeah.

835
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,549
So this works too.

836
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,427
-Use the bottom one to set the direction.
-Okay.

837
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,678
-Direction?
-Place it here.

838
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,263
-Aim it like this.
-Aim it?

839
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,140
-Yeah, just give it a poke.
-Okay.

840
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,352
-Yeah, that's how you help someone.
-He's so kind.

841
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,146
-He's so kind.
-Exactly.

842
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,482
-Just a poke. Yeah, I did hit it.
-Good job.

843
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,694
You think you could hit
the cue ball to hit that one in?

844
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,155
-Good job.
-I think you could.

845
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,782
-Hey.
-Look at that strength!

846
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,243
You still need to try hard
even if you think you'll fail.

847
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,123
He's like a coach!

848
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,541
He just sounded like one.

849
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,002
-The head coach.
-My goodness.

850
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,378
They're in trouble.

851
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,507
What should I do? Look.
Should I hit the yellow stripe ball?

852
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,467
-Not bad, right?
-Not bad.

853
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,719
-Then, I'll have to go over there.
-But…

854
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,059
Wow, that was great.

855
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:06,065
I'm pretty good at physical activities.

856
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,317
-As expected.
-I have a delicate touch.

857
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,235
Really?

858
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,486
No?

859
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,323
A dance major's delicate touch. No?

860
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,867
Could you keep it down a bit?

861
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,203
We're trying to focus here.

862
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,877
Do whatever you want.

863
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:30,923
She's something else.

864
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,801
-I must have good control of this touch.
-There are three left.

865
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,885
That was incredible.

866
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,346
Just hit it hard?

867
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,306
Just think about sending it that way.

868
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,522
Is Jun-seo in some kind
of competition right now?

869
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,107
Jeez.

870
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,358
His competitiveness is…

871
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,151
How can they be so different?

872
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,862
What's the score right now?

873
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,239
I suddenly feel competitive.

874
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,658
We're totally winning.

875
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,993
We're definitely winning.

876
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,411
-Totally, because… Yeah.
-Really?

877
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,038
I have to at least beat Jun-seo at this.

878
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,709
All right, let's do our best.
Let's go for the win.

879
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,961
I guess I used up
all my luck earlier today.

880
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,504
Okay.

881
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,965
There's not much to hit though.

882
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,758
Just the stripes…

883
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,511
Playing as a team
makes me want to win even more.

884
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,638
-For sure.
-Do your best.

885
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,140
Let's go. Let's give it our best.

886
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,019
Losers have to write
their names with their bottoms.

887
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,272
But it's a bit crooked… Hey.

888
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,065
He's saying "Hey" again.

889
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,692
That's a bit…

890
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,778
He has to stop calling her "Hey."
But he keeps saying it.

891
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,447
That does seem a bit wrong.

892
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,073
Why does he keep doing that?

893
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,200
-It's so annoying.
-Da-hee's upset again.

894
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,202
She's very annoyed right now.

895
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,787
-She's hung up on that again.
-Yeah.

896
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,831
I think it's just his way of speaking.

897
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,209
Hey, can't you discuss with me
what you'll do first?

898
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,753
Come on, it's our chance.

899
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,796
This one's tough too.

900
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,256
You can do it. You're good.

901
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,674
-It's not that.
-Don't be nervous.

902
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,134
-It's hard to reach over.
-It is?

903
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,261
-Get the cue bridge. Where is it?
-The cue bridge?

904
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,056
-I don't want to use it for my last shot.
-She used it too.

905
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:02,973
It's okay.

906
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,516
You want to write your name
with your rear?

907
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,434
Okay, sorry.

908
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,979
You said you didn't want to…

909
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,231
Hey, think it through before you act.

910
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,359
-Don't do it half-heartedly.
-Stop calling me "Hey."

911
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,152
-Okay, Si-an.
-Call me by my name.

912
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,112
I wish you'd move this way a little.

913
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,783
Okay. They're in conflict.

914
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,867
Fight, fight.

915
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,035
Let's take advantage of it.

916
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,536
Nice.

917
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,545
Jeez, they're hustlers.

918
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,546
Good game.

919
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,506
That was fun.

920
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,092
-Where should they write their names?
-It was fun, Jeong-su.

921
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,927
-It was.
-All right.

922
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,053
You're so good.

923
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,304
Yeah, I'm not bad.

924
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,352
Gosh, we keep seeing it.

925
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,730
Especially in that setting,
Si-an hates how he's treating her.

926
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,607
It's the worst.

927
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,150
How does it feel to come in second?

928
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,946
It's okay.
The real games are what counts.

929
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,197
Of course.

930
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,074
This is actually so fun and different.

931
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,826
-The four of us…
-I'd been sleepy too.

932
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,536
It totally woke me up.

933
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:06,787
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

934
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,331
-Because it made your blood boil?
-Right.

935
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,457
Gosh, my blood pressure.

936
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,210
That was fun though.

937
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,420
-Yeah.
-We were similar.

938
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,255
-Right, we all were.
-Seriously.

939
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,840
-Aren't they really good?
-They are.

940
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,925
-Who is she?
-Why is she so good?

941
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,928
I have a delicate touch.
I have good control.

942
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,596
As expected, my Oompa Loompa.

943
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,934
Wow, You-jin is unbelievable.

944
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,438
You are incredible.

945
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,149
Thanks.

946
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,653
This is delicious.

947
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,990
You seem a little unhappy though.

948
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:43,907
No.

949
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,326
Coming in second stings.

950
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,244
Come on.

951
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,454
Goodness.

952
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,834
For the last time, cheers.

953
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,835
Our last cheers.

954
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,463
-Bye.
-Cheers.

955
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,256
-Have fun, you two.
-Have fun.

956
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,424
Why is it a goodbye?

957
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:10,726
To be honest, I was already feeling
a bit hurt by Jun-seo at that point.

958
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,644
Maybe because of that…

959
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:18,233
I started to notice
Jeong-su's kind gestures even more.

960
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:23,739
So I kept thinking a lot
about my first Paradise date

961
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,449
that I had with Jeong-su.

962
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:28,118
That's what made me
start to have a lot of concerns.

963
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,415
-Did you have fun?
-Yeah.

964
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,416
That's good.

965
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,335
-Did you have fun?
-Yeah.

966
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,753
It was fun.

967
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,049
Paradise really seems

968
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,676
like an important place.

969
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,594
Paradise?

970
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,054
Yeah, very important.

971
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,889
-Right?
-It's so important.

972
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,475
It's really crucial.

973
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,075
-That was full of meaning.
-She kept talking about it.

974
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,912
What do you think she meant by,
"Paradise is a really important place"?

975
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,664
It's a message for Jun-seo.

976
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,749
Yeah, she's saying

977
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,961
she found out more
about her feelings and about him.

978
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,921
-It's probably something like that.
-Yes.

979
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,298
Since it's such an important place,

980
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:27,970
it seems like a warning message
telling him to behave better as well.

981
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,013
-To that extent?
-"It's not too late to wake up."

982
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,265
"Before it's too late."

983
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,934
But I don't think he noticed
any of those warnings.

984
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,561
Right, that seems to be the problem.

985
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,356
When you're with someone you like,
you should at least try to change.

986
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,566
She told him multiple times.

987
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,192
-True.
-But that's just…

988
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,444
-It must be a habit.
-Is he looking down on her?

989
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,029
-It's not that.
-I meant…

990
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,282
-It's his habit.
-But his tone…

991
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,242
He's lived like this for like 30 years.

992
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,994
-He became competitive too.
-Wait, not 30.

993
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,370
He's been this way for 20 years.

994
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,415
Then, it means they aren't compatible.
They should break up here.

995
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,793
You're being so straightforward.

996
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,336
-What? It's because…
-Everyone's…

997
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,672
-It's obvious how their future will be.
-Right.

998
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,215
-I don't think they match.
-Right.

999
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,759
-This is the end.
-"I'll do whatever I can to fix my habit."

1000
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:10,512
You can't fix that way of speaking.

1001
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,015
-Why are you empathizing with Jun-seo?
-Are you him?

1002
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,016
It hurts my heart.

1003
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,060
"It's been a habit for 28 years.
I can't help it."

1004
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,104
"I don't want to either!"

1005
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:22,524
-How much time does he need?
-Just a little. At least three months.

1006
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,777
If Jun-seo did ask for time to change,
that would've been better.

1007
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,279
But he's not doing that.

1008
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,657
-He's like, "Really? But that's who I am."
-He doesn't back down. Right.

1009
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,368
-And they were on a double date.
-Right.

1010
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,996
-Exactly.
-Being called "Hey" wouldn't feel good.

1011
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,040
And the other couple
is so sweet to each other.

1012
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,625
Right. It was such a contrast.

1013
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,710
-This is why you don't do double dates.
-Right.

1014
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,211
That darn double date…

1015
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,881
I think this double date
will bring about a big change.

1016
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,383
Exactly, it was so huge.

1017
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,343
Yeah.

1018
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,430
PARADISE
KIM TE-HWAN & BAE JI-YEON

1019
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,267
This place is totally private.

1020
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,103
-Should we go in for a bit?
-Okay.

1021
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,192
It's nice though. It's not bad.

1022
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,693
-Really? It's not bad?
-Yeah.

1023
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,238
I love it.

1024
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,323
-You love it?
-Yeah.

1025
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,368
I love it.

1026
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,953
By the way, you look cute in the pool.

1027
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,372
-Really?
-Yeah.

1028
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,252
You're like a puppy.

1029
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,464
Dipping my feet in feels nice too.

1030
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,382
Yeah.

1031
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,008
Exactly.

1032
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,010
This is fun.

1033
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,178
-It's fun?
-Yeah.

1034
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,056
Usually, we've seen it
the other way around.

1035
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,141
He doesn't want to go in.

1036
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,143
It seems Ji-yeon
is more enthusiastic.

1037
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,647
-Remember when you asked about my dream?
-Yeah.

1038
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,648
What's your dream?

1039
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,442
Well, the work I'm doing now

1040
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,613
is about building a culture.

1041
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,742
I want to become someone

1042
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,913
who grows that culture by tens

1043
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,249
and thousands of times bigger.

1044
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:06,336
I want everyone to recognize me
as the one who made that culture grow.

1045
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,674
I want to be respected
by everyone who loves that culture.

1046
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,467
That's my dream.

1047
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,177
I see.

1048
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,811
-That's a big dream.
-Yeah.

1049
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,479
We usually call them
historical figures.

1050
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:25,981
-Right!
-Yeah.

1051
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,233
It's a dream I've never imagined.

1052
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,861
People in Korea

1053
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:35,323
are often deprived of the opportunity
to discover what they like.

1054
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,325
-Right.
-I find that so unfortunate.

1055
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:43,957
But nowadays, more people are starting
to explore their personal preferences.

1056
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,335
-That's why…
-Right.

1057
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,799
It seems like Te-hwan
enjoys talking about his work.

1058
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:58,305
He really likes
to talk about what he does.

1059
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,265
He tends to talk only about himself.

1060
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:04,269
A conversation should be a two-way street,
with each person asking questions.

1061
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:09,608
So I always work hard
to share good music with people…

1062
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,903
It's constantly about him.
That's what it's like.

1063
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:17,491
So towards the end, I grew tired
and started responding less.

1064
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:22,120
I only want to be known
by those who truly know my worth,

1065
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:26,124
and I only want to be recognized
by those with that depth of understanding.

1066
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,751
That's what I want.

1067
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,002
I see.

1068
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,172
That's my dream in its simplest terms.

1069
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,256
I see.

1070
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,510
In its simplest terms?

1071
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,679
I didn't realize Te-hwan had
such high self-esteem until now.

1072
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,681
He's so unique.

1073
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,519
What about your personal life goals?

1074
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,814
I'm not someone
who believes in staying single, but…

1075
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:49,856
Okay.

1076
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,401
But I guess you could say
that I lean that way.

1077
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,029
I just want to spend my life
with the culture I love…

1078
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:59,282
He sounds like he wants
to be some kind of president of culture.

1079
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,201
-A Minister of Culture.
-President of culture.

1080
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,577
-The Minister of Culture.
-Right.

1081
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,455
I just want to spend my life
with the culture I love…

1082
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,959
-And with the friends I love.
-Right.

1083
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,711
My goal's to live a happy life.

1084
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,796
I see.

1085
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:13,880
Happiness is my priority.

1086
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,967
It's to just live happily.

1087
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,136
I see.

1088
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:25,225
Usually, if you like someone,
do you tell them you want to stay single?

1089
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,645
No offense, but I'm not thinking
about marrying Te-hwan yet either.

1090
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,730
But the point here is

1091
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:35,777
I told him that my dream was
to create a happy family of my own.

1092
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,070
What's your dream?

1093
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,447
-Right, you asked me about that.
-Yeah.

1094
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,575
-My dream is to be a kind wife.
-Right.

1095
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,369
And I want to become
a reliable mother for my family.

1096
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,871
That's actually my dream.

1097
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,539
That's the hardest thing to do.

1098
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,582
That's right.

1099
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:53,795
I did mention I wanted to get married
and raise my own family.

1100
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,464
And as I was thinking this,

1101
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:00,594
I honestly felt confused
about it even yesterday.

1102
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,348
During times when we're supposed to
walk together,

1103
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,143
he'd walk ahead without caring about me.

1104
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,313
I think I get it now.

1105
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,689
-I know what to do.
-You get it?

1106
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,610
And when we went skating,
he didn't care much about me

1107
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,153
and had fun all by himself.

1108
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,449
This was the truth
behind that beautiful scene?

1109
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,366
Right?

1110
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,201
All he really did was just skate.

1111
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,413
EARLIER THIS MORNING

1112
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,507
-You're really focused on eating.
-Yeah.

1113
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,427
You have to eat well to be healthy.

1114
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,345
Right.

1115
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,181
THIS EVENING

1116
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,807
Do you have any more questions for me?

1117
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,897
-I'll ask when I think of one.
-What?

1118
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,440
-I'll ask when I think of one.
-Sure.

1119
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,942
"I'll ask when I think of one?"

1120
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,778
Most guys are simple and straightforward…

1121
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,655
-But that's…
-But we don't respond like that.

1122
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,989
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

1123
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,158
-I'll ask when I think of one.
-What?

1124
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,701
-I'll ask when I think of one.
-Sure.

1125
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:07,911
If you suddenly ask…

1126
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,079
-Right.
-Yeah.

1127
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,039
-I freeze up and can't think.
-Yeah.

1128
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:16,628
It makes me wonder
if he's actually interested.

1129
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:21,549
From his words,
he says he likes me this much,

1130
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,135
but I only feel just a fraction of it.

1131
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,847
It doesn't feel completely genuine.

1132
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,934
So I'm feeling a little confused.

1133
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,937
This twist was as big as The Sixth Sense.

1134
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,854
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1135
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,648
That's why she didn't want to go.

1136
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:41,069
So Ji-yeon was genuinely telling him
to go with someone else.

1137
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,697
-She wanted to stay and think things over.
-Right.

1138
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,865
-She could get to know the others too.
-Exactly.

1139
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,702
But he was really clueless
and chose her anyway.

1140
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,286
And if he actually liked her,

1141
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:54,249
he'd never say,
"I'll ask when I think of one."

1142
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,458
You'd never answer that way.

1143
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,210
-You want to know everything.
-You freeze…

1144
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,753
Even if you can't think of anything,

1145
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,381
you wouldn't answer like that.

1146
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,424
You can make things up.

1147
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,885
-"I'm curious about everything."
-"What's your favorite color?"

1148
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,846
"Gosh, I have so many."

1149
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,723
"What should I ask first?"

1150
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,183
-And you earn some time to think.
-Right.

1151
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,687
Te-hwan is really set
on the sense of who he is.

1152
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,941
It's strong, so he always follows
his strict personal standards

1153
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,943
in how he acts and speaks.

1154
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,695
And honestly,

1155
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,197
-he could've gone in the pool with her.
-He should have.

1156
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,615
-He didn't go in at all?
-But…

1157
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,160
-he'd already decided not to go in.
-He didn't go in later?

1158
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,911
He didn't want to get wet today.

1159
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,789
-It came off as stubborn and headstrong.
-Yeah.

1160
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:38,126
I guess back-to-back trips
to Paradise aren't so great after all.

1161
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,044
I guess not.

1162
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,211
It may not be good,

1163
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,380
but it's crucial
for getting to know someone better.

1164
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,466
-It does seem important.
-It is.

1165
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,134
All three couples are crumbling.

1166
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,427
-Totally.
-Definitely.

1167
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,512
Today wasn't a day in paradise.

1168
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,766
Everyone seems gloomy.

1169
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:54,184
Yeah.

1170
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,602
Why are you down? Tell us.

1171
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,729
Me? I've been on Inferno for too long.

1172
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,356
-I don't remember what it's like outside.
-There's tomorrow.

1173
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,358
-I doubt I'll go.
-Why do you think that?

1174
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,860
We'll help you.

1175
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,320
-Help with what?
-What do you mean?

1176
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,905
Just stay put!

1177
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,573
-Wait…
-She said stay put!

1178
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,283
Look at him laughing now.

1179
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,869
-She can handle it on her own.
-She can?

1180
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:13,912
I'm doing just fine.

1181
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,747
Really? Then, you'll probably go tomorrow.

1182
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,956
You better not stay behind.

1183
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,042
I'll make sure not to.

1184
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,253
I'm just saying
it's okay to be more assertive.

1185
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:26,424
But we're not allowed to talk
about who we picked, right?

1186
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,218
-No, that's up to you.
-Really?

1187
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,512
But if you're being cautious,
you can keep it secret.

1188
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,848
I was being really careful,
because I thought we couldn't say it.

1189
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,517
Feel free to say it then.

1190
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,434
Go ahead.

1191
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,478
-What?
-Who…

1192
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,979
Who did I pick?

1193
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,564
No, who's on your mind?

1194
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:43,691
Jong-hoon.

1195
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,694
Jong-hoon.

1196
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:49,739
What?

1197
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,492
What? Out of nowhere?

1198
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,327
-What on earth?
-Hye-jin, what's going on?

1199
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,454
-That was perfect timing.
-Exactly.

1200
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,040
I chose Jong-hoon this round too.

1201
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,625
-Goodness.
-Seriously?

1202
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,835
You didn't catch that?

1203
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,546
-This round? Or before he came?
-You're so cool!

1204
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,131
-She's so cool!
-And…

1205
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,299
-I'll keep…
-Do I need to swap seats?

1206
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,009
I'm going to keep picking Jong-hoon.

1207
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,932
-Sorry, I can't handle cheesy stuff!
-What?

1208
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,475
-Good thing I asked, right?
-What?

1209
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,727
-Yeah, seriously. I mean it.
-I didn't know.

1210
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,106
Nice one, Hye-jin.

1211
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,275
-No, it wasn't cheesy. It was cool.
-She's certain.

1212
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,192
Yeah.

1213
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,986
I didn't know.

1214
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,572
But why didn't you know?

1215
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,282
That's actually my fault.

1216
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,409
-Why?
-I wasn't expressive enough.

1217
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,952
I felt it from him though.

1218
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,581
At first, he was being really nice to me.

1219
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,041
-I was so grateful.
-She's stuttering.

1220
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,668
I'm nervous right now.

1221
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,254
I saw that they took
a lot of Polaroid photos together.

1222
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,923
Then, I'll go and talk with Hye-jin.

1223
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,759
That was immediate.

1224
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,470
-To see them act so quick…
-That's great.

1225
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,430
-That's so nice.
-This warms my soul!

1226
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,764
-My goodness.
-It feels so nice.

1227
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,433
Hye-jin's so honest.

1228
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,769
To hear that you think well of me,

1229
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:06,149
I feel really thankful,
touched, and happy.

1230
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,946
Every time I see you,

1231
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,492
you look so pretty.

1232
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:19,996
There's something about you
that makes me swoon.

1233
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,706
-Really? Honestly?
-Yeah.

1234
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,083
-Yeah.
-I genuinely believe what people say.

1235
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,044
-Right.
-So be honest.

1236
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,505
-I am being honest.
-And don't be like Jeong-su.

1237
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,422
What is he like?

1238
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,508
Never mind.

1239
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,467
All right.

1240
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:38,556
I just couldn't get the words out,
but today, you had that scarf thing on.

1241
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,807
-Scarf?
-Yeah.

1242
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,976
-You wore it around your neck.
-Right.

1243
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,895
Your outfit looked really nice on you.

1244
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,230
-Really?
-That outfit.

1245
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:48,024
And the yellow outfit you wore yesterday.

1246
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:49,609
So…

1247
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,278
Saying "Nice outfit"
isn't a big deal, you know?

1248
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:57,742
But I found it hard
to say even those things.

1249
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:02,497
That's how difficult it was
for me to approach you.

1250
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,086
That's understandable.
I'll initiate the talking then.

1251
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,297
-No, it's fine now. I can do it.
-It is?

1252
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,676
Yeah, from now on,
I'll approach you first.

1253
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,639
I want to go…

1254
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,018
to Paradise with you tomorrow.

1255
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,770
-With me?
-Yeah.

1256
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,313
Gosh.

1257
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:33,695
I'll keep writing your name for sure.

1258
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,573
"Jong-hoon."

1259
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,203
Let's take a photo
to remember this moment and go to bed.

1260
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,705
-Should we?
-Yeah.

1261
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,915
I'll stretch out my arms as much as I can.

1262
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:53,923
Okay.

1263
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:57,677
Nice.

1264
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,597
-All of a sudden.
-Great.

1265
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,682
I never expected to see this on Inferno.

1266
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,018
After seeing what happened in Paradise,

1267
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,644
-we felt a bit down.
-Right.

1268
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,229
And Hye-jin was so cool.

1269
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,230
-Honestly.
-Right.

1270
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,315
-Just now.
-She was.

1271
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,482
I feel good about them.

1272
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,859
They'll keep this going.

1273
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,194
-They'll head to Paradise together.
-Yes.

1274
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,031
Is there anyone you want to talk to here?

1275
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,451
It's our free time right now,
so feel free to chat.

1276
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,745
I want to talk.

1277
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,832
With who?

1278
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,584
-Dong-ho.
-Go on, then.

1279
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,127
Go ahead. Us three will be here.

1280
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,546
I'll go rest after this.

1281
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,840
You're not going to chat with us either?

1282
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:39,385
Of course, I'll talk with you.
I need to put on some lip balm first.

1283
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,888
-All the women here are assertive.
-Yeah.

1284
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,723
A-rin doesn't look happy.

1285
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,933
I want to go for a walk.

1286
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,644
-Should we?
-Do you like to go for walks?

1287
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,317
What about you, A-rin?

1288
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,153
-A lot on your mind or just being quiet?
-I'm curious.

1289
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,237
I mean…

1290
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,740
I might've been mistaken,

1291
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,284
but I thought I'd received
a lot of assurance.

1292
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,040
I'm rooming with Hae-lin and You-jin, so…

1293
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,917
That's why your room's so quiet?

1294
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,335
I can't really talk now.

1295
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,506
I want to talk about what happened
and share how I felt.

1296
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,508
But with them around, I can't talk.

1297
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,093
-Come to our room.
-Yeah, you can't.

1298
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,470
So I don't even know what's going on.

1299
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,722
After we came back,
I haven't talked to Dong-ho today.

1300
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,182
-Do it later.
-So the thing is…

1301
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,768
I'm pretty sure
she talked with Dong-ho earlier.

1302
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:32,188
So I'm not sure if he rejected her
and she's still pursuing him,

1303
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,190
or if it's because
he's giving her a chance.

1304
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,650
I'm curious about that.

1305
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,029
Right, we came back
from Paradise yesterday.

1306
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,407
You really lose a sense of time here.

1307
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,326
We had some coffee together yesterday.

1308
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:46,828
Yesterday morning.

1309
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,163
-Right.
-Did you have one today?

1310
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,457
-I did.
-I'm so jealous.

1311
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,126
Are you craving coffee?

1312
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,502
It's driving me crazy.

1313
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,962
Those were the happy days.

1314
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,465
What do you mean "were"?

1315
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,635
Those were the happy days…
Of course, I'm happier right now.

1316
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,266
If it's really a women's game
for Paradise tomorrow,

1317
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,601
would it be okay if you were kidnapped?

1318
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,063
-I'm going to do it anyway.
-Sure.

1319
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,356
It'll happen for sure.

1320
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:20,445
I'm going to win no matter what.

1321
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:22,989
What?

1322
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,866
You're really fired up.

1323
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,827
I really have to go to Paradise tomorrow.

1324
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,663
Let's go together.

1325
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,999
Let's go.

1326
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,377
You're smiling like that again.

1327
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,087
What smile?

1328
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:43,843
You're doing it again.

1329
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,762
No, I just feel awkward.

1330
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,346
Smiling feels awkward to me.

1331
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,474
Seeing myself smile felt awkward too.

1332
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,060
That's…

1333
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,729
He can't get a grip.

1334
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:58,274
It seems he only smiles like that
in front of Hae-lin.

1335
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,650
-Dong-ho…
-Yeah?

1336
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,319
-I didn't tell you, right?
-About what?

1337
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,863
-When I mentioned my ideal type…
-Yeah.

1338
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,908
I didn't mention the cheeks, right?

1339
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,993
-You didn't mention that.
-Why didn't I?

1340
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,412
I like guys who blush when they're shy.

1341
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,497
That's what I said.

1342
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,332
And here you are.

1343
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,753
It's not that I'm shy…

1344
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,338
Do you feel flustered instead?

1345
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:24,342
I've never met
anyone like you in my life before.

1346
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:29,055
Someone who's so direct
and clear with their feelings…

1347
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,182
I really hope the girls
get to pick tomorrow.

1348
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,436
I'll let you sleep on the master bed.

1349
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,192
At this point,
I think I'm enjoying this too.

1350
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,320
-She's hitting on him so much.
-Yes.

1351
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,404
"Hitting on him"!

1352
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,366
-It's no joke.
-Exactly.

1353
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:51,452
But whenever she does that,
Dong-ho doesn't know what to do.

1354
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,370
Yeah.

1355
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,455
Hae-lin finds that so funny and amusing.

1356
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,873
-Exactly.
-She wants to tease him.

1357
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,251
Yeah, this is like a comic book story.

1358
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:01,671
You have this shy guy
as the main character.

1359
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,674
Then, this super bubbly heroine appears.

1360
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:07,301
-And she acts all cute…
-She's that popular girl at school.

1361
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:08,594
-Yeah.
-And then…

1362
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,513
-She's like, "Hey, what's up?"
-Right!

1363
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,723
-You know that vibe?
-I kept picturing that idea.

1364
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:16,060
So without realizing it,
he's slowly being drawn to her.

1365
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,478
-My goodness.
-Yeah.

1366
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,316
They're taking a long time to talk.

1367
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,987
-I'm curious.
-Hae-lin and Dong-ho?

1368
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,281
I'm pretty sure they talked earlier.

1369
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,366
They did.

1370
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,535
They did, right?

1371
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,579
-Yeah, earlier.
-I saw them together.

1372
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,122
They had a one-on-one chat.

1373
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:39,834
For me, that was a big deal.

1374
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,879
The place where he works

1375
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:47,425
and the place where I work is the same.

1376
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,509
-What?
-The location.

1377
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,386
We live in the same area.

1378
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,180
Our parents live in the same town.

1379
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,098
What?

1380
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,602
We have the same birthday month too.

1381
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,312
-It's destiny.
-You have a lot in common.

1382
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,273
That's why it was such a shock to me.

1383
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,610
But there was excitement
that came from that shock.

1384
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,403
I thought, "What? Even this?"

1385
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,155
Is it fate?

1386
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,531
That's what happened.

1387
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,867
After hearing that about him,
it made a huge impact.

1388
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,328
I think that's why
my feelings for him grew so much.

1389
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,581
I think everyone's gone inside.

1390
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:19,749
No, they haven't.

1391
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,250
-They're still here.
-Yeah.

1392
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,796
Do as you please.
I'm going to get some water.

1393
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:28,966
They're back.

1394
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,886
Did you have a nice chat?

1395
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,263
That took almost two to three hours.

1396
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,557
-What? Really?
-The new day almost dawned.

1397
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,558
What time is it?

1398
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,477
Why are you being so mean?

1399
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,980
What, did you have some alcohol?

1400
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,607
No, my eyes are so dry.

1401
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:45,524
Really?

1402
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,318
I thought the sun was going to rise.

1403
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,819
I almost went to bed.

1404
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,907
You're so scary.

1405
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,535
I'm so tired. I almost went to go sleep.

1406
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,453
Exactly.

1407
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:58,663
We couldn't even wash up.

1408
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:03,334
You only had two hours of sleep,
yet you were still chatting away.

1409
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,420
This is so fun.

1410
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,422
It's so fun being on Inferno.

1411
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,258
You two should talk.

1412
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:14,261
We couldn't even wash up
since we were waiting.

1413
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,430
No, if you're tired,
we can talk next time.

1414
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:17,348
Let's go.

1415
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,557
Let's go.

1416
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,809
Wait, I need to sneeze…

1417
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,729
That means he wants to go to bed.

1418
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,815
-He's cold.
-It was a sneeze.

1419
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:26,774
-You're cold.
-No.

1420
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:28,442
He was shivering yesterday too.

1421
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,485
Really?

1422
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,946
Let's go. I don't have much to say anyway.

1423
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,614
Let's go.

1424
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,535
Wait for me.

1425
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,329
Let's go.

1426
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,039
We can talk tomorrow if you're tired.

1427
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,457
That's not it.

1428
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,793
-You were acting all tired and yawning.
-It's not that.

1429
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:47,003
-I…
-"Are you going to bed?"

1430
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,797
Let's talk fast and sleep. I'm so tired.

1431
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,552
Well…

1432
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,596
-Didn't you two talk earlier too?
-We did.

1433
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,434
I was curious why you were talking again.
But you two went on for a while.

1434
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:06,522
I figured I'd wait and hear
what you talked about before going to bed.

1435
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,649
I think she just wanted to talk.

1436
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,318
I listened to her talk.

1437
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,531
I was mostly listening to her.

1438
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,617
The whole time.

1439
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,121
I see.

1440
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:24,874
I was just curious.

1441
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,209
This was just an excuse
for me to talk to you.

1442
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:31,130
And after the game you played earlier…

1443
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,633
we hadn't talked
since returning from Paradise.

1444
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:36,469
That's true.

1445
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,930
I thought we'd have
plenty of time to talk today.

1446
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,850
-They all came to you.
-They came.

1447
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,728
We were talking here.
And then, You-jin walked by.

1448
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:48,397
She asked to talk next,
so I did that right after.

1449
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:50,941
So that's how it went.

1450
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:59,825
Honestly, I'm not curious
about what you talked about.

1451
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,660
I just…

1452
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,832
I wanted to let you know
that I'm still thinking about you.

1453
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,212
So I'm not actually
interested in what was said.

1454
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:12,421
Because since before…

1455
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:14,799
we've been talking,

1456
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,551
whether it was on Paradise or here.

1457
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:24,934
Anyways, that's all.

1458
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:29,688
That's it.

1459
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,488
What?

1460
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:40,157
Should we go to bed?

1461
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:42,701
No, we can stay a bit.
Let's stay a little longer.

1462
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:43,661
Really?

1463
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,539
I'm not acting like I don't want to.

1464
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,581
I know.

1465
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,125
-You know, right?
-Yeah.

1466
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,168
-I didn't want you to misunderstand.
-I'm sleepy.

1467
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,878
-Because you were sleepy?
-Yeah.

1468
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,088
Let's get up.

1469
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,299
We really didn't get a lot of sleep.

1470
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:01,345
I'm not sure about these two either.

1471
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:02,471
This feels off too.

1472
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,807
It's a love triangle
involving Kook Dong-ho.

1473
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,810
Honestly, from tonight's conversation…

1474
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,312
-Hae-lin?
-I think there's no need for confusion.

1475
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,774
I feel he definitely has
stronger feelings for Hae-lin.

1476
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:16,068
But A-rin mentioned this earlier.

1477
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,738
We thought she wasn't
being assertive enough.

1478
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,574
But during their conversation,

1479
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,742
she said she received a lot of assurance,

1480
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,203
so even if she doesn't go
and talk to him, it'll be okay.

1481
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,873
I feel like that's what she's thinking.

1482
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:31,709
But if she's thinking that,
isn't she letting her guard down?

1483
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:35,212
I bet Dong-ho's never experienced
anything like this in his life before.

1484
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,716
I don't think
he'll just openly show his feelings.

1485
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,385
-Even if he's drawn to Hae-lin.
-Right.

1486
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,053
PARADISE
YUK JUN-SEO & LEE SI-AN

1487
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,764
It's so comfortable here. This is great.

1488
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,310
Now, this is Paradise.

1489
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:51,604
Right?

1490
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:55,649
Don't you think?

1491
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,276
Yeah.

1492
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:04,867
She turned her head.

1493
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,368
Yeah. Don't talk with that tone.

1494
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,953
Stop talking to her with that tone.

1495
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,419
It's because we're tired, right?

1496
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,088
Do you want to shower first?

1497
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,925
No, let's talk a bit first.

1498
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:22,009
You want to talk?

1499
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:24,386
Or should we talk after showering?

1500
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,971
I think that sounds better.

1501
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:37,191
How's your second day in Paradise been?

1502
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,611
-Second day in Paradise?
-Yeah.

1503
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,453
You sleeping?

1504
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:50,371
"You sleeping?"

1505
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:52,831
That's ridiculous.

1506
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:53,749
Really?

1507
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:54,875
No way.

1508
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,799
What if he actually fell asleep?

1509
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:03,634
-What?
-Then, it'll be over.

1510
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:04,551
-For sure.
-No way.

1511
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,053
He fell asleep?

1512
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:12,935
Are you sleeping?

1513
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,969
