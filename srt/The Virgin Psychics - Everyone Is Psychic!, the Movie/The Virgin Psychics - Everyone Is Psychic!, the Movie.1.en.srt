1
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,930
He'd think about it.

2
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,360
When would it happen?

3
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,890
It obsessed him.

4
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,900
Hands, legs. hands, legs...

5
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,440
Hands and legs.

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,070
I'm getting ahead of myself.

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,800
I'll start at the beginning.

8
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,340
In a little corner of the universe is Earth.

9
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,790
In a little corner of Earth is Japan.

10
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,060
In a tiny corner of Japan is Higashi Mikawa.

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:15,190
In a tiny corner of this town
our hero's adventure begins

12
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,960
at his house.

13
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,340
OK, let's eat.

14
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,710
Thank you.

15
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,990
You're so handsome.

16
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,330
You're lovely.

17
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,830
You make me hot!

18
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,370
Really?

19
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,240
- This is our hero.
- Really?

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,100
Yoshiro Kamogawa.

21
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,810
Is the cucumber hard?

22
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,450
He looks like a loser
but tonight he'll become a hero.

23
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,350
I'll jerk off.

24
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,160
She waves and runs over.

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,560
We hold hands and run.

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,230
We run and run.

27
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,270
She puts her hand on mine.

28
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,170
And we kiss.

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,760
OK, my right-hand man.

30
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,810
And tissues.

31
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,370
Ready. Partner?

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,520
Who will it be tonight?

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,230
What about...

34
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,700
Sae Asami. Sae Asami...

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,870
Sae!

36
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,570
I got a peek!

37
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,040
Sae Asami. Sae Asami...

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,710
What a cute smile!

39
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,870
No, I can't!

40
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,350
How about Keiko from the bookstore?

41
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,010
That sexy pose!

42
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,720
Wait! On the school route there's an arcade.

43
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,950
The owner...

44
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,320
No, Saya, the granddaughter.

45
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,670
How about...

46
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,440
Yoshiro, pay attention!

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes. Ma'am!

48
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,310
Did you hear me?

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,910
Yes. Ma'am!

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,580
- Yoshiro?
- Yes!

51
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,050
The teacher!

52
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,350
Oh, look at her body!

53
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,080
I can't concentrate in class!

54
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,790
She's too sexy!

55
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,260
I can't take any more!

56
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,720
Or Taeko, the local newspaper reporter.

57
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,590
Her smile! Her tits! Oh, God!

58
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,170
And her lovely friend!

59
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,670
I bet she acts sexy at work.

60
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,070
So sexy!

61
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,080
No, wait...

62
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,100
It has to be the special one!

63
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,650
The girl of my destiny. Who is she?

64
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:21,320
He is obsessed with finding that special girl.

65
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,450
Who is she?

66
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,790
Is it Sae, his classmate?

67
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,960
Is it her?

68
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,460
He once met that special girl.

69
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,710
17 years ago. 3 months before he was born.

70
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,410
If you're having contractions, go left!

71
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,380
Next up is Number 3.

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,030
Next up is Number 3.

73
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,950
Wake up.

74
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,090
Who's trying to wake me up?

75
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,920
We're about to be born. Isn't it exciting?

76
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,250
No!

77
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,590
Why not?

78
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,060
It's depressing. I'll just be
another greedy loser.

79
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,300
Life's messed up.

80
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,010
No way. Life is hope!

81
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,410
The world is beautiful.

82
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,310
Why can I hear your voice?

83
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,320
- You can hear my thoughts.
- What?

84
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,220
Our minds are connected.

85
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,320
How strange! Can we meet someday?

86
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,860
Maybe, if you listen out for me.

87
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,850
How will I know it's you?

88
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,000
La-la-la...

89
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,640
- What's that?
- Our secret code.

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,440
If I find you I'll wave
and run to you, singing.

91
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,250
La-la-la...

92
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,410
I'll remember it.

93
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,280
Look around if you hear it.

94
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,620
Sure. I'll find you one day.

95
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,990
Next up is Number 19.

96
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,500
It's our destiny to meet.

97
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,840
Destiny...

98
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:50,870
Right.

99
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,170
You're the girl of my destiny.

100
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,940
Yoshiro remembers that day
like it was yesterday.

101
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,420
And the song,

102
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,150
La-la-la.

103
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,180
When he went home on the tram

104
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,460
he felt content in his mother's womb.

105
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,230
Where is she?

106
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,770
Where's the girl of my destiny?

107
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,870
Images of her come into his mind

108
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,950
in fragments.

109
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,720
She's waving at their meeting place.

110
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,650
He sees her running over.

111
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,190
He sees them running, hand in hand.

112
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,860
They keep running together.

113
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,860
They sit and hold hands.

114
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,770
And kiss on tiptoe.

115
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:58,430
As he thought about her and was about to climax

116
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,380
a cosmic phenomenon took place.

117
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,340
A shaft of light shone on him.

118
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,120
I'm coming!

119
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,930
What the hell?

120
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,900
That's how it all began.

121
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:31,670
Little does Yoshiro, our hero,
know what lay ahead.

122
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,920
What's going on?

123
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,110
I feel weird...

124
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,810
Miyuki Hirano is Yoshiro's classmate.

125
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,710
She's yet to realize it

126
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,700
but her indecent act gave her a special power.

127
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,680

128
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,910

129
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
Ouch!

130
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,260
My head!

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,830
I feel weird.

132
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,770
Breakfast!

133
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,640
Our hero realizes that something's occurred.

134
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,790
It's 100 rotations per second.

135
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,990
All for you!

136
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,860
Do it tonight!

137
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,420
Please.

138
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,660
I can't wait.

139
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,650
Don't speak!

140
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,870
We didn't.

141
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,990
You did.

142
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,840
There's no stopping the unfolding events.

154
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,430
Look at her, she's gorgeous!

155
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,030
Thanks.

156
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,130
- Did I speak out loud?
- No, why?

157
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,740
- I want sex.
- I want to smoke.

158
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,350
I want to get laid.

159
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,610
Am I reading people's thoughts?

160
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,080
Too short!

161
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,890
A slip for Madoka.

162
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,590
- Too short!
- A slip for Kazumi.

163
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,730
Both of you!

164
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,830
I have to be the sexiest!

165
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,660
She said that!

166
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,430
Clothes mirror your soul!

167
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,640
Your skirt's too short! No push up bras!

168
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,140
I...

169
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,780
Nobody's as erotic as me.

170
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,370
I can hear them!

171
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,840
Yoshiro!

172
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,510
Yasu.

173
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,590
Come to my place later.

174
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,990
I got an "Erotic Teacher" DVD.

175
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,450
She's too sexy.

176
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,550
She'd be sexier in underwear!

177
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,400
Yasu, you hunk!

178
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,870
Don't think about it!

179
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,670
It's the new girl!

180
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,700
She's so pretty!

181
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,280
He's right, Sae's cute. Is she the one?

182
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,650
They're watching us again.

183
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,050
- Creeps!
- Creeps!

184
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,780
Fuck off!

185
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,650
Sae Asami is so cute.

186
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,250
Sae.

187
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,160
Yoshiro, is that a hard-on?

188
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,320
I know Yoshiro jerks off to Sae, too!

189
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,860
I don't!

190
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,370
I have to hide my boner!

191
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,770
Yoshiro!

192
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,580
Miyuki...

193
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,640
Come on! Don't act like a sissy!

194
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,050
Oh...

195
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,050
A hard-on.

196
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,280
- He's got a hard-on!
- I don't!

197
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,150
He's got a hard-on.

198
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,720
Sae!

199
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,220
Come on.

200
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,870
Of course I don't have a hard-on!

201
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,930
You're low.

202
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,200
Any girl's OK.

203
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,940
It's an accident!

204
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,770
Oh sure! Horny four eyes.

205
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,970
Take it back!

206
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,240
Huh?

207
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,690
How did we talk just now?

208
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,180
Can Miyuki read thoughts too?

209
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,130
She's cool. I want her.

210
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,390
Thanks.

211
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,710
The First Moroccan Clitoris,
I mean, Crisis occurred in 1905.

212
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:44,200
Germany's Kaiser William II...

213
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,050
went down on Tangier, causing friction

214
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,510
and tried to take it.

215
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,120
We have a new student, Sae Asami.

216
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,590
Come in.

217
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,850
Sae came to his school a month ago

218
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,030
and our hero Yoshiro was...

219
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,340
She's so cute!

220
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,580
- Pervert!
- Yoshiro!

221
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,410
She triggered something in him.

222
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,950
Maybe she's the one...

223
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:30,260
This led him to think that
she was the girl of his destiny.

224
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,590
I can read people's minds.

225
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,570
I can read her thoughts too.

226
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,740
I'm sure he jerks off to me.

227
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,410
No hard-ons, Yoshiro!

228
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,240
Class, be quiet.

229
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,520
Sae, I'm not that kind of man...

230
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,490
Oh, I want to have sex.

231
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,730
Yoshiro, check this out. Teru gave it to me.

232
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,090
Put that away, pervert!

233
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,350
You jerk!

234
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,590
It'll get dirty!

235
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,970
Ms. Akiyama.

236
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,540
Are you listening?

237
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,340
Yes.

238
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,350
Our research has proven right.

239
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,280
There's psychic activity here.

240
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,720
In the past 3 days locals visited hospitals

241
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,560
with baffling ailments.

242
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,460
Some might be awakened psychics.

243
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,100
After a decade of research

244
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:48,530
and derision by Tokyo scholars,
I'll prove my theory.

245
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,640
It's a peaceful town.

246
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,740
It all starts here!

247
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,280
I'm Taeko, a local journalist.

248
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,790
This is a detective.

249
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,160
Mitsuko Mitsui.

250
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,060
I love Toyohashi city.

251
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,160
Toyo River supplies the city's water.

252
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,360
Toyohashi citizens love Toyocky!

253
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,470
Toyohashi is nice!

254
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,400
There's Yoshida Castle

255
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,170
and the City Hall.

256
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,680
Toyohashi is the best!

257
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,010
Have fun at Non Hoi Park.

258
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,740
Are you listening to me?

259
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,520
I love Toyohashi!

260
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,390
I just love it!

261
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,380
It's a wonderful city!

262
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,390
This is the Ushi River Ferry.

263
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,130
I'm Kamiya, a rookie!

264
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,930
Someone's calling! Coming!

265
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:56,300
The ferry is still used to transport citizens.

266
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,510
No crime today.

267
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,880
Yes, Detective.

268
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,210
Totally!

269
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,820
They don't know that Toyohashi's in danger.

270
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,280
"Nakaya Bookstore"

271
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,120
"The Secret of ESP"

272
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,860
"Precognition, telepathy,
telekinesis teleportation, clairvoyance"

273
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,470
So many types...

274
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,870
"A psychic never thinks about sex."

275
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,240
"He brings peace to Earth."

276
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,850
"Psychics are the world's heroes
and fight evil."

277
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,010
"They save the world!"

278
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,290
"Psychics fight evil and save the world!"

279
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,350
I'm a hero!

280
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,690
"Do not abuse your powers."

281
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,260
"Don't use it to pick up girls."

282
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,330
It's not the time to jerk off!

283
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,270
I wonder what kind of girls Yoshiro likes.

284
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,940
Telepathy!

285
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,770
Hello.

286
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,310
This, please.

287
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,200
Nice weather.

288
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,150
Just that? Want some tea?

289
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,590
Imagine her underwear!

290
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,520
Uh... No, thank you.

291
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,690
"Special Boob Issue"

292
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,720
Stop!

293
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,140
Don't snatch that!

294
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,370
Yoshiro.

295
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,000
How about pinball?

296
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,180
Wait a minute!

297
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,340
Come on!

298
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,690
What's that book?

299
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,460
"Psychics fight evil and save the world!"

300
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,700
"They're heroes..."

301
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,670
Don't!

302
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,300
Yoshiro!

303
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,670
I want to read it now!

304
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,370
"Seahorse Café"

305
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,120
What a loser...

306
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,710
I'm a hero.

307
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,300
I have ESP, Teru!

308
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,180
I saw your mom at the supermarket.

309
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,470
She's beautiful.

310
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,910
Hey!

311
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,220
It can't be! What a coincidence.

312
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,920
My all-time favorite to jerk off to.

313
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,230
OK, the book.

314
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,710
"Love me Tenga"

315
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,940
"Tenga it..."

316
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,130
Yoshiro. Have you heard of Tenga?

317
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,520
Well...

318
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,290
If you have Tenga you won't need women.

319
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,930
Now.

320
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,870
This Tenga is for women.

321
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,030
For Miyuki.

322
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,530
Take it.

323
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,800
Here!

324
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,540
Normally this is all you do with it...

325
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,910
But from today I have a new skill.

326
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,910
Like what?

327
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,520
See what I can do now?

328
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,120
It means I can jack off with no hands.

329
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,420
Telekinesis...

330
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,500
You shoplifted that magazine!

331
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,370
I saw you in there so I pranked you.

332
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,540
Now for real.

333
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,610
Up, down. Up, down...

334
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,320
Ritsuko... Stop.

335
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,050
You're married.

336
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,040
Ritsuko...

337
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,590
Not in front of your son!

338
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,110
Not my Mom!

339
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:47,350
I can move Tenga and dirty mags...
Only erotic stuff.

340
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,900
It'll be a life of jerking off.

341
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,960
Here, Tenga!

342
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,040
- No!
- Go on, jack-off boy!

343
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:06,970
No!

344
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,720
I'm not a jack-off boy!

345
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,960
Jack-off boy.

346
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,630
I'm a psychic hero so give me a break!

347
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,100
Lay off!

348
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,130
I'll...

349
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,460
I'll save the world!

350
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:34,080
Now Yoshiro is aware of his responsibilities.

351
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,240
Being a hero isn't easy.

352
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,110
I might just try it...

353
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,760
Yoshiro, use it!

354
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,820
It's magic!

355
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,470
Sae...

356
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,830
I'll fantasize about her.

357
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,170
No!

358
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,080
I have to act like a psychic hero now!

359
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,190
I could read people's thoughts...

360
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,250
What's going on?

361
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,690
Men look at me and have dirty thoughts.

362
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,400
I want to do her!

363
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,260
The slut!

364
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,000
You want men!

365
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,370
Hey, babe!

366
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,800
I can still hear those voices in my head.

367
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,780
What is this?

368
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,310
Is this, like... ESP?

369
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,100
Yoshiro!

370
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,360
Sae, I'll save the world for you.

371
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,060
Sae...

372
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,300
I'll show Sae my naked body!

373
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,470
I'll get naked in front of her.

374
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,380
We have to get changed! Come on!

375
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,470
Coming! I'll get naked in front of you.

376
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,950
OK, Sae.

377
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,130
To the locker room. Go!

378
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,960
What the... Oh, no!

379
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,210
Oh, I feel like making out...

380
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,360
Maybe I'm sick...

381
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,130
When is he going to fuck me?

382
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,130
- I'll cheat on the test.
- Someone, kiss me!

383
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,690
Maybe I'll be OK soon...

384
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,030
I'll wait...

385
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,800
- Am I gay?
- I want to masturbate.

386
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,000
Penis!

387
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,310
Oops.

388
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,610
You're not Sae.

389
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,080
Cool!

390
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:26,950
Damn!

391
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,470
Punch it!

392
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,450
What! Did you see him?

393
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,460
- No one's here.
- There was!

394
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,930
Right, Sae?

395
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,830
He was cool.

396
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,760
What!

397
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,530
Miyuki?

398
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,600
Yoshiro.

399
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,470
A naked man was here!

400
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,240
Are you OK, Sae?

401
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,230
Creep!

402
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,250
Who are you?

403
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,880
It's ESP!

404
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,320
It wasn't Sae!

405
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,260
I wanted her to be the first to see my penis.

406
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,660
But it's OK...

407
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,230
What a rush!

408
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,760
Teleportation. It's ESP!

409
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,200
Hi there!

410
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,610
What if you showed him your bra?

411
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,350
He'll fall and spill the water.

412
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,360
We'll see.

413
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,710
A dirty mag.

414
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,470
What the hell?

415
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,540
Telekinesis!

416
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,780
It's ESP!

417
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,220
"ESP Research Lab"

418
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,990
It's ESP!

419
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,960
You have 39 yen.

420
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,260
39 yen!

421
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,400
Add 120 yen.

422
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,460
Add 130 yen.

423
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,440
Never mind the kids.

424
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,370
Now.

425
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,510
Yabe is clairvoyant. Be nice to him.

426
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,040
Sexy undies!

427
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,650
Don't look!

428
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,890
I'm Professor Asami,
an ESP researcher from Tokyo.

429
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,160
Ms. Akiyama is my assistant. She has ESP.

430
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,590
She does?

431
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,360
Precognition.

432
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,420
Hello.

433
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:02,830
She sees the future of anyone
who stares at her breasts.

434
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,710
That's why you flashed your boob!

435
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,310
Why do we suddenly have ESP?

436
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:15,480
It's because you all fit the criteria.

437
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,350
200 years ago in Duluth, Minnesota

438
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,720
there was another psychic awakening.

439
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,560
Cosmic rays hit Duluth

440
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,290
when the planets were aligned
in a particular way.

441
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,430
This time

442
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,100
cosmic rays hit this region.

443
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,070
Cosmic rays!

444
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:42,310
You got ESP because you fit certain criteria.

445
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:46,270
So we're special. We were chosen!

446
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,250
You're my hero.

447
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,330
First, you've never had sexual intercourse.

448
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,700
I see a hymen.

449
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,000
We had to be virgins?

450
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,510
I know how this mix-up happened.

451
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,810
Sometimes experienced people seem pure.

452
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,920
Sure...

453
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,650
I'm no virgin!

454
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,720
- Shut up, cherry boy!
- I'm not!

455
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,060
Look at me! I've put it to good use.

456
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,460
I doubt it.

457
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,030
You're like a brand new car. Nice!

458
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:40,060
I'm a used Ferrari in comparison
with all my mileage.

459
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,310
Secondly, when the rays hit the town

460
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,950
you were sexually aroused.

461
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,370
I jacked off...

462
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,270
Miyuki?

463
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,690
You, too!

464
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,320
You masturbated?

465
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,390
Hymen!

466
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,230
So girls do it, too?

467
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,780
What if we do?

468
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,430
- I guess it's OK.
- You bet!

469
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,630
Thirdly, you noticed your power.

470
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You fulfilled these 3 criteria to be psychics.

471
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,110
Bullshit!

472
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,370
It sounds unlikely but

473
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,210
we've been trying to harness
this energy from space.

474
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:29,250
She offered to become a psychic
to test our theory.

475
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,740
You masturbated!

476
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,220
- A babe with tits!
- And a hymen.

477
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,680
What happened to the psychics
in the American town?

478
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:45,800
They're discussed in a document called
"The Planet Waves."

479
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,200
In that particular case in 19th Century Duluth

480
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,810
they were killed.

481
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,840
Killed?

482
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,540
By other psychics.

483
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,880
Other psychics are in this town.

484
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,520
And some might abuse their power.

485
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,520
A psychic fights evil!

486
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,360
Psychics seek out each other.
Inform me of anything unusual.

487
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,860
Psychics bring peace to Earth!

488
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:19,150
We'll protect our town from Duluth's fate!

489
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,000
You're heroes!

490
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,830
Go, psychics!

491
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,740
You're a hero!

492
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,290
Where are my panties?

493
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,380
Hanging on the verandah.

494
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,190
Sae?

495
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,590
I guess you know my daughter.

496
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,620
Sae?

497
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,640
Her?

498
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,200
It's him!

499
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,380
With your help, I hope Sae can live here
in peace.

500
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,050
Go, heroes!

501
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:11,450
Peacekeepers, let's put the banner up!

502
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,110
Up a bit.

503
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,450
Good!

504
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,490
"Welcome Psychics!"

505
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,860
- Yoshiro.
- Saya!

506
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,760
ESP!

507
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,890
The professor was right.

508
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,610
Shady plots were under way.

509
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,020
I'll cause some serious trouble.

510
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,370
On the night the cosmic rays hit,
many virgins masturbated.

511
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,740
Including Akiko Kamiya, a budding lesbian...

512
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,900
Take us across!

513
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,270
Skipper, hello!

514
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,780
They're cute...

515
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,080
I'll take them across.

516
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,320
Come on!

517
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,870
Skipper!

518
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,820
Great!

519
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,530
Join us, Miyuki!

520
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,300
It's stupid! The ESP Force...

521
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,070
Well, you masturbated!

522
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,410
Let's do this. We're the Force!

523
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,280
We're a unit. And masturbation is OK.

524
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,410
Hey! Come back!

525
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,250
I feel so psyched now!

526
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,060
I have my X-ray vision.

527
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,960
I'll protect this town!

528
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,090
I'm not just a wanker.

529
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,900
You only move sex-toys!

530
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,060
No, I can do this too.

531
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,640
Stop it!

532
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,340
You're erotic enough for me.

533
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,810
I like it!

534
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,010
A white bra!

535
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,120
I'll teleport myself and hug you!

536
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,860
Go, Enomoto!

537
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,290
We'll fight together.

538
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,620
Right. Go, ESP Force!

539
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,050
Me, too!

540
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,190
And me.

541
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,960
Do I have to work with these people?

542
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:56,770
What's going to happen to me?

543
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,640
I don't want to be with them.

544
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,980
"Beware of gropers"

545
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,620
Where are some real girls?

546
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,190
Come on!

547
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,590
Here's one.

548
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,900
"We skip hand in hand! La-la-la."

549
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,570
"La-la-la, duckies"

550
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,730
"Quack!"

551
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,710
"La-la-la, and goats too!"

552
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,110
"Baa!"

553
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,450
The ferry skipper.

554
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,040
You want to come with me?

555
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,150
We'll have tea.

556
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,900
You're so pretty!

557
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,110
Oh, this is so nice...

558
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:04,780
- Yoshiro's always watching me.
- He's creepy.

559
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,280
I bet he jerks off to you, Sae.

560
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,720
Your dad's cool!

561
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,190
- You think?
- Sure!

562
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,600
Look at her...

563
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,780
She's divine.

564
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,950
"ESP Party"

565
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,880
A party?

566
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,390
We should be fighting crime!

567
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,500
Hello.

568
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,990
I'm from a local bar. You have ESP?

569
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,420
Yes.

570
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,230
I brought you food.

571
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,230
We're psychics!

572
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,140
Open up, Baby.

573
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,820
I'll keep this town safe!

574
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,010
Enomoto!

575
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,590
I love you!

576
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,790
What's ESP anyway? A superpower?

577
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,330
Are you psychics?

578
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,030
Yes.

579
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,830
You're the talk of town!

580
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,100
Oh?

581
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,000
- You have ESP powers?
- We sure do.

582
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,340
Yummy noodles!

583
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:48,210
Your mouth is so erotic!

584
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,850
Watch!

585
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,320
See, one hand!

586
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,750
Look at me!

587
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,130
I'm here!

588
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,000
And here.

589
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,910
Over here!

590
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,050
And here.

591
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,150
Amazing!

592
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,050
What's good about it?

593
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,590
It's a miracle I found you, Sae...

594
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,960
A miracle!

595
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,240
Gimme a break.

596
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,310
I want to have sex!

597
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,920
I want sex, too!

598
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,470
I want sex! I want sex!

599
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,300
Sex!

600
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,840
Stop, virgins!

601
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,070
She's right!

602
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,750
I want sex!

603
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,050
Dumb psychics...

604
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,910
Perverts!

605
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,310
Sae, no!

606
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:12,460
Don't worry, Yoshiro...

607
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,600
Never mind.

608
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,100
My destiny girl...

609
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,400
I'm sure it's Sae.

610
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,160
I'll try harder as a psychic to protect her.

611
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:32,010
I dream about the girl of my destiny.

612
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,720
In fragmented images.

613
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,020
Of the place we'd meet.

614
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,960
Her waving hand.

615
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,560
Her legs running to me.

616
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,660
Holding hands as we run together.

617
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,540
Her hand on mine.

618
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,700
And we kiss.

619
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,950
It's the same details every time.

620
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,560
Stop talking about erections.

621
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,070
Get serious!

622
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,640
We're psychics!

623
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,210
You're a hero.

624
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,290
Mr. Asami. I'm Detective Mitsui.

625
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,630
I'm Taeko, a reporter.

626
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,860
- My assistant, Ms. Akiyama.
- Hello.

627
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,090
This way.

628
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,540
- You're here!
- What is it?

629
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,670
I can't describe it so please

630
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,640
come and look.

631
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,940
What the...

632
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,710
Are they real?

633
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,470
Security found them. They're dolls.

634
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,890
This is a challenge to my psychics.

635
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,810
It appears to be some kind of aphrodisiac.

636
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:37,900
Akiyama.

637
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,380
- Take a sample.
- Yes.

638
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,480
No!

639
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,420
Don't touch it like that...

640
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,520
Something's going on in Yoshiro's classroom.

641
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,760
Akiyama.

642
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,230
Don't tell Yoshiro about this.

643
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,800
It might be the enemy psychic.

644
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:03,830
Right...

645
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:08,970
Professor!

646
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,610
It's so late to be running, Yoshiro.

647
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,630
Just in case I have to save the world.

648
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,580
- I see.
- And to protect Sae.

649
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:21,980
Thank you.

650
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,260
Sae!

651
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,560
Thank you!

652
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,720
"The Sex Pistols did not sing love songs"

653
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,800
"To my ears they were
screaming Love and Peace"

654
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:46,150
"The papers don't write about those places"

655
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:53,540
"But they can't ignore those smiles and tears"

656
00:44:53,540 --> 00:45:00,760
"50 nuke power plants
5000 earthquakes a year"

657
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,320
"Our lives are blowin' in the wind"

658
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,240
"So take it easy, kid"

659
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,510
"They think you're a pushover"

660
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,580
"Yell so your voice's heard"

661
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:22,310
"Power to the people. Show me
how to break the silence"

662
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,260
So you were born in Toyohashi, Sae!

663
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,870
We soon moved to Tokyo.

664
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:32,590
You were born at Toyohashi hospital!

665
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:35,860
I knew it! Sae and I met in the womb.

666
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,000
Sae is the girl of my destiny.

667
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,750
She must be!

668
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:47,370
Yoshiro's babbling again.

669
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,680
- He's creepy.
- He's mental.

670
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,460
- Watch out when you walk home.
- For perverts!

671
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,210
Don't scare me!

672
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,490
Good morning.

673
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:10,830
We have a new teacher starting today.

674
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,600
Be quiet.

675
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,590
Class, pay attention.

676
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,700
Come in.

677
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:32,810
Meet your new English teacher.
Aiko Polnareff from USA.

678
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,980
Nice to meet you, I'm Ms. Polnareff.

679
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,630
A babe teacher like in the DVD!

680
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,030
Shut up!

681
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,030
I teach English but more importantly...

682
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,610
What?

683
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,400
Earth is in a crisis.

684
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,490
People have lost hope.

685
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,870
We need Eros in our hearts.

686
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,380
To fill this town with love.

687
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,510
Embrace love and be erotic.

688
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:16,080
Come to school in your swimsuits!

689
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,050
Swimsuits?

690
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,790
Pardon me...

691
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,090
This is important.

692
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,920
Wear bondage gear or a swimsuit tomorrow.

693
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,370
Do you feel love in the air?

694
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,540
You like her?

695
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,140
Yoshiro.

696
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:49,210
Ma'am.

697
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,510
Don't call me that.

698
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,990
Excuse me?

699
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,050
You think Sae's the girl of your destiny?

700
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:02,500
Ma'am?

701
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,620
Kiss me.

702
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,090
You're my destiny, you understand?

703
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,210
Your destiny.

704
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,250
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

705
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,650
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

706
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,190
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.

707
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:39,720
And summer's lease hath all too short a date.

708
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,000
What is it?

709
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,210
The Tokyo lab's looking at it.

710
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:58,750
It's something beyond us.

711
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,390
The components aren't from this Earth.

712
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:04,550
- Meaning?
- I don't know.

713
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,590
Maybe something psychic?

714
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,170
No, it's dangerous!

715
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,810
It might be part of the evil psychics' plan.

716
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,050
Something is going on.

717
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,020
What about my boobs?

718
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,080
And mine.

719
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,590
I only have eyes for hers.

720
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,840
I love pretty high school girls!

721
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,570
Off we go! See you later!

722
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,400
Off we go! See you later!

723
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,040
Bon Voyage, my pretty ones.

724
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:09,550
Rain...

725
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,150
She's next.

726
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,270
It's Toyocky!

727
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:34,210
Toyocky, I can't resist you!

728
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,180
Toyocky!

729
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,920
Toyocky!

730
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,860
I love Toyocky, the city's mascot!

731
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,230
Toyohashi's mascot!

732
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,330
Toyocky!

733
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,210
See you later!

734
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:50,890
She's insanely pretty.

735
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:08,270
Game over.

736
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,770
Not in the mood?

737
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,850
What's wrong?

738
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,950
Low libido today?

739
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,690
I'm not driven by libido...

740
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:24,890
You are!

741
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,950
OK, I am.

742
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,400
But to be a psychic hero...

743
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:38,190
I have to control my horny fantasies!

744
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,260
That's nonsense.

745
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:44,240
Here, 2 free balls.

746
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:50,170
I want to jerk off...

747
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,580
That's my boy!

748
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,290
Hi. I'm totally drenched.

749
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,390
Got a shirt?

750
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,330
Miyuki...

751
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,560
Here, before you catch a cold.

752
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:14,170
Yoshiro, I know you like her.

753
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,200
What? No, I don't!

754
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm going.

755
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,720
And you like Yoshiro, too.

756
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,520
Of course not.

757
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:30,580
Don't be shy!

758
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,190
Shut up!

759
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,520
Why are you coming?

760
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,680
I have to check out your sexy teacher.

761
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:18,620
Yoshiro.

762
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,090
What's up?

763
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,890
Uh... nothing!

764
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,170
You made me hard, okay?

765
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,600
I made you hard?

766
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,070
No!

767
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,350
They look so sexy!

768
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:52,880
This is the epicenter for erections!

769
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,430
You're too uptight.

770
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:00,400
Put more Eros into it.

771
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,230
Hi, Yoshiro.

772
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,470
Ms. Polnareff!

773
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,870
You're Teru.

774
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,370
Telekinesis.

775
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,140
You're Miyuki.

776
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,020
Telepathy.

777
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,390
How do you know?

778
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,190
Are you a psychic too?

779
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,170
I have an ability to see people's memories.

780
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:40,470
I'm delighted to meet you.

781
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:48,100
Hello, class!

782
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,910
We'll start with

783
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:55,480
erotic sex education today.

784
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,180
Way to go, teacher!

785
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,120
Get a hard-on.

786
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,400
Get a hard-on.

787
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,330
I want to jerk off...

788
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,240
Hard-on, hard-on.

789
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,340
No!

790
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,830
Oh my God! Please!

791
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,310
I'm hot!

792
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,620
Come to Daddy, girls!

793
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:34,020
What's going on?

794
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,360
Eros. Love is spurting everywhere.

795
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,420
Sir!

796
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,230
- You're in panties!
- Too sexy.

797
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:46,690
Please, you have to come. It's too erotic!

798
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:51,570
Love and Eros in Toyohashi!

799
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:56,180
Make love hotels free!

800
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:02,750
Nudist beaches at Toyohashi!

801
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:06,690
Say "Yes" to the sex industry!

802
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:11,030
Love and Eros in Toyohashi!

803
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:13,620
You're surrounded!

804
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,400
Resistance is futile!

805
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,330
We want nudist beaches!

806
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,900
Listen to me!

807
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,110
- Detective Mitsui.
- Professor.

808
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,640
How are things?

809
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,110
Cosplayers and girls
in swimsuits took hostages.

810
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,550
- Another erotic crime!
- Their demands?

811
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,350
They want to talk to the mayor. Look at this.

812
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,490
- "Love and Eros"?
- And Toyohashi's independence.

813
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,860
Say "Yes" to the sex industry!

814
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:47,260
- They want a sex empire?
- It's outrageous.

815
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,900
Who are they?

816
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,740
We know they're sexy cosplayers.

817
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:57,170
We don't know their numbers
or if they're armed.

818
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:01,440
We can't use force on such pretty girls.

819
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,810
They're armed with Tenga.

820
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:07,180
I'll negotiate with them.

821
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,320
Are you sure?

822
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,620
They'd be more willing to talk to a civilian.

823
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,850
I am Professor Asami!

824
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:23,170
I'm here to talk.

825
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,790
Hold it!

826
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:38,050
Agree to our terms!

827
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,050
Now!

828
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,420
What do you want?

829
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,490
We want to live the way humans should!

830
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:50,120
First we need to be sexually liberated!

831
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:54,800
So that we'll survive Armageddon!

832
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,540
Who's behind this? What is Armageddon?

833
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,530
They won't answer.

834
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,700
Because they're my servants.

835
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,580
We'll start a war to protect our world!

836
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:15,320
So you're behind this. Are you a psychic?

837
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,950
Yes. Guess what I did that night.

838
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:27,630
Professor, why did you get psychics
to protect the town?

839
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,900
To stop people like you.

840
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,540
- Why protect greedy humans?
- Stop this!

841
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:39,910
Don't you remember being mistreated
by those bastards

842
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,350
who mocked your ESP research?

843
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,180
You can't trick me.

844
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:48,620
Don't you wish they died?

845
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,520
- Don't abuse your power.
- Shut up.

846
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,990
Release the hostages. I'll get the police

847
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:56,990
to go easy on you.

848
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,360
She's right.

849
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:03,090
This conversation is going nowhere.

850
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,090
I'll have to kill you!

851
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,400
Strip them all naked!

852
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,940
Look out!

853
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,210
Clean up!

854
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,590
Where is she?

855
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,360
Is she here?

856
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,970
She's gone.

857
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,530
I'll find her.

858
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,650
What's going on?

859
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,380
This is awesome!

860
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,510
It's getting sombre!

861
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,080
I must hurry!

862
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:28,420
Things are strange all over town.

863
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,350
Such as?

864
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:33,420
The bank was robbed yesterday

865
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:37,450
by women wearing sexy swimsuits.

866
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:40,890
Before they left, they danced.

867
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,460
- Danced?
- Yes. Like go-go dancers.

868
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,830
That's kind of old...

869
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,500
What did they steal?

870
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:56,380
Actually they took nothing.

871
01:01:56,610 --> 01:02:01,210
- And...
- On the roof of Pachinko USA

872
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,780
there was a striptease.

873
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,090
Akiyama.

874
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,830
A psychic is behind this.

875
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:19,560
Someone powerful enough to destroy
this town and the world.

876
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,240
- You heard about the groper?
- Yoshiro?

877
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,600
Possible!

878
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,540
- Let's look inside.
- Yeah!

879
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,800
Guys, stop!

880
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:33,570
Hey!

881
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,000
- OK, I'm spooked!
- Oh, my God!

882
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,090
Hey!

883
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,860
Sae?

884
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:52,430
Yes...

885
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,400
- Your dad's a professor?
- May I help you?

886
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,810
Now you're mine!

887
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:44,550
Evil psychics... How dumb.

888
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:48,850
We can't save the world on our own.

889
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:52,830
Help us find the evil psychic tomorrow.

890
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,300
Skipper!

891
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:31,600
Sae's not back.

892
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,970
She's never this late.

893
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,670
Maybe something happened to her?

894
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,880
She might be making out with someone.

895
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:49,050
I can't reach Miyuki either.

896
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,290
Hi, psychics!

897
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,050
What's wrong?

898
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,130
Sae is missing.

899
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:02,830
Sae? I saw her coming home.

900
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,230
What's wrong?

901
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:31,820
"The immoral incident at the high school
is a prelude"

902
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:35,600
"to something even worse."

903
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,720
This is Taeko.

904
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,720
Keep this out of the papers, OK?

905
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:10,270
We want to keep the bad guys guessing.

906
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,320
Okay.

907
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,500
I'm not feeling myself today...

908
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,870
What's wrong, Hon?

909
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,410
Sorry?

910
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,050
You feel the itch?

911
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,250
Yes.

912
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:31,890
Where does it itch, Hon?

913
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,390
- Everywhere.
- Oh my!

914
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,660
I feel restless...

915
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,670
The town is changing.

916
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,630
I am too...

917
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:00,180
I have erotic thoughts

918
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,720
circling in my head.

919
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,460
Hot, Hon?

920
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:14,530
- Burning!
- That hot?

921
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,770
- Taking that off too?
- I'm aroused!

922
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:20,530
You are?

923
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:29,000
Relieve me, dinosaur!

924
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,810
Miyuki didn't come.

925
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:45,160
Not Saya too!

926
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,790
Hi, Yoshiro.

927
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,630
Where will we find the evil psychics?

928
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:54,600
It's kind of a drag.

929
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,240
But I like the skimpy new town.

930
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:59,810
Yeah.

931
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:03,180
But it's tiring having a nonstop hard-on.

932
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:07,710
I guess I'm a little impotent...

933
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:14,320
I'm always rock hard!

934
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:21,300
Cut the hard-on talk. This is an investigation.

935
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,660
I can't work.

936
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:29,400
- The town's gone weird.
- Who can work?

937
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:35,170
- Look at us.
- We're working.

938
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:39,510
Oh no!

939
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:40,810
What's wrong?

940
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:46,710
A man's value isn't just in his penis.

941
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:52,190
Ma'am...

942
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:56,560
If Sae's in danger I have to save her!

943
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,830
What's this number?

944
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:06,310
Hello?

945
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:09,800
Yoshiro, it's me, Sae.

946
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:13,580
What?

947
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,550
Nothing. I'll look over there!

948
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,150
What's going on?

949
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:21,120
You going to jack off?

950
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:27,990
I know this place from...

951
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:30,860
My dream!

952
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,670
My destiny!

953
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,470
This is the place!

954
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:50,550
I know she'll appear from over there!

955
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:51,950
Hey!

956
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,580
That hand!

957
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,790
Those legs!

958
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,590
She's singing!

959
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:08,960
It's me!

960
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:14,580
- Sae.
- Sorry to drag you away.

961
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,170
No problem. What's up?

962
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:22,250
Are you helping Dad with his research?

963
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,180
Just a little.

964
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,490
Thank you!

965
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:32,530
Researching ESP is dumb!

966
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:34,690
We get mocked about it.

967
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:38,030
Life's been hard for her...

968
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:44,070
I'm happy you're on Dad's side.

969
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,340
I'd do anything for your dad.

970
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:50,870
Yoshiro.

971
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,760
If you want more we can go to a hotel.

972
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,450
A hotel?

973
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,600
You can do what you want.

974
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,990
Make love to me.

975
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:21,440
Wow, she's pushy!

976
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:24,480
I thought she'd be shy.

977
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,450
Hey.

978
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,840
Let's have sex.

979
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,840
Until we drop.

980
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:36,220
Sorry! I'm not ready...

981
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,360
Clean up!

982
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:43,830
Are you okay?

983
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,600
But Sae...

984
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:14,630
Sae...

985
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:19,010
She seduced me like a stranger.

986
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:22,060
What's going on?

987
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:26,770
Explain! You, explain, OK?

988
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:32,610
All people Eros! So amorous!

989
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:34,280
And... doll!

990
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,330
Doll!

991
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:38,320
That's not your daughter.

992
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,960
- It's a copy.
- What?

993
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,160
You speak Japanese!

994
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:47,120
- A copy?
- Yes. That means she's alive.

995
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,630
This is crazy!

996
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,860
It's OK.

997
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,130
You see... I purified her soul.

998
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:56,140
I can get rid of evil thoughts.

999
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,170
Purify...

1000
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:03,510
She became a sex doll
because copies don't have souls.

1001
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,480
Did you put those sex dolls at the school?

1002
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:08,380
Yes.

1003
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,610
Who are you?

1004
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:13,680
My name is Julie Babcock.

1005
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,790
I'm a psychic from Duluth.

1006
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:18,850
Duluth!

1007
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:29,200
I thought they all died.

1008
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:32,570
In the Duluth Massacre.

1009
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,170
A few survived and went into hiding.

1010
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,150
So you're a descendant.

1011
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,910
Is ESP hereditary?

1012
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,750
Maybe it's in your DNA.

1013
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:49,020
Why did you come to Japan?

1014
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:53,450
To prevent another tragedy like Duluth.

1015
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,560
The enemy can duplicate people.

1016
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,990
Their numbers will get out of control.

1017
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,500
Yes?

1018
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,610
Lots of girls are being kidnapped.

1019
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,480
- Where?
- At the ferry hut.

1020
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,150
The famous groper spot.

1021
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:16,670
That place! Is something going on?

1022
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:17,650
Yes.

1023
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:19,780
Me?

1024
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,630
You'd pass as a girl in a uniform and a wig.

1025
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:29,010
A disguise? I could do it.

1026
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:33,570
No. You're too old.

1027
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:36,800
Leave it to me. I'll be sexy.

1028
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,470
Yoshiro.

1029
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,300
Don't you want to protect Sae?

1030
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:14,170
Would the evil psychic fall for this...

1031
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,330
Damn!

1032
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:48,180
- Who was that?
- The enemy.

1033
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,880
I'd be cuter!

1034
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:53,050
What will she do?

1035
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,410
She's going to the city hall.

1036
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,110
Let's go!

1037
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:31,090
"City Hall"

1038
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:33,280
That was close!

1039
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:06,590
What's this?

1040
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,380
Only girls!

1041
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,090
Kamiya abducted them all.

1042
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:19,000
She made copies of them to eroticize Toyohashi.

1043
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,750
That's what happened to Sae!

1044
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,640
She must be here.

1045
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:26,300
Hey!

1046
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:28,370
It's Sae!

1047
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,040
Wait!

1048
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,170
Dad!

1049
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:37,340
Sae...

1050
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,850
Dad.

1051
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:41,660
Dad.

1052
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,090
There are 3 of her!

1053
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:46,840
Yabe!

1054
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,200
Check her organs with X-ray vision.

1055
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,460
Wow. Sure?

1056
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:01,870
They're hollow!

1057
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,350
Damn! They're copies!

1058
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:05,340
Right.

1059
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:08,310
I made them.

1060
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,480
Yoshiro.

1061
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:18,990
Yoshiro.

1062
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:20,450
Yoshiro.

1063
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,160
Yoshiro.

1064
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,670
Nobody gets in our way.

1065
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:31,900
Japan's the worst!

1066
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:35,060
All greed and malice.

1067
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,340
Who are you?

1068
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,540
Clean up!

1069
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:41,150
It was you!

1070
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,050
I'll stop you!

1071
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:46,950
Let's get along.

1072
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:48,650
Let's get along.

1073
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,760
Let's get along.

1074
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,100
Let's get along.

1075
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,990
Let's get along.

1076
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:58,020
Let's get along.

1077
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:05,910
Let's get along.

1078
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:08,530
They're hollow! All hollow!

1079
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:09,640
This way!

1080
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,350
OK, girls!

1081
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:12,940
Don't!

1082
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,980
On the stage.

1083
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:28,020
OK...

1084
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:42,500
Yoshiro, we're finally alone.

1085
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:48,500
Not now, Ma'am!

1086
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,420
Not here!

1087
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,150
Please don't!

1088
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:59,960
Hey, what the...

1089
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,460
What's this?

1090
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,160
What's going on?

1091
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,460
What the hell? Somebody, help!

1092
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:27,010
No...

1093
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,250
Shit.

1094
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,720
Yoshiro?

1095
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:45,000
Sae?

1096
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:46,940
Are you OK?

1097
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:50,380
I'm OK. Did you come to rescue me?

1098
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:51,640
Yes.

1099
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:54,670
But...

1100
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:59,380
I'm locked up in here.

1101
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,190
What do they want with us?

1102
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,620
I don't know.

1103
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,290
Yoshiro.

1104
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:12,490
Yes?

1105
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,460
Will they...

1106
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,570
kill us?

1107
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:25,510
What have I done?

1108
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:32,950
It's my fault...

1109
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,490
I mean...

1110
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:41,820
I never wanted ESP powers...

1111
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,560
Don't act like a sissy!

1112
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,340
Miyuki?

1113
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:01,350
Yes.

1114
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,850
Why are you being a wimp?

1115
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:08,520
Miyuki was also captured.

1116
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,280
Yoshiro!

1117
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:15,700
We can read people's thoughts.

1118
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:19,530
But...

1119
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,670
Nothing...

1120
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:29,110
Nothing good came of that!

1121
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:35,110
Are you crying, Miyuki?

1122
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:39,310
Of course not.

1123
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,720
I'm scared...

1124
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:58,730
OK.

1125
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,870
Someone will rescue us.

1126
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,580
I'm sure somebody will find us.

1127
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,060
Sae? It's the song...

1128
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:26,300
What?

1129
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:29,240
What did you say?

1130
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:30,930
Is it...

1131
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:33,540
Miyuki?

1132
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,500
What?

1133
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:40,980
You called me?

1134
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:45,040
What's that song, Miyuki?

1135
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:49,380
It popped in my head.

1136
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:54,060
I wanted to sing it.

1137
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,960
It's a song I used to know...

1138
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:06,440
I know that song.

1139
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:08,110
You do?

1140
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:11,900
Because you taught it to me.

1141
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:18,280
Before we were born, back in the womb.

1142
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:21,750
Can you hear me?

1143
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,110
Yes, I can!

1144
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:30,620
We said, "When we are born
we'll find each other."

1145
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,970
It was our secret code!

1146
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,170
It's our song!

1147
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,010
I found you.

1148
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,290
Thanks

1149
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,310
for finding me.

1150
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:02,300
Hey!

1151
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:12,860
Hey!

1152
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,330
I waited for you.

1153
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,720
Me too.

1154
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,190
For a long time.

1155
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,470
So long...

1156
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,270
I'm happy.

1157
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:47,100
Me too.

1158
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,140
I'm so happy!

1159
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:56,880
I don't know how to describe it.

1160
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:08,890
Come on!

1161
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,700
Wait!

1162
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:00,850
How come you never noticed me?

1163
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,910
Why didn't you notice me?

1164
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:09,950
Sorry.

1165
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:13,360
You were always on my mind!

1166
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,120
Sorry.

1167
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,700
Every minute of my life.

1168
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,270
Sorry I didn't notice.

1169
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:28,600
I've always loved you.

1170
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,440
Me too.

1171
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:54,560
I forgive you.

1172
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,070
Sorry!

1173
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:01,630
Forgiven.

1174
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:04,870
Thank you.

1175
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:14,310
Stand up.

1176
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:41,820
I love you.

1177
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,590
I love you too.

1178
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:49,420
Forever.

1179
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:13,050
I taught that song to Miyuki.

1180
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:14,740
It's my memory.

1181
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:23,790
You lost, Kamiya!

1182
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:25,980
I couldn't have...

1183
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:30,560
This is what you get for abusing your power.

1184
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,270
Is it so wrong?

1185
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:37,040
People looked down on me and ignored me.

1186
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:41,710
The copies listen to me now
because God gave me powers.

1187
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:44,910
We all have our problems!

1188
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:46,910
Exactly!

1189
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:49,320
Are we going to get her?

1190
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:54,120
This isn't over. The Master's coming!

1191
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,090
Who?

1192
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:59,160
The Master will bring a New World Order!

1193
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,300
You rotten psychics will perish!

1194
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,560
The Master?

1195
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:04,500
Master...

1196
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:06,630
Polnareff!

1197
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,370
I taught her the song. Got it?

1198
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:13,110
I'm the girl of your destiny.

1199
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:14,940
Not them.

1200
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:17,340
I am your destiny.

1201
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,120
Help me, Yoshiro!

1202
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,220
Yoshiro, help!

1203
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:27,190
Yoshiro!

1204
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:30,210
Sae! Miyuki!

1205
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,330
Are you two okay?

1206
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:35,640
Sae! Miyuki!

1207
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:39,460
Ms. Polnareff is the ringleader?

1208
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,560
Clean up!

1209
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,910
What was I doing?

1210
01:30:53,810 --> 01:31:00,250
"Under the blue sky
Toyohashi is so beautiful"

1211
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:03,050
She was Polnareff's puppet...

1212
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:09,160
Reading people's memories is not
Polnareff's only ability.

1213
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:13,460
She controls people's memories.

1214
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:19,670
She deletes, rewrites and transplants memories.

1215
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:23,510
She manipulates memories to suit her needs.

1216
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,820
Ms. Polnareff, it's you...

1217
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:35,020
I'm the girl of your destiny.

1218
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:38,530
Where are Miyuki and Sae?

1219
01:31:38,530 --> 01:31:40,320
Forget about them.

1220
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:43,190
Yoshiro!

1221
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:46,600
You defeated Kamiya already?

1222
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,970
Why are you doing this?

1223
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:53,140
To wipe out humanity from Earth.

1224
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:56,110
You want humans to perish?

1225
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:58,950
All humans' evil deeds...

1226
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:02,450
They violate nature and the environment

1227
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,510
and kill off wildlife.

1228
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:07,390
Before Earth is ruined

1229
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:09,950
I'll ruin humans.

1230
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:15,700
We only stock nudie magazines now.

1231
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,200
That's all you can buy.

1232
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,000
Okay!

1233
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,710
Behave, girls!

1234
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:26,500
It's okay!

1235
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,800
OK, then.

1236
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:38,950
Mitsui, you make me hot!

1237
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:40,620
Where are you hot?

1238
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:41,680
Here?

1239
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,860
There?

1240
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:46,360
Tell me where you're hot!

1241
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,530
Naughty!

1242
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:49,830
Me too! Naughty!

1243
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:52,520
Naughty!

1244
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:02,110
Everyone, get aroused!

1245
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:05,880
More and more aroused!

1246
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,820
More and more!

1247
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:11,850
I'm hot!

1248
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:19,890
Out of the way! He's mine!

1249
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,970
Mona, I'm melting.

1250
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:27,990
I love you, Yuko.

1251
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:32,640
There's no room on Earth for greedy fools.

1252
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:37,140
Only God's chosen one will stay.

1253
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:38,840
And he's here.

1254
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,810
Yoshiro, it's you.

1255
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:44,120
Him?

1256
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:45,420
Not me?

1257
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:49,720
Because I love Yoshiro.

1258
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:55,600
I can't control the memory
of someone I truly love.

1259
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,900
There's only been one person.

1260
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:04,060
You're the only one, Yoshiro.

1261
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:07,440
This is true love.

1262
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,980
We'll create a new world together!

1263
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:17,380
We'll be Adam and Eve, and start again.

1264
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:23,560
It's worse than the Duluth Massacre!

1265
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,990
Grandpa told me not to let
the Duluth Massacre be repeated.

1266
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:32,590
It's my duty as a surviving Duluth psychic!

1267
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:34,200
Julie!

1268
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:37,170
Purify that female teacher!

1269
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:38,160
Purify!

1270
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,220
What's this?

1271
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:53,820
You have no evil intentions?

1272
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:58,220
Of course not. I am pure love.

1273
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,320
Let me take your life from you.

1274
01:35:10,650 --> 01:35:11,800
Julie!

1275
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:13,510
You too!

1276
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:18,000
We'll fight back with our powers!

1277
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:21,940
Gotcha!

1278
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,940
Here goes!

1279
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:26,820
Penis!

1280
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:48,770
I erased their memories.

1281
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,000
They don't remember who they are.

1282
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,840
That's cruel...

1283
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:59,580
Yoshiro, please understand.

1284
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:03,560
You're the only man I truly love.

1285
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,290
It's our destiny.

1286
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,420
Come here.

1287
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:11,060
If you make love to me you will live.

1288
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:13,030
Or you die.

1289
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:19,260
Earth's fate depends on you.

1290
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,660
Yoshiro.

1291
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:46,890
Let's reorganize.

1292
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:50,840
- Get more psychics...
- And them?

1293
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,810
We have to stop the crisis.

1294
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:57,440
- And buy time.
- And sacrifice them?

1295
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,470
You need to live to save the world.

1296
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:05,380
The world...

1297
01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:08,040
The world... I dunno...

1298
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,960
I'm sorry.

1299
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:19,030
But I...

1300
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:23,330
I live for the girl of my destiny.

1301
01:37:25,570 --> 01:37:27,230
That's why

1302
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,240
I have to rescue her.

1303
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:41,050
Yoshiro.

1304
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:46,790
You're our only hope.

1305
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,470
Our future.

1306
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:11,510
He's here.

1307
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,950
Here he is!

1308
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:15,820
He came!

1309
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,480
Sae?

1310
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:25,570
Miyuki!

1311
01:38:25,570 --> 01:38:29,160
Rock the boat, rock the boat...

1312
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:44,270
She waves. We hold hands...

1313
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:48,790
Run. Her hand on mine.

1314
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:50,550
And kiss!

1315
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:59,150
Where's the girl of my destiny?

1316
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:05,360
Love over impurity.

1317
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:09,140
We'll be pure children again.

1318
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:13,910
Like when we met at the hospital.

1319
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:16,140
When we made a vow.

1320
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,210
No, thank you!

1321
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,890
You've seen my power.

1322
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:32,550
I can rewrite the memories of all humans.

1323
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:34,260
Go, fishy!

1324
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:39,500
Choo, choo...

1325
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:43,870
Forget the other girls. Come with me.

1326
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:48,750
To our very own world!

1327
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:51,450
No!

1328
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:57,680
I just want to jack off to fantasy girls!

1329
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:01,460
Ms. Polnareff, I can jack off to you now!

1330
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:05,300
No! I'm your girl not a plaything!

1331
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:06,960
How about you?

1332
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:10,260
Or you!

1333
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:13,770
Can't you make love to me?

1334
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:17,880
I'll jerk off to fantasy girls
until I meet the one!

1335
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:21,140
Don't!

1336
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:35,230
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

1337
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:40,400
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

1338
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:47,770
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.

1339
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:54,370
And summer's lease hath all too short a date.

1340
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,010
What's this?

1341
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:08,320
What's going on?

1342
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:10,800
What's this!

1343
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:21,070
Huh?

1344
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:35,820
What's this? How embarrassing!

1345
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:37,490
It's cold.

1346
01:41:39,490 --> 01:41:41,360
- Get away!
- You too!

1347
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:52,940
Yoshiro, wait! What do you want?

1348
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,710
I protected you.

1349
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,910
Polnareff is a liar!

1350
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:00,070
I know you're my destiny!

1351
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:04,780
Yoshiro, you have a hard-on...

1352
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,420
Sae?

1353
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,510
You pervert!

1354
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:09,450
Sae...

1355
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:13,330
You think I'm your destiny girl? No way!

1356
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:15,990
You're mean...

1357
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,300
Yoshiro.

1358
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:20,370
- Yoshiro.
- Yoshiro.

1359
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:31,410
You did well!

1360
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:33,450
Awesome!

1361
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:36,040
- Where's Sae?
- Dad!

1362
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:40,310
Thank you!

1363
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:47,190
Yeah, well...

1364
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:49,690
Great!

1365
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:51,690
Good job.

1366
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,260
No crimes today.

1367
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:23,330
Toyohashi's peaceful.

1368
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:24,460
Peace!

1369
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,860
Good morning!

1370
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:32,870
What I want in a man...

1371
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:35,900
Someone who'll spoil me.

1372
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:49,850
Peace was restored in Toyohashi
by Yoshiro, our hero.

1373
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:53,650
That night he had a peaceful dream.

1374
01:43:58,150 --> 01:44:01,290
About when he was in his mom's tummy.

1375
01:44:02,490 --> 01:44:06,090
Seeing her gently rub her big stomach

1376
01:44:06,090 --> 01:44:12,670
Yoshiro thought she could be
the woman of his destiny.

1377
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:17,430
Next morning he woke up and wiped back tears.

1378
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:20,820
- Then he ran to his mother.
- Mom!

1379
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:34,490
I love you!

1380
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:36,730
What's this?

1381
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:39,600
It's love.

1382
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:38,090
Yoshiro.

1383
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,620
I got a new DVD.

1384
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:45,440
They're amateurs so it's all real!

1385
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,380
They moan like they mean it!

1386
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:52,470
Come over and check it out.

1387
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:22,410
Found the girl of your destiny?

1388
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:49,990
The women around Yoshiro sang
the song to get his attention.

1389
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:52,830
He was puzzled.

1390
01:46:54,910 --> 01:47:00,400
He'd promised the girl of
his destiny to meet up.

1391
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:05,590
There must be only one girl...

1392
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:08,650
Why were they all singing?

1393
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:14,220
In fact on that day on the tram

1394
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:18,760
something happened at the next stop.

1395
01:47:47,630 --> 01:47:51,030
- How many months?
- Eight.

1396
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:54,900
- Same here.
- You too!

1397
01:47:57,390 --> 01:47:58,960
Can you hear me?

1398
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:01,730
Yes.

1399
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:05,180
I'm from the bookstore.

1400
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:06,780
You're 8 months?

1401
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:11,380
- I'm from the pinball arcade.
- Oh, you too!

1402
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:13,880
Do you hear me?

1403
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:15,660
How about me?

1404
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,590
I'm here too!

1405
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:27,530
Me too!

1406
01:48:27,530 --> 01:48:30,250
You're all my girls.

1407
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:31,740
Just wait.

1408
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:38,330
Me too!

1409
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:44,110
In a little corner of the universe...

1410
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:47,380
In a little corner of Earth...

1411
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:52,250
In a tiny corner of Japan...

1412
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:56,490
In a small town in Higashi Mikawa...

1413
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:59,830
In one tiny corner of town...

1414
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:07,470
Yoshiro, our hero, jacks off as usual.

1415
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:12,640
Our hero is back at square one.

1416
01:49:13,010 --> 01:49:14,810
Ready, Partner?

1417
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:21,790
Miyuki...

1418
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:25,450
No! How about...

1419
01:49:26,690 --> 01:49:27,280
No!

1420
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:32,430
After fantasizing about many girls
a thought returns to him.

1421
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:34,030
Who are you?

1422
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:11,110
This is how the world is saved.
