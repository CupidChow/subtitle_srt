1
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:33,510
The following story is fictional.

2
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:40,347
It doesn't depict any person,
place, organization or event.

3
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:04,983
Jeong Ji-hee, a fresh
actress is found dead in her room.

4
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,567
- Here he comes!
- Your comment please!
- Please look at the camera!

5
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:12,483
Police ruled it as regular suicide
and case was closed.

6
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:13,817
Out of the way!

7
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:14,900
Out of the way now!

8
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:16,531
Do you admit to taking sex bribes?

9
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,942
Jeong Ji-hee's email was found
with details on sex bribes.

10
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,567
Public demand a re-opening of the case.

11
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:27,017
"Daughter of a great Judge" Prosecutor
Kim Mi-hyeon leads the investigation.

12
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:32,692
- Do you admit to taking sex bribes?
- Do you admit to taking sex bribes?!

13
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:36,583
Choi Cheol-soo / film director
Indicted: Case misconduct

14
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:39,442
Cha Jeong-hyeok / CEO Kovest Entertainment
Indicted: Case violence.

15
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:43,317
- Mr President, do you admit to taking sex bribes?

16
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:44,307
- Get him out of here! Quickly!

17
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:47,408
Hyeon Seong-bong / CEO and President of Hankuk Daily
Charged: Aiding and abetting the violence.

18
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:50,275
- Mr President, do you admit to taking sex bribes?

19
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:59,520
NORIAGE

20
00:02:23,858 --> 00:03:00,217
*Missing subs, alternate opening.*

21
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:04,024
How did you get this document?

22
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:07,791
After the funeral,
I received it by post.

23
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:10,260
Who sent it to you?

24
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,100
Well, the name and
the address was fake.

25
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:14,938
So I don't know who it was from.

26
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:17,501
What did you do after you received it?

27
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:21,845
I double-checked if the email address
belonged to Cha Jeong-hyeok,

28
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:24,911
and went to the bar where
they threw a drinks party,

29
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:27,113
then interviewed the owner lady

30
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:31,717
and then checked the CCTV.
I confirmed the information was true.

31
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:37,060
That night, you gave out the news
in your TV show Reporter's Notes?

32
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,894
Yes.

33
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:43,688
Your honor, I offer into evidence
a copy of the email correspondence

34
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:48,034
that the deceased sent
to defendant Cha before her death.

35
00:03:58,074 --> 00:03:59,917
It is received in evidence.

36
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:07,050
Mr. Cha. For sure you're a monster.

37
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,895
Last time, I put up with all the nasty
things that director Choi did to me

38
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:15,903
and I even had to fall into the casting
couch to get the part in his movie.

39
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:21,838
And you saw it too last night...
what Mr. Hyeon did to me.

40
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:26,946
You said, if I quit, you won't let
me work in this business again.

41
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,948
Well, bring it on.

42
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:33,248
I wrote down every name
that I served so far.

43
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:37,815
If you don't let me go,
I'll go to the police with my diary.

44
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:41,172
Where is this diary?

45
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,076
I couldn't find it.

46
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,180
You may cross-examine,
counsel.

47
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:54,218
You have been charged
with defamation

48
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:57,282
from the defendants
in this court. Correct?

49
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,323
Yes, it's a civil action.

50
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:01,194
Aren't you defending your
clients for that case too?

51
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:04,393
Witness. Address your
answers yes or no.

52
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:08,929
I gather that lawsuit is to
give grounds for this one.

53
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:11,302
Rephrase your answer?

54
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:13,776
You want to question
my credibility for this case.

55
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,076
It's not suitable for criminal action,
so you go with civil one.

56
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:18,648
- Witness!
- Witness.

57
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:21,617
Let the court do the judgment.

58
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:23,820
Counsel, proceed.

59
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:30,691
With regards to your report,
how many lawsuits are filed?

60
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:33,108
I think that's
irrelevant to this case.

61
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:36,399
Objection, your honor.
Relevance.

62
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,937
I'm asking about the
credibility of the witness.

63
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,416
Overruled.
The witness must answer.

64
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:49,853
34 in total.
I lost none of them.

65
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:59,366
You lost the case in relation to the report
about tax corruption of National Tax Service.

66
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:04,998
I was charged with contempt
referring civil servants as tax-fed pigs.

67
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:06,700
The court partially ruled for the plaintiff.

68
00:06:06,763 --> 00:06:08,071
But you said you never lost a case.

69
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:12,011
The judge ordered to change
the charges and to pay the fine.

70
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:15,014
But the report turned out true so the
civil officials all got disciplinary action --

71
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:16,142
Your honor.

72
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:21,349
The witness has been dismissed
from TV station he worked for.

73
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:24,722
That was a wrongful dismissal.
I'm fighting for that in the court.

74
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:29,355
I guess we're done here.

75
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:31,023
Do you have further questions?

76
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:32,362
No, your honor.

77
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:34,558
No.

78
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,500
Witness, you may
leave the witness box.

79
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,903
- ls witness Go Da-ryeong present?
- No, she isn't.

80
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:47,315
Order in the court.

81
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:52,977
Do you still want her to
testify as your witness?

82
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:57,549
She was an A-list actress
the defendant represented.

83
00:06:57,614 --> 00:07:01,255
And she was at the drinks
party with Defendant Hyeon.

84
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:04,332
I'll make her present for the next hearing.

85
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:07,200
Okay.

86
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,933
Counsel. Your client will he be
present for the next hearing?

87
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:16,909
I'll make sure he will.

88
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:24,854
You've become a prosecutor
just like your father.

89
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:27,687
I'm so proud of you.

90
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:30,422
How's your work?

91
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,192
You didn't want to see
me for this small chat.

92
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,608
You' re right.

93
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:45,520
Dear. About president Hyeon.
Just drop the charges.

94
00:07:47,077 --> 00:07:49,956
You've humiliated him
enough already.

95
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,695
We're not supposed to
meet outside the court

96
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:58,925
and discuss about the case.

97
00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:05,501
We both know.
You can't win this case.

98
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:13,672
We have evidence, the CCTV footage.

99
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,076
You should deal with it first
and talk me down.

100
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:26,223
The evidence can be
something or nothing.

101
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:31,286
It's you who can make
something to nothing

102
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,956
or the other way around.

103
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:37,129
That's the power you've got.

104
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:43,334
Do you really think people will think
that CCTV evidence is nothing?

105
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:47,674
They're not in the court.
We are.

106
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:50,043
You just can't ignore
what others think.

107
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:52,981
Don't you get it?

108
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,418
Just one stupid actress.
What's the big deal?

109
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:14,567
It can't be -- because of -- [??] no?

110
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,164
Hello. How's Mirin?

111
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:25,365
How's Mirin?

112
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:27,269
Mirin? Do you even care?

113
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:28,843
Come on. Not again.

114
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:30,002
You promised.

115
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:34,343
You will keep a low profile
until the court ruling.

116
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:37,475
Now you're working
for the mobile news?

117
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:39,884
And why did you bring my
nephew into your mess?

118
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:42,354
I'm falling out with
my sister because of you!

119
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:46,485
You mean Jintae?
He's doing great.

120
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,993
Yeah, right.

121
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:51,698
Living apart is
bad enough already.

122
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:53,433
You're being so selfish.

123
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:56,593
No more excuses.
Come to us.

124
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,469
Have you thought
about our daughter?

125
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:00,166
Okay, I'll think it over.

126
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:01,698
What's more to think?

127
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:04,176
If you keep doing this.
I want a divorce.

128
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:06,805
- This is not a marriage.
- Hello? Honey?

129
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:10,450
- This is not a family.
- You're breaking up. I'll call you later.

130
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:12,282
- Don '2' you dare hang up on me!
- I'll call you back.

131
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:14,355
Uncle.

132
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:16,656
We've got company.

133
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:20,425
They've been following us
since we left Seoul.

134
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:23,096
Who is it?

135
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:43,648
What?

136
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:48,089
You're catching fish not criminal.

137
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:50,556
You're scaring them away.

138
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:54,684
If you don't want help,
don't mess it up at least.

139
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:56,556
Did you get some, Bro?

140
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:01,830
- You know, her diary --
- Where's the camera?

141
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:07,374
Over there. There.

142
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:10,909
It's too far.
We can't even recognize you.

143
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:13,777
What's all this?
ls Jin with you?

144
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,649
Just interview me all at once.
No time for 2!

145
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,518
I'm not that crazy to come
along with that brat.

146
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,416
Where is it? The diary.

147
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:27,628
You came to the wrong person!

148
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:30,392
Go to the prosecutor in charge!

149
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:33,127
You are the second-in-command.

150
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:37,604
You should know everything.
Come on!

151
00:11:37,694 --> 00:11:41,767
You are scaring them away.

152
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,245
It wasn't our decision.

153
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,391
The prosecutor insisted
to indict Mr. Hyeon.

154
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:57,686
Really?

155
00:11:58,281 --> 00:12:00,727
And the Hankuk
Daily just stood by?

156
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:03,729
You know her father.

157
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:09,194
You can't ignore the power of
Supreme Court Judge.

158
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:13,002
Bro, you want me to comb
every corner of the evidence room?

159
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,476
Tell me where her diary is.

160
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:19,947
Police closed the case as a suicide.

161
00:12:20,003 --> 00:12:22,347
No crime scene preservation.
No laboratory investigation.

162
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,908
Plus, no autopsy.

163
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:29,652
Then you meddled in after the funeral.
So we reopened the investigation.

164
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:33,559
Who knows who
took the diary. Silly!

165
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:37,495
How about the sex bribe?

166
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:39,429
You got the evidence, right?

167
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:42,427
Stop messing up my fishing!

168
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:46,037
The girl's already dead.

169
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:50,272
No one would own up
to banging her!

170
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:53,205
You know how things work.

171
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:56,611
Okay. Okay.

172
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,483
Now I have to work
on another story then.

173
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:04,524
Your brother lost
out to the nominee.

174
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:06,823
I got to see him.

175
00:13:07,517 --> 00:13:15,026
If I don't get promoted this time,
I have to quit my job.

176
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,871
I'm off now.

177
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:30,909
You know that guy
Cha Jeong-hyeok.

178
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:34,883
He was charged with
a similar case 3 years ago.

179
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:40,156
Back then, he ran off abroad
until the dust settled.

180
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:45,091
That's why he's arrested this time.

181
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,893
On May 14, 2012,

182
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,130
defendant Cha Jeong-hyeok

183
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,535
came to your bar 'Inferno' with
defendant Choi Cheol-soo, correct?

184
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,070
Yes, director Choi was about
to shoot his new film.

185
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:10,900
So he came after the
meeting with the actors.

186
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:15,907
Pease stop.
Don't have feeling for me any more.

187
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:20,786
Never ever look for me.

188
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:27,428
I will break your heart.

189
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:33,292
Damn it.

190
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,031
Director, you
shouldn't do that here.

191
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:41,041
My hands must be too cold.
She's freaked out.

192
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:44,369
You're so mean, director.

193
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:46,972
No, totally accidental while dancing.

194
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:51,884
It was before Choi Cheol-soo casted
Go Da-ryeong as a female lead.

195
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:55,023
I don't know.

196
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:01,425
Witness.
On the preliminary examination,

197
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:04,898
you said you heard that
defendant asked Go

198
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:08,960
for leading role and Jeong
for supporting role.

199
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:13,006
Did I say that?

200
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:16,001
I really can't remember.

201
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:28,923
When you play the music,
the light changes in that room. Right?

202
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:30,549
Yes, it gets darker.

203
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:34,653
You said that you turned your face
when you heard the scream.

204
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:39,459
Under the dim light,
there must have been a time gap.

205
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:47,338
Did you clearly see that his hands
were under the panty of the deceased?

206
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,710
Well.

207
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:58,544
His hands accidentally
touched the body of the deceased.

208
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:01,021
That made her panic and overreact?

209
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:04,616
Objection, Your honor, leading.

210
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:07,922
Sustained. Another question.

211
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:10,121
Next question.

212
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:15,399
After she came back from bathroom,
how did she feel?

213
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:16,869
Objection.

214
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:20,237
He's asking the witness
about victim's feeling.

215
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:22,937
I rephrase the question.

216
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,773
After that,
how was the atmosphere?

217
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,841
Objection, the question
calls for an irrelevant answer.

218
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:34,683
The deceased didn't leave the room
after what happened.

219
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:41,990
So we can speculate about
her feelings from the atmosphere.

220
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:45,327
Overruled. Proceed, counsel.

221
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:48,828
I'll ask again.

222
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:53,040
After that incident,
how was the atmosphere?

223
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,807
Well, it was okay.

224
00:16:57,534 --> 00:17:01,949
It seemed she thought Choi did it to her
because he was drunk.

225
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,015
No further questions.

226
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:14,317
*Missing subs*

227
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,311
It's funny.

228
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:31,681
When I was a prosecutor, I used to
drink boilermaker to save time.

229
00:17:31,873 --> 00:17:35,480
But after I become a lawyer,
still can't live without it.

230
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:42,661
This case, what do you think?

231
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:53,238
Nothing much to say about my clients
but feel sorry for Mr. Hyeon.

232
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:54,864
Feel sorry for him?

233
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:57,304
His charges don't make sense
in the first place.

234
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:02,405
It's all about -- you know--
what people think about the law.

235
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:09,720
Back in old days, it was okay to
turn a blind eye and keep a low profile.

236
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:13,859
Till the media forgets about us
but now it doesn't work at all.

237
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:17,091
SNS crap and all.

238
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:20,598
Everybody talks all the time.

239
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:29,436
As you know --
it's a pre-judged case.

240
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:31,871
Your clients

241
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:36,575
The trial damaged their
reputation already.

242
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:44,379
But we must not hurt my client's.
Not even a scratch.

243
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:53,123
You do your best only
when you have to. Understand?

244
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:59,032
You're not going to be
lawyer forever, are you?

245
00:19:12,433 --> 00:20:04,067
*Missing subs, polite tango*

246
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:05,233
Cheers

247
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,025
Cha Jeong-hyeok used to call
his actresses to his drinks parties.

248
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:16,491
Is that right?

249
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:21,131
He did on a daily basis.

250
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:26,102
Everyone has her
duty call everyday.

251
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:28,670
But did they have to?

252
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:34,851
The more people you know,
the more jobs you get.

253
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:41,494
You can't say no to the chance
to meet producers or directors.

254
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:48,927
So... if you get to meet them,

255
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,596
do they ask you a certain favor?

256
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:55,106
Like sexual ones?

257
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,403
So you are curious about that too?

258
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:03,245
A few days ago, another
reporter asked the same thing.

259
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:07,952
Do I have to answer
that question?

260
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:14,593
Well. Don't you think
it's time to tell the truth?

261
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:18,457
Time has passed and you are
no longer in that business.

262
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:24,103
It can be helpful for young
girls who want to be in that.

263
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:31,603
Why do I have to tell
my story for them?

264
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:36,411
Will it change their mind?

265
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:39,145
I don't think so.

266
00:21:42,243 --> 00:21:45,986
My life sucks but
I've never lost my pride.

267
00:21:46,814 --> 00:21:50,785
I'm done here. I trust that
you'll edit the interview wisely.

268
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,924
Don't forget to blot out
my face and my voice.

269
00:21:57,425 --> 00:22:04,570
After all these years, I'm on TV
but I can't tell my mom, can I?

270
00:22:10,733 --> 00:23:03,525
*Missing subs*

271
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:12,212
You worked as a fashion stylist at
defendant Cha's Kovest Entertainment?

272
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:13,710
Yes.

273
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:17,620
On May 17, 2012,

274
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:24,287
you accompanied Jeong Ji-hee
to a photo studio for her profile photo.

275
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,264
Yes.

276
00:23:27,123 --> 00:23:30,297
You heard Jeong Ji-hee say, I quote

277
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:36,935
Director Choi is just like
the other bastards.

278
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:37,967
Objection.

279
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:44,114
The question is leading the witness to convey
the third-party opinion about my client.

280
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:45,850
Sustained.

281
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:49,916
On May 26, 2012.

282
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:55,520
You and Jeong Ji-he were at the sets
of defendant Choi's film.

283
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:59,900
The sex scene wasn't in the script!

284
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:04,602
I told you already.
There were some changes in the script.

285
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,470
Wonjae's wasted and
rapes Da-ryeong's friend,

286
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,375
which amplifies the conflict
between the 2 main characters.

287
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:12,378
Don't you get it?

288
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:13,675
But that doesn't make sense.

289
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,912
You had no discussion beforehand,
and you make her do this now?

290
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:19,483
- Hey! Director.

291
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:32,294
Director...

292
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,635
Who should I talk to?

293
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,166
Mr. Father?

294
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:42,207
Damn, it's humiliating.

295
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:54,280
Yes Mr Cha, it's me.

296
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,417
Listen.

297
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:01,021
We changed the story a little.

298
00:25:02,051 --> 00:25:04,531
We want Ji-hee to
do the sex scene.

299
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,402
Why?

300
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:14,203
Did you just ask why?

301
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,768
God damn it!
Cause it's necessary!

302
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:23,475
I'll put her on.

303
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,982
Here. Take it!

304
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:35,988
Why is it so damn
hard to make a movie?

305
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:44,899
Yes, Mr Cha?

306
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:52,270
But this is too much.

307
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:41,725
Director Choi thought Ji-hee
was a yes girl who took her clothes off easily.

308
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:49,865
I took her home and left.

309
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:52,205
But I forgot my car key
so I went back in.

310
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:16,524
Why are you back?

311
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:18,726
Forgot the car key.

312
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:20,462
Didn't you hear the doorbell?

313
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:22,866
No, I was distracted.

314
00:27:33,407 --> 00:27:36,047
What... Hey...

315
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:41,059
It's not what you think.
Don't. Stop.

316
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:43,186
Spit it out. Now.

317
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,560
Spit it out.

318
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:13,048
Why didn't you
tell me last time?

319
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:19,094
You didn't ask.

320
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:21,789
Did you tell Mr. Cha about this?

321
00:28:22,823 --> 00:28:26,202
No. She didn't let me.

322
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,796
You should've told him.

323
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:30,842
Taking care of her personal life
is your job too.

324
00:28:34,702 --> 00:28:36,545
Get off. Now.

325
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,382
What's the point of telling him?

326
00:28:54,722 --> 00:28:58,693
She ended her life as a last resort
to get away from Mr. Cha.

327
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,233
Him and big shots
who harassed her.

328
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:08,270
All those devils are still alive.

329
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:14,351
You know who those devils are?

330
00:29:16,844 --> 00:29:19,188
No.
I don't.

331
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:26,726
I gotta go now.

332
00:29:27,021 --> 00:29:30,332
Okay. Ah, well..

333
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:35,164
Wait. One last question.

334
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:41,343
You were the first
who found her dead.

335
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:47,209
Did you see her diary?

336
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:52,021
No, I didn't.

337
00:29:55,582 --> 00:29:58,961
Okay. Take care, bye.

338
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:00,859
Thanks.

339
00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:34,324
Will you just stop?

340
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:37,627
Why would I?
It's getting more fun now.

341
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:42,270
Find the dead bitch's diary.
What's the point?

342
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:44,568
Watch your mouth, man.

343
00:30:45,532 --> 00:30:49,207
We couldn't find it,
neither did the prosecutor.

344
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:51,582
What makes you think you can?

345
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:55,043
If I did, it will be fun.
Don't you think?

346
00:30:55,142 --> 00:30:57,850
Some of them will wet their pants.

347
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:00,252
That makes no difference.

348
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:02,384
You'll get into trouble.

349
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,799
I don't want anything.

350
00:31:08,522 --> 00:31:11,662
It's the only way
to make your boss flinch a little.

351
00:31:12,092 --> 00:31:14,197
Just a friendly advice.

352
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:16,035
Hands off the case.

353
00:31:16,897 --> 00:31:21,539
Think about your wife and kid
in the Philippines.

354
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:28,318
You're going too far.

355
00:31:28,842 --> 00:31:30,412
Is that a threat?

356
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:36,717
Here you go.
Enjoy your meal!

357
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:41,824
You've changed.

358
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:46,527
Changed a lot.

359
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,404
Stop talking nonsense.
You jerk.

360
00:31:55,235 --> 00:31:57,044
Okay.

361
00:31:58,806 --> 00:32:00,308
Where are you going?

362
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:04,781
You'll keep following me, right?

363
00:32:05,212 --> 00:32:07,021
Your shout.

364
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,287
Hey, Jang-Ho!

365
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:21,702
Bottoms up.

366
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:27,008
Play fair. Okay?

367
00:32:50,924 --> 00:32:52,491
Long time no see, Jin-seok.

368
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:53,732
Go away.
Don't make me say it again.

369
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:55,000
- Wait.
- Fuck off!

370
00:32:55,562 --> 00:32:58,236
What's this? Put it away!

371
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,676
Jin-seok. Calm down.

372
00:33:03,437 --> 00:33:06,179
I live out in the
boonies because of you.

373
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,481
You should be ashamed of yourself.

374
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,190
Get the fuck out of my sight.

375
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:17,320
Keeping it a secret won't do
any good to your dead sister.

376
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:20,756
- Damn it.
- Holy Molly.

377
00:33:21,822 --> 00:33:23,529
Are you okay?

378
00:33:24,424 --> 00:33:26,563
Why are you hitting him?

379
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:29,340
- My eye. My eye.
- Your eye?

380
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:40,050
Sorry about that.
Let's call it even.

381
00:33:40,107 --> 00:33:43,213
You made me press
charges against them.

382
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:55,257
Why did you close down
your Chinese restaurant?

383
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:07,544
After I sued them,
I was getting more calls

384
00:34:08,635 --> 00:34:14,916
for an interview than for orders.

385
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:17,948
You just gave up like that?

386
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:27,556
I started to have
hallucinations mocking me

387
00:34:27,654 --> 00:34:34,765
whose sister sold
herself to the haves.

388
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:38,109
I couldn't stand it.

389
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:40,377
So I sold my restaurant.

390
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:50,817
Ji-hee came here about a week
before she died. Right?

391
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,652
A very little something for her, literally.

392
00:35:26,947 --> 00:35:30,224
There's nothing much to eat.

393
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:33,897
Poor mommy, how undutiful we are.

394
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:37,367
No preparation, no complaints.

395
00:35:37,424 --> 00:35:39,904
You should get yourself a wife.

396
00:35:39,926 --> 00:35:45,877
Huh? You'd better talk
after you hook me up with a girl.

397
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:49,913
You have no idea how you look
to the rest of the world, do you?

398
00:35:59,646 --> 00:36:02,525
Next time I should order the
food for her memorial service.

399
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:08,625
No need. I'll see to it.

400
00:36:09,556 --> 00:36:11,126
Yeah, right.

401
00:36:24,638 --> 00:36:31,283
Maybe I should quit my job --

402
00:36:32,412 --> 00:36:34,983
Why? Having a rough time?

403
00:36:35,882 --> 00:36:37,793
No,

404
00:36:43,657 --> 00:36:50,700
I guess I'm a bit exhausted lately.

405
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:06,519
Every time a young
actress commits suicide,

406
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:10,458
the media will talk about my sister.

407
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:17,400
Now that it will, we should clear
her name at least.

408
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:29,202
I want you to write her last story.

409
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:33,750
I'm on my own now.

410
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:39,816
I've got nothing to lose.

411
00:37:53,358 --> 00:38:01,800
From April to June 2012,
you worked as an escort girl at 'Inferno'.

412
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:03,579
Yes.

413
00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:07,638
On June 7, 2012,
you served the defendants

414
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:11,143
Cha Jeong-hyeok and
Hyeon Seong-bong at the drinks party.

415
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,548
Yes.

416
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,525
That day, Hyeon came first. Correct?

417
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:20,619
Yes.

418
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,559
It was around past 10:00pm.

419
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:27,399
I went into the room and
there were Mr. Hyeon and my manager.

420
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:33,408
And Mr. Cha came about
half an hour later.

421
00:38:33,532 --> 00:38:35,273
Was he alone?

422
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:36,638
Good evening, sir.

423
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:39,648
No, he was with a girl.

424
00:38:39,704 --> 00:38:41,342
She is a new girl that
I'm representing.

425
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:43,716
I was newbie back then.

426
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:46,585
I thought she must be
one of the girls like me.

427
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:50,620
Later, I learned that
she was actress Jeong Ji-hee.

428
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:55,063
How was the atmosphere that day?

429
00:38:55,554 --> 00:38:57,090
Oh, it was horrible.

430
00:38:57,155 --> 00:38:59,362
I've never been to such
a weird drinks party ever.

431
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:02,598
She didn't say a word.

432
00:39:04,262 --> 00:39:10,440
What should I call her anyway?
The dead actress?

433
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:12,105
You can call her the victim.

434
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:17,483
Appreciate your taking time for us.
It's truly an honor.

435
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,350
Oh, thanks.

436
00:39:20,612 --> 00:39:24,719
We have so many girls
as talented as Da-ryeong.

437
00:39:25,484 --> 00:39:28,294
How to put it...
Arrogant isn't the right word.

438
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:30,296
She seemed to be pouty

439
00:39:31,723 --> 00:39:33,566
Let me fill up your drink.

440
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:34,729
Objection.

441
00:39:34,826 --> 00:39:38,205
The witness is speculating
other's feeling.

442
00:39:38,263 --> 00:39:41,244
How long were you
there with them?

443
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:44,439
Well~~ about 30 minutes.

444
00:39:45,303 --> 00:39:47,408
I felt suffocated so
I couldn't be there anymore.

445
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:50,249
So I left pretending to
go to the ladies' room.

446
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:56,753
You just said that you were with
defendant Hyeon for half an hour

447
00:39:56,815 --> 00:40:01,992
before defendant Cha and
Jeong Ji-hee entered the room.

448
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,364
Yes.

449
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:11,606
Did defendant Hyeon ever mention that
he asked Cha to bring some actress.

450
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:14,036
- No.
- Then,

451
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:24,483
did you hear defendant Hyeon call
defendant Cha asking for an actress?

452
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:27,215
No.

453
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:29,748
No further questions.

454
00:40:29,814 --> 00:40:35,492
Then, did you hear anything defendant
Hyeon talk defendant Cha out of it or

455
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:38,864
ask Jeong Ji-hee why she was there?

456
00:40:39,024 --> 00:40:40,628
Your honor.

457
00:40:40,692 --> 00:40:43,969
The argument of the
Prosecution is far fetched.

458
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:50,105
According to the witness, the drinks party
was for my client to meet defendant Cha and

459
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:53,672
it was defendant
Cha who brought the deceased.

460
00:40:53,738 --> 00:41:01,054
Defendant Hyeon was fully aware the fact
that Jeong Ji-hee was forced to join them

461
00:41:01,112 --> 00:41:03,149
but he didn't do any action.

462
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:04,353
Even so,

463
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:08,592
the Prosecution can't even prove the
charge of coercion against defendant Cha.

464
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:13,159
According to the witness, it is certain that the
victim joined the drinks party against her will.

465
00:41:13,225 --> 00:41:15,535
Okay!
The court has heard enough.

466
00:41:16,094 --> 00:41:17,664
Both of you calm down.

467
00:41:18,697 --> 00:41:21,007
Are there any further questions?

468
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:23,237
- No, your honor.
- No.

469
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:27,948
Witness, you may
leave the witness box.

470
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:33,378
Counsel, you may call your witness.

471
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:35,520
Yes, your honor.

472
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:39,221
I solemnly swear to tell the truth,

473
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:44,094
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

474
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:55,608
From October 2011 to June 2012,

475
00:41:55,734 --> 00:41:59,841
you worked for the defendant's
company Kovest Entertainment?

476
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:00,815
Yes.

477
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:04,445
What was your job
title at that time?

478
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:06,514
Road Manager.

479
00:42:06,845 --> 00:42:10,019
Around 19:00 on June 7 2012,

480
00:42:10,081 --> 00:42:13,290
the defendant
wanted to see you in his office.

481
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:14,363
Yes.

482
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:18,625
When you entered his office,
what was he doing?

483
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:22,635
He was on the
phone talking to Ji-hee.

484
00:42:22,994 --> 00:42:26,441
What did he tell her?

485
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:32,913
To get herself prepared
to meet someone important.

486
00:42:33,038 --> 00:42:39,614
Did the defendant threaten
her or swear at her?

487
00:42:43,782 --> 00:42:45,125
No, he didn't.

488
00:42:45,684 --> 00:42:50,064
Why did he want to see you?

489
00:42:50,822 --> 00:42:52,233
I don't know.

490
00:42:53,758 --> 00:42:57,228
Who picked her up?

491
00:42:58,263 --> 00:43:00,470
Mr. Cha did.

492
00:43:01,032 --> 00:43:04,912
Normally, you do for
her official schedules.

493
00:43:05,637 --> 00:43:06,707
Yes.

494
00:43:08,073 --> 00:43:13,216
Which means that
was not an official one.

495
00:43:14,813 --> 00:43:16,315
I don't know.

496
00:43:16,414 --> 00:43:19,452
When you were at the questioning.

497
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:26,867
You said that the victim came to the office
and argued with defendant Cha.

498
00:43:30,528 --> 00:43:33,099
For how long do I have to
support Da-ryeong?

499
00:43:33,465 --> 00:43:35,945
It's totally up to you.

500
00:43:36,034 --> 00:43:37,377
You practice acting hard and --

501
00:43:37,402 --> 00:43:41,873
I've been doing everything
you told me to. Even that...

502
00:43:41,973 --> 00:43:45,386
Watch your mouth.
The walls are thin.

503
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:47,856
Let me go.

504
00:43:48,446 --> 00:43:50,892
What?
Where do you want to go?

505
00:43:51,116 --> 00:43:53,027
I want to start all over.

506
00:43:54,386 --> 00:43:55,558
You do?

507
00:43:55,687 --> 00:43:57,689
Let me review the contract.

508
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:00,895
Oh no. I have it in my head.

509
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:09,437
You have to pay me penalty fees for
breach of contract 30 times plus expenses.

510
00:44:11,035 --> 00:44:16,781
I believe your money
already went down the drain.

511
00:44:18,009 --> 00:44:22,719
Oh and, your one and only brother runs
a Chinese restaurant in the boonies.

512
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:25,188
I don't believe you do this to me.

513
00:44:26,017 --> 00:44:28,861
The easy way or the
hard way. you choose.

514
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,992
'Please have a heart'
or 'See you in court'.

515
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:37,400
It seemed Ji-hee wanted
the cancellation of the contract.

516
00:44:37,462 --> 00:44:39,738
Objection. Speculation.

517
00:44:39,798 --> 00:44:40,868
No further questions.

518
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:44,410
Witness, you may
leave the witness box.

519
00:44:47,405 --> 00:44:49,043
Do we have next witness?

520
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,380
No, your honor.

521
00:44:50,942 --> 00:44:54,185
Do you still want
Go Da-ryeong to testify?

522
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:57,757
She's abroad now.

523
00:44:57,849 --> 00:44:59,590
But she'll be back soon.

524
00:44:59,651 --> 00:45:01,688
We can't wait her forever.

525
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:07,498
For the next hearing, examine the
defendants and close the statements.

526
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:12,030
Your honor, I would like to send
the subpoena one more time.

527
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:15,942
First you get a hold of her,
then we'll talk.

528
00:45:27,645 --> 00:45:29,318
Wait, Wait.

529
00:45:29,614 --> 00:45:32,652
You don't want to win this case?

530
00:45:33,251 --> 00:45:34,753
Why are you saying that?

531
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:38,631
The game's almost over.
Time to use your ace up your sleeve.

532
00:45:38,656 --> 00:45:42,035
I don't want to lose
this game either.

533
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,131
But I cannot reach
Go Da-ryeong.

534
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:47,468
How did you reach her?

535
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:50,373
Through her mother.

536
00:45:50,702 --> 00:45:53,376
You're being so naive.

537
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:56,544
Should've let your
colleague take the case.

538
00:45:57,809 --> 00:46:00,312
- Are you done?
- Okay.

539
00:46:00,478 --> 00:46:03,357
Did you find the diary yet?

540
00:46:03,414 --> 00:46:04,916
I'm working on it.

541
00:46:05,683 --> 00:46:07,594
Well, how did
you know about that?

542
00:46:07,785 --> 00:46:10,789
That's the only thing
you reporters are after.

543
00:46:10,889 --> 00:46:15,201
Don't tell me what to do,
just mind your own business.

544
00:46:16,594 --> 00:46:19,336
Normally at your age,
people don't get beat up.

545
00:46:20,098 --> 00:46:23,136
No I didn't. I let him. On purpose.

546
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:26,209
I don't beat strangers.

547
00:46:26,704 --> 00:46:29,082
Are you even listening to me?

548
00:46:30,975 --> 00:46:34,479
To be fair,
Da-ryeong is a victim too.

549
00:46:34,612 --> 00:46:37,786
After that happened,
my daughter suffered.

550
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:40,987
She didn't even sleep or eat.

551
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,828
I'm not happy with the media
misleading the public

552
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:48,029
that my daughter took
advantage of the dead

553
00:46:48,126 --> 00:46:51,903
girl for fame and fell
into the casting couch.

554
00:46:51,963 --> 00:46:55,911
You know. She was A-list actress
before she signed with that agency.

555
00:46:55,967 --> 00:47:01,849
Your daughter is called
as a witness in court.

556
00:47:01,906 --> 00:47:04,011
I said, she's a victim too.

557
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:06,521
She had to get the therapy for that.

558
00:47:06,578 --> 00:47:11,118
She left the country as the media
never leave her alone.

559
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,853
So she won't appear in court?

560
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,025
It's up to her.

561
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:21,662
I told her every time the
subpoena was delivered,

562
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:25,002
she said okay but never said
when she would be back.

563
00:47:26,664 --> 00:47:32,012
But the prosecutors said it's not easy
to get a hold of her through you.

564
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:35,381
Did they? Strange.

565
00:47:35,573 --> 00:47:38,213
As far as I know,
they contact her directly.

566
00:48:01,265 --> 00:48:02,767
Over the last 10 years,

567
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:07,146
I've been working with top stars and
earned a good reputation in business.

568
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:10,147
I've never pressured anyone
doing anything against their will.

569
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:16,853
When you sign with the agency, you think
it's only a matter of time before you become a star.

570
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:20,127
But you don't get any jobs for 6 months.

571
00:48:21,586 --> 00:48:23,691
You were cocky at first,

572
00:48:24,389 --> 00:48:26,369
but you start to learn how to be humble.

573
00:48:27,592 --> 00:48:32,098
I'll work hard.
Please get me anything.

574
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,361
When you join the drinks party,

575
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:00,027
you'll get a job even if
it's a teeny, tiny one.

576
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:08,573
That is the catch.

577
00:50:12,063 --> 00:50:16,136
You know, girls like you
are a dime a dozen.

578
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,306
There's no such thing
as a free lunch. Got it?

579
00:50:44,896 --> 00:50:47,570
I just had a drink with the actors.

580
00:50:47,665 --> 00:50:49,508
What's so wrong with that?

581
00:50:58,776 --> 00:51:01,757
I'm in front of the court.

582
00:51:01,846 --> 00:51:04,759
The scandalous trial of the
late Jeong Ji-hee case

583
00:51:04,782 --> 00:51:06,762
has now entered its final stretch.

584
00:51:07,685 --> 00:51:09,926
Last week, we promised that

585
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:13,764
we would give you a revealing
story behind her tragic death.

586
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:19,571
There was a suicide
attempt before she died.

587
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:23,234
And prosecutors are being complacent
in preparation of the trial.

588
00:51:27,505 --> 00:51:28,916
Let's find out more.

589
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,482
Let's go.

590
00:51:37,815 --> 00:51:39,624
Okay. Let's go.

591
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,484
Damn it.

592
00:52:11,382 --> 00:52:13,157
All hard drives are gone.

593
00:52:40,378 --> 00:52:43,689
One drink is worth of half of it.

594
00:52:45,216 --> 00:52:48,459
We call it even when I hit you.

595
00:52:48,753 --> 00:52:50,426
- Come here.
- What's all this?

596
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:54,830
You really don't know?
You brat!

597
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:14,314
The world changes in any way.

598
00:53:15,947 --> 00:53:18,951
There's nothing to brag
about what you did.

599
00:53:22,887 --> 00:53:23,991
I'm leaving.

600
00:53:42,206 --> 00:53:46,677
I was expecting the updated news today.
Will there be tomorrow?

601
00:53:46,777 --> 00:53:50,418
Pull yourself together.
Give us the news ASAP.

602
00:53:51,882 --> 00:53:56,922
I thought Thursday is News Scratch day.
A little bit of spanking for the lazy reporter.

603
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:13,314
Yes, honey.

604
00:54:14,205 --> 00:54:15,377
What are you doing?

605
00:54:15,873 --> 00:54:18,353
Doing some job
searching on a website.

606
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:22,120
Got anything for you?

607
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:23,385
Not so many.

608
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:26,623
I should take on
the tutoring again.

609
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:30,963
You 're not a friendly
teacher you know.

610
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:38,501
Who wants an old man with a big
face smelling like cigarettes?

611
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:40,438
How do you know?

612
00:54:40,998 --> 00:54:42,807
So you're following me on Twitter.

613
00:54:43,901 --> 00:54:48,543
Silly. I have my own source.

614
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:51,480
Ah, Jin-tae told you.

615
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,421
What are you gonna do?

616
00:54:55,513 --> 00:54:58,892
Weird, today's just OMG.

617
00:54:59,116 --> 00:55:01,790
OMG? What are you, 20?

618
00:55:03,854 --> 00:55:05,390
How's our girl doing?

619
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:08,198
Sleeping -

620
00:55:08,426 --> 00:55:10,929
She seems to be tired
of waiting for you.

621
00:55:12,663 --> 00:55:14,199
She wants to go back to Korea.

622
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,671
If anything happens, call me.

623
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:20,576
We'll go back.

624
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:24,085
Okay.

625
00:55:24,608 --> 00:55:25,951
Sleep tight.

626
00:55:40,558 --> 00:55:44,665
I request to reopen the proceedings
for Go Da-ryeong to testify in court.

627
00:55:48,132 --> 00:55:50,203
We only have one hearing
before passing the sentence.

628
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:52,611
And the witness has refused
her appearance in court several times.

629
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:56,618
The Prosecution's request is
intentionally delaying the trial.

630
00:55:56,707 --> 00:56:00,018
The witness will be back
in time for the next proceeding.

631
00:56:00,111 --> 00:56:02,091
I spoke to her on the phone.

632
00:56:05,015 --> 00:56:07,393
What do you reckon,
counsel Yoon?

633
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,300
I'm with counsel Kim.

634
00:56:11,388 --> 00:56:13,368
If the counsels refuse my request,

635
00:56:13,424 --> 00:56:16,496
I have to issue an
arrest warrant to Mr. Hyeon.

636
00:56:16,594 --> 00:56:20,599
The defendant has never been present
in court after the first hearing.

637
00:56:20,664 --> 00:56:22,837
But the case is almost over --

638
00:56:28,873 --> 00:56:32,685
Okay. Request granted.

639
00:56:32,743 --> 00:56:35,383
But if the witness fails to appear,

640
00:56:35,446 --> 00:56:37,824
the court will pass the
sentence and close the case.

641
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:43,292
- Do you agree?
- Yes.

642
00:56:48,726 --> 00:56:52,230
Back then, there were
many girls on a roll.

643
00:56:53,564 --> 00:56:58,104
I just tagged along with them.

644
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,343
You know what time it is?

645
00:57:01,772 --> 00:57:03,581
- Take some time off, you said.

646
00:57:03,641 --> 00:57:06,178
- Take time off as much
as you can in an urn.

647
00:57:07,478 --> 00:57:10,982
We've got nothing.
What are you going to do now?

648
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:16,531
We have a card up our sleeve.

649
00:57:17,054 --> 00:57:18,260
Huh?

650
00:57:18,822 --> 00:57:20,927
You'll know when you see it.

651
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:50,362
She ended her life as a last resort
to get away from Mr. Cha.

652
00:57:51,689 --> 00:57:54,602
Him and big shots who harassed her.

653
00:57:55,759 --> 00:57:58,262
All those devils are still alive.

654
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:05,214
to get away from Mr. Cha.

655
00:58:07,471 --> 00:58:10,350
Him and big shots who harrassed her.

656
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:13,988
All those devils are still alive.

657
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:40,273
Where is it? The diary.

658
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,784
She called me 4 days
before she died.

659
00:58:51,415 --> 00:58:55,557
She wanted to give me
a tip-off about unfair contract.

660
00:58:57,354 --> 00:59:02,599
Back then, I was in the Philippines
to see my wife and daughter.

661
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,698
So I asked her to
call me back next week.

662
00:59:05,763 --> 00:59:07,037
And she said okay.

663
00:59:08,299 --> 00:59:14,511
And when I was back at the office,
she's was already dead.

664
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:17,318
I completely forgot
about her phone call.

665
00:59:19,677 --> 00:59:22,157
Now you know who my source was.

666
00:59:27,217 --> 00:59:29,163
Yes. It was her.

667
00:59:30,554 --> 00:59:36,630
It occurred to me that
if I met her right after she called me,

668
00:59:37,795 --> 00:59:40,776
would you she really end her life?

669
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:47,246
I feel responsible for her death.

670
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,986
I mean it.

671
00:59:54,912 --> 00:59:58,951
Nothing changes if you
keep your mouth shut.

672
01:00:00,217 --> 01:00:05,098
Just like there's nothing
but mould in the shades.

673
01:00:14,865 --> 01:00:17,072
I call Go Da-ryeong to
the witness box.

674
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:20,148
Go Da-ryeong? She's here.

675
01:00:30,881 --> 01:00:32,883
Before proceeding
the witness examination,

676
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:36,898
considering the relationship between
the witness and the defendant,

677
01:00:36,987 --> 01:00:38,989
the court judges that the witness

678
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:42,401
cannot testify without any pressure
in presence of the defendant.

679
01:00:43,093 --> 01:00:46,597
Hence the court orders the defendant
to leave the court temporarily.

680
01:00:55,839 --> 01:01:00,839
Around 11:00pm
on June 7, 2012,

681
01:01:01,812 --> 01:01:06,227
you went to the bar 'Inferno?

682
01:01:07,384 --> 01:01:08,385
Yes.

683
01:01:09,086 --> 01:01:10,622
Who asked you to come?

684
01:01:11,655 --> 01:01:13,635
It was Mr. Cha.

685
01:01:14,525 --> 01:01:18,837
When he called you in,
what were you doing?

686
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:22,236
I was with my friends.

687
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:27,274
He told me to come over
as Mr. Hyeon wanted to see me.

688
01:01:27,438 --> 01:01:30,510
He said Mr. Hyeon is
very important to us.

689
01:01:30,574 --> 01:01:35,080
Come over now or I'll be doomed.

690
01:01:35,512 --> 01:01:39,426
So I had to.

691
01:01:40,184 --> 01:01:45,793
When you entered the room,
how was the atmosphere?

692
01:01:48,425 --> 01:01:51,838
Oh, Miss. Go. Nice to see you.

693
01:01:52,596 --> 01:01:54,837
I really loved your recent TV drama.

694
01:01:54,932 --> 01:01:56,502
Da-ryeong, come in here.

695
01:01:58,669 --> 01:02:03,084
I pestered him to see you.

696
01:02:04,007 --> 01:02:08,285
She's the most precious
asset of my company.

697
01:02:09,847 --> 01:02:11,485
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

698
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:14,188
Have a drink. What will you have?

699
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:16,853
I get easily drunk.

700
01:02:16,854 --> 01:02:19,630
Yes, she is a light drinker.

701
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:23,360
Say -- That's the only
fly in the ointment.

702
01:02:23,594 --> 01:02:25,505
Mr. Hyeon.

703
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:33,946
My name is Jeong Ji-hee.

704
01:02:41,612 --> 01:02:46,061
My -- name is --
Jeong Ji-hee.

705
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:50,531
- I'm 25"-
- What are you doing?

706
01:02:51,154 --> 01:02:55,694
My name is Jeong Ji-hee.

707
01:02:56,627 --> 01:02:58,903
I'll be a good actress.

708
01:03:15,245 --> 01:03:16,451
And...

709
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,521
What else happened?

710
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:24,598
A while later-m
Mr. Hyeon left the room.

711
01:03:24,755 --> 01:03:27,201
You bitch.. Crazy bitch.

712
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:28,861
Any idea who
you're messing with?

713
01:03:28,926 --> 01:03:31,497
I've worked my ass off to meet him.
And you fucked up!

714
01:03:31,595 --> 01:03:32,539
Stop it!

715
01:03:32,596 --> 01:03:34,303
Get the hell off of me!

716
01:03:35,198 --> 01:03:37,439
So I'm not good enough?

717
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:40,505
I'm not Da-ryeong.
I'm nothing like her.

718
01:03:40,637 --> 01:03:42,742
Am I really not that worthy?

719
01:03:43,941 --> 01:03:48,890
Don't you get the picture yet?

720
01:03:49,112 --> 01:03:50,887
She's here kicking it up a notch.

721
01:03:50,948 --> 01:03:53,758
And you're putting a damper on it.
Don't butt in!

722
01:03:53,817 --> 01:03:56,491
And I just spread my legs for him?

723
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,892
Damn it.

724
01:03:58,055 --> 01:04:00,092
Please stop!

725
01:04:00,891 --> 01:04:02,666
M-hee, are you okay?

726
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:11,439
Serve him well, or I'll kill you.

727
01:04:14,805 --> 01:04:16,284
And then?

728
01:05:13,697 --> 01:05:15,768
He's high on dope.

729
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:18,543
We just watch and enjoy.

730
01:05:20,203 --> 01:05:25,915
Your success comes from girls like her
hoping to be like you one day.

731
01:05:27,277 --> 01:05:30,019
Painful? Difficult to watch?

732
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,718
It ends soon.

733
01:05:32,282 --> 01:05:36,230
Your success, she sows and you reap.

734
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:10,823
If I took the courage to stop him,
she wouldn't end like this.

735
01:06:11,421 --> 01:06:13,526
I was scared

736
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:18,229
that I can't work in
the business any more.

737
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:24,209
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

738
01:06:49,926 --> 01:06:53,999
Her testimony is irrelevant
to the charges.

739
01:06:54,064 --> 01:06:55,134
Your honor!

740
01:06:58,935 --> 01:07:03,884
In order to question
defendant Hyeon Seong-bong,

741
01:07:03,974 --> 01:07:06,921
the Prosecution requests
an arrest warrant for him.

742
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:10,480
Against the defendants

743
01:07:10,547 --> 01:07:13,391
Hyeon Seong-bong
and Cha Jeong-hyeok,

744
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:18,763
will add charges of sexual coercion.

745
01:07:18,822 --> 01:07:21,928
It is not possible
to amend the charges

746
01:07:22,325 --> 01:07:24,464
It's against protection
of the defendant's right.

747
01:07:24,528 --> 01:07:27,372
The request of the Prosecution is
not worthy of consideration.

748
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:29,607
Please make the audience silent.

749
01:07:29,633 --> 01:07:31,010
Your honor! Your honor!

750
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:35,683
Order! Order in court!

751
01:07:39,476 --> 01:07:40,682
Mr. Lee.

752
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:46,022
I owe her an apology.
I was scared.

753
01:07:50,854 --> 01:07:54,165
I couldn't stop her death.

754
01:07:56,726 --> 01:07:59,798
I thought I always
had been there for her.

755
01:07:59,896 --> 01:08:02,342
But there were things
that I didn't know.

756
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:05,773
I was scared of Mr. Cha.

757
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:13,681
And I didn't want her death
to be disgraced either.

758
01:08:25,822 --> 01:08:29,497
I'm not sure if
I did the right thing.

759
01:08:32,829 --> 01:08:35,105
If I'm wrong,

760
01:08:36,633 --> 01:08:40,012
I'll ask her forgiveness
when I see her in heaven.

761
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:56,126
Hello, everyone.
Lee Jang-ho from News Scratch.

762
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:59,760
You're watching this live on the internet.

763
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:05,369
Exclusive on Jeong Ji-hee's death.

764
01:09:07,864 --> 01:09:11,573
What I'm holding here is
the late actress' diary.

765
01:09:12,369 --> 01:09:18,581
She wrote down every detail
about what she had to go through.

766
01:09:19,843 --> 01:09:24,019
Noteworthy events
go back to December 2011.

767
01:09:24,147 --> 01:09:27,959
She wrote that CEO of her
agency Cha Jeong-hyeok

768
01:09:28,051 --> 01:09:32,090
forced her to serve at his drinks parties.
She also had to offer sexual favors.

769
01:09:32,289 --> 01:09:34,826
Names mentioned in her diary

770
01:09:34,891 --> 01:09:37,303
vary from media figures, producers,

771
01:09:37,394 --> 01:09:43,072
to politicians, prosecutors,
bank officials.

772
01:09:52,676 --> 01:09:56,749
Do you remember my name?

773
01:09:58,415 --> 01:10:02,625
I said, do you remember my name?

774
01:10:16,132 --> 01:10:18,612
You got some nerve
to talk to me like that.

775
01:10:20,503 --> 01:10:23,074
Why should I?

776
01:10:25,342 --> 01:10:28,789
At least my body will remember you.

777
01:10:29,112 --> 01:10:33,492
H R does,
I'll come and see you again.

778
01:10:41,558 --> 01:10:43,765
My name's

779
01:10:45,428 --> 01:10:50,241
Jeong Ji-hee.

780
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:41,186
The number you dialed is
not available --

781
01:12:05,442 --> 01:12:07,683
You good for nothing.

782
01:12:10,146 --> 01:12:13,025
Never let your guard
down in this country.

783
01:12:13,983 --> 01:12:16,691
You have to kick the crap
out of those bastards.

784
01:12:21,157 --> 01:12:25,628
Anything you want to say,
counsel?

785
01:12:27,297 --> 01:12:31,973
Apologies for having
caused you trouble, sir.

786
01:12:32,202 --> 01:12:35,308
You can't even handle
this stupid prosecutor?

787
01:12:36,306 --> 01:12:39,253
Is it because her father is
a supreme court judge?

788
01:12:40,043 --> 01:12:42,990
For how long do I have to put up
with this humiliation?

789
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:46,993
She's nothing but a bitch.

790
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:56,233
Korean prosecutors are
not that easy to deal with.

791
01:13:05,335 --> 01:13:08,111
You paid me a fortune.

792
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:11,776
You have to trust me
and let me do my job.

793
01:13:13,576 --> 01:13:18,753
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go clean up the mess.

794
01:13:20,617 --> 01:13:22,062
By the way,

795
01:13:23,653 --> 01:13:26,827
You never asked me
if I slept with that bitch.

796
01:13:30,293 --> 01:13:34,366
It's not important to me at all.

797
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:37,303
I don't even have to know.

798
01:13:39,035 --> 01:13:44,007
I'm just helping you to
get what you want.

799
01:13:58,254 --> 01:13:59,198
Come in.

800
01:14:03,092 --> 01:14:05,333
Come and sit here.

801
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,170
What brings you here?

802
01:14:16,372 --> 01:14:21,014
I have something to say
regarding this case.

803
01:14:22,378 --> 01:14:24,881
As you know, your honor,

804
01:14:25,014 --> 01:14:31,624
her father and I have known
each other for many years.

805
01:14:32,322 --> 01:14:35,565
We went to the law
school together and

806
01:14:35,658 --> 01:14:38,229
we passed the bar exam and

807
01:14:38,294 --> 01:14:41,537
served as prosecutors.

808
01:14:42,265 --> 01:14:47,044
He's my dearest friend.
I must say.

809
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:55,117
I've known prosecutor
Kim Mi-hyeon for a long time.

810
01:14:55,912 --> 01:14:59,826
Once, she had measles.

811
01:15:00,049 --> 01:15:04,191
So I had to fill in for his father.

812
01:15:09,459 --> 01:15:13,635
It was about 20 years ago, I guess.

813
01:15:14,664 --> 01:15:18,202
One day, her father asked
me to have a drink.

814
01:15:18,768 --> 01:15:23,478
He drank like a fish.
Normally he didn't.

815
01:15:24,874 --> 01:15:27,377
I asked him what's got into him.

816
01:15:28,244 --> 01:15:32,522
He said his daughter got violated.

817
01:15:33,549 --> 01:15:37,463
In his house by his nephew.

818
01:15:37,887 --> 01:15:40,561
I really feel sorry for her.

819
01:15:40,657 --> 01:15:45,902
Maybe that's why she's
obsessed with this case.

820
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:57,149
Are you okay?
Mi-hyeon!

821
01:16:00,677 --> 01:16:09,461
What I'm asking is
to take off this case.

822
01:16:09,552 --> 01:16:11,759
I heard what you said.

823
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:14,131
I had no idea.

824
01:16:14,223 --> 01:16:17,329
Such a terrible accident --

825
01:16:17,393 --> 01:16:19,771
- Excuse me.
- I understand.

826
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:24,938
You have to think about your father.

827
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:28,847
If the word gets out,
it's not good for your father.

828
01:16:29,072 --> 01:16:30,813
Do what he says.

829
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:40,784
Has it ever occurred to you that
you want to bring the bad guys

830
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:43,592
to justice by all means?

831
01:16:44,921 --> 01:16:48,425
Do you have any case like that?

832
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:54,707
I want to win this
case no matter what.

833
01:16:56,532 --> 01:17:00,639
So you want to spill the beans on it?

834
01:17:02,338 --> 01:17:04,511
Be my guest.

835
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:07,980
I wouldn't have even started
this if I want to back off now.

836
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:16,023
The counsel's statement doesn't have
anything to do with the case.

837
01:17:16,085 --> 01:17:22,525
I won't get off the case.

838
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:36,907
Ji-hee

839
01:17:38,508 --> 01:17:41,284
I see her in my dream.

840
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:50,292
- Mom! Oh no -- Ji-hee --
- Dear! What is it?

841
01:17:50,353 --> 01:17:52,526
There's a fat chance to get them.

842
01:17:55,625 --> 01:18:00,199
Your testimony is all we have.

843
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:03,543
But it won't hurt to try.

844
01:18:05,535 --> 01:18:09,073
You leave the country for a while.

845
01:18:09,338 --> 01:18:13,252
That's the only way
that I can protect you.

846
01:18:33,329 --> 01:18:38,608
Nobody gave a damn before.
Now everyone's here.

847
01:18:39,035 --> 01:18:41,208
Hyenas looking for a scoop.

848
01:18:42,104 --> 01:18:44,050
All rise.

849
01:18:49,979 --> 01:18:51,253
Please be seated.

850
01:18:58,855 --> 01:19:00,129
Who is it?

851
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:02,530
Who is it?

852
01:19:02,692 --> 01:19:03,762
Sorry.

853
01:19:08,231 --> 01:19:10,711
Officer,
get him out of the court.

854
01:19:13,636 --> 01:19:14,706
Please stand up.

855
01:19:14,804 --> 01:19:18,673
From now on,
anyone who interfere with the trial

856
01:19:18,674 --> 01:19:20,620
will be out of court immediately.

857
01:19:21,277 --> 01:19:23,348
The judge's weird today.

858
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,382
Before we start,

859
01:19:27,383 --> 01:19:32,765
the court will examine
the amendment of the charges.

860
01:19:35,858 --> 01:19:37,559
The relevant request from
the Prosecution is applied

861
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:41,406
only when the charges are
in line with the previous ones.

862
01:19:41,497 --> 01:19:46,242
Followed by the precedent case,

863
01:19:46,302 --> 01:19:51,479
the court must consider the similarity
as well as the range of the penalty.

864
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:55,045
Also it must be taken into consideration

865
01:19:55,111 --> 01:20:00,993
the effort, time, cost the defendant need
to take for his own defense.

866
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:02,994
I don't understand a word he's saying.

867
01:20:03,052 --> 01:20:08,024
The relevant amendment
exercises an unfavorable

868
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:13,233
influence on the right of the defendant.

869
01:20:13,296 --> 01:20:18,075
Hence, the Prosecution's
request is disapproved.

870
01:20:18,167 --> 01:20:20,579
Your honor.
I request reconsideration.

871
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:22,149
I've already given you the explanation.

872
01:20:22,204 --> 01:20:23,410
Make it to another case.

873
01:20:23,472 --> 01:20:24,644
Your honor!

874
01:20:24,707 --> 01:20:27,551
We will proceed the examination
of defendant Hyeon Seong-bong.

875
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:29,988
Defendant,
please go to the witness box.

876
01:20:32,081 --> 01:20:35,654
Counselor! Counselor!

877
01:20:39,755 --> 01:20:45,762
On June 7, 2012,
you had a drink with defendant

878
01:20:45,828 --> 01:20:49,435
Cha Jeong-hyeok
and the victim Jeong Ji-hee.

879
01:20:50,132 --> 01:20:51,008
Yes.

880
01:20:51,701 --> 01:20:58,311
Did you ask Cha
to bring Jeong Ji-hee?

881
01:20:58,941 --> 01:21:00,318
No.

882
01:21:01,377 --> 01:21:07,692
Were you aware that
she was forced to be there?

883
01:21:08,751 --> 01:21:09,957
No.

884
01:21:10,386 --> 01:21:19,534
Have you confirmed
the testimony of Go Da-ryeong?

885
01:21:19,929 --> 01:21:20,999
Yes.

886
01:21:22,064 --> 01:21:26,137
What do you think of her testimony?

887
01:21:27,136 --> 01:21:31,846
I swear to God,
I don't know anything about that.

888
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:46,840
Over the last 3 decades, my company
has been my life-long commitment.

889
01:21:47,650 --> 01:22:06,192
I've always tried to live up to
my high standards of ethics and trust.

890
01:22:14,942 --> 01:22:21,826
This is the snapshot from CCTV
at the entrance of Inferno.

891
01:22:25,586 --> 01:22:28,726
The man in this picture is you.

892
01:22:28,922 --> 01:22:29,866
Yes.

893
01:22:34,428 --> 01:22:38,035
And another picture here.
It's you again, correct?

894
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:48,277
10 minutes later,
That's you holding a briefcase.

895
01:22:50,373 --> 01:22:53,047
What was in that briefcase?

896
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:56,455
Counselor.
What are you trying to prove?

897
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:59,527
I'm asking what
his briefcase contained.

898
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:03,156
How does it support his allegation?

899
01:23:03,253 --> 01:23:05,563
I have more questions to ask.

900
01:23:05,622 --> 01:23:06,930
One by one --

901
01:23:07,324 --> 01:23:10,601
On what ground, your questions have
something to do with the charges?

902
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,230
Why are you interrupting her?

903
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:14,809
Officer.
Get him out of the court.

904
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,236
Order in the court!

905
01:23:22,839 --> 01:23:26,412
The evidence of the
Prosecution is not accepted.

906
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:33,755
- Proceed the next question.
- Your honor.

907
01:23:34,918 --> 01:23:38,058
Are you denying my authority?

908
01:23:42,459 --> 01:23:43,870
No further questions?

909
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,962
Then the counsel will proceed
the cross-examination.

910
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:48,269
You may cross-examine, counsel.

911
01:23:48,465 --> 01:23:50,467
I haven't finished yet.

912
01:23:51,868 --> 01:23:53,939
Allow me to offer another evidence.

913
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,752
Objection, your honor.

914
01:24:04,814 --> 01:24:07,158
The relevant evidence wasn't
discussed with the Defense.

915
01:24:07,217 --> 01:24:11,029
And it is not clear what the
Prosecution wants to prove.

916
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:15,126
To prove the charges of the defendant.
Please read the marked page.

917
01:24:26,067 --> 01:24:28,358
June 7, 10:47pm, Hyeon Seong-bong CEO
and President of Hankuk Daily harassed me.

918
01:24:35,478 --> 01:24:36,752
Your honor!

919
01:24:37,881 --> 01:24:39,554
Turn off the monitor.
Now!

920
01:24:40,817 --> 01:24:42,660
Counselor!

921
01:24:45,755 --> 01:24:46,961
Order!

922
01:24:47,691 --> 01:24:52,003
Order in the court!
Or leave the courtroom.

923
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:03,445
We' re adjourned.

924
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:07,981
I haven't finished It yet.

925
01:25:08,078 --> 01:25:10,183
The questioning is not finished!

926
01:25:25,929 --> 01:25:28,705
Try the best you can.

927
01:25:30,433 --> 01:25:33,903
For you, we didn't reveal
the last page on TV.

928
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:35,907
I did a good job, didn't I?

929
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:43,214
And,
so did you.

930
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:48,122
The court is prepared
to proceed to sentencing.

931
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:53,363
Before the sentence is imposed,

932
01:26:54,028 --> 01:26:59,478
please note that this sentence only applies
to the given charges of the defendants.

933
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,872
The court makes it clear that

934
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:08,249
the sentence is irrelevant to the high-profile
reinvestigation of the sex bribes.

935
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:12,418
The court finds the defendants

936
01:27:13,047 --> 01:27:17,894
Cha Jeong-hyeok and Choi Cheol-soo
guilty as charged.

937
01:27:18,786 --> 01:27:25,362
The courts sentences
each of the defendants

938
01:27:25,459 --> 01:27:29,965
to one year in prison
with 2 years of probation.

939
01:27:30,364 --> 01:27:35,370
And the court find defendant
Hyeon Seong-bong not guilty.

940
01:28:05,566 --> 01:28:10,037
"45.3% of actresses has been
told to serve at a drinks party.

941
01:28:10,137 --> 01:28:14,279
And 60.2% has been asked
for sexual favors to

942
01:28:14,342 --> 01:28:18,188
powerful media figures or social figures. "

industry (National Human Rights Commission in Korea)

944
01:28:24,218 --> 01:28:29,133
