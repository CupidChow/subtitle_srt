1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,680
Why are those eyes looking at me?

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,560
It's like sending a signal that we're going to get to know each other.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,760
One day, one day when we are together

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,080
Set the clock to run a little slower.

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,880
Let me get a little closer to you.

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,160
Take it slow

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,400
There will come a day when we are ready.

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,240
It's too hard to feel

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,640
Deep down it's crying out

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,080
She was there and I could only look.

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,760
Before we got into a relationship

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,280
I will write a love song for you to listen to.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,000
From that day we passed each other

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,720
What a strange dream!

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,480
Hoy!

16
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,920
Are you dreaming?

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,840
Not dreaming

18
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,120
Oh, I didn't dream.

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,120
Ha!

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,440
Hoy!

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,880
Who the hell is this?

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,720
How did you get into our room?

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,560
mother

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,000
Mom, help me!

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,120
There's someone in the room, Mom.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,680
mother

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,920
What happened, son?

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,840
Get out!

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,680
What happened, my son?

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,200
mother

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,400
What's wrong, son?

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,520
There's someone in my room.

33
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,400
Who is your son? I don't see anyone here, Sia.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
There is, right there.

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,400
Oh, where did it go?

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,800
No children

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,600
What is it?

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,800
I guess you went to bed late.

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,280
Whose guitar is that?

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,920
Are you still playing music, son?

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:29,800
Uh huh

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,320
Uh huh

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,400
Oh, it's Jod's, Mom.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
It's like they created the content and then forgot about it.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,120
So, Sia picked it up and gave it to me.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,720
If it comes to get it, it will tell Xia again.

47
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,880
Okay then let's go.

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,480
Anyway, study hard, my child.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,680
Go... go take a shower and eat something.

50
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,520
I'm going to be late for school.

51
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,840
okay

52
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
What happened? Where did it go?

53
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,200
Hoy!

54
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,240
hello

55
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,920
Who are you?

56
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,520
Wait, take it easy.

57
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,960
Why are you following us?

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
We didn't follow you.

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,840
You're the one who brought us here.

60
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:49,960
Ha!

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,120
Are you crazy? Who brought who here?

62
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,800
You also showed up at our house.

63
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,520
Wait a minute.

64
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,440
Are you imagining it?

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,640
Oh, never mind.

66
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,640
Okay, who are you? Why are you following us?

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,680
Is that a thief?

68
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,840
We have nothing, just a guitar.

69
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,800
wait a minute

70
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,640
We are not thieves.

71
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,560
If we were thieves, we would just steal things.

72
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Then just run away?

73
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,120
Oh, why are you following me again?

74
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,320
Not following

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,880
I'm following you. Can you please stop pestering me?

76
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,320
Can you stop following me?

77
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,680
Hey, Xia!

78
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,480
Xia

79
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,720
What's wrong with you?

80
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,280
No, let's hurry up.

81
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,640
What's wrong with Sia?

82
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,320
do not know

83
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,880
Strange

84
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,280
No matter how long

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,400
No matter how long

86
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,280
I can't wait any longer.

87
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,000
I miss you so much that I want to hug you.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
Did you play the wrong chord?

89
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,560
Who are you?

90
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,440
How did you get into my room?

91
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,400
Get out now!

92
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,200
already

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,160
already

94
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,360
So how did you get in?

95
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Listen to us first.

96
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,360
My name is...

97
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,800
go out

98
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,880
Get out now!

99
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,480
Get out of here right now or else.

100
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,480
Not so

101
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,840
I called the police.

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,600
Now, listen to me first.

103
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,280
enough

104
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,880
My name is Blue.

105
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,800
We saw that you didn't know how to play the guitar, so we wanted to help you.

106
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,040
What do you need help with?

107
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,960
Hey, don't come any closer.

108
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,120
this

109
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,440
This is my bedroom.

110
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,640
Now it is that I need to ask for help.

111
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,840
Please help me.

112
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,760
Please help me.

113
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,360
help

114
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,560
help

115
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,240
Please help me.

116
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,680
Get out!

117
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,280
Please help me.

118
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,240
Please help me.

119
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,320
Hey, can you please stop talking?

120
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,800
Mr.

121
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,360
Who the hell are you?

122
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,240
In that case

123
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,080
I'll act like

124
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
That thing just now never happened.

125
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,400
Hoy!

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
Are you crazy?

127
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,320
Listen to us first.

128
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,040
We are in good spirits.

129
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,000
Uh huh

130
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Okay, so what's up?

131
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,920
My name is Blue.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,880
That guitar

133
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
It's ours.

134
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,920
Whose guitar is that?

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Can I play this to relieve my boredom?

136
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,600
Hoy!

137
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Are you here to collect it?

138
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,760
If you're jealous, I don't have to play.

139
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,920
We are not jealous.

140
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,800
We just want to say that

141
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,840
That guitar

142
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,240
It's really ours.

143
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,760
Which is why we came here.

144
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,320
It's because of that guitar.

145
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
While we were alive

146
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,800
I also like playing the guitar like you.

147
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:48,840
this

148
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,840
Do you even know our name?

149
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,120
Since you picked up that guitar

150
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
We've seen it in passing

151
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,160
In that case

152
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,960
If I go to the bathroom

153
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,360
Can you peek?

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,960
So, do you want me to watch it?

155
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,160
mental disorder

156
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,600
Hey, hey, calm down first.

157
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,920
We just want to help Xia.

158
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,920
We know that.

159
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,720
That Sia has been under a lot of pressure

160
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,000
We want to help you become better.

161
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,840
Do you know how to play guitar?

162
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,560
It's our big dream.

163
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,440
We see people who have the same dreams.

164
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,760
So we want to help Sia.

165
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,080
successful

166
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,840
already...

167
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,000
If you say you're dead

168
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,640
How did you die?

169
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Well, we're not breathing.

170
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
Not like that.

171
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,840
Refers to the cause of death

172
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,640
Just kidding

173
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,360
We just...

174
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,000
we

175
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,160
We don't remember anymore.

176
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,800
oh

177
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,000
Why can't I remember?

178
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,760
This is who you are.

179
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,640
It's your business too.

180
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,720
oh

181
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Haven't you heard?

182
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,600
They say that...

183
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,160
The dead person

184
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,400
Memories of the past will fade away

185
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,840
If I could see the images from the past again

186
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,520
You should be able to remember some things.

187
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,600
Sigh

188
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
We say that

189
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,400
We have to adjust ourselves a bit in this regard.

190
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,480
At first, it might be a bit awkward.

191
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,680
We are not used to it either.

192
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,560
But you saw us first.

193
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,200
But between

194
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,600
Where we teach you how to play guitar

195
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,680
Please help me find the truth.

196
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,080
Can we talk about our deaths?

197
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,080
It's considered an exchange.

198
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,440
Why do you want to know?

199
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,680
Because there are still things that we are worried about.

200
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,040
And then there are some unfinished matters.

201
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,080
And we still haven't found the answer.

202
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,040
And if we can make you feel less worried,

203
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,160
You will be free from worries and disappear, right?

204
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,760
That's right.

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,520
Okay, okay.

206
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,560
but

207
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,320
The cause of death is one thing.

208
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,040
already

209
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,160
What is the other thing?

210
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,160
It should be

211
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,880
That you became an artist

212
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,920
Hey, so we have to be together for a long time, right?

213
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,840
but

214
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,480
we

215
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,840
I'm not that good at playing.

216
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:20,960
this

217
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Stop looking down on yourself

218
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,560
There's a whole person here.

219
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,400
can

220
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,160
We also

221
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,520
I will do my best to be the best.

222
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,120
already...

223
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,720
Why you?

224
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,920
So you want us to be artists?

225
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,760
What do you think we think of you?

226
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,080
It's a bit strange.

227
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Are you crazy?

228
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
I really want you to be an artist.

229
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,680
stop

230
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,800
kid

231
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, we want to be artists.

232
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,320
but...

233
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,400
We didn't have a chance to do it.

234
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
Because if you are successful,

235
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,240
It is also our success.

236
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,800
already

237
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,800
Why...

238
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,760
Can we even see you?

239
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,880
So... do other people agree?

240
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,800
If other people see the performance, then...

241
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,360
This means that you are no different from a normal person.

242
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,520
Xia

243
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,640
Come quickly and help your mother prepare the food, my child.

244
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
Mom called already.

245
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,360
Xia

246
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,720
Yes, Mom.

247
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,280
I'm leaving now.

248
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,400
Stay here, don't go anywhere.

249
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,120
Yes, where do you want me to go?

250
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,960
We have to stay with the guitar.

251
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,840
Okay, that's it. Let's go eat.

252
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,960
But wait a minute.

253
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,680
But if you have to be on the guitar

254
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,160
already...

255
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,640
Can you make the guitar walk by itself?

256
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,400
So that we don't have to carry it.

257
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,320
So we won't have to carry it.

258
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,440
We are joking.

259
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,520
just...

260
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,480
You keep reminding us

261
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,520
Just hide the guitar so mom doesn't see it.

262
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,160
okay

263
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Then let's go.

264
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,200
okay

265
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,080
Don't go anywhere. Don't be naughty.

266
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,400
Xia

267
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,360
What's wrong, son?

268
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Is the food not delicious, son?

269
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,480
Oh, the food my mother makes is the most delicious.

270
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,920
We are over-praising our mother.

271
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,040
Mom,

272
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,520
Is anything up?

273
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,440
Does Mom believe in these mystical things?

274
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,280
Mom, I think it might actually exist, my child.

275
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,960
But it depends on whether we see it or not.

276
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,640
If the minds communicate with each other

277
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,320
We may meet

278
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,880
Or you can see it, son.

279
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
already...

280
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,320
If one day Mom really sees it

281
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,760
What will mom do?

282
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,080
If mom can see it?

283
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,840
Mom probably won't do anything, son.

284
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,640
Because if he comes in a good way

285
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,480
We don't need to chase him away, son.

286
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,960
As he said.

287
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,080
Good people are protected by ghosts.

288
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,440
Good people are not protected by monks?

289
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,880
It's a child's idiom.

290
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,800
But anyway

291
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,120
Ghosts and humans cannot coexist.

292
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,160
Everyone walks their own path, without disturbing each other.

293
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,360
Happiness or suffering depends on the karma you do, my child.

294
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,160
amen

295
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,880
Hey, this is us?

296
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,600
When my mother spoke seriously, I acted like I was joking.

297
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,120
But...

298
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,320
Ask this template

299
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,160
Or...

300
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,560
Brother Tham greeted me with a story.

301
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:08,920
really?

302
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,680
But

303
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,000
Have you ever felt hungry?

304
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,000
No, no.

305
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,240
I just felt like eating.

306
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,000
But I don't feel hungry at all.

307
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,800
Wow!

308
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,920
already...

309
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,280
before

310
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,200
Have you been playing guitar all along?

311
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,600
yes yes

312
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,760
And no one has ever seen you before?

313
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,800
That is, we never show ourselves to anyone.

314
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,120
Because no one has ever held a guitar before.

315
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,960
oh

316
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,960
Are you saying we hit the jackpot?

317
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,160
I think it's good luck.

318
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,600
You will have someone to teach you how to play the guitar.

319
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,800
Is it lucky that I saw a ghost?

320
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,920
What are you complaining about?

321
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,120
Oh, no, nothing.

322
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,920
So why do you want to be an artist?

323
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,880
Us?

324
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,480
I'm not sure either.

325
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,760
It's a feeling that we can't describe.

326
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,800
When we see our favorite artists on stage

327
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,760
We would like to be up there too.

328
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
I want to make music.

329
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,400
And many people love us.

330
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,640
That's good.

331
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
You still have a chance.

332
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
There is still time to make it happen.

333
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,440
And we believe that you will definitely succeed.

334
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,080
Okay, I guess I'll have to try it first.

335
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,720
But thank you for giving us more encouragement.

336
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,680
Let's just say I have to go to sleep.

337
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,240
I don't know if you'll sleep or not.

338
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,400
But we will sleep.

339
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,120
Are you sleeping yet?

340
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,440
Si Luk

341
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,800
Talking to someone is fun.

342
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,120
Wow, when I talk to my mom, she's not like this at all.

343
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,840
Go to sleep, child. It's late.

344
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,240
Yes, Mom. I'm going to sleep now.

345
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,320
Can I sleep here next to you?

346
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,560
It's better than putting a guitar down instead.

347
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,960
By the way, how old are you?

348
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,360
Probably around 20-21 years old.

349
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Then let's be friends.

350
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,720
Be my brother.

351
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,320
Because we die, our age remains the same.

352
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,080
So you mean to say that when you die, your lifespan is the same as if you were stuffed?

353
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,840
How long has it been?

354
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,360
Can I ask?

355
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,960
It should be about 2 years.

356
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,320
2 years like that. Now I'm 22-23 years old, right?

357
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,640
I'm the same age as P'Tham.

358
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,440
Probably so.

359
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,440
already...

360
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,840
What faculty did you study? Do you remember?

361
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,760
It should be journalism.

362
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,000
We see a vague picture.

363
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,920
In our room, there are pictures all over the walls.

364
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,760
But we can't remember where our house is.

365
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,280
I'm in the same faculty as Phi Tham.

366
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,200
Are we friends?

367
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,680
I think it's very late. You should rest, Sia.

368
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,600
What the heck? You just cut the conversation short.

369
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,600
Okay, I'm going to bed. I'm sleepy.

370
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,320
sweet dreams

371
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,680
Let's be honest.

372
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,360
Drinking alcohol doesn't taste good these days.

373
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,560
It's like there's always something on my mind.

374
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,680
What's the matter?

375
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,400
Hey, if you have something to say, just say it.

376
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,840
If there's anything bothering you, just say it.

377
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,080
We are friends.

378
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,960
It's Sia's business.

379
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,640
It's very bothersome.

380
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,720
Especially when I saw Sia walking back and forth in the club.

381
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,040
Very annoying

382
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,040
You are right.

383
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,440
It's very messy.

384
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,920
We think the guitar is broken.

385
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,760
Then Xia will disappear from the club.

386
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,600
Crying heavily

387
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,960
But Xia still came back.

388
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,720
Hey, guys calm down.

389
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,360
If the story of Xia is annoying to you guys,

390
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,760
Look at the three women looking at our table.

391
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
It's a pleasure to the eyes and ears.

392
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,880
Really, very cute.

393
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,760
Stand up now. What are you waiting for?

394
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,080
Let's go, let ....

395
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,880
Stop first.

396
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,680
It's not our way yet

397
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,720
What's wrong with you?

398
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,320
Aren't you guys in a hurry to leave?

399
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,040
All the women will disappear.

400
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh, yeah. Let's go. Let's go.

401
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,480
you

402
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,120
Don't you want it?

403
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,120
Hey, are you guys working offline yet?

404
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,640
Off, who is this?

405
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,520
Off is Teacher Frame. Have you guys done it yet?

406
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,640
Done

407
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,520
Really? Can I have a look?

408
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,560
Stop it, sis. Slap her bald head.

409
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,520
Oh, do it yourself, man.

410
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,040
Whatever, we just want to see it as a guideline.

411
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Who would copy you? Oh dear.

412
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,440
We can do just this. Oh, it's just a little bit.

413
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,640
Hey Liu

414
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,880
Those guys

415
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,680
Those guys

416
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,440
When I saw your face, I lost all my temper.

417
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,560
I don't like them at all.

418
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,400
Actually, I don't like acting like this.

419
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Talking all day long

420
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,080
Xia

421
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,840
You go with them, you have to be careful.

422
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,280
We don't want you anywhere near them.

423
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,080
But you chose your dream.

424
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,840
We still support you.

425
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,400
True, if you get bullied by them again

426
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,000
Tell us.

427
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
We'll send Liu over.

428
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,280
Wow, at first you said it like you were helping a friend.

429
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,680
In short, throw it to us.

430
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,280
Oh, come on, thank you guys so much.

431
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,200
What time?

432
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,280
Where are you rushing to?

433
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
The teacher will check the roll call now.

434
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,320
Hey, I got free milk too.

435
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,360
Whose milk is this?

436
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
no

437
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,040
It's like the vending machine is stuck.

438
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,880
And the woman in front was in a hurry.

439
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,920
The cabinet didn't stay there long before he walked away.

440
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,680
Hey, so you just picked it up, Type?

441
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,280
Wow, look at his heart.

442
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,000
A woman?

443
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,800
Is it cute?

444
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,080
It's normal. We saw it from the corner of our eyes.

445
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,720
Hey, if you say that, you're trying to block Q, right?

446
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,440
Do you want it?

447
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,720
Crazy nonsense

448
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,000
Just kidding

449
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,320
Hey, hey, you guys.

450
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,880
Look at the Xia women.

451
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
It's not just Liu.

452
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,480
There are others.

453
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,760
very cute

454
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,400
I don't know if this group was selected or not.

455
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,200
What Q said is true.

456
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,240
Every woman, your style too.

457
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,960
But men are also a problem.

458
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
You see, as an art student like this, he's very handsome.

459
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,120
In that case, a young lady like you has to meet us.

460
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,800
Hey, it's full of people.

461
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,480
Oh, Type, aren't you interested in this group?

462
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,760
Not only Xia, we also don't like his face.

463
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,680
And then there's Liu too.

464
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,240
We are bored.

465
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,440
That's great.

466
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,840
We will be able to see it alone.

467
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
No need to compete with anyone.

468
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,440
The sky is very white today.

469
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,880
Where is it white?

470
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,680
It looks like it's going to rain. The sky is white.

471
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,040
C, you don't know anything.

472
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,440
oh

473
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,920
Oh, you're here, Sia.

474
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,520
Hey guys

475
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Let's play basketball.

476
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,200
That's right, my friend. The women are all waiting.

477
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,600
Okay, let's go guys.

478
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,520
It's okay, Sia.

479
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,520
That's just the way they are.

480
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,680
do not think very much

481
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,320
I'm okay, Brother Tham.

482
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,400
It's okay, I understand.

483
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,880
Then come practice with me. I'll help you watch.

484
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,320
okay

485
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:57,720
come

486
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,760
okay

487
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,600
What are you guys doing? Why are you taking so long?

488
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,200
Wait a minute, this

489
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,600
Turn around and I'll give you a shot.

490
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,000
It's okay, friend. I can inject it myself.

491
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,720
oh

492
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,360
this

493
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,520
What kind of spray is this?

494
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
Puree's

495
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,760
We tried it and it was good.

496
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,240
Acne problems on the back caused by sweat

497
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,080
When exercising, it all disappears.

498
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Once we use it

499
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,160
The back is white and smooth like this.

500
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,560
Huh?

501
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,280
Then, after we finish playing basketball.

502
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,680
Can we try it?

503
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,440
Hey, let's go play basketball!

504
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,760
Hey, wait for us.

505
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,840
I'm going now.

506
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,840
Type A

507
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,080
Hey, it's not coming down.

508
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,360
One more round, another ball goes.

509
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,280
Let's go

510
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,920
Hey Ho Type

511
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,000
excuse me

512
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,560
Did you get hit by her just now?

513
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,560
Is this yours?

514
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,680
Are you okay?

515
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,000
It just rolled on the floor and didn't get hit at all.

516
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,960
It's fine if it's okay.

517
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,320
Now that I have my basketball back, I can go back to playing.

518
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,680
What are you standing there looking at?

519
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,440
I don't even want to look at you. Why would I be in trouble?

520
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,360
It's not a big deal.

521
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,520
You have a big mouth. Live until you're old.

522
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,280
Let's go love

523
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,400
Love, is your name Love?

524
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,080
We type

525
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,840
Nice to be loved

526
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,600
Hoy!

527
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,200
pleased to meet

528
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,160
That's the group of friends we're looking at.

529
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,720
The real person is cuter than the picture.

530
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,840
We like

531
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,200
Yes!

532
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,800
How do you play basketball to find your soulmate?

533
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
We booked, glad to love you.

534
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,120
Hey, nice to meet you.

535
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,640
What are you doing with your hands?

536
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,040
I love it.

537
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,400
Nice to meet you. Hey, nice to meet you.

538
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,280
Let's go, love. These guys are annoying.

539
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,600
Are you lonely practicing alone?

540
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,760
I was shocked. You came without any warning.

541
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,040
How was it? Where did you practice just now? Come, let me help you take a look.

542
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,040
Hey, didn't you see me standing there watching?

543
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,280
But we still can't play here.

544
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,440
oh

545
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,800
Then try the index finger, first fade.

546
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,320
okay

547
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,800
And then just keep going up.

548
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,640
Hold the C chord, okay.

549
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,120
try

550
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,480
Wow!

551
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,240
How are you?

552
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,400
Much easier to play

553
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,720
This guy

554
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,080
You're equally good.

555
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,200
certain

556
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,480
Go ahead and play.

557
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,080
Why did Xia stop playing?

558
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
Where are you going, Xia?

559
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,200
Quietly

560
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,400
Xia

561
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,920
What are you looking for? Someone will see.

562
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,120
Brother Tham has gone back. No one will come in now.

563
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,720
Nixia, what are you looking for? Can you tell me yet?

564
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,120
Sigh

565
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,200
We will help you find your story.

566
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,760
In case you find any information

567
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,760
At least you were a member of the club.

568
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,200
So will it really happen?

569
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,200
Oh, why is it locked?

570
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,760
Xia

571
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,560
If it doesn't open, then never mind.

572
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,800
Hey, it's okay.

573
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,200
We will help you find the truth.

574
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,160
Let's take it slow.

575
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
Oh, thank you, Sia.

576
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,720
How about this? Would you mind...

577
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,800
Oh... Blue

578
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,960
oh

579
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,240
yes

580
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,320
Xia hasn't come back yet? Is something wrong?

581
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,440
Brother Tham is...

582
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,800
My brother said that he would like us to lock the room.

583
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,840
But I forgot to leave the key with us.

584
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,800
I thought you had already gone back, so I came back myself.

585
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,760
But... why haven't you come back yet?

586
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,840
Uh huh

587
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,280
Oh, I'm just about to go back.

588
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,880
But I got too carried away practicing the guitar.

589
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,240
Then, would you like to go back with me?

590
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,400
Oh, it's okay, Brother Tham.

591
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm sorry. I'll go back myself.

592
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,080
Is that so?

593
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,800
yes

594
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,960
okay

595
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,360
Is there anything I can help you with?

596
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,760
No, it's very easy.

597
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,800
Look flustered

598
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,440
Oh, it's nothing, Brother Tham.

599
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,760
It's normal.

600
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,280
okay

601
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,880
I'll go first.

602
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,520
bye bye

603
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,200
Come back safely.

604
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,960
Yes, hello.

605
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,120
Hello, Brother Tham.

606
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,800
yes

607
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,720
Hey, watch out. Are you okay?

608
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,400
Okay, that's fine.

609
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,280
Then Love will go first. Bye-bye.

610
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,560
Hey, wait a minute.

611
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,520
Today's story

612
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,120
What's the story today?

613
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,400
Story of the evening

614
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,760
What's the matter?

615
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,560
Liu

616
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,240
Tell me, Love is waiting to hear you.

617
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,640
Story...Type

618
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,800
Are you okay?

619
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,520
What does that mean?

620
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,280
Well, it's a basketball...

621
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,960
It's not love, it's fine, it's fine.

622
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,520
Are you sure?

623
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,880
Sure, then I'll go with Love first.

624
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,560
bye bye

625
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,160
See you.

626
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,840
Hey, wait!

627
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,880
It's time to go home. It's getting late.

628
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,480
meet tomorrow

629
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,360
Don't be swayed by type.

630
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,000
No matter how long

631
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,800
No matter how long

632
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,440
I can't wait any longer.

633
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,600
I miss you so much that I want to hug you every day.

634
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,160
I want to tell you I love you every morning and before I sleep.

635
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,600
Being together and doing things together

636
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,000
It's good...

637
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,720
But once a week is not enough.

638
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,920
Very good, Siah. Now you can play.

639
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,920
Would you like to try playing another song?

640
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,440
Where? What song?

641
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,840
Then can we play?

642
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,320
Give it a listen first.

643
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,360
What song?

644
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,160
Experimental Song

645
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,000
can

646
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,840
I feel like I've heard this song before. Is it popular?

647
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,560
Try opening it first.

648
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,920
Whose is this?

649
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,800
Twinplus +

650
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,520
Why does this name sound so familiar?

651
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,520
Of Twinplus +

652
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,200
Twinplus + ?

653
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,840
yes

654
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,280
Twinplus +

655
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:23,920
Is this it?

656
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,480
This is it.

657
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,960
What chords are there?

658
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Try playing this chord.

659
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,560
Bm

660
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,080
What's the next chord?

661
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,680
A

662
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,120
Xia, mom brought some warm milk for you.

663
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,080
Xia

664
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,120
Uh...

665
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,280
It's nothing, Mom.

666
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,840
Mom doesn't see it.

667
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,400
It's nothing, Mom.

668
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,720
It's Xia...

669
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,400
Xia is reading a book.

670
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,880
That's good, son.

671
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,560
Mom brought me some milk.

672
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,200
Oh, Mom can put it on the table first.

673
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,320
Xia would like to sit down and rest for a while.

674
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,840
What did you do? You look tired.

675
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,920
Don't overdo it, dear. Mommy is worried.

676
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,360
Yes, Mom.

677
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,760
It's late. Mommy's going to bed now, dear.

678
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,200
Okay, good night, Mom.

679
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,320
Good night, my child.

680
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,200
mother
