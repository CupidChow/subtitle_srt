1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,640
Blue

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,880
How did you get here?

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,960
Can you hear me?

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,880
What's wrong with the guitar?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,680
Why?

6
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,440
Hey!

7
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,640
How could you do this?

8
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,160
I should ask you.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
How could you do this?

10
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,360
Do you think no one knows?

11
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,760
You should have told me first.

12
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,480
Would you like to
consult with me first?

13
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,720
Time

14
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,000
You shouldn't have said that.

15
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,440
You said we need
to consult you first.

16
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,240
When you do something bad

17
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,200
You can do it alone.

18
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,280
And you should know this.

19
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,920
I feel very ashamed of what
you have done to the club.

20
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,520
Blue

21
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,000
Blue

22
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,040
Blue

23
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,480
Where are you going...

24
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,600
Blue

25
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,280
Time, stop.

26
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,560
What's wrong with you? Why
did I see... a moment ago?

27
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,240
Let's talk later, Cher.

28
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,400
Hey

29
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,960
Go into the house first.

30
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,320
but...

31
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,720
Blue

32
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,440
Blue

33
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,040
be reasonable.

34
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,320
Your reason is...

35
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,840
What is

36
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,960
What you did to our club

37
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,520
Do you realize how rotten it is?

38
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,040
calm down.

39
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,920
Listen to me explanation first.

40
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,200
You don't.

41
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,160
Don't do that, Blue.

42
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,280
Come back.

43
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,000
Didn't you say you love Club?

44
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
You said you love music.

45
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
But what you are doing now

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
Are you betraying
what you love like this?

47
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,880
I've thought about it.

48
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,520
That you will understand us the most

49
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,440
But now I think I were wrong.

50
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,440
It's not what you think, Blue.

51
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:56,880
it...

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,080
It's not like that.

53
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,080
Please come back.

54
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,760
Sorry.

55
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,080
I can't stand it anymore.

56
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,000
Blue

57
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,120
car

58
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,880
Blue

59
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,320
Blue

60
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,200
Hey, you.

61
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,360
Blue

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Hey

63
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,880
What's wrong with you?

64
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,480
Hey

65
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,560
Sir, please call an ambulance.

66
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,680
Hello.

67
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,240
Ambulance

68
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,160
An accident occurred.

69
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,160
At the intersection

70
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,080
Stay and play guitar with us first.

71
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,440
Blue

72
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,080
Please let me see
the injured person.

73
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,880
If the injured person is
unresponsive, CPR must be performed.

74
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,480
you

75
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,120
You guys

76
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,040
mother

77
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,320
Cia

78
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,960
It's okay, It's okay.

79
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm right there.

80
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,960
Cia

81
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,640
It's okay.

82
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,960
It will pass.

83
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,520
No matter what
happens, it will pass.

84
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,360
Cia

85
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,480
It's okay, my child.

86
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,200
It's okay.

87
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,400
Cia

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Sing it out, baby.

89
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,480
If it's uncomfortable

90
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,800
Cry out.

91
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,040
Cry it out.

92
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,000
If Cia is comfortable

93
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,560
If Cia is ready

94
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,520
Or is there something bothering you?

95
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,960
You can tell me.

96
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,600
Are you feeling better now?

97
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,520
yes

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,280
If you have anything
to say, you can tell me.

99
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,680
I don't know what's wrong with me.

100
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,040
Mom, do you remember that?

101
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,080
I once asked you that...

102
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,440
If we encounter something mysterious

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,120
Or something that

104
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,320
Can't see

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,800
And then we...

106
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,000
Become very attached to that thing.

107
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,080
Yes.

108
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,360
I believes it.

109
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,640
If we think well

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,040
Good things will come to us.

111
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,000
already

112
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,520
If one day...

113
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,320
Something that is
most connected to us

114
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,960
It's gone.

115
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,400
Cia

116
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,400
Everything is according to time.

117
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,760
It's in the hands of the gods.

118
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,080
You knows, right?

119
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,640
One day

120
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
I must be old too.

121
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,160
I must be sick.

122
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,080
And then I might not
be with Cia like today.

123
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,760
Mom

124
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,280
Cia

125
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,480
It's something that everyone
has to face in real life, son.

126
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,080
Mom,

127
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
If it happens that...

128
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm...

129
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,720
Fall in love with someone

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,200
What do you think ?

131
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,120
That's good.

132
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,200
Does Cia have a boyfriend?

133
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,840
And what if...

134
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,880
Cia's Love

135
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,840
It may not be correct.

136
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,800
or...

137
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,880
It might not please you.

138
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,880
What did you say?

139
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,760
Cia, listen to me.

140
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,040
I doesn't blame you at all.

141
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,120
love...

142
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,280
It's not just about what's
right or what's pleasing, Cia.

143
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,600
Love must have no conditions.

144
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,120
It depends on two people.

145
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,240
Look at the my story
about your father.

146
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,240
We try unconditionally.

147
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,120
But what is important

148
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
It's trust.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,520
and understanding each other

150
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,520
But anyway, not
too soon, not too late.

151
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
We may have to say goodbye

152
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
We won't break up.

153
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,160
We might part ways in other ways.

154
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,240
This is the truth of human life.

155
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,920
Thank you, Mom.

156
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,320
Are you feeling better now?

157
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,760
Then go check the lights
in the kitchen for me.

158
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,440
It's off. I don't know
if it's broken or not.

159
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,840
Please go check it out for me.

160
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
It's nothing, Mom.

161
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,960
mom

162
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,200
Thank you.

163
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,840
Yes, my child.

164
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,760
I love you the most in the world.

165
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,720
I love you too, Cia.

166
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
There are only two of us.

167
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,280
Play hard and practice hard to
achieve your dreams, my child.

168
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,360
And don't forget to study hard.

169
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,600
Yes, Mom.

170
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,880
Hug again

171
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,040
Love, does your face look brighter?

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,560
Me?

173
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,360
Yes, it's like someone who
just went through an obstacle.

174
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,640
It's true. Your face looks
very fresh and cute too.

175
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,520
Hey, is that Cia?

176
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,960
Cia

177
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,800
Cia

178
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,160
Cia

179
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,800
What are you so gloomy about?

180
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,080
I'm a little tired these days.

181
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,160
What have you been doing? Haven't
you already submitted all your work?

182
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,360
Are you practicing music hard?

183
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,560
Well

184
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,560
a little

185
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
Get plenty of rest, Cia.

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,040
If I lose my voice,
it will be really bad.

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,960
Thank you Love.

188
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,320
Then, should we go study together?

189
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,120
Let's go. Let's go.

190
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,480
Let's go study.

191
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,640
What is it?

192
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,120
Oh, Q!

193
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,080
what

194
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,040
This is heavy.

195
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,840
It's not ours, so we
have to do it for you.

196
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,680
Let's help each
other and make merit.

197
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,160
Hey, is that P'Time?

198
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,200
Have you seen Cia?

199
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,560
I don't see it, bro.

200
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,880
Why are you asking for it?

201
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,960
forget it

202
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,200
Please return this
drum to him quickly.

203
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,480
I'm going now.

204
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,920
Time

205
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,520
The Day Blue Died

206
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
What happened?

207
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,760
It was the biggest
mistake in my life.

208
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,520
I'm made my friend I
loved the most leave.

209
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,960
I understand.

210
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,280
but...

211
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,680
The truth is the truth.

212
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,640
if...

213
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You don't want to tell.

214
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
It's not a problem.

215
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,160
Please come back.

216
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,880
Blue

218
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,800
car

219
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,760
Blue

220
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,840
okay

221
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,040
I understand everything now.

222
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,960
but...

223
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,640
You know, right?

224
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,640
that...

225
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,760
You're also part of
what caused Blue to die.

226
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,960
But I don't dare tell
anyone about this.

227
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,960
I made my friend I
loved the most leave.

228
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,920
Time

229
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,880
I'm so apologize.

230
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,720
That always makes you
feel guilty about our deaths.

231
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,080
I'm

232
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,040
So sorry

233
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,400
if

234
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,840
Destroying the good
feelings between Blue and Sia

235
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,960
What do you think of me, Cia?

236
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,080
What do you think?

237
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,680
What do you mean, Time?

238
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,640
Well

239
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,320
What does you think of me?

240
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,760
You also...

241
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,200
You're always been
a good brother to me.

242
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,600
I feel good with Cia.

243
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,320
Since the first day we met

244
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,240
Especially when I saw
Cia practicing music

245
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,760
Commitment

246
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,480
Cia's efforts

247
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,080
It makes me feel good
in an indescribable way.

248
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,120
What does Cia think of me?

249
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,320
I like you.

250
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,440
Time...

251
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,240
I feel that... 252 You're one of
the very good brothers in the club.

252
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,080
You're one of
the very good brothers in the club.

253
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,280
And then

254
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,560
He is an older brother who...

255
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,400
Like to give opportunities
to the new generation

256
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,240
Who wants to be a musician

257
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,920
but

258
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm...

259
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,280
I never thought about you.

260
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,240
Much more than brother.

261
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,040
Cia

262
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,200
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,760
Thank you very much for

264
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,360
Good feelings

265
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,120
And then there are
good opportunities

266
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,560
Can I have a chance?

267
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,840
Please give me a chance to love you.

268
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,960
Can I take care of you?

269
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Time

270
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,320
Don't let our story be

271
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,560
It must end with this feeling.

272
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm

273
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,080
I still respect and admire you.

274
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,400
When the day comes when
everyone must say goodbye

275
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
For whatever reason

276
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,800
The people who suffer the most are those
who never get the chance to say goodbye.

277
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,280
Just like this song

278
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,080
To end this night with...

279
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,600
Reddot Music Love

280
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,160
Where are you going?

281
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,320
Why did you come back here?

282
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,000
Hey!

283
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,520
Time

284
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,720
Time Time Time

285
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,120
Time

286
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,040
Time

287
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,160
That intersection over
there is really scary.

288
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,880
It's true that Time
isn't hurt too badly.

289
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,880
It's really scary.

290
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,600
What's going on?

291
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,840
Where have you been?

292
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,080
Something happened to Time.

293
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
what happened

294
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,720
The university page reported that

295
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,800
A student had an accident.

296
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,120
Be warned, because it is dangerous.

297
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,840
Time might have been hit by
a car in the middle of the night.

298
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,280
What does it mean?

299
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
It's a music club page...

300
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,800
They said that the person
who had the accident was...

301
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,320
Time, president of the music club...

302
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:58,960
Blue

303
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,960
Cia

304
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,840
Who are you looking for?

305
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,000
How is Time?

306
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
Time?

307
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,320
Now he feel better.

308
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,640
Q and Type went to
watch since morning.

309
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,560
I'm here to pack up our
things in the club room.

310
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,400
I'll follow you in the afternoon.

311
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,600
Are you coming with me?

312
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I like Cia.

313
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
I have project submissions.

314
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,360
Let's follow along now.

315
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,000
If there's anything, just tell me.

316
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,880
I feel weird.

317
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,160
What's weird?

318
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,880
It's the intersection where
Brother Time had the accident...

319
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,040
It's not a shortcut or a
way back to Time's room.

320
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,120
I don't know why he went there.

321
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,920
Where is the intersection?

322
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,200
The intersection where
our university students

323
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,240
There was an accident 2 years ago.

324
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,680
Where the news went quiet

325
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,040
That one.

326
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,360
Dead.

327
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,480
car

328
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,520
Blue

329
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,680
Are you listening to me?

330
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,440
Cia

331
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,840
But luckily,

332
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,520
That Time is not badly hurt.

333
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,400
Type tells us

334
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,320
The person who saw
the incident said that...

335
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,080
When Time got out of the car

336
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,880
It looks like a motorcycle
has crashed into me.

337
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,320
And then

338
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,360
Time's body

339
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,320
It bounced off.

340
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,160
Before the motorcycle
crashed into him

341
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,120
Then I said that feel like

342
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,760
I got goosebumps.

343
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
What's wrong with you?

344
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,480
I think you're lost in thought
and thinking about Time.

345
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,960
If there's anything, I'll tell you.

346
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,960
I will go first.

347
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,920
See you

348
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,920
Blue

349
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,440
Where are you?

350
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,200
Are you in here?

351
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,560
Can you please not do this?

352
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,200
Don't hurt Time.

353
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Time has admitted all his guilt.

354
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,440
come out.

355
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,400
Don't leave me like this, okay?

356
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
Where did you say you would?

357
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,600
Stay here and help me.

358
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,080
And then

359
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,520
Will be watching to see me succeed

360
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,800
So where are you going now?

361
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,800
You're really not going
to come out, are you?

362
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,520
Hey, Cia, what's wrong?
You're not going to class...

363
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,360
Hey, what's wrong?

364
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,760
Why are you crying?

365
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,920
What's wrong with you, Cia?

366
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,400
Cia

367
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What's wrong? You
don't look so good today.

368
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,240
Did you go to play music at night?

369
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,360
nothing

370
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,000
just

371
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,240
I'm currently preparing new songs.

372
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,200
So...

373
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,000
I don't get much sleep.

374
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,120
Take care of yourself.

375
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,800
TRUE

376
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,520
It's almost the end of the semester.

377
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,960
The projects are also increasing.

378
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,400
Thank you very much everyone.

379
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
But...

380
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,320
Are you just stressed
about composing songs?

381
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,800
We've been together for a long time.

382
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,480
How could I not know that there
was something bothering me?

383
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,800
You're smart.

384
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,480
Is this a compliment? It's weird.

385
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,520
Cia

386
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
If you have anything that
makes you uncomfortable

387
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,720
Tell us about it, don't
keep it to yourself.

388
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,840
is...

389
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,280
I have a little problem with Time.

390
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
I'm...

391
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,320
I already know about Time's past.

392
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,680
but...

393
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,600
The night before
Time had an accident

394
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,800
I don't know...

395
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,280
Is Time thinking too
much because of this?

396
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,920
Cia, don't think about anything.

397
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,640
It's not about you.

398
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,800
but...

399
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,520
There is another thing.

400
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,840
What else?

401
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,280
Liu, calm down.

402
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,560
Let Cia review what
he wanted to say first.

403
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,040
Thank you Love.

404
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,360
It's a story.

405
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,320
In the club before we came in

406
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:39,920
But...

407
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,600
forget it

408
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,600
Time has expressed all his feelings.

409
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,080
If there's anything I can
help with, please tell me.

410
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
You always have us.

411
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,360
thank you

412
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,560
but

413
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,560
Iprobably won't be
able to go to class today.

414
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,000
I will go.

415
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,800
If you have anything, just tell me.

416
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,960
Keep fighting, Cia. We are
waiting to hear your song.

417
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,840
fight

418
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,080
fight

419
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,640
fight

420
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,400
See you.

421
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,080
bye bye

422
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,560
Hurry back to class.

423
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,400
bye bye

424
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,800
Come back safely.

425
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Everything is you

426
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,840
Will you come back?

427
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,480
I look forward to seeing
your success, Cia.

428
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,000
Hello my dear

429
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,640
How did you get here?

430
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Hello everyone.

431
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,320
Sorry for being late.

432
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,040
Come late

433
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,640
Jod

434
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,720
Ja sis

435
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,400
It just so happens that when I speak in
a vague way, it probably floats in too.

436
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,080
Don't worry everyone.

437
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,640
No one will bother you anymore.

438
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,080
Tonight, Cee will sleep with Jod.

439
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,200
Where is the accommodation?

440
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,760
Jod, please take Cee
to put away the things.

441
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,080
Go quickly!

442
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,400
Bye bye Jod

443
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,360
Are these weird?

444
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,880
Come on, we've known
each other for a long time.

445
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,160
Let's not be at odds
with each other.

446
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,560
I think so.

447
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,720
Another thing

448
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,720
They themselves have changed a lot.

449
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,280
Okay, that's fine.

450
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,400
Considered to be with
fellow human beings

451
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,880
Lately, it hasn't
bothered me anymore.

452
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,160
And then

453
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,000
Type, I understand it.

454
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,800
Just have to keep watching.

455
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,760
I understand.

456
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,520
okay

457
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,440
And then

458
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,560
Let me go up to my room first.

459
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,120
I want to finish clearing the song.

460
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,000
yes

461
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,720
Follow me up.

462
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,880
We'll follow you up.

463
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,760
Come quickly.

464
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,000
Show up without saying anything

465
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,600
Well

466
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,040
surprise!

467
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,320
That's such a surprise.

468
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Are our friends shocked?

469
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,800
Why are you shocked?

470
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,560
I'm not ghosts.

471
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,720
Sea Ghost

472
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,040
Emerging in the middle of the sea

473
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,600
Then I can go back.

474
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,760
Hey, wait a minute.

475
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,240
What's Cia calling about now?

476
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,200
Hello, friend. called
to ask for help.

477
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,680
I'll say that I'm back
to composing songs.

478
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,160
Thank you for reporting to me.

479
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,880
Is that all you want to say to me?

480
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,200
Yes, that's it.

481
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,400
That's all.

482
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,680
Hey, come quickly, go quickly.

483
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,440
Okay, we're going back now.

484
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Hey!

485
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
Don't be mad.

486
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,480
Put away your things so we can
hurry down and go play in the water.

487
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,320
okay

488
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,960
Put away your things so we can
hurry down and go play in the water.

489
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,160
Don't be mad.

490
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,560
You

491
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,000
What did you prepare?

492
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Go play in the water

493
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,000
Do you want to wear sunscreen?
The sun is very strong today.

494
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,880
Do you want to wear sunscreen?
The sun is very strong today.

495
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,720
Let me see.

496
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,040
Please do it for me.

497
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,080
Here, apply it yourself.

498
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,640
Stop wasting my time.

499
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,560
What?

500
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,880
The weather is nice today.

501
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,160
It's nice to finally have a
chance to really relax together.

502
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,040
True, I will take the opportunity
to bring Sia along for the trip.

503
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,960
So that you won't be stressed.

504
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,560
I have something I
want to accomplish.

505
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,520
Really, Jod?

506
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,520
I'm so serious guys.

507
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,400
I really want to make it happen.

508
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,040
To my YouTube channel

509
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,520
Just started getting followers

510
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,560
Just started to gain fans

511
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,960
People are just starting
to really like our content.

512
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,240
But at least it lets me know that...

513
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,120
Past efforts have shown results.

514
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,560
I know you can do it.

515
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,280
You are someone we enjoy being with.

516
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,200
Other people who saw your
clip must have enjoyed it too.

517
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,040
No matter what the
future holds for you

518
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,240
While pursuing your
dreams, there will be obstacles

519
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,840
Or maybe there are times
when you get discouraged

520
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
But you still have us.

521
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,120
Jod

522
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,160
yes

523
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,280
We will be fans

524
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,960
Jod's number one forever

525
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,680
Thank you Love.

526
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,200
Thanks to you guys too.

527
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,120
Let's see, Jodjy Yesterday

528
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,880
Has the most followers in Thailand

529
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,280
Good job my friend.

530
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,720
And Liu

531
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,960
What will happen in foreign affairs?

532
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,160
It's almost time.

533
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,240
I already thought so.

534
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,000
I probably won't go anymore.

535
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Oh, why?

536
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,040
Well...

537
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,960
Stay with you guys
first, isn't that good?

538
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,920
It's not that it's bad.

539
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,800
But this is Liu's future.

540
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,960
Just wait until I graduate
with you guys first.

541
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,880
Then decide.

542
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,560
The story isn't difficult at all.

543
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,760
As for me, I will probably
wait for Chertam to graduate.

544
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,680
And then I'll probably take her

545
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,560
Go live abroad with her family.

546
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,320
I think we will plan to
study there at the same time.

547
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,080
Very cool!

548
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,440
And you?

549
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,360
Me?

550
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,640
I haven't thought about it yet.

551
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,960
But basically

552
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,080
Go help run the family business.

553
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,240
It's good to work with family.

554
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,240
Be with the people we love

555
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,160
Let's playing in the water.

556
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,720
Hey, what's this?

557
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,880
Come on, let's play in the water.

558
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,680
Come

559
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,440
Have you finished learning?

560
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,360
Yes, I just finished. Are you arriving yet?

561
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,360
There was a lot of traffic. I
went to drop Jod off, so I was late.

562
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,360
I'm sorry, I'll be calling soon.

563
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,320
It's okay. I'll wait at the same place.

564
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,840
Hello, what?

565
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,800
Hello Ploy

566
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,440
The facial cleanser you left for me

567
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,360
Can I use it?

568
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,600
Facial cleanser

569
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,480
