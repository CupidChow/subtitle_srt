1
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,960
thanks so much for telling me.

2
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,200
He brings nothing to the table,

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
but somehow landed a fiancée
ten times better than he deserves.

4
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,400
Here you go, miss.

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:51,680
yes

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,880
These are the documents

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,080
for the university.

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,640
Your father said not to forget

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,720
Thank you so much.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,400
Um... if my parents ask,

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,200
could you please let them know he
picked me up and took good care of me?

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,520
You sure about this, Miss?

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,320
This is how I’ll find out

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,080
what kind of person he really is.

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,880
If you say so, Miss...

16
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Can’t talk right now
call me back later, okay?

17
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
I could take you, if you'd like.

18
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,960
It’s all good, I’ll go by myself. Just
need to make a quick stop to see a friend!

19
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,720
Okay! Catch you
later, in the evening!

20
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,760
Hmm, well then, I’ll go now!

21
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,720
Be good and focus on
your studies, my clever girl.

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,320
Bye bye!

23
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,840
You can do it, my smart little one!

24
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,200
Where could you be, Blue?

25
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,280
Oh, Cia.

26
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,240
Are you working on the song?

27
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,680
How’s it going, is it sounding good?

28
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,400
It's quite alright.

29
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,280
Whoa, not just good enough anymore!

30
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
You’ve really improved a lot!

31
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,480
Did you take more lessons, or...

32
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,280
has someone been teaching you?

33
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,880
The one who taught me is...

34
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,440
is...

35
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,640
Well, actually, it’s YouTube! I just
watch the videos and practice on my own.

36
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,640
Wow, you’re really good! If you
can learn this well on your own,

37
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,680
I bet being a pro is
just around the corner.

38
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,960
Brother Tham also said too much.

39
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,600
TRUE

40
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,560
You’re too kind, haha!
But thank you, really.

41
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,160
Can I sit with you?

42
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,120
yes

43
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,160
Hey, Cia… can I ask you something?

44
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
That last song you played last night

45
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,000
do you know the person
who originally sang it?

46
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
Hmm, I don’t actually know them.

47
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,880
I just found the song online

48
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,560
and thought it sounded really nice…

49
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,840
so I tried to figure
it out and play it.

50
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,480
But the way you're asking me...

51
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,320
does that mean you know the song?

52
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Ah, well… the song just
sounded kinda familiar.

53
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Maybe I’ve heard it online or on...

54
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,120
the radio while driving around.

55
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,200
Where are you at with the
song? Let me give you a hand.

56
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,760
okay

57
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,160
I’m almost done.

58
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,080
You’ve really stepped up your game!

59
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,320
Can you do it?

60
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,200
Dude, look at this mess… the room’s a
total disaster. What the hell do I even do?

61
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,200
Bro! Is silence like…
impossible for you or what?!

62
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Oh... uh, you're here already?

63
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,520
Yes, bro.

64
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,760
I was helping Cia with the new song,

65
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,960
but hey, now that you’re here,
let’s practice as a band! Come on.

66
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, let’s practice, bro.

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,720
Yup, practice,

68
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,360
practice, practice!

69
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,280
practice!

70
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
By the way,

71
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,760
is Type not coming again?

72
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,120
Type's busy with stuff...

73
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,440
Yep, he's busy with
a bunch of things

74
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,840
Man, he’s got so much going on

75
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,600
yes

76
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,440
Whatever,

77
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,160
I’ll fill in for him
again like I usually do

78
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,280
Go and prepare your things.

79
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
You? Play? Really?

80
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,880
I’m not bothering you guys, am I?

81
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,600
What do you mean, bothering
me? What’s up with that?

82
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,920
Forget it,

83
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,720
he meant he’s bothering
you to step in for Type,

84
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,400
right See?

85
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,160
Yes, yes, bro. Yes, right.

86
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,760
Come on, don’t act
like you’re all shy now!

87
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,440
Come on, Let’s just practice!

88
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,240
go

89
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,080
Let's go practice.

90
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,800
Let's go. Let's practice.

91
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,720
I am going to a club tonight.

92
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,640
And why are you telling me this, Cee?

93
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,280
I just wanted to tell you. Is that a problem?

94
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,480
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
So what time are you going?

95
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,360
Gonna head back, change, and
go out. Why are you asking me?

96
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,960
I didn't want to know.

97
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,640
Yeah, you two are pretty chill.

98
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,760
I haven’t been to
the club much lately.

99
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,760
Well, it’d be nice if you
showed up sometime.

100
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,240
What if Time brings Cia to
replace you? What would you do?

101
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,560
Yeah, yeah, whenever
I’m in the mood, I’ll pop by.

102
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,720
But...

103
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,720
So, what’s going on with
you and Love? How’s it going?

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,920
I don’t know,

105
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
we’re just talking normally.

106
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,440
You sure about that?

107
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
I think Love might be
too good for me, honestly.

108
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,520
Wow, it’s that serious, huh?

109
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,360
Why are you asking me this, Q?

110
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,640
Nah,

111
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,640
I just heard Mira’s coming back.

112
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,920
Okay, I understand.

113
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,280
Mira’s your fiancée after all.

114
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Why the hell do you care about
my stuff? What’s your problem?

115
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,960
Nah, I just don’t want you
to get stressed out, man.

116
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,920
With everything going on
with Cia, it’s enough already.

117
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,160
They're tough to get rid of.

118
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,120
Mention them and

119
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,240
their friends just pop up.

120
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,600
Where the hell is Cee?

121
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,360
Said he’d come, and now?

122
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,000
Not a damn trace.

123
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,280
Fine, I’ll just go then.

124
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,440
He looks kinda familiar…
but nah, probably not.

125
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,600
And now?

126
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Liu

127
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,640
Dude, why are you here?

128
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,360
Uh... I came to wait for you.

129
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
You said you'd be here, didn’t you?

130
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,600
Weird… you don’t usually come here.

131
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,800
Did I ever say I was coming?

132
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey! Come on, cheers!

133
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,040
cheers!

134
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,480
Cheers?

135
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:28,960
Hell yeah, cheers!

136
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I was done drinking
but fine, cheers!

137
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,520
Type,

138
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,520
I swear

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,960
that girl at that table

140
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,280
is totally checking you out.

141
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,280
Where?!

142
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,120
Damn, that was fast.

143
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay, so let me tell
you what happened.

144
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,960
It was today, right? Me and him we
walk into the clubroom like normal.

145
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,480
Just a little late, okay?
Just a tiny bit late.

146
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,560
And bro... the moment we
opened the door holy sh*t...

147
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,720
Brooo they were
hugging, like for real!

148
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,040
And their faces? This close like they were
about to kiss, man! I swear! I was like,

149
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,040
holy sh*t, C! What the hell, bro?!

150
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,520
You were there with me, weren’t
you? True. But seriously, just stop.

151
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,000
What? Why?

152
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,280
Look at him. He’s completely zoned out. Not
listening to a damn thing you’re saying!

153
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,040
I’m almost finished,

154
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,040
but I still got some
left in my drink!

155
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,840
Guess we’re not done
at the same time, huh?

156
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Come on! Come on!

157
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,720
How are you getting back?

158
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,440
I’m driving back.

159
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,400
No, nothing at all. No, nothing.

160
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,840
Nothing left! What are
you even looking for?

161
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,400
What? I wasn’t looking at anything,
Anyway, where’d you bring the girl from?

162
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,160
Here’s my friend, KarnKaew and Ping.

163
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,920
And this is Jod,

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,280
but you guys don’t need
to get too familiar with him.

165
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,520
Let’s go into the club.

166
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,280
And you, just follow
me if you’re coming.

167
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,920
Can I join for a toast?

168
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,880
Alright, whose is this one now?

169
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,680
Sure, let’s sit together later!

170
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,760
What is your name?

171
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,960
I'm Cat, I’m just here to have
some fun with you guys today.

172
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,920
Sure.

173
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,880
okay

174
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,360
Come sit over here, Cat.

175
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,400
Come on, come on!

176
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,320
Well, the traffic was bad today.

177
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,200
Heyyy!

178
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,040
What’s up?

179
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,640
Uh, I’m gonna go to the bathroom
for a sec. I’ll be right back.

180
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,120
What? Didn’t you just
go to the bathroom?

181
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,280
Yeah, yeah, I’ll be
back in a minute.

182
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,920
Forget it.

183
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,080
Cat,

184
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,720
I think we should head
to that table over there.

185
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,560
This spot’s not really right for us.

186
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,320
okay

187
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,320
How’d you get here?

188
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,680
Uh... I...

189
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,040
I came with Liu.

190
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,480
Liu asked me to come as a friend.

191
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,680
What? You just...

192
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,360
Found the table, huh?

193
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,920
Let’s go, let’s go!

194
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,560
Hey, wait!

195
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,160
Liu, go sit at the table first.

196
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,040
Hold on, let me
talk to Jod for a sec.

197
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,160
Let me go talk to Jod about
the influencer work for a sec.

198
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,520
Come with me for a sec.

199
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,120
just a sec!

200
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,360
Let go of my arm!

201
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,920
Nope, not letting go!

202
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,640
If you don’t, I’ll
punch you in the face!

203
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,360
Alright, alright, I’ll let go!

204
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,640
Ugh, enough.

205
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,240
I’m serious, did you
really come with Liu?

206
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,280
Yeah, I did...

207
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
Liu asked me to come as a friend. She brought
her elementary school friend to hang out.

208
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,200
What are you looking at?

209
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
Looking for a heart.

210
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,080
You really don’t practice
what you preach, huh?

211
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,800
What’s your deal, huh?

212
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,640
How can someone’s words
ever match their heart?

213
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,320
They can. Haven’t you
seen it happen before?

214
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Then show me.

215
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,520
Show me how to make your words

216
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,720
match your heart.

217
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,640
But you have to promise, okay?

218
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,840
Just stand there and watch.

219
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,400
Ugh, you're being so dramatic.
You trying to show off or something?

220
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,680
Promise me first.

221
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,320
Fine.

222
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,880
Don’t move.

223
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,840
Here we go.

224
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,360
...See? My mouth finally
matches your heart.

225
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,080
That good enough for you?

226
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,920
You’re such an idiot...
that was so dumb.

227
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,240
Was that your idea of a grand
performance or something?

228
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,440
Impressed yet? I’ve got
you blushing non-stop.

229
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,840
Yeah, this is the
place. Totally worth it.

230
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,360
Good vibes, good-looking
guys—serious eye candy.

231
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,280
The cocktails? Top notch.

232
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,320
You can't miss this, Liu.

233
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,480
I hope it’s really as good
as you say, KarnKaew.

234
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,680
It’s legit, I confirm it.
I’ve been here a lot.

235
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,600
Look at you, coming
without inviting me!

236
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,520
Like, can you go
out with me anytime?

237
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,600
Well...

238
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,680
I have someone keeping me in check.

239
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,400
Is that type? On the sofa.

240
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,200
Where?

241
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:52,920
Where?

242
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,440
On the sofa

243
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,200
No need to look,

244
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,920
I’ll keep an eye on that
handsome guy for you instead.

245
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,400
Hey, Liu.

246
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,200
You and Type go to the
same university, right?

247
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,040
So, does Type have a girlfriend?

248
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,000
Not yet, just living
life day by day.

249
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,680
Really?

250
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
I heard Type's already engaged.

251
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,240
The engagement's just for business.

252
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,920
They’re not really in love.

253
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,960
I feel dizzy...

254
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,320
Let me borrow your
shoulder for a sec.

255
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,560
Don't throw up, okay?

256
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,000
I’m not gonna throw
up, I just feel dizzy.

257
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,200
I’ve never thrown up before, okay?

258
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,120
You're already tipsy and
still trying to show off?

259
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,960
I’m not tipsy, okay, Jod?

260
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,720
I’ll believe it when I see it.

261
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,120
So,

262
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,600
what about that influencer
work you told me about?

263
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,080
work

264
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,320
What work?

265
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,680
It’s the job you told me about with Liu,
and you dragged me out here, remember?

266
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Oh... the influencer job, right?

267
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,320
But for this job...,

268
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,440
you gotta take photos
with me, only with me.

269
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,320
That’s so weird, why do I
have to take photos with you?

270
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,400
Can your face even pull this off?

271
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,280
Are you fooling me?

272
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,880
Come on, Jod. My face
isn’t any worse than yours.

273
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,280
And why would I fool you?

274
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,600
I brought you this job, remember?

275
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,800
But the catch is,
it’s a couple’s shoot.

276
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,560
So...

277
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,680
why don’t you go
find your girl, huh?

278
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,920
Well, the professor...

279
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,880
wants a male-male couple look.

280
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,920
Fan vibes.

281
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,280
Yeah... I’m heading up to my room.

282
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,480
oh...

283
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,720
Oh what? I’m going to my room.

284
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,640
And you should check the
time, too. It’s getting late.

285
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,040
Three o'clock in the morning

286
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,320
Good time, the ghost said

287
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,080
Are you a ghost?

288
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,360
A cute one.

289
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,520
Alright, I’m going up now.

290
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,520
Do you want me to walk you up?

291
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,760
Enough, No need, really.

292
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,440
See you. You can go now.

293
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,880
Love.

294
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:28,480
Yeah?

295
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:37,520
Nothing, really. Just worried, so I
messaged. You're at home, right?

296
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Yeah, I am.

297
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,360
Can I ask you something? How are
things between you and Type lately?

298
00:18:51,720 --> 00:19:07,440
Can I ask you something? How are
things between you and Type lately?

299
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,480
You're really that worried about
me? There's nothing to worry about.

300
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:16,520
Still, how are things?

301
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,600
Not much. I think Type's been normal.

302
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:28,760
Just… be careful, okay?

303
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,840
I know. Anyway, I'm heading to bed now.

304
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,600
The food is delicious, huh?

305
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,080
Yeah, it's really good.

306
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,320
Wow, wow, wow! Where
have you two been?

307
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,000
You’re both smiling so brightly.

308
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,080
Hey, since you’re spending so much time
together, why not just date already?

309
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,040
What do you think? You guys agree?

310
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,200
I agree.

311
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,080
But when you joined the club,

312
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,880
was it for the music

313
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,520
or just to find a partner?

314
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,080
Why are you guys teasing him?

315
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,720
Hey!

316
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,960
You guys

317
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,960
Keep it down a bit, will
you? You’re talking too much.

318
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,000
Calm down, bro. My
friend was just joking.

319
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,560
Don't take it too far.

320
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,360
You can say anything
to me, I don’t care.

321
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,960
But show some respect to Cia.

322
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
Whoa, Bro.

323
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,520
If it’s not true, why are
you getting so defensive?

324
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,240
That’s enough, Q.

325
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,200
This is just how we are.

326
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,440
If he can’t handle
it, that’s his problem.

327
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,640
Hey, let’s go rehearse
somewhere else, guys.

328
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
For real, man.

329
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,440
Totally ruined my mood.

330
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,760
And where are you going now?

331
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,200
So no one’s gonna answer me, huh?

332
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,840
Don’t worry, Cia.

333
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,320
They’re always like that.

334
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,400
Don’t let it get to you.

335
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,120
Okay.

336
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,720
What should we do for this project?

337
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,400
Sh*t, I forgot to turn
in the assignment!

338
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh yeah.

339
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,600
Wait for me!

340
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,280
Cia

341
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,200
Cia

342
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
I need to talk to you.

343
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,560
I’m in a rush today.

344
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,680
Let’s talk later, okay?

345
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,200
What’s up with him?

346
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,040
How long have I been gone?

347
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,880
But since I’m already here...

348
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,840
Thinking about Chertame
again… I guess I’ll be fine.

349
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,360
Blue

350
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,160
You’re back?

351
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
How are you?

352
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,480
Where have you been?

353
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,560
Are you feeling better now?

354
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,240
Hey, slow down.

355
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,040
One question at a time.

356
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,240
What’s the rush?

357
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,840
Well...

358
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,160
I just... I was afraid you’d
suddenly disappear again.

359
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,120
You’re scared we won’t
see each other again?

360
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,880
Well, yeah.

361
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,920
If you’re worried
about me, just say so.

362
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,080
I’m not worried!

363
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,920
I’m fine. You don’t
have to worry about me.

364
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,960
I said I’m not worried, didn’t I?

365
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,640
Fine. Don’t be worried then.

366
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,120
So...

367
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,360
Do you remember anything?

368
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,040
If it’s about Cherthame...

369
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,200
I remember a lot more now.

370
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,040
Really?!

371
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,560
What else do you remember? Tell me.

372
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,280
It’s hard to explain everything.

373
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,200
I can’t recall all of it.

374
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,680
But I do remember
the things that matter.

375
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,080
Like...

376
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,800
Like what?

377
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,200
Like...

378
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,880
My little sister... she's always
been bright and cheerful.

379
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,200
but...

380
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
if I had to guess,

381
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
she probably isn’t
like that anymore.

382
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,120
Yeah... that's what I thought.

383
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,200
Like I said

384
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,240
if I could just find out the truth,

385
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,160
maybe she could smile again.

386
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,640
And maybe... so could I

387
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,720
You too?

388
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,520
Yeah.

389
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,400
Because I need to go back
to where I came from, too.

390
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,840
Cia

391
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,240
Hmm? There's
something I want to tell you.

392
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,160
Sure.

393
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,920
What is it?

394
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,480
I don’t really know
what’s happening to me...

395
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,880
but certain things,
when they come to me,

396
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,120
it’s like my perception
becomes clearer.

397
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,840
And sometimes...it might
cause me to disappear.

398
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,880
That’s good…

399
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,200
I’m glad you’re starting
to remember more.

400
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,920
Blue

401
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,400
What's wrong with you?

402
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,480
I might be remembering more…

403
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,040
But the closeness
between the two of us…

404
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,520
It might fade away.

405
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,680
I don’t know what’s happening to me.

406
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,040
I don’t know why I
can’t control my powers.

407
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,960
And every time I disappear…

408
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
By the time we meet again,

409
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,680
I keep feeling like…

410
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,120
I won’t be able to stay
by your side anymore.

411
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,840
Blue, don’t overthink it.

412
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,040
What you’re going
through yes, it’s important.

413
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,440
but...

414
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,480
you can’t live without
your memories.

415
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,600
And I truly believe… You
won’t disappear on me again.

416
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,080
I don’t want it to turn
out that way either.

417
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,520
hello

418
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,880
Hey, are you free now?

419
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,280
Yeah, I’m free. What’s up?

420
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,200
You’ve been trying to talk
to me since class ended.

421
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,960
I just really wanna know... Why are you
trying to find someone named Chertham?

422
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,120
I mean… I do wanna
tell you everything.

423
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:29,800
But...

424
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,720
I’m scared you won’t believe me.

425
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,920
Then try me. Just tell me the story.

426
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,600
I know someone…

427
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,680
And they don’t remember
anything about their past.

428
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,120
But after I did some digging,

429
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,640
I found out they might have
a relative named Cherthame.

430
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,960
So I’ve gotta find this
Cherthame person.

431
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,600
I’m hoping it’ll help me learn more.

432
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,200
Mm, I get it now. It
really is important.

433
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,440
That’s why you’ve been
keeping quiet about it, huh?

434
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,960
Yeah, sorry about that.

435
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,960
I didn’t want anyone
to know too much.

436
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,720
But...

437
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,560
But... do you know
someone named Cherthame?

438
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,120
I know a little bit.

439
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,120
Wait, so...

440
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,400
Can you help arrange
for them to meet me?

441
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,800
Sure, just let me know
when you want to meet.

442
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,080
Thanks a lot, dude.

443
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,440
No problem.

444
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,440
Chertame

445
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,480
What's up, Mhok?

446
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,120
Well... My friend needs your help.

447
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,640
CherTame, do you
remember me from that day?

448
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,840
The one who...

449
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,440
in a rush, right?

450
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,560
yes

451
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,320
He said...

452
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,160
you could help him.

453
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,480
So, he wants to meet.

454
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,760
Me?

455
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,800
I don't even know him.

456
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,760
Maybe you've met before,

457
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,680
but I’m not sure either.

458
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,360
I don’t know what he
wants to talk to you about,

459
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,280
but he really seems
like he needs help.

460
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,400
Okay, I’ll help if I can.

461
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,360
After all, he's your friend.

462
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,200
Thanks.

463
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,720
I'll talk to him and see
where we can meet.

464
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,920
I'll let you know again later, okay?

465
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,920
okay

466
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,640
Love,

467
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,640
What are you looking at?

468
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,560
Love, I think we should
go find something to eat.

469
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,360
Hello everyone!

470
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,520
Welcome to

471
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,440
Jodji Yesterday channel!

472
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,280
And today we’re opening
the vlog at the university

473
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,520
I study at.

474
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,240
All of my friends
are here today too.

475
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,000
Let’s go meet them now!

476
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,480
What's wrong with you guys?

477
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,960
Life’s not so happy right?

478
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,040
Got a lot on my mind.

479
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,240
True, especially your stuff.

480
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,440
Wait,

481
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,600
why’s it suddenly about me?

482
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,360
No fighting, kiddos~

483
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Right, mommy?

484
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,800
You’re gonna catch a
kick from me one day, Jod.

485
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,080
Uh… guys, my mom doesn’t
want me home too late today.

486
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,280
So I think I’ll head out first.

487
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,280
Get home safe, Love.

488
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,960
Come back safely.

489
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,920
Mmm, bye-bye.

490
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,360
bye bye

491
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,840
What’s going on here?

492
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,080
What’s up with you guys?

493
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,760
I think we should
go do something fun.

494
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,800
Karaoke, anyone?

495
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,480
Or maybe... another one of his strengths
is how he manages to charm people.

496
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,360
Shy, just like everyone says.

497
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,920
Do we know each other?

498
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,800
Didn’t think we would, to be honest.

499
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,120
So... how far have
you and Type gotten?

500
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,440
...Excuse me?

501
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,560
Type and I are engaged.

502
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,120
It’s for the benefit

503
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
of both our families’ companies.

504
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,560
If I put it that way, does it
make more sense to you?

505
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,880
Engaged?

506
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,640
Even before graduating?

507
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,600
If I had to explain everything,
it’d be a real waste of time.

508
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,560
Let’s just say…

509
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,520
You were just a way for Type to
pass the time when he was lonely.

510
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,640
I don’t think I need
to repeat myself, do I?

511
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,840
Oh… and if possible,

512
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,960
I do hope we won’t have
to see each other again.

513
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,760
Love

514
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,080
Don’t let it get to you.

515
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,240
How am I supposed to ignore it?

516
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,360
She said she’s…

517
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,200
It’s just going to give
you a headache, Love.

518
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,560
Come with me.

519
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,320
No, I’m going home.

520
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,760
Don’t be stubborn come with me.

521
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,960
I feel so bad for Love…

522
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,880
Here's Chertame's contact.

523
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,040
This is Chertame's contact.

524
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,520
Hello, I’m Cia. I'm a friend of
Mhok’s he might’ve mentioned me.

525
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:58,280
Oh, hello. Is there something
you wanted to talk to me about?

526
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,360
Uh, yes. It’s something important I
think you might be able to help me.

527
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,840
What is it?

528
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,640
Could we meet up? I don’t think
chatting here would be convenient.

529
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:20,560
I don’t think I’m very
free these days either.

530
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,760
It’s about Blue.

531
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:33,720
Chertame, I really do need to talk to you.

532
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,960
What should I do now?
Cherthame’s not replying anymore.

533
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,360
I guess I’ll just try calling.

534
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
She hung up on me again.

535
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,680
What I want to know is really important.

536
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,600
If you don’t feel like replying right
now, please at least think about it.

537
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,360
But I really do want to meet and talk to you.

538
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,760
Is my brother that important to you?

539
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,400
Not just to me. I think
he’s important to you too.

540
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:56,800
Alright. But if we meet and I’m not comfortable
answering your questions, I hope you’ll let me leave.

541
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,680
Thank you so much. Would
tomorrow afternoon work for you?

542
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,920
Sure. Just send me the location.

543
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,000
Will do. Thank you so much again.

544
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,880
Chertame, this way.

545
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,040
Hello, Cia.

546
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:26,960
Hi.

547
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,200
Um… thank you so much
for agreeing to meet.

548
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,440
Sure.

549
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,920
So, what is it that you
want to ask me about?

550
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,880
I want to know what
really happened that day…

551
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,680
You mean,

552
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,320
what happened to Blue?

553
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,840
Why are you asking

554
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
about Blue all of a sudden?

555
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,120
I mean…

556
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,840
it's been quite a
while since it all ended.

557
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,960
And besides…

558
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,120
I don't think you even
knew Blue personally.

559
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,320
So why do you…

560
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,400
Um…

561
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,920
I was a junior

562
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,520
in the same club as him.

563
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,680
I only saw him a few
times when I first joined.

564
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Then I found out

565
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,280
he stopped coming...

566
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,000
So I got curious about
what really happened.

567
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,400
So…

568
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,480
in the end, do you know what
really happened, Cherthame?

569
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,840
Nothing really happened.

570
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,920
Nothing happened?

571
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,160
What do you mean by that?

572
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:31,880
Then...

573
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,480
where did Blue go?

574
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,360
What did happen?

575
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,560
That's enough, Cia.

576
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,800
Cia, why do you even want to know?

577
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,800
Even my family

578
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,600
doesn’t want to talk about Blue.

579
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,000
They don’t even
want to think about it.

580
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,320
It’s just…

581
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,560
I…

582
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,800
I saw that he loved
music, just like I do.

583
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,880
yes

584
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,640
Music was Blue’s dream.

585
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,000
And…

586
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,120
no one ever told you anything?

587
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,120
Even if I wanted to hear it,

588
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,160
no one wanted to talk about it.

589
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,840
I still haven’t come to terms
with what happened to Blue.

590
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,200
That’s why the people
around me barely mention him.

591
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,920
Even the bits I know...

592
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,920
just stop, Cia.

593
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,960
I don’t want to think
about this anymore.

594
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,880
I don’t even want to know

595
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,920
who was with Blue last.

596
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,680
Chertham, please calm down.

597
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,000
I understand how hard this must be,

598
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,520
but…

599
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,840
I didn’t mean to upset you.

600
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,640
Blue’s best friend…

601
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,320
was the one who
was with him that night.

602
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,080
Oh, Cia.

603
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,200
You’re back?

604
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,760
How was it? Are you tired?

605
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,360
Not really… not too tired.

606
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,840
But...

607
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
But what?

608
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,800
How many close friends do you have?

609
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,080
Um… just one.

610
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Just one? Are you sure?

611
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,720
Yeah, Time. You know him, don’t you?

612
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,280
sighs Time… just Tham, huh?

613
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,400
Yeah.

614
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,760
I don’t lie to people
all the time, you know.

615
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,200
Are you sure?

616
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,680
Mm-hmm. I’m sure…

617
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,280
Well, at least, as far
as I can remember.

618
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,640
In the clubroom,

619
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,800
it’s always just been Tham
and me, with that same old guitar.

620
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,360
Well...

621
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,280
I met Cherthame today.

622
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,120
Really?

623
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,640
Um... so, how’s my sister doing?

624
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,880
She still hasn’t really come to
terms with what happened to you.

625
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,800
But...

626
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,880
Try not to overthink it.

627
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,240
Your sister...

628
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,840
She’s trying her best too.

629
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,720
As for the details about that day...

630
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,080
Maybe we can talk
about it some other time.

631
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,360
She...

632
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,480
doesn’t seem quite ready
to open up about it yet.

633
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,680
Thanks a lot, Cia.

634
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,360
Hey, don’t worry.

635
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,760
Here how about I play the
guitar for you? Sound good?

636
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,280
Blue

637
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,840
Can you just be reasonable for once?

638
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,880
What the hell even
is your reason, huh?

639
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,400
Do you even realize

640
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,480
how messed up the crap

641
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,920
you did to our club is? Huh?!

642
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,520
Blue

643
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,200
Blue

644
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,280
Blue
