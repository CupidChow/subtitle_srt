1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,840
Everything is you

2
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,480
Blue...

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Are you around here?

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,000
Where are you, Blue?

5
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,280
I'm begging you...

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,160
Can you please come back to me?

7
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,120
I don’t want you to disappear ever again.

8
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,800
I want to stay right here...

9
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,440
in your arms.

10
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,440
I don’t want you to go anywhere either.

11
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,960
I just want to be here...

12
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
wrapped in your warm embrace.

13
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,240
What should we eat tonight?

14
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,880
Yeah, what should we eat?

15
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,800
Barbecue?

16
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,320
Sure, sounds good.

17
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,520
Then let’s go buy.

18
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,400
Cia

19
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,680
Huh? Yeah what?

20
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,600
Who was that?

21
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,800
Huh? Who what?

22
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,120
A friend, Cia?

23
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,880
Wait a sec.

24
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,040
Don’t tell me that…

25
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,800
You guys...

26
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,920
saw?

27
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,120
It’s already evening, man.

28
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,960
What are you playing?

29
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,560
Uh… hey everyone,

30
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,160
I’m Blue. I’m a friend of Cia’s.

31
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,320
I met Sia at the music store,

32
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,080
then I saw their IG story,
so I just… followed them here.

33
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Why do you look so familiar?

34
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Hey, that's enough.

35
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,280
Blue

36
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
studies somewhere else,

37
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,720
you don’t know them.

38
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,200
Jod

39
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,200
why don’t you take Cee to shower?

40
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,640
He just got out of the pool, he’s all soaked.

41
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,480
Everyone, go shower.

42
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,040
Go on, get changed!

43
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Alright, here’s the plan

44
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
Blue and I will go grab some food outside,

45
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,400
and we’ll cook dinner together tonight.

46
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,560
Sound good?

47
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,800
Sounds great! The vibe is so nice

48
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
with all of us here.

49
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,440
I’ll go take a shower,

50
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,960
then I’ll come down and help you, Cia.

51
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay.

52
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,800
Let’s go, Liu.

53
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,360
Jod, help Cee too.

54
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,560
Let’s go, let’s go,

55
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,560
out you go!

56
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,400
Alright, I’m heading out

57
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:45,760
see you later!

58
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,400
see you.

59
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,280
see you.

60
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,520
Go take a shower already.

61
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,200
Bye bye!

62
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,920
See you!

63
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,920
Where are you going?

64
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,800
Come on.

65
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,280
What is wrong with you?

66
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,800
Did my friends just see you?

67
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,240
...Yeah. They did.

68
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,320
They did.

69
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,560
And the others?

70
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,120
I think so, yeah.

71
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,160
Uh, excuse me

72
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,600
can you see my friend here?

73
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,880
Yep, I can.

74
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,000
And... wow.

75
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,400
You’re really good-looking, you know that?

76
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,640
You look like an actor.

77
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,840
Ever thought about doing a BL series?

78
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,320
Haha, thanks.

79
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,040
Thank you.

80
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,160
You can really see them, right?

81
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,600
Of course I can. Are you okay?

82
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,560
Uh... yeah,

83
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,960
yeah.

84
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,640
So... you’re really back?

85
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,840
Like physically back?

86
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,240
And...

87
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,120
people can see you?

88
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,480
Is this really happening?

89
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,480
It’s done! My homemade barbecue!

90
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,320
Whoa, that looks so good.

91
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,800
I’m starving just looking at it!

92
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
It looks so good, Liu!

93
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,120
There’s even fruit!

94
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,760
I made this piece just for you, love.

95
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,080
thank you

96
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,360
Everyone,

97
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,640
How about this?

98
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Since we already...

99
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,240
got to hear Blue’s beautiful music,

100
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
I actually have a song

101
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,240
I want everyone to listen to too.

102
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,360
And on this special occasion...

103
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,160
I want to say sorry.

104
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,320
What’s up with you, Cee?

105
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,800
Getting all emotional out of nowhere.

106
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,040
Just listen for a sec, okay?

107
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
I want to say sorry to everyone

108
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,880
for all the things me and my friends

109
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
ever messed up.

110
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,040
So tonight...

111
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,480
can we listen to Cia’s song?

112
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,520
Huh? What song?

113
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,040
The song you once wrote...

114
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,080
the one...

115
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,360
me and my friends stole and gave to Time.

116
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,520
I believe…

117
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,560
you want to sing that song for everyone.

118
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,880
And I also

119
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,640
Believe that

120
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,400
everyone sitting here

121
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,920
wants to hear your song too.

122
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,440
Sing it!

123
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,560
Come on, sing it!

124
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,640
Sing it!

125
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,720
Come on, sing it!

126
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,440
Sing it!

127
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,440
Sing it, at least the song you once wrote

128
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,400
is still here.

129
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,520
So…

130
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,920
could you play the guitar for me?

131
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,000
At the very least,

132
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,800
you’ll be a part

133
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,400
of this song with me.

134
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,520
Sure, I’d love to.

135
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
1 2 3 go

136
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,160
Hello, Time.

137
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,240
About the sponsor. Thank you so much, man.

138
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,480
The event went really well today.

139
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,080
Nah, don’t worry about it. It was nothing.

140
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,520
Still, give Sia some
encouragement for me, alright?

141
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,000
Sure thing.

142
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,280
Let’s catch up later I’m keeping
an eye on the shop for now.

143
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,800
Alright.

144
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,640
The vibe’s really nice tonight.

145
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,280
Yeah, totally.

146
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,560
I bet a bunch of new singers
are gonna come out of this event.

147
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,720
Love’s sitting right here.

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
Hey guys, hello.

149
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,400
hello

150
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,520
Has Cia gone up to perform yet?

151
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,760
Ugh, he already finished like three songs!

152
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,920
Come on, I know he was
only supposed to do one song.

153
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,440
You always try to trick me.

154
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
And you always fall for it when it’s Jod.

155
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,040
Cia hasn’t gone up yet, actually but
I think he’s getting ready backstage.

156
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,440
I’m kinda nervous for him.

157
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,640
Hey, come sit down first.

158
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,600
Yeah, yeah, okay.

159
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,680
There's plenty of food.

160
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,440
What do we have here?

161
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,480
Me, obviously.

162
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,920
It's too much.

163
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,480
That was a bit much!

164
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,160
Everything looks so good.
You guys ordered a lot, huh?

165
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,840
How do you feel?

166
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,400
Nervous?

167
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,160
No matter how many times
I do this, I still get nervous.

168
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,640
Seeing you get to this point…

169
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,560
it kinda gets me emotional.

170
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,760
Huh? Nothing, I just...
I’m really happy for you.

171
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,840
I always knew you could do it.

172
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,680
Don’t go all sentimental on me now.

173
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,760
I’m already a nervous wreck as it is.

174
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,560
Hey

175
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,480
Good luck out there.

176
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,120
And also,

177
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,640
Good luck on every stage from now on, too.

178
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,200
You're talking like...

179
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,200
you're only gonna come
see me perform just this once.

180
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,680
Cia

181
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,800
Yes?

182
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,800
Whoa! you look great today.

183
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,720
How are you feeling? Ready?

184
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,600
Well, I’m feeling a little
nervous, to be honest.

185
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,800
You got this.

186
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
If you're ready, just
wait for your cue to go on.

187
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,800
Got it.

188
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,560
Um, Pun?

189
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,120
Uh… Thank you so much

190
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,360
for giving me this chance.

191
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,560
Hello everyone,

192
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,320
and welcome to

193
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,520
the Young Blood Music Festival!

194
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,440
This event was...

195
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,400
created for young people

196
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,120
who have dreams,

197
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,840
passion, and a fresh perspective

198
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,600
to give them a space
to explore their identity

199
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,720
and chase their dreams.

200
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,760
But before we meet this new wave of talent,

201
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,800
let me introduce my younger brother...

202
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,680
Cia Paphinwit Phatthanapinya

203
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,960
to open the stage for

204
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,480
the Young Blood Music Festival!

205
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,360
Hello!

206
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,360
Hi there!

207
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,880
hello

208
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,600
So, what do you think of my little brother?

209
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,320
Pretty good.

210
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,920
Just look at that confidence impressive!

211
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,880
And he wrote this song himself, by the way.

212
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,680
Hi, I’m Cia.

213
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,000
Today, I’m going to sing a
song called ‘Everything Is You’.

214
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,080
Jod

215
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,720
Yeah?

216
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,280
Why

217
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,240
does

218
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,640
your face look kinda different today?

219
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,960
Different how?

220
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,240
Like...

221
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,920
What?

222
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,400
Do I have something on my face?

223
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,200
Nooo…

224
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,400
It’s just…

225
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,280
I wanted to say…

226
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,400
You look kinda cute.

227
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,640
Love

228
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,160
How are things at home?

229
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,000
Well…

230
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,240
not good

231
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,040
But it's not bad.

232
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,000
That's good then.

233
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,160
thank you

234
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,520
Thank you for what, love?

235
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,000
Just… Thank you for always being by my side.

236
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,320
Even when I mess up sometimes.

237
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,600
It’s just that… I love you. See you
tomorrow. Okay. See you tomorrow.

238
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,120
Cia

239
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,880
You know...

240
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,000
In just this short time,

241
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,200
you've come so far.

242
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,000
Mmm... you're right.

243
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,000
You’ve worked so hard.

244
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,640
It’s only fair that you finally

245
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,040
get what you’ve been dreaming of.

246
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,240
I...

247
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,280
I don’t think I want to dream
of anything more than this.

248
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,800
Is something wrong?

249
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,040
I...

250
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,120
I just want to be right here, with you.

251
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,440
I feel at peace...

252
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,240
when you're with me.

253
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,040
I told you before, didn’t I?

254
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
That I’ll always stay by
your side, no matter what.

255
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,760
Cia!

256
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,560
Cia

257
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,480
Cia

258
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,240
Wake up, Cia. Someone’s calling you.

259
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,320
Hello, Cia.

260
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,640
Yes?

261
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,280
Are you free to talk?

262
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,280
Yes.

263
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,600
I just wanted to call and
let you know that this Friday,

264
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,240
you can come and play music at my place.

265
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,200
Someone from Yale Music will be there.

266
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,520
They want to see you.

267
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,640
Huh? What did you say?

268
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,800
They’re interested in your
song and your performance

269
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,440
from that night at my place.

270
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,920
Alright.

271
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,280
Are you okay with it?

272
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,520
Uh, yes, I’m good.

273
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,800
Thank you so much.

274
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,760
Alright, make sure to prepare well.

275
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,480
See you soon.

276
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,440
Okay, see you.

277
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,560
Blue

278
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,280
Blue

279
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,400
What's up?

280
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,560
Pun told me that

281
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,200
someone from Yale Music is

282
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,080
coming to see me this Friday.

283
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,640
They’re interested in my song.

284
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,760
Really?

285
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,360
Hey, that’s awesome! I’m so happy for you!

286
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
See? I told you you could do it.

287
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
thank you

288
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,320
Excuse me.

289
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,760
Hello, my name is Wayu
or you can call me "Wayo"

290
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,680
I was watching your performance
just now, from start to finish.

291
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,560
You were really good.

292
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,280
I loved it.

293
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Thank you so much.

294
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,080
Here’s my business card.

295
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,840
I’m actually a music producer.

296
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,600
The style of music I usually
work with is quite similar

297
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,640
to what you played today.

298
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,360
Oh… uh… you're Wayu

299
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,080
from

300
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
Yale Music, right?

301
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,720
That’s right.

302
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,880
Pun already told me about you.

303
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,400
If you're interested in
working on music with me,

304
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,760
feel free to reach out. You
could become a full-fledged artist.

305
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,760
An actual artist?

306
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,160
Really?

307
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,800
yes

308
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,640
Because your music is really
interesting and really good too.

309
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,400
Well…

310
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,320
would it be okay if I talk to you

311
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,960
more about the details first?

312
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,800
Of course. Just give me a call

313
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,200
using the number on the card.

314
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,720
Ah, sure.

315
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,320
Don’t forget to call, okay?

316
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,360
I really hope we’ll get
to see each other again.

317
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,960
Yes, thank you so much.

318
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,040
Take care.

319
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,800
Do it! Upload your song!

320
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,760
Come on,

321
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,840
Do it!

322
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,120
Alright, I'm posting it now.

323
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,040
Yes

324
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,520
That's it.

325
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:51,960
wait...

326
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,840
Why are you in such a rush to sleep?

327
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,960
I'm too excited… I don't even dare to look.

328
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,960
Fine, I'm just gonna sleep then.

329
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,560
Oh come on!

330
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
Hey, do you think Cia's song
is like… actually famous now?

331
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,880
Honestly, it's way bigger than I expected.

332
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,560
When I went out to grab food,

333
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,360
I heard someone playing Cia’s song.

334
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,400
Dude, you're about to
have a famous friend, Jod.

335
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Excuse me, I'm famous too,
you never say that about me!

336
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,280
You're loud, not famous, man.

337
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,760
What song is that?

338
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,480
Oh, it's 'Everything Is You' by Sia.

339
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,000
Wait, what?

340
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,320
Yeah, just listen first.

341
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,720
Hey, the lyrics are actually pretty good.

342
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,480
Yeah, not bad at all for the time he had.

343
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,800
I think he's really moving
fast. Growing up and all.

344
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,680
Well, he’s in our club, right?

345
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,520
We should support him
when he puts something out.

346
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,400
Honestly? It's not bad at all.

347
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,440
Guys, check this out

348
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,400
he just posted a video last night

349
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,840
and it's blowing up!

350
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,760
Damn. Not bad.

351
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,520
Have you heard Cia’s new song yet?

352
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,800
Yeah, I did! He sounds so good.

353
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,640
Seriously, I listened this morning so good!

354
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,880
Someone from your club, right?
You’ve got some real talent there.

355
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,160
Who? Sia?

356
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,800
Yeah.

357
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,960
He’s not just talented. He’s the real deal.

358
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,240
No doubt.

359
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,480
Of course.

360
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,120
Did you guys see my IG story with Cia’s song?

361
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,400
Yeah, I saw it.

362
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,760
But seriously, Cia’s pretty handsome.

363
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,000
He’s really leveled up, huh?

364
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,760
What about me though?

365
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,760
Am I handsome?

366
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,800
You? Please.

367
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,320
Not even close.

368
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,000
Hey, a cup!

369
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,040
Heyy, Cee!

370
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,720
What noww?

371
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,600
Why you all up in my business?

372
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,440
Let me play tooo!

373
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,960
Hey, your song…

374
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,960
I listened to it already.

375
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,440
It’s awesome.

376
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,280
Nice working with you.

377
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,000
Likewise.

378
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,720
Type

379
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,960
I’ve taken some time to reflect

380
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,000
on everything that happened
between the two of us,

381
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,520
and all the bad moments that came with it.

382
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,520
Especially

383
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,720
what happened with Love.

384
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,040
I admit,

385
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,920
I went too far.

386
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,440
Mira, do you know something?

387
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
None of this was solely your fault.

388
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,440
I had my part in it too.

389
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,120
Trust is built on honesty

390
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,800
and we both failed there.

391
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,240
I’m sorry. For everything that happened,

392
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,680
especially with Love.

393
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,720
After graduation, I’ll be moving back abroad.

394
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,840
And you’ll go study, just
like we planned together.

395
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,440
I remember.

396
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,760
And I also remember

397
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,720
we’re supposed to get married,
just like our parents arranged.

398
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,280
We’ve known each other for so long.

399
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,960
Long enough to understand
the bond we’ve shared.

400
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,120
And that it’s something worth holding on to

401
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,240
Do you have any thoughts?

402
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,840
Hmm… honestly,

403
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,240
I think there are still a
few parts in the music

404
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,920
that could use a bit of refining.

405
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,600
But with your team’s help
some tweaks here and there

406
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,080
I think it could really shine.

407
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,600
And what about you?

408
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,120
What’s your opinion, Chawit?

409
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,880
Well…

410
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,400
Judy,

411
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,400
come to my office. Right now.

412
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,720
Hurry.

413
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,120
Wait what do you mean by that?

414
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,880
What is it?

415
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,480
Yes, Chawit.

416
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,680
Cia

417
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,640
It's like this.

418
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,880
this song of yours…

419
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,720
I think...

420
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,360
it’s incredible.

421
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,040
Like, really good.

422
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,120
I’m not just saying
that. It’s honest, it’s raw

423
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,720
And my entire team agrees

424
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,240
Really good.

425
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,840
it feels like it came
straight from your heart.

426
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,800
And my entire team agrees.

427
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,600
Judy was listening just
now, too. She loves it.

428
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,560
So here’s what I’m thinking

429
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,520
I’ll have my team book
you a recording session.

430
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,960
Judy and my PR team will

431
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,840
start your promo right away.

432
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,840
And if you’re ready, I want
to schedule a photoshoot

433
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,520
for you next week.

434
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,880
My crew’s already on standby.

435
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,200
Yes, I’m in.

436
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,760
Oh and also...

437
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,120
We’ll organize a mini concert

438
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,520
to launch your new song.

439
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,760
And those other great tracks you sent
me? I’ve listened to all of them.

440
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,840
I really like it.

441
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,640
Let’s showcase them
all together at the launch.

442
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,840
Sound good?

443
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,360
Whoa, our engagement has gone up a lot!

444
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,240
Did this person already
have a fan base or something?

445
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,080
Talented songwriter and good looking.

446
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,600
No wonder, right?

447
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,080
Exactly. A rising new artist like this.

448
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,880
They're definitely going places.

449
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,240
And...

450
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,640
Let’s prep the next content drop,

451
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,800
and re-submit the plan
to the executive board.

452
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,800
Got it.

453
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,600
Comments

454
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,920
Look at all these followers. That’s a lot!

455
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,560
Impressive, huh?

456
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,280
As smart as your mother

457
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,400
correct

458
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,080
Beautiful like your mother

459
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,560
Am I handsome?

460
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,160
Handsome like your mother

461
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,560
look at this.

462
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,240
Blue

463
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,280
Have you seen my promo photos yet?

464
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,080
Next week,

465
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,040
I’ll finally be on stage for the concert.

466
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,000
...Are you okay?

467
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,360
Oh yeah, yeah, I’m fine.

468
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,800
I was just thinking

469
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,960
about your setlist,

470
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,040
wondering if there’s anything
that still needs tweaking.

471
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,800
Because... I want it to be perfect.

472
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,400
Oh, actually,

473
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,960
when I recorded it, everything felt solid.

474
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,600
But with the time left,

475
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,840
I’ll need to rehearse really hard.

476
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,360
I’m finally

477
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,720
doing what I’ve always dreamed of.

478
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,000
I’m really happy for you.

479
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,360
And also...

480
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,160
thank you.

481
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
Also will you be there, that night?

482
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,160
I mean, at the concert?

483
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,120
Can you be there, cheering me on?

484
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,000
I’m... kinda nervous.

485
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,640
Blue

486
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,480
Blue,

487
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,680
are you okay?

488
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,360
Yeah. Of course.

489
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,240
Of course I’ll be there.

490
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,120
Okay.

491
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,120
Oh hang on a sec.

492
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,040
Epilogue

493
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,000
Of a dream

494
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
On the day

495
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,480
When it was

496
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,720
Just the two of us

497
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,760
Stay Together

498
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,640
It's strange, isn't it?

499
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Things got better

500
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,920
Thank you to everyone who came today.

501
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,160
Well...

502
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,000
Before I play my last song

503
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,880
I would like to thank Brother Chawit.

504
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,680
And also to all the staff.

505
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,960
Thank you mom.

506
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,720
Who has always been open
to listening and supporting me.

507
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,200
Thank you to my friends who
have always been there for me.

508
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,640
Thank you to everyone who follows me.

509
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,400
Everyone who has been supporting me.

510
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,600
Please keep listening to
my songs for a long time.

511
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,040
And then...

512
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,760
Finally

513
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,040
I would like to thank one person
who is very important to me.

514
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,280
That brought me to this point.

515
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Thank you for...

516
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,520
He made me never give up.

517
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Thank you for...

518
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,240
Thank you for always being by my side

519
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,960
and for constantly encouraging me.

520
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,120
Thank you so much.

521
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,200
Cia

522
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,160
You're so good, my friend.

523
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,680
very handsome

524
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,840
Flowers for you.

525
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,600
1 2

526
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,560
very cute

527
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,360
1 2

528
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,800
1 2

529
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,040
Excuse me,

530
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,520
Can you turn the music up a bit?
