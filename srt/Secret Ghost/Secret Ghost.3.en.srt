1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:10,840
mother

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,600
Why are you so surprised?

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,600
Well...

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,840
Mom didn't knock on the door.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,720
So Xia was shocked.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,160
Mom forgot

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,400
What did you forget, Mom?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,720
Forgot to hug Sia.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,440
Come give mom a hug.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,560
Don't sleep late, my child.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,720
Yes, Mom.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,640
Good night.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,800
Good night, my child.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,240
bye bye

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,520
Teasing again

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,000
If mom finds out,

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Mom doesn't know.

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,080
Don't forget, we're good at hiding.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,000
Otherwise, someone would have caught them a long time ago.

20
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,000
Pretend to talk

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,680
Come on!

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,920
Do you want to play?

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,680
song...

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,640
Experimental

25
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,360
I heard that you like this band, right?

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,960
I saw you playing a song...

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,320
It's not enough, right?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,640
yes

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,960
Well...

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,480
This band...

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
He came

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,160
concert

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,040
During orientation when we were first year

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,680
When I first saw it

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,320
I really like it.

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,120
I like the song

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,960
Like people

38
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,880
What is this?

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,000
We also seem to be familiar with this band.

40
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,960
It's like it's stuck on the wall, right?

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Is that it?

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,640
yes

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,280
Are you familiar with this?

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,160
We are not sure.

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,520
It's like we've seen it somewhere before.

46
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,640
It should be

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
Senior students of the Faculty of Communication Arts

48
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,040
If I remember correctly,

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,760
It's like...

50
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,040
He came to introduce himself on stage.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,920
You're very talented. You look like you have a dream.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
And then...

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,520
It seems like you have a good goal in making music.

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,400
That big?

55
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,920
Shall we talk or shall we practice?

56
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,120
Just a moment

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,000
We say...

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,440
I would like to ask about the drawers in the club room.

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,040
Why...

60
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
It's locked in one place.

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,880
How did you get to this point?

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,440
Well, your business is important.

63
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,480
Another thing...

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,360
Your story is still connected

65
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,240
About our club too

66
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,040
That's important.

67
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,200
Brother Tham

68
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,120
He is also the president of the club.

69
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,880
It's been 3 years already.

70
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
which...

71
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,440
It must have been around the time you died.

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,400
We say...

73
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,920
What information must be in there?

74
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,720
It's definitely about you.

75
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,080
But it's locked.

76
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,120
What should I do?

77
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,800
already...

78
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,760
We have never seen P'Tham.

79
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Open that drawer first.

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
Do you remember anything?

81
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,520
What's wrong?

82
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,840
have a headache

83
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,000
Can you get a headache when you're a ghost?

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,680
Normally, we've never had this before.

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,960
And when ghosts have a headache

86
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,840
Will taking painkillers help?

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,160
It's unlikely to help.

88
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,480
Or...

89
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,360
It might be because you're trying to remember when you were still alive.

90
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,720
It might be possible.

91
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,640
But normally, we've never been like this before.

92
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,640
Are you okay?

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,280
You can take it slow.

94
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,200
Don't tell us about it now.

95
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,840
Mr.

96
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Think about it another day.

97
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,080
nevermind

98
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,560
We figured it out.

99
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,000
What do you think of?

100
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,320
Tham usually hangs his keys on his belt.

101
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,480
Sometimes you leave it with us

102
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,760
Because Tham is the closest to us.

103
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,840
We think that...

104
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,600
If you want Tham to leave the key with you,

105
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,960
You have to get close to Tham.

106
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,320
It's so difficult.

107
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,240
we

108
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,680
I'm not very good at approaching others.

109
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,800
Stay with different friends.

110
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,160
Is this the right time?

111
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,480
Now let's think about what to do.

112
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,160
This guy.

113
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,760
Has anyone commented?

114
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,800
Is this Jod from Sia's group?

115
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,880
I think so.

116
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,800
We remember.

117
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,120
I think there's something good.

118
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,800
Jod

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,160
The clip is really well cut.

120
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,040
Stay here

121
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,840
What is it?

122
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
Follow us

123
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,040
First comment

124
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,920
Jod

125
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
I'm going crazy

126
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
Jod

127
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
what

128
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,640
no

129
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,760
Don't know each other

130
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,400
Why do you have to speak politely? We are all friends.

131
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,520
These are my friends, Jod.

132
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,760
Yeah, that's right.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,360
Another thing is there are two of us.

134
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,040
I'm following your clips.

135
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,400
Fan... Fan club?

136
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,320
Oh yeah.

137
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,000
We watch every clip.

138
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,240
Every clip?

139
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,200
Especially episode 5

140
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
We like it very much.

141
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,760
The best

142
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,920
I only uploaded 3 clips.

143
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Let's just say we're really following you.

144
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,520
Otherwise we would know

145
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,960
How did Liu Love get it?

146
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,480
Right?

147
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,360
yes

148
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,400
Your group is full of good-looking people.

149
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,760
I don't know if they select based on looks or not, Mr. Jod.

150
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
If we talk about looks... I also

151
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
Not that much

152
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,080
But we don't see you very often.

153
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,760
Give your friend information about your contact details.

154
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,720
The two of us are...

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,120
Love's fans

156
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,280
I would like to follow some.

157
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,640
Or don't you want your friend to be famous?

158
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,840
Or are you selfish?

159
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,720
Not like that.

160
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,640
Then you bring your Instagram.

161
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,120
Hurry up!

162
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,640
okay

163
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,280
thank you

164
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,840
I'll make it famous myself, friend.

165
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,600
How was yesterday, love?

166
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,960
What time do you sleep?

167
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,880
Are you reading too late?

168
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,000
no

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,560
Love likes reading books anyway.

170
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,120
Then we say that

171
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,200
We probably have to be as diligent as Love.

172
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,800
Please let me see Sia when she's hard working.

173
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,240
I really want to see it.

174
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,160
Let's just wait and see, fog.

175
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
I forgot what I studied in the morning.

176
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,840
we

177
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,200
Is that Jod?

178
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,480
And what did Jod do to C and Q?

179
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,600
do not know

180
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,760
Those guys

181
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,440
The lady has arrived, Jod.

182
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,720
Have you weaned off breast milk yet, my child?

183
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,040
Why are you here? Who lit the incense sticks to call you?

184
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,160
What the hell is it doing?

185
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,760
is...

186
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,400
That's about it.

187
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,680
Did Jod cheat on you?

188
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,080
But he just asked for Instagram.

189
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,920
TRUE

190
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,200
Our Instagram is also open to the public.

191
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,600
However, anyone can come and see it.

192
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,640
But he got a love contact.

193
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,000
Never mind.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,960
I think we should go study together.

195
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,440
The audience is all over the place.

196
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,400
Let's go.

197
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,040
Come here, Jod. Sit here.

198
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,600
What else, sis?

199
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,120
This morning, someone commented on our clip.

200
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,120
A friend's first step

201
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,760
already

202
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,800
What do you comment on?

203
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,680
Is this a good story?

204
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,920
You're so awesome, my friend Jod.

205
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,360
Calm down guys.

206
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,240
He commented that...

207
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,960
First comment

208
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,880
Finished

209
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,840
Should we be happy?

210
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,240
It's okay, Jod, you'll grow up slowly.

211
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,920
Is it like when Nong Love grew up?

212
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,600
Dad's 3-year-old little love

213
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,600
You've been annoying me too much, Jod.

214
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,560
If we were Father Love,

215
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,000
Mother Love must...

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,120
Jod probably wants to get his head knocked out.

217
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro Liu.

218
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,000
Wait a minute.

219
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,560
The sentence sounds familiar.

220
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,840
I'm sorry, bro.

221
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,400
We play around with anything we're familiar with.

222
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,680
Like a song...

223
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,080
What song is that?

224
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,920
song...

225
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,440
What song are you thinking about?

226
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,480
We just play around.

227
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,440
really?

228
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,080
This guy...

229
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,160
What a strange person.

230
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,680
Jod is always criticized.

231
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,560
Do you ever go home and cry in secret?

232
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,560
People like Jod

233
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,840
I will never shed tears over the words of these people.

234
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,400
Is this your friend?

235
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,120
My friend, my friend.

236
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,360
love

237
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,040
Do you love Sia?

238
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,240
I love you.

239
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,520
Liu

240
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,880
Are you okay?

241
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,120
Your face looks stressed.

242
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,600
Hello, Brother Tham.

243
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,400
Oh, Xia.

244
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,360
Came just in time.

245
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,080
Come on!

246
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,640
Please help me clean my room.

247
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,400
Sure.

248
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,640
And normally, Brother Tham

249
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,960
Do you always clean the club room yourself?

250
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,400
Most of the time, anyway.

251
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,800
Every once in a while, the Type Q&A guys come to help.

252
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,280
They like to escape and play basketball.

253
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,360
In that case

254
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,600
If next time, Brother Tham has to clean again

255
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,440
You can call me anytime.

256
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,240
I'll help you myself.

257
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,360
Is that so?

258
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,560
Yes, it's very easy, that's all.

259
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,800
okay

260
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,720
If Xia is okay with it, then that's it.

261
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,560
already

262
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,480
normal

263
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,400
The documents that the children brought to the club

264
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,640
Did Brother Tham keep it all the time?

265
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,320
I keep it all the time.

266
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,680
This is club statistics.

267
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,760
already...

268
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,920
Collect both those who have passed through and those who have passed through.

269
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,680
It didn't pass, right?

270
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,320
yes

271
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,120
Collected all

272
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,560
But keep them separate.

273
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Xia, do you see that drawer?

274
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,960
Each floor has different storage.

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,400
already...

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,920
What is stored on which floor?

277
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,240
is

278
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560
I would like to know some information about the club.

279
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,880
good

280
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,680
It's like this.

281
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,640
The first floor is information for people who apply for the club.

282
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
Both are attached and not attached at all.

283
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,680
Second floor

284
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,640
It will be university documents.

285
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,920
When we have to submit anything related to the club

286
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,480
The third layer contains information about current members.

287
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,600
There's something for everyone.

288
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,720
And then...

289
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
The last floor belongs to former members.

290
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,320
Brother Tham is very organized.

291
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Well

292
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
Actually, these documents

293
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,320
You have to keep it organized like this.

294
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,960
Because when we look for information about someone, right?

295
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,000
It will be convenient.

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,320
And it's fast too.

297
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,800
Another thing

298
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,320
If someone were to do it instead of me,

299
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,480
So he can do it easily.

300
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,520
Actually, these things were taught to me by my seniors.

301
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,120
okay

302
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,720
What should I eat tomorrow?

303
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,960
Eat anything.

304
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,120
Love can eat everything.

305
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,880
got home

306
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,720
Then Love will go first.

307
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,440
meet tomorrow

308
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,280
Love

309
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,800
Can I talk to you?

310
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,240
okay

311
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,920
Is anything up?

312
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,120
Looks very serious.

313
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,000
No, it's not.

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,920
Just wanted to say that...

315
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
This is another type thing, right?

316
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,880
Liu whispered into Love's ear

317
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,480
Morning, noon, evening, after meals

318
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,560
Until Love remembers everything.

319
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,280
Listen to us carefully.

320
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,720
We are really serious about this.

321
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,160
Type and I knew each other before.

322
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,160
And Type isn't what Love thought.

323
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,360
Type changes women every time, Love also sees it.

324
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,720
And even though Type has a partner...

325
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,040
pair...

326
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,320
forget it

327
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,280
Let's just say that we're telling you this because we mean well.

328
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,400
But if Love doesn't believe us, it's okay.

329
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,280
I know already.

330
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,360
Liu, don't worry about Love.

331
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,720
If Love messes with our type...

332
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,800
We're really going to be mad at you.

333
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,920
I don't know how many times I've listened to it.

334
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,560
Love remembers

335
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,520
Then can you promise us?

336
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,920
That if Type messes with Love

337
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,400
Love will tell us

338
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,600
Why do you hesitate?

339
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,680
Promise, promise, promise.

340
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,480
contract

341
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Don't bother me at all.

342
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,920
Go into the house.

343
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,600
Okay, see you tomorrow.

344
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,200
When you get home, please Line me.

345
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,240
bye bye

346
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,360
bye bye

347
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
bye bye

348
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,280
Is this yours?

349
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,200
Are you okay?

350
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,320
Or...

351
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,520
What is Love really thinking about Type?

352
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:28,200
With the words you once said

353
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,440
Keep it in your heart, never forget it.

354
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,640
That I will stand, stand here.

355
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,320
But it looks similar

356
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,560
you...

357
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,960
This song is difficult. I can't seem to play it.

358
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,760
Just keep practicing and don't think too much.

359
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,480
but

360
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,760
We have been trying to figure out this song for a long time.

361
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,440
Look carefully, there are only easy chords.

362
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,920
Easy with ghosts

363
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,840
excuse me

364
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,880
We mean, how is it easy?

365
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,440
Take a good look first, there are all basic chords.

366
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,080
The food is ready, son.

367
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,760
Come out and eat, son.

368
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,280
Xia, the food is ready, son.

369
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,520
What is he doing?

370
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,200
Xia

371
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,160
Then let's try again.

372
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,360
okay

373
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,080
From the very beginning?

374
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,080
With the words you once said

375
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,600
Keep it in your heart, never forget it.

376
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,680
That I will stand, stand here.

377
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,760
But it seems like you've changed.

378
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,040
Yes, that's right.

379
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,720
Very good, Siah.

380
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,040
Now playable

381
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,680
Mr.

382
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,160
Doing what?

383
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,920
Get out of here, it's not funny.

384
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,520
What? What's wrong with you?

385
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,520
Crazy, this is a bathroom.

386
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,320
You see, I'm naked too.

387
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,360
Get out, I'm going to take a shower.

388
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,680
Why?

389
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,280
I'll take a shower too.

390
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,800
Are you crazy or what?

391
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,520
How can they bathe together?

392
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,520
Why can't I take a shower?

393
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,600
Well, I'm standing here, letting you shower.

394
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,800
Can you please give me a bath?

395
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,440
Please give me a bath.

396
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,000
What is it?

397
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,360
Please give me a bath.

398
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,320
this

399
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,360
You won't stop bothering me, will you?

400
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,400
Go out now, I'm going to take a shower.

401
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
go out

402
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,160
This is out now.

403
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,880
Still more

404
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,120
Okay, you won't come out, right?

405
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,360
can

406
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,600
It didn't work, right? I guess it must have been holy water.

407
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,880
Hurry up, we're going to be late.

408
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,120
You can go now.

409
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,320
fast

410
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,160
Are you leaving already?

411
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,840
It takes you so long to get dressed, Sia.

412
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,840
The university must have closed.

413
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,920
Dressed up since dawn

414
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,520
Until now

415
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,080
The sky is going to get dark again.

416
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,960
You're exaggerating a bit, aren't you?

417
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,040
What is it?

418
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,040
Also look who's in the bathroom.

419
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,080
Until it comes out

420
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,240
but

421
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,960
Do I have to dress neatly when I go to university?

422
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,560
Who is as dirty as you?

423
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,480
Wait, you're saying we're dirty.

424
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,640
Let me see your room first.

425
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,920
Why

426
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,120
Whose room is this?

427
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,520
How did you do that?

428
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,680
It's a simple matter, Blue style.

429
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,800
Next time, you should do the same.

430
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,320
Don't just wait for your mother to do it for you.

431
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,480
Gone

432
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,280
Hurry up

433
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,200
I won't make it to university in time.

434
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,640
oh

435
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,520
See you again soon.

436
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,160
And our phone

437
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,200
Here it is.

438
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm going now.

439
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,960
wait a minute

440
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,080
So you're not taking the guitar?

441
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,400
no

442
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,720
There's a lot of work today.

443
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,320
Let's come back and practice at home.

444
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,640
So where are you going?

445
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
We go together

446
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,880
no

447
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,920
It's better to wait here.

448
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,760
heavy

449
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,760
No, or...

450
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,000
Are you upset with us about things in the bathroom?

451
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,400
Who would be angry?

452
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,480
nonsense

453
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,880
More than a thousand stories a day.

454
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm too lazy to carry it. If I carry it, I won't be able to play it.

455
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,360
See you soon.

456
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,600
And then...

457
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,240
Keep a good watch on the house.

458
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,720
Not a dog

459
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,600
Have you gone to school yet, son?

460
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,440
Yes, Mom.

461
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,560
Thank you.

462
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,520
yes

463
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,920
Study hard.

464
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,880
yes

465
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,720
The cutest ever.

466
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,880
What are you watching, Mom?

467
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,800
Watch the news about your child

468
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,040
Let's go. Hurry up and go to school. Otherwise, we'll be late.

469
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,800
I want to eat it right now.

470
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,520
Let's go, it'll be late, son. Let's go.

471
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,040
One piece

472
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,600
Go to Xia

473
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,120
Then I'll be going now.

474
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
Bye bye baby

475
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,000
bye bye

476
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,280
Is this my son's room?

477
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,640
clean

478
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,320
This is the Xiani.

479
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,360
The sleeping area is arranged nicely.

480
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,200
What is that picture? It's definitely a new one.

481
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,840
The pillows are arranged nicely.

482
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,520
So where does the guitar sound come from?

483
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,080
You guys

484
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
We say...

485
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,480
This corner

486
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,440
Okay.

487
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,840
What did you get?

488
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,280
That's it. What do you get?

489
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,200
Well

490
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,040
Riverside

491
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,000
Shady

492
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,200
Refreshing the heart

493
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,520
Come on, come on

494
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
Hurry up and do it, or it will be too late.

495
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,840
You talk too much, man.

496
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,440
But wait a minute.

497
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,560
What's wrong with you now?

498
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,200
They say that...

499
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,640
This is a legend.

500
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,400
What legend? Enough already.

501
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,320
There was a housewife who drowned here.

502
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,280
fog

503
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,680
Mr.

504
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,960
Don't joke around.

505
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,720
What are we kidding about?

506
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,600
You asked a strange question.

507
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,040
Since I was born, I have never seen a ghost.

508
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,640
Or...

509
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,480
Have you guys seen

510
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,040
Xia

511
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,240
Mr.

512
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,320
ever...

513
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,720
Did you see a ghost?

514
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,320
Your face right now looks like you've seen a ghost.

515
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,440
Never.

516
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,440
We say...

517
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,280
We have to go back to music practice.

518
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,920
I was so engrossed that I forgot to look at the time.

519
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,720
We'll go first. See you later.

520
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,520
Liu, I'll leave this with you. I'm going now.

521
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,400
meet

522
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,840
Very strange

523
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,960
What's wrong with him?

524
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,320
Xia is back, son?

525
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,440
Mom, are you still not sleeping?

526
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,720
Not yet. Not sleepy yet.

527
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,040
Then why did you come back late today, son?

528
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,880
oh

529
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,720
fit

530
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,760
Sia has been working on a report with her friends.

531
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,120
Are you busy with work these days, son?

532
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,800
Well...

533
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,800
There are quite a few, Mom.

534
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,920
If there's a lot of work, you don't have to clean the room.

535
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,360
It's a mother's duty.

536
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,200
Did your mom come into Xia's room?

537
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,720
Have you forgotten?

538
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,280
That mom has to go into the room

539
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Clean every 3 days

540
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,000
already...

541
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,840
Mom, did you find anything?

542
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,960
meet

543
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,000
What did you find?

544
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,400
There's nothing, son.

545
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,920
do not have anything

546
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,280
Or is there

547
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
No, Mom.

548
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,640
otherwise...

549
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,560
Wait, I'll go back to work first.

550
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
Don't sleep late, Mom.

551
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,960
Did Mom Sai come to clean your room?

552
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,680
Unusually clean

553
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,960
Xia

554
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Xia

555
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,600
This is you.

556
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,440
What do you say?

557
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,360
Call me, is there something wrong?

558
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,600
nothing

559
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Are you okay?

560
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,840
Why do you look weird?

561
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,320
No, nothing.

562
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,640
already...

563
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Mother Sai came to clean the room.

564
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,240
already...

565
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,840
Doesn't he see the guitar?

566
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,240
We blocked it so Mother Sand couldn't see it.

567
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,280
That big?

568
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,440
Are you good?

569
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,920
You can also look after the house.

570
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,240
Cleaning is good.

571
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,200
Plus you can hide things too.

572
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,840
You can brag about it.

573
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,720
come

574
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,000
Let's practice guitar.

575
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,360
but...

576
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,800
Be quiet, or Mother Sai will hear.

577
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,720
Who is this?

578
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,920
Then can you promise us?

579
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,280
That if Type messes with Love

580
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,600
Love will tell us

581
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,040
This job is very difficult.

582
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,240
It's impossible.

583
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,080
We're not done yet.

584
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,600
Just kidding

585
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,640
There is another presentation.

586
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,440
TRUE

587
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Who will present?

588
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,840
Jod

589
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Then who will make the slides?

590
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,160
Fog and Liu

591
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,520
Okay, okay.

592
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,640
otherwise...

593
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Sia and Love

594
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,080
Find out.

595
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,960
And then...

596
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,480
If there's anything I can help with, please let me know.

597
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,560
Okay, okay.

598
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Love, did you hear what your friend said?

599
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,040
Love will help you make the slides.

600
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,440
no

601
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,440
Love and Xian lead their friends to find information as usual.

602
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,160
Love also heard that.

603
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,320
But I mean, Love will help make the slides too.

604
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,960
So this is it.

605
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,160
this period...

606
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,360
Is Miss Love in love these days?

607
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,400
Why?

608
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,160
Her skin looks good like someone in love.

609
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,240
Look radiant

610
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,120
TRUE

611
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,400
oh

612
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,280
I guess I've been sleeping a lot lately.

613
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,880
I slept since 8pm yesterday.

614
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,600
Go to bed early

615
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,160
but...

616
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,680
It's good to get plenty of sleep.

617
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,880
Restore your skin with

618
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,880
This is true.

619
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,880
Yes, that's right.

620
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
That's why you're so beautiful.

621
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,880
It's really beautiful.

622
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,080
Evidence, huh?

623
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,200
Good looking. Good looking.

624
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,800
But really,

625
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,200
This is the evidence.

626
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,960
This is correct.

627
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,080
Oh, Xia!

628
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,560
What are you doing here?

629
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,600
Have you eaten rice yet?

630
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,560
not yet

631
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,760
already...

632
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,720
What are you doing here?

633
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,200
Are you waiting for a friend or...?

634
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Come to me.

635
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,280
yes

636
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,000
Is anything up?

637
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,960
If you want to talk about the club, that's fine.

638
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,280
It's not like that at all, Brother Tham.

639
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,720
is...

640
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,840
hair...

641
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,680
What are you doing, Brother Tham?

642
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,560
Is this it?

643
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,520
It just so happens that it's my friend's shop.

644
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,720
He will arrange it like...

645
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,520
Something like a concert for young people.

646
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,960
Then I want to work with you.

647
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,840
So I asked my brother to help me find a sponsor.

648
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
already...

649
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,040
Have you found it yet, Brother Tham?

650
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,760
There have been some contacts.

651
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,480
But this is very interesting.

652
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,000
Come and see quickly.

653
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
This one.

654
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,680
This is a skincare product.

655
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,440
I think it's very suitable for teenagers.

656
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,000
But this one...

657
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,400
hair...

658
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,080
I use it to wash my face regularly.

659
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,040
Really?

660
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,640
yes

661
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,600
And this one

662
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,200
This one, this one is good too.

663
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,880
I see people using C often.

664
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,600
It is a body spray.

665
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,960
already...

666
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,040
Has Brother Tham agreed yet?

667
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,840
Now it is...

668
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,640
We are discussing the details.

669
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,640
But I have to talk to my friend about it again.

670
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,800
Ask if he's interested

671
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,760
But I think there's no problem.

672
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,800
But...

673
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,000
Why did you come to the club room?

674
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,120
It's noon already. Aren't you going to eat lunch?

675
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,920
hair...

676
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,640
I'm going to invite P'Tham to go out to eat.

677
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,200
Then why did you invite me?

678
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,760
Where have all our friends gone?

679
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,360
friend...

680
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,920
My friend went to...

681
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,680
okay

682
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,720
I understand now.

683
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,560
I'm a substitute.

684
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,760
Right next to our friend.

685
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,640
It's not like that, Brother Tham.

686
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,520
is...

687
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,880
hair...

688
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,960
I really want to go eat with Phi Tham.

689
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,640
Really.

690
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,640
The bag fell.

691
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,000
Okay, no more doubts.

692
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Let's go eat.

693
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,360
Brother Tham

694
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,280
Brother Tham, do you like to eat at this restaurant?

695
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,560
I often see them buying.

696
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,760
Are you secretly looking at me?

697
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,160
I didn't sneak around. I mean...

698
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,320
I just happened to come across P'Tham buying all the time.

699
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,120
I happen to see it all the time.

700
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,200
Do you see anyone else?

701
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,640
This is my first time eating at this restaurant.

702
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,960
Is it okay?

703
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,040
Get some water first.

704
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,240
Thank you.

705
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,600
Then I'll go buy you some water.

706
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,880
It's okay, just eat it.

707
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,960
yes

708
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,000
Xia, let me ask you something.

709
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,880
Why do I want to eat rice with you these days?

710
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,400
When I first invited you, you didn't seem very...

711
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,320
I also want to have dinner with Phi Tham.

712
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,200
I mean that

713
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,840
I just want to eat with Phi Tham.

714
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,800
There is no reason.

715
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,360
Eat a lot so you can grow fast.

716
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,080
I'm already grown up.

717
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,320
What are you growing up to?

718
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,880
Is something wrong with Xia?

719
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,600
It's okay. Let's eat.

720
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,760
Hurry up and eat

721
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,360
Hurry up and talk

722
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,480
Hurry back

723
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,560
Hurry up and search

724
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,000
Hurry up and find

725
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,040
And then hurry up.

726
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,600
It's really okay, right?

727
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,480
Hurry up!

728
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
mean...

729
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,240
Let's hurry up and eat.

730
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,400
And try to buy some snacks for Tham often.

731
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,680
Tham might like it.

732
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,440
This is dessert, Brother Tham.

733
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,680
What is it?

734
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,960
Well...

735
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,800
I saw that P'Tham likes to eat it, so I bought it for him.

736
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,600
Really peeking.

737
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,280
Where else have you seen this?

738
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,600
Well...

739
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,560
The trash can in the club room.

740
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,520
That doesn't make sense.

741
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,240
If it were a trash can

742
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,480
It might be the three Kumaras.

743
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,600
Why do you think it's yours?

744
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,040
Well...

745
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
I saw that Phi Tham likes to eat it when he is with his close friends.

746
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,640
The more you say this, the more I know you're lying.

747
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,360
I don't have any close friends at university.

748
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,400
Brother Tham really doesn't have it?

749
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Like Brother Tham here.

750
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:58,840
Well...

751
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,880
Just had it

752
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,600
Why do you use the word "used to"?

753
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,640
Did you have a fight?

754
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,680
Or...

755
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,200
We broke up.

756
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,640
forget it

757
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,880
I don't want to talk about it.

758
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,960
In that case...

759
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,320
Should we go back to practicing music?

760
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,880
Is this your way?

761
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,440
There's only food.

762
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,360
Are you hungry?

763
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,560
this

764
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,520
Not at all

765
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Then...

766
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,440
Let Tham teach you how to play guitar.

767
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,640
And then just snatch it.

768
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,120
Xia

769
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,440
Yes, brother.

770
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,000
Focus a little.

771
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,400
Will be able to play

772
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,400
okay

773
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,720
Try again.

774
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,280
There is only one last resort left...

775
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,920
Make Tham fall asleep

776
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,040
Because Tham is a deep sleeper.

777
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,640
I am a person who really likes listening to music.

778
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,040
It's probably been there since childhood.

779
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,880
because...

780
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,240
My father has taught Sia since she was a child.

781
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,080
So I liked it since I was a kid.

782
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,440
Besides the music...

783
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,600
I also like watching movies.

784
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,440
When it can do both

785
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,040
It feels so much more connected.

786
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,000
because...

787
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,240
Music is the soundtrack of a movie.

788
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Once it's mixed together

789
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,480
I immediately felt an impact.

790
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,320
If one day the movie disappears

791
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
I would be very sorry.

792
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,000
And I also like to walk like Phi Tham.

793
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,560
Walking in the park is so great.

794
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,440
Cool breeze, good weather

795
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,560
Then put on your earphones and listen to music.

796
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,400
Once you do something like that...

797
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,920
It feels like my life has been recharged.

798
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,240
Brother Tham, do you feel the same way?

799
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,120
Brother Tham

800
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,320
Brother Tham

801
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Got it

802
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,960
Please take care of Brother Tham for us.

803
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,760
Okay, hurry up.

804
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,720
Xia, can you do it faster?

805
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,880
Just a moment.

806
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,480
Xia

807
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,960
Please make it faster.

808
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,240
Tham will wake up soon.

809
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,920
Take it easy and concentrate.

810
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,680
Xia

811
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,680
Xia

812
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,040
behind

813
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,880
Brother Tham...

814
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,480
I can't even compose a song.

815
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,520
I can't sleep.

816
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,200
Acne pops up again

817
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,800
stressed

818
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,760
Good thing I brought some acne gel.

819
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,360
Otherwise it would be bad.

820
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,560
That's it.
