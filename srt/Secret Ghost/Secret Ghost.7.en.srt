1
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,880
Wait a minute, I'll be back.

2
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,280
Yes, young miss.

3
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,040
I'll tell you when it's done.

4
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,000
Love, are you okay?

5
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,680
What's wrong?

6
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,840
Why?? You're not feeling
well or is there any pain?

7
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,280
I'm fine.

8
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,800
Well you okay? your mental state?

9
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,080
Why??

10
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,040
Doesn't you guys really know this?

11
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,480
What is it? I don't
know anything at all.

12
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,120
Well...

13
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,080
Mira talking to Love
at the basketball court

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,120
You guys already know that?

15
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,600
Which woman did Mira talk to?

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
None of them ended well.

17
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,880
Well...

18
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,880
We know that.

19
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,600
We care about you very much.

20
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,440
Why you didn't tell us?

21
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,120
is...

22
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,000
So what Mira talk to you?

23
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,440
Yes.

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,280
Tell me.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Everyone, calm down.

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
is not that big problem.

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,480
And I didn't pay
any attention to it.

28
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Everyone, don't think too much.

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
If Mira messes with you again

30
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,840
You have to tell us.

31
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,720
Do you understand, love?

32
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,640
okay

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,160
This is Mira too.

34
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,720
She...

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,560
didn't say anything
bad to you right?

36
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,760
Love also said it.

37
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,000
Like don't want to
keep thinking about it.

38
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,360
Never mind

39
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,840
And then...

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,640
can I ask you something?

41
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,520
Who is Mira?

42
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,040
I thought you already knew her.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,520
Liu

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,120
What?

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,800
Me??

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,200
You did it.

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,920
Tell us.

48
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,200
I heard that before moving to the
Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

49
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,560
Aren't you two best friends?

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
I don't count.

51
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,240
So who is Mira? Liu

52
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,080
I go to the bathroom first.

53
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,000
Love

54
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,280
So sorry

55
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,840
but...

56
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
If there is anything uncomfortable

57
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,440
You can tell me.

58
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,800
okay

59
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,360
bye bye

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,240
See you

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,920
bye bye

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,960
What is it?

63
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,400
Oh, that's right.

64
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,440
What's wrong?

65
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,760
Tell Love that her are
not feeling well can tell.

66
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,080
Look at him.

67
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,360
It's heavier than love.

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
Would you like to
continue listening?

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,960
Listen, sister.

70
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,360
Hurry up and say it, Liu.

71
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,960
Fine

72
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,360
Mira I-rada

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,640
I can't remember her
last name, it's too long.

74
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,520
So what next?

75
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,440
beautiful

76
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,520
rich

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,120
good

78
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,480
Everyone knows Mira
as the Business Princess.

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,200
And then...

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,560
The important thing is

81
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,440
Mira is wicked smart

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,080
Often makes the person who is being

83
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,360
It can become wrong

84
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,200
Is it that big?

85
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
The final card is...

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,600
Mira is engaged to Type.

87
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,640
The owner's son

88
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,800
That the whole hotel does

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,800
department store

90
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,800
And many other condos

91
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,160
So what next?

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Even if Mira breaks off
the engagement with Type

93
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,640
No matter what,
Mira will get a partner.

94
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,680
From half of the house Type

95
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,360
So that means Type
is richer than Mira?

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,320
No

97
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,720
Mira

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
No, Mira is a binding
contract with House Type.

99
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,560
Make a bankrupt house type

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,000
Have a chance to move on

101
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,040
And then...

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,640
Now it's going to be a long way.

103
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,680
This means that even if
the engagement is cancelled,

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,240
It has no effect on Mira, right?

105
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,400
Yes

106
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,520
And even if Type gets
involved with other girls,

107
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,800
It won't affect Mira anymore.

108
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,440
That's right.

109
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,240
And if we actually get married,

110
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,160
The child was born

111
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,720
Born with a silver
spoon in one's mouth.

112
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,480
wrong

113
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:54,880
wrong

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,440
How?

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,080
If people don't love each
other, getting married won't work.

116
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,160
Another thing is that I
haven't finished my studies yet.

117
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,400
And why should we bother with
them? They are doing business.

118
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,120
That's true.

119
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,520
Stunned

120
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,760
I'm stunned.

121
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,480
what

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,520
There she is.

123
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,800
Like a princess in a fairy tale

124
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,880
Is the carriage waiting
in front of the castle?

125
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,720
The other day we didn't notice.

126
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,960
But today she is really beautiful.

127
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Really, really beautiful.

128
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,600
Love, are you okay?

129
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,200
Well...

130
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,720
It's not that it's not okay.

131
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,200
But Type never told me anything.

132
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,200
What can you expect
from a person like that?

133
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,200
People who are
dishonest in relationships.

134
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,960
You can't rely on people like that.

135
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,920
Go clear things up with him
and make sure everything is clear.

136
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,760
Go clear things up with Type
to find out what you want to do.

137
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,400
Or would you like me to go with you?

138
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,520
No

139
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,000
I will handle it by myself.

140
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,240
Are you sure?

141
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,240
yes

142
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,720
What are you doing, Q?

143
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,520
play a game

144
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,480
What game?

145
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,640
Yesterday I surfed really slow.

146
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,320
Who's coming again?

147
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,800
Don't know

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why do you not answer

149
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,920
unavailable

150
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,960
Can you give me something
that doesn't sound irritating?

151
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,880
It's muted. I can't hear it.

152
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,440
came here yourself today.

153
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,760
True, Mira usually
doesn't come by herself.

154
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,800
Why is it like this today...

155
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,760
Your two friends once said
that it was the fiance's right.

156
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Is this the right of a fiancé?

157
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm so tired of
business relationships.

158
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,920
Then why did you come?

159
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,240
My mother asked me to pick
you up and take you out to eat.

160
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Didn't she call to tell you?

161
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,160
not yet

162
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,920
Now that you know, go get dressed.

163
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,760
unavailable

164
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,880
Must make a report

165
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,800
Don't you see?

166
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,520
I never knew that before.

167
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,240
That you guys are so
determined to study?

168
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,320
I'm also have to thankyou Q for...

169
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,560
It's okay. It's just a small matter.

170
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,320
Let's work first.

171
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,000
Mira usually doesn't
thank anyone easily.

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,960
You guys stop acting.

173
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,520
Thank you for what?

174
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,480
Q

175
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,680
What you help Mira?

176
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,120
I think I should go back first.

177
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,360
Hey Q

178
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,200
Just a moment

179
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,800
Don't you guys know this?

180
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
What do you mean?

181
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
Mira thanks Q

182
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,160
That made Me know
about Type nonsense.

183
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,360
While Mira was away

184
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,120
Hey Q

185
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,080
Q

186
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,160
Type, calm down.

187
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Yeah, I told her.

188
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,960
Why did you do that?

189
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,280
for what?

190
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,840
Why I can't tell?

191
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,680
Because you're really bad.

192
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,640
Cee

193
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,840
Enough, you guys, stop it.

194
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,240
Q, come out with me first.

195
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't make a big problem out of it.

196
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,800
You did it all by yourself.

197
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,200
You can stop being
friends with friends like this.

198
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,800
Doing what?

199
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,040
Type

200
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,480
It's not just a girl named Love.

201
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,920
To look more
serious than other girls

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,840
Without caring
about anyone like this

203
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,360
What are you talking about?

204
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,200
Look

205
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
What else do you want?

206
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,440
What else are you hiding?

207
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,200
I thought that was more than enough.

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,680
Q

209
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,240
Go get dressed.

210
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,240
I doesn't like to
repeat things, Type.

211
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,240
today

212
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,360
Not really.

213
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,720
So apologizes to you.

214
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,520
Please tell your parents for me.

215
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,840
So today

216
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not available

217
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,480
Or say that I don't want to go.

218
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,240
That's fine too.

219
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,400
I don't see you do
like this with other girls.

220
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,840
With that Love.

221
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
when

222
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,920
When will you stop
involving other people, Mira?

223
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,800
Is that you.

224
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
I'm back

225
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,160
Stop bothering other people.

226
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,960
You know right?

227
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,920
That no matter how much you love each
other, you guy can't be together.

228
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,240
And what if it were possible?

229
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
If you really think that way,

230
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
You probably watches
too many movies.

231
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,720
Stop rambling.

232
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,280
Are you done?

233
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,760
If it runs out, you can go back.

234
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,240
You can release me now.

235
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
What's wrong with you, Q?

236
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,400
And what happened?

237
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,880
Why did you do this?

238
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,640
Then why do you have
to ask the same thing?

239
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,560
Q, Aren't the three of us friends?

240
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,760
Yes!

241
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,680
So what exactly happened?

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,200
Then why did you tell Mira?

243
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,880
I'm not satisfied with Love.

244
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,720
I tell you I like her?

245
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,200
It said himself
that it didn't like it.

246
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,680
And there is no
sign that he likes it.

247
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,400
But look at what it did.

248
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,400
Take it easy.

249
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,000
I think that's not the case anymore.

250
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
If it's just Love.

251
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,760
It's because you took his side
that he became this kind of person.

252
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,000
If you have anything
to say, please tell me.

253
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,280
is...

254
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,280
The owner of the guitar I borrowed

255
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,120
Why?

256
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,280
he...

257
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,440
It's from someone who
used to be in the club.

258
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,880
He just doesn't have the
chance to use it anymore.

259
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
So where did he go?

260
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,800
Why do you want to know?

261
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,080
I let you practice.

262
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,320
Don't worry

263
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,600
Time, please answer me.

264
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,240
I really need to know.

265
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,280
Or...

266
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,000
Did you break guitar again?

267
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,920
never mind

268
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
Is it still repairable?
Let's me see.

269
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,200
Who is the owner
of the guitar, Time?

270
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,600
Time

271
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,720
Time

272
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,360
Blue

273
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,080
That guitar...

274
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,760
It's Blue's.

275
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,680
And then he...

276
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,000
Why do you want to know
about the owner of this guitar?

277
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,760
Last time you came
to search my drawer

278
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,480
Is it because you want to steal the
documents of someone named Blue?

279
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,480
Time, do you see it?

280
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,680
Cia, do you think I'm
sleeping that deeply?

281
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,160
I apologize.

282
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,560
So when did you get to know Blue?

283
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,560
Who the hell are you?

284
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,360
What did you say?
I'm totally confused.

285
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,160
Asked when did you get
to know Blue? Tell me.

286
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,560
If you is in a bad
mood, I'll go back first.

287
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,480
Let's talk later.

288
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,360
Love, what's wrong?

289
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,160
Why would you ask me?

290
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,000
Why don't you go ask to Mira?

291
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,400
That matter, I was
just about to tell you.

292
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,240
What do you think about me?

293
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Umm...

294
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm not okay if you thinks
more about me than that.

295
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,360
And in the past

296
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,960
How do you feel about me?

297
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry I have to say this.

298
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,200
But I never thought with
you as more than a friend.

299
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,360
Love

300
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,000
What is this?

301
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm feeling good when I'm with you.

302
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,200
But I never thought about
anything more than that.

303
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,040
And all that...

304
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,320
You cheated on me?

305
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,480
I think I got cheated?

306
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,560
So that Mira, if I don't
find out on her own

307
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,040
When will you tell me?

308
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,400
Love, calm down first.

309
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,560
The most troubled person

310
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,840
Could this be me?

311
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,120
Do you know how
hard it is to be with you?

312
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
What about Cia's lyrics?

313
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,080
What about the story
of Mhok girlfriend?

314
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,480
And then there's the Mira story.

315
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,520
What did you see me as?

316
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,600
I don't want things to be like this.

317
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,640
I'm so apologizes

318
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,160
All along, I had never
felt good about anyone.

319
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,400
It's just like how I feel about you.

320
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,880
As for Mira

321
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,240
I can handle this. Trust me.

322
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,320
Enough.

323
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,200
The more you talk, the more
uncomfortable it becomes.

324
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,840
I'm so uncomfortable that
I don't know what to do.

325
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,560
I said not to pay
attention to what Mira said.

326
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,360
If it's that you, you can do it?

327
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,880
I don't want to be like this.

328
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,080
You said...

329
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,040
You can fix this?

330
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,760
Yes sure

331
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,760
I can fix this.

332
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,360
Love, trusts me.

333
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,920
Well...

334
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,800
Let's go back to the way we were.

335
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,960
I means...

336
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,240
The kind where we don't have
to know each other anymore

337
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,040
No, love.

338
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,400
What is this, love?

339
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,880
No way!

340
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,200
And if possible

341
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,400
I hope we don't have to meet again.

342
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,600
Love

343
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,200
No, love.

344
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,440
Doing what?

345
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,720
Hey Blue

346
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,680
Where have you been?

347
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,920
You

348
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,520
It's nothing, right?

349
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,360
Then why are you smiling so much?

350
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,480
Or...

351
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,120
Glad I'm back.

352
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,920
Can you promise?

353
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,000
That you won't
disappear anywhere again

354
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,600
I can't not make promises?

355
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,560
Because I don't know
what will happen next.

356
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,360
But I will be here.

357
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,920
To wait and see your success

358
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,960
You

359
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,680
Why are you following me?

360
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,400
Where else have you
been fighting with dogs?

361
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,760
Yeah, I'm...

362
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,720
Sorry

363
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,960
what happened

364
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,960
You called me out because

365
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,240
Is this the case?

366
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
We got hit by a Type punch.

367
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,600
what happened

368
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,680
Can I trust you?

369
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,920
How many hearts do you want?

370
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,280
You can just tell me.

371
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,760
I have only one heart.

372
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,160
Can I leave it with you?

373
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,120
Enough!

374
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
Can you tell me now that..

375
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,760
What happened?

376
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,080
Your Gang

377
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,360
Q...

378
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,040
went and betrayed Type.

379
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,080
He went to tell Mira about Love.

380
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,400
I knew it!

381
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,720
Love must be Mira's target.

382
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,400
That's right.

383
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,200
Type also looks serious.

384
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,480
Even though him know it's impossible

385
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,840
And then Q

386
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,040
liking someone like Love.

387
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,080
My friend is so beautiful.

388
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,800
That's why things are like this.

389
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,640
Those two are also our friends.

390
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,560
I get it.

391
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,840
I never thought it
would come to this point.

392
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,480
never mind

393
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,680
Give them both time to reflect on
themselves. Things will get better.

394
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,240
I hope so too.

395
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,200
It hurts, Jod.

396
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,400
Enough!

397
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,560
I give you medicine.

398
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,200
Take it easy

399
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,480
Wait, stop it.

400
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,760
Are you carrying drugs with you now?

401
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,720
is...

402
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,920
Or did you check out my Instagram?

403
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,280
No

404
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,400
Are you sure?

405
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,320
yeah.

406
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,080
Let's me see.

407
00:24:59,480 --> 00:24:59,880
Jod

408
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,280
You did it.

409
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,960
Where you are looking at me?

410
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,040
What do you think about me?

411
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,120
Think about what?

412
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,280
Apply the medicine yourself.

413
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,080
What did you do
yourself? I can't see it.

414
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,040
You do it for me.

415
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,520
I'm hurting.

416
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,320
Cia

417
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,400
What's wrong, son?

418
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,240
Mom, aren't you sleeping yet?

419
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,080
I hasn't gone to bed yet, son.

420
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,440
Mom,

421
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,440
If you...

422
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,520
Knowing the story
of a person all along

423
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,640
And then you became attached to him.

424
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,880
worried about him.

425
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,000
but...

426
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,640
When it reaches a certain point

427
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,160
You could not help him at all.

428
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,040
What are you doing next?

429
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,960
I thinks that we all

430
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,520
Doing what?

431
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,080
That want to be successful.

432
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,240
But it's not easy.

433
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,640
We may encounter obstacles.

434
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,840
But it will be a lesson.

435
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,680
Let us learn.

436
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,160
I want to be one of them.

437
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,400
When you tired, you thinks of

438
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,360
You worry about something

439
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,440
You can vent to me.

440
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,160
Well...

441
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,920
How are you doing with your
music practice these days, my child?

442
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,360
mom...

443
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
How did you know about this?

444
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,800
Cia plays music

445
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,200
Cia

446
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
I'm your mother.

447
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,520
Why wouldn't I know?

448
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,600
Then...

449
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,880
If you knew this,

450
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,760
You will...

451
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,880
Be okay?

452
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,200
Cia

453
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,600
You love

454
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,160
And be happy

455
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,240
In what you did, son?

456
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,240
I loves to playing
music so much, Mom.

457
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm admitted that

458
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,120
All along

459
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
I'm very happy playing music.

460
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,960
although

461
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,000
I have to hide and hide from you.

462
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,880
Cia

463
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,640
If you love it

464
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,880
And be happy in what you do.

465
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,680
I'm always ready to support you.

466
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,880
I have doubts for a long time.

467
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,480
that...

468
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
What's wrong with music, Mom?

469
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,280
At that time

470
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,480
You still very young.

471
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,920
You probably doesn't
remember anything.

472
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,520
But it's me and your
father's business, my child.

473
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,880
in fact

474
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,760
Your father and me

475
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,280
We broke up.

476
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,040
Because we didn't
stop loving each other.

477
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,320
But there's more to it than that.

478
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,880
Lately, him has also...

479
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,960
go home

480
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,600
Too late

481
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Or else...

482
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,920
He never went home.

483
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,200
And the worst thing

484
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,120
That is, leaving me alone.

485
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,120
So I decided

486
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,960
To divorce with him

487
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,520
I love you mom.

488
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,280
I love you too, Cia.

489
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,760
Blue

490
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,040
You...

491
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,120
it is nothing

492
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,720
I understand

493
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,520
Cia

494
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,200
All along

495
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,480
Thank you very much.

496
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,080
I'm so very happy.

497
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,800
That we both met

498
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,200
But...

499
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,160
What?

500
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,040
I think...

501
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
Can I be honest?

502
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,480
I'm afraid that we will...

503
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,080
I'm just wondering.

504
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,240
Why did you...

505
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,320
That I can come back?

506
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,040
Something like that

507
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,560
I don't know.

508
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,560
It's very strange.

509
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,000
It's like I'm in a wide open space.

510
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,880
No people

511
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,160
No color

512
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,800
But we heard the sound
of a guitar being played.

513
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,640
But it's very strange.

514
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,320
That is the song

515
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,040
It's a very familiar song.

516
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,920
But I can't remember
the name of the song.

517
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,600
The song I play?

518
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,760
yes

519
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,360
It's like I hear it so often.

520
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,800
but...

521
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,200
Every time I hear it

522
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,960
It's like having
symptoms all the time.

523
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,920
That's true.

524
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,040
before

525
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,480
I also play this song.

526
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,240
And then suddenly

527
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
You are gone.

528
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,280
But this time,

529
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
I also play this song.

530
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,920
And then you come back.

531
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,240
That's strange.

532
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,280
Then...

533
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,320
Is

534
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,560
I can feel you, this is...

535
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,880
If that's the case

536
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,480
I'm not sure either.

537
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,280
Same as everything

538
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,880
It's according to feeling.

539
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,080
How about this?

540
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,480
I think...

541
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,440
The two of us

542
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,640
How about we go for a walk in
the park in front of the village?

543
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,240
And then

544
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,760
guitar

545
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,160
Leave it in this room.

546
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,120
Or else...

547
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,240
I'll leave it in my mother's
room so she'll know for sure.

548
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,560
Wait a minute.

549
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,880
And won't your mother mind?

550
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,720
It just so happens that...

551
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,000
When you disappeared

552
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,520
Our mother...

553
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,120
know the whole everything now.

554
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,600
It's useless to hide it.

555
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,520
People who are mother and child

556
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,160
but...

557
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,640
Mother Sai also...

558
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,840
Glad to see me succeed

559
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,520
With what I'm intended.

560
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,720
Really?

561
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,280
Congratulations, Cia.

562
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,160
Mom

563
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,680
What do you say, son?

564
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,000
Are you okay?

565
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,520
What do you say?

566
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,520
Umm...

567
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,160
I will go for a walk outside.

568
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,200
So I'm going to leave
my guitar with you.

569
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,600
Sure.

570
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,840
Are you going out, son?

571
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,280
The weather is cold.
I will get you a shirt.

572
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,240
okay

573
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,440
I'll leave it here for now.

574
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,160
Sure

575
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,040
Don't forget to put it in.

576
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,000
thank you

577
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And don't come back late.

578
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,880
Bye bye. I'll be going now.

579
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,760
bye bye

580
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,440
You...

581
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,640
Be careful.

582
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,760
Okay

583
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,680
Why did your body disappear?

584
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,520
I'm still here.

585
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,200
calm down

586
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,560
It'll disappear again soon.

587
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,640
Too much.

588
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
Are you okay?

589
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,200
I'm ok.

590
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,000
Enough, Cia.

591
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,080
I think we've come far enough.

592
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,040
I feel like...

593
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,880
Guitars are probably
no longer necessary.

594
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,200
That's right.

595
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,560
I mean

596
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,160
You don't have to be
near the guitar anymore.

597
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,120
Your body hasn't
disappeared anywhere either.

598
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:20,960
Is that right?

599
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,920
Or maybe it's because of the song

600
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,200
Or whatever

601
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,200
I don't know either.

602
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,720
Well...

603
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,880
Let's try it again.

604
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,640
What are you trying?

605
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,760
Well...

606
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,320
When we let you off the guitar

607
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
You can do it too.

608
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,120
Your body hasn't
disappeared anywhere either.

609
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,240
But if we think it's
because of the song

610
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,360
Then...

611
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,520
How about we both listen
to that song together?

612
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,040
okay

613
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,560
okay

614
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,440
Blue

615
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,160
One day

616
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,840
Blue

617
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,360
Blue

618
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,400
You have to be reasonable.

619
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,480
What is

620
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,840
Your Reason

621
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,920
You said you love music.

622
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,680
But what you are doing now

623
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,880
Are you betraying
what you love like this?

624
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,160
Blue

625
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,680
Blue, calm down.

626
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,200
It's okay, Blue.

627
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,920
Take it easy.

628
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,480
Done

629
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,440
I'm done.

630
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
I lost to you again.

631
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,600
Whenever I play with you,
it's like I'm slapping a chicken.

632
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,480
Bored

633
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,880
Can we play another round?

634
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,040
I want to win

635
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,560
That's enough, bro.

636
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,480
I'm tired from playing.

637
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,960
Why

638
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,040
Well...

639
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,840
Can we continue playing tonight?

640
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,760
Even heavier than before

641
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,160
I don't want to sleep
late these days, friends.

642
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,760
My acne is all over.

643
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,800
Wait, Pink and Pim won't
follow us and scream.

644
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,840
People like us need help.

645
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,640
what

646
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,320
How can you not be any?

647
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,120
Try it.

648
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,040
Trust me, your face will be
clear and acne-free for sure.

649
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,480
Really good

650
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,560
Is that right?

651
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,760
Thanks, Q.

652
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,000
It's okay, friend. Give me.

653
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,520
Can we borrow it?

654
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,280
But not returned

655
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,840
Oh, what is it? You
bought it for yourself.

656
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,760
Oh, Q, please, please, please.

657
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,320
Cee

658
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,040
Cee

659
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,800
No return, seize, seize now.

660
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,640
Hold on, hold on.

661
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,200
Come here.

662
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,520
Cee

663
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,800
Stay here
