1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,200
Everyone has their best moments.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,280
The most struggling

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,200
Some parts of life that were always good

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,200
And it couldn't get any better than this.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:31,160
I will compose a love song for you to listen to.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,840
From that day we passed each other

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,320
She was stuck in the rain there.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,040
Inside my soaked heart

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,000
And one day we will walk together.

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,960
Hello my friends, wake up already.

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,480
You can't be late for the first period today.

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,280
Okay, but let's meet at our regular table first.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,080
Let's go together, okay?

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,360
okay

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,320
Okay, hurry up and come.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,600
Yes, friend. I know.

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm sian.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,320
Now I'm in my second year.

19
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,280
Studying at the Faculty of Fine Arts

20
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,560
Is it cool?

21
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,360
My dream?

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,520
I want to be an artist.

23
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,360
But also

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,200
It might be a bit difficult.

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,280
Because I'm not very good yet.

26
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,600
Now, it's probably

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,240
Study to survive first.

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,040
First day of second semester

29
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,880
Have a nice day, Sia.

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,760
Good morning, my son. Come and eat your breakfast quickly.

31
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,840
Good morning, Mom. What's for dinner?

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,560
Mom made porridge for us to eat. Does it look delicious?

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,640
tasty

34
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,480
but

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,080
It's okay, Mom.

36
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,600
It's late. We'll be late in time.

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,320
Okay, okay.

38
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,280
Thank you.

39
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,760
okay

40
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,560
Mom, can you eat it all by yourself?

41
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
You can eat it, son.

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,280
Aren't you lonely?

43
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,400
Not lonely

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,440
Bye bye bye

45
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,760
bye bye

46
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,880
Dad, you play really well.

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,440
Do you like it? Does Sia want to play the guitar, son?

48
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,640
I like it. I want my father to teach Sia for a long time.

49
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,720
okay

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,480
In that case, Xia must come practice with dad every day.

51
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,480
Is that okay?

52
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,400
I will play with determination.

53
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
I practiced hard until I became a musician like my father.

54
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,040
Sure, let's give it a try.

55
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,960
excuse me

56
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,800
excuse me

57
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,960
This year, there will only be... people selected.

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,440
alone

59
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,040
I wonder if I can do it.

60
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,280
So brutal!

61
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,400
This year, you're only accepting one person?

62
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,200
excuse me

63
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,920
Excuse me.

64
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,960
Oh, Xia!

65
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,720
What are you doing? Why are you late?

66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,800
Yeah, that's right.

67
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
I called you to wake you up early this morning.

68
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,200
oh

69
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,680
I saw the fog standing there looking at me too.

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,920
Let me see.

71
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,520
What club did you apply for?

72
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,000
This is you.

73
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,600
is

74
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
do not know

75
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,280
We are not sure either.

76
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,720
but

77
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,520
When I stood there

78
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,320
Suddenly

79
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,200
Someone just happened to walk into me.

80
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,160
And this one

81
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,400
It's already in my hands.

82
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,680
I don't know.

83
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,440
Will it work?

84
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,160
So I waited to ask you guys.

85
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,040
Here you are saying

86
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,640
Is it a divine selection? Is it a divine arrangement? Is it a divine inspiration?

87
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,800
So we're going to have an artist friend?

88
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,440
but...

89
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,360
Are you serious, Sia?

90
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,960
Why?

91
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,360
This Xian will be in the audio club.

92
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,800
I can't imagine it at all.

93
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,440
already

94
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,640
Is Nong Love single?

95
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,440
Is this the right time?

96
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
We just don't want people like you.

97
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,560
Go into that kind of environment.

98
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,080
Liu means Type Q&A?

99
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,600
This type is the one Liu detests the most.

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Why do you hate it?

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,960
Well, I don't like flirtatious people like you.

102
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,280
Wow, that's strong.

103
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,600
Then, would you like to join our content club?

104
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,880
I will take you out to review restaurants every week.

105
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,680
no

106
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,720
Not the way at all

107
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,680
Liu

108
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,480
As for those three people,

109
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,080
If we don't pay attention to them or don't get involved with them,

110
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,200
I guess it's okay.

111
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,440
just

112
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,760
I'm afraid I won't be able to do it well.

113
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,920
Even though we don't really agree with it,

114
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,400
But don't think like that if you really want to do it.

115
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,160
If Liu is worried about those three people,

116
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,040
It will find a way to help you deal with it.

117
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
Can you help me?

118
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,520
That's a lot, man.

119
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,080
We are also worried about you.

120
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,440
That you really have to go through something like that.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,920
But it's better to do what Xia wants to do.

122
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
Yeah, that's true.

123
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,880
If you really want to do it

124
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,600
Don't think too much about it, man.

125
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,000
We are always on your side.

126
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,080
But we think that now

127
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,680
Let's go to school.

128
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,600
On the first day of school, you might get late for roll call.

129
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,040
Oh, that's true.

130
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,440
Oh, that's right.

131
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,680
Let's go! Let's go!

132
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,880
It's late.

133
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,440
Yes!

134
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,000
Go Liu go.

135
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,960
Xia

136
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,800
Xia

137
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,240
What's wrong? I've called you several times, but why can't you hear me?

138
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,520
oh

139
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
nothing

140
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,640
I was just lost in my thoughts for a moment.

141
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,760
It's not like this anymore, my ears are ringing like this.

142
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,160
We know you want to do it.

143
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,080
If doing so makes you happy

144
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,560
Just do it.

145
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,160
but

146
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
If you can't do it...

147
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
What will the results be?

148
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,200
Don't worry about it.

149
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,680
If you've done your best,

150
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
You don't have to regret anything, Xia.

151
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,520
Thanks man.

152
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,600
Let's go and study.

153
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,520
I don't even know anymore.

154
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,200
Whatever happens, happens.

155
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,480
Wow, that looks delicious.

156
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,760
Eat a lot, son.

157
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,160
yes

158
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,600
Xia

159
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,320
How was your first day of school, my child?

160
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
Is the university lively?

161
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,760
It's good, Mom. It's going well.

162
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,280
It's been a long school break.

163
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,160
It's fun to come back and see my friends.

164
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,960
That's good.

165
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,320
You're in your second year now, so don't be distracted. Focus on your studies.

166
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,720
Do you have a girlfriend?

167
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,880
Oh my gosh!

168
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,600
There isn't any.

169
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,080
Where will I find time to find it?

170
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,800
Xia

171
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm so busy with work.

172
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,400
Oh, that's good, that's good.

173
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
If you have a boyfriend, don't tell your mom.

174
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,840
Definitely got it.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,720
Yes, Mom.

176
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,120
Xia already tells her mother everything.

177
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,800
I love my mother to death.

178
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,720
Eat a lot of rice.

179
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,280
Look, she's thin now.

180
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,800
He'll think that Mother Xia is not good.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,880
Eat rice, son.

182
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,840
Won't you give me a hug?

183
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,920
Eat rice, eat rice. Look, I made you some tom kha kai.

184
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,800
Did your mom make it herself?

185
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,040
Yes, this is chicken tom kha, my friend.

186
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,760
My favorite.

187
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,120
Until one day she came in

188
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,640
I can feel it just by looking into your eyes, my heart desires that.

189
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,720
I found you, the one who made my heart stop searching.

190
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,160
I found you. You held me captive and kept me in your sight.

191
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,160
I will write a love song and wait for you to listen.

192
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,560
mother

193
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,720
From that day we passed each other

194
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
Is something wrong?

195
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,480
Um, hello, Mom. Is something wrong?

196
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,360
Nothing much, son.

197
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,160
Mom just wanted to ask why this morning

198
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,080
Looks like he's rushing out of the house.

199
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,480
Breakfast that mom made for me on the table

200
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,200
I didn't see him eat even a single bite.

201
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,440
Are you in a hurry to do something at the university, son?

202
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,640
It's nothing, Mom.

203
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,880
is

204
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Xia

205
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,720
oh

206
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,920
Sia, please hurry and submit the report.

207
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,840
The teacher asked me to submit it in the morning. I'm afraid I won't be able to submit it in time.

208
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,360
Hearing that, my mother felt relieved.

209
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,680
So, have you submitted your work already?

210
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,040
Oh, it's all right, Mom.

211
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,840
mother

212
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,040
Xia just happened to meet a friend.

213
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,960
Then I'll excuse myself first.

214
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,400
Wait, wait, wait, son.

215
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,680
Tonight, find yourself dinner and eat it yourself, my child.

216
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Yes, Mom.

217
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,720
Mom has to go out and run some errands. She'll probably come back late.

218
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,280
oh

219
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,440
Okay, okay, Mom. That's all for now.

220
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,960
Almost there, huh?

221
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,320
Hoy!

222
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,040
Is this really a classical guitar?

223
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
So cool

224
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,080
Er... I can play just fine.

225
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,160
What do you get when you play?

226
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,720
This guitar is so classic. So cool.

227
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,560
but

228
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,840
Other people are probably much better than me.

229
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,280
Be confident, my friend.

230
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,520
Hey Mark

231
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,360
Hey Q

232
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,800
Oh, you look great. I think you'll definitely pass this.

233
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,440
Normally, you can prepare to wait.

234
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,520
We'll definitely join your group.

235
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,360
Wow, you got to get through this first.

236
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,160
Don't look down on each other. Don't look down on each other.

237
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,320
And what time did you get here?

238
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,040
Well, he made an appointment for ten o'clock, so we came at six.

239
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,960
This guy is really prepared.

240
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,680
Let's eat first. Have you eaten yet?

241
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,640
We haven't eaten yet.

242
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,440
Let's go eat when we're done.

243
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,320
Okay friend.

244
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
What are you doing here, little Q?

245
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,200
I just came into the club.

246
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,320
Come see your club friends

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,280
Come see your club friends

248
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,520
Or come and see the girls.

249
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,080
Both of them

250
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,560
Look, isn't it cute?

251
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,640
Type, look at it again.

252
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,800
next

253
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,320
He aims...

254
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,720
Is Mark there?

255
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,480
Yes, brother.

256
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,320
Please come inside. Yes, yes.

257
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,440
meet

258
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,760
Let's get through this, man.

259
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,160
Who is this?

260
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,600
Our friends

261
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,880
Name Mark

262
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,960
He plays the guitar very well.

263
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,520
You have to stay in our group like this.

264
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,760
Actually, why did you guys come here?

265
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,160
I came to follow you to study here.

266
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,360
Why are you checking in?

267
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Hey, I have to go now.

268
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,040
Then why didn't you check for us?

269
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,000
What are they checking? They're checking each person individually.

270
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,680
Go fast

271
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,760
Oh, I wonder if we can do it or not.

272
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,000
That's right. Why are there only talented people this year?

273
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,240
Hello, brother...

274
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,520
Tham, you can call me Brother Tham. I'm in my fourth year now.

275
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,080
Oh, and this is Brother Sol.

276
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
This person is Brother Ryu.

277
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,040
I'm a second year student in the Faculty of Fine Arts.

278
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,280
Hello, Xia.

279
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,720
Please come here now.

280
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,920
Don't be excited.

281
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,720
Play casually and chill.

282
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,040
calm down

283
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,960
If you're ready, let's get started.

284
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Until one day she realized it just by looking into my eyes.

285
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,720
The person my heart desires

286
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,400
I found you, the one who made my heart stop searching.

287
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
I found you. You held me captive and kept me in your sight.

288
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,120
I will watch over your freshness, which is more beautiful and beautiful.

289
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,840
No matter if it's a diamond or a gem, every piece will be defeated by her.

290
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,320
Good luck.

291
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,400
And then

292
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,920
I hope you meet the person you want to meet just like the song says.

293
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,080
Thank you very much.

294
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,400
In that case, I'll be going now.

295
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,480
Not too obvious, right?

296
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,040
Brother,

297
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,920
Sister Sia

298
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,760
Yes, brother.

299
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,160
is

300
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,080
Can you give me your number?

301
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,600
It seems like we entered the wrong number.

302
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,880
When I called to check

303
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,200
My brother can't reach us by phone.

304
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,520
Oh, really?

305
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,960
I'm sorry, Brother Tham.

306
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,680
wait a minute

307
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,080
Let me find a pen for a moment.

308
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,000
Then I think we should save the number on our device.

309
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,120
So that it won't be wrong.

310
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,480
okay

311
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,880
It's done.

312
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,080
thank you

313
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,040
See you later, Sia.

314
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,120
Okay, okay.

315
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,480
Thank you.

316
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,240
Yes, hello.

317
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,920
Paphinwit Phatthanapinya

318
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,320
Yay! I did it!

319
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:28,200
I will write a love song for you to listen to.

320
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,040
Hello, who are you?

321
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,400
is

322
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,960
I'm here to congratulate you.

323
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,520
Welcome to the music club

324
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,320
Very good.

325
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,080
Thank you, Brother Tham.

326
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,160
See you later.

327
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,840
Yes, see you later, Sia.

328
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,040
I'll be able to join the club tomorrow.

329
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,960
Xia

330
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,440
What are you doing making so much noise, son?

331
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,800
can sleep now

332
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,320
Don't you have class tomorrow?

333
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,360
Sorry, Mom. I'm going to bed now.

334
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,400
This guy is very handsome.

335
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,920
Really, it's beautiful, isn't it?

336
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,720
for

337
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,720
Why do people we see playing the guitar so well?

338
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,360
Why didn't he get into the club?

339
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,160
Oh, that's right. I wondered the same thing as Mark.

340
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,880
How could it not be stuck?

341
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,760
I am confused

342
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,000
Is there someone better than him?

343
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,920
I really regret losing Brother Mark.

344
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,040
It's like this

345
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,280
He's also good at playing music.

346
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,600
TRUE

347
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,040
And it's also charming.

348
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,360
TRUE

349
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,040
It's over.

350
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,800
I missed watching him play music on stage.

351
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,600
With Brother Type, Brother Q, Brother C.

352
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,200
feel hurt

353
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,120
I wonder what criteria they use to select.

354
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,480
If you want to bring in someone who is not good enough, why would you bring them in?

355
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,360
But go see it.

356
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,440
TRUE

357
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,280
You sir, sir.

358
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,840
Oh, okay.

359
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,120
The drinks are ready.

360
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,600
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,200
Scan and pay successfully.

362
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,040
thank you

363
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,120
Thank you, Brother Tham.

364
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,280
What are you looking at? I'm embarrassed.

365
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,240
Now, let's go to the club room, Sia.

366
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,120
Yes, brother.

367
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm bored. Is there anything I can do?

368
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,360
You guys should practice some too.

369
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,640
Don't just lie around and play.

370
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,480
Hey everyone!

371
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,120
Hello, Brother Tham.

372
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,080
Anyway

373
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,240
We came early this morning.

374
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,840
Hurry up and show me your new song. Come on!

375
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,000
In a moment, show a new song.

376
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,440
First of all, I have a new friend to introduce to you.

377
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
Those are the people who passed the audition to join the club.

378
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,840
This person is cool.

379
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,080
Year 2, the same as us.

380
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,520
As for Sia, this person is type Q and C.

381
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,720
Uh... Hello Type.

382
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm just hungry, bro.

383
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,120
I'll do it another day.

384
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,120
Hey friend, let's eat.

385
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,400
Go ahead, Brother Tham.

386
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,440
I'm so hungry.

387
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,680
It's okay.

388
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,160
Those little guys must be really hungry.

389
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,000
Sia can already play the guitar.

390
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,520
I'll find time to practice with them later.

391
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,880
Okay, bro.

392
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,040
And this room is open since early morning.

393
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,440
On days when Sia has afternoon classes or doesn't want to rush home

394
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,000
Come and chill out.

395
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,560
Come play the guitar here first.

396
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,480
But before leaving the room

397
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,040
Please help me look after the cleanliness.

398
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,640
Actually, we have our own karma, but let's help each other do our part.

399
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
Sure, bro.

400
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,800
Do you like it?

401
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,440
I don't like Sia's face at all.

402
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,880
Yes, she's very timid and weak like that.

403
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,760
Do you think you can hold a guitar?

404
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,080
Because P'Tham was kind to it.

405
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,160
Oh yeah, that day.

406
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,520
We went to secretly watch him audition.

407
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,360
There are only good people.

408
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,200
If there are only really good people

409
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
How did that Tim get in?

410
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,520
That's right.

411
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,920
The conditions are not suitable for a music club.

412
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,240
The most I can do is do aerobics behind Lotus.

413
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,280
Like this?

414
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,560
You guys, Xia is coming here.

415
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,560
Why are you making such a sad face?

416
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,920
Is something wrong?

417
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
You ask.

418
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,880
That's you.

419
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,800
It's you.

420
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,680
Enough. What are you whispering? Everyone knows.

421
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,200
You ask.

422
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:25,920
Yes!

423
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
What's wrong, Siah?

424
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,400
It's nothing.

425
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,800
You're not really anything.

426
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,320
Your face is not what your mouth says.

427
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Just say it.

428
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,480
Don't tell me that the three baht in the club is

429
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,840
See, I said it must be three baht.

430
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,680
Hoy!

431
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,280
Calm down and sit down.

432
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,360
Listen to your friend first.

433
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,600
If you have anything to say, please tell us.

434
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,480
We will help each other.

435
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,000
There's really nothing.

436
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,960
Don't think too much about it, guys.

437
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,320
just

438
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,360
It's just a matter of studying.

439
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,640
What do you study?

440
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,040
Here we have friends in the top three.

441
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,360
Yes, our talented Miss Love.

442
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,200
Fog may be something that cannot be spoken of.

443
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,320
But if it's really about studying, Love can help.

444
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,800
Let's go home.

445
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,120
It'll get dark soon.

446
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,520
Love, let's go home.

447
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:52,640
What is this? What is this in our house?

448
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,120
Our way back home.

449
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,040
oh

450
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,960
There are a lot of missing words.

451
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,040
Enough. Let's go home. I'll be going now, Sia.

452
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,080
Let's go home. I'm going now, Sia.

453
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,600
bye bye

454
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,120
See you. Go back safely.

455
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
It's back to good.

456
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,280
There is a personal bodyguard for the princess of this size.

457
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,000
You're annoying, man.

458
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,520
Let's go, love.

459
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,000
bye bye

460
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,560
What the heck, leaving us again?

461
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,120
Let's go back together.

462
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,840
Let's go home, Siah.

463
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,400
Come on, come on.

464
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,320
You're so dazzling, man.

465
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,200
This kind of thing is definitely possible.

466
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,280
I've already got an account.

467
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,800
for a few minutes

468
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,880
People walking past when entering the restroom

469
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,280
Your face looks like a new kid's.

470
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,720
Is that right?

471
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,320
Tim like that

472
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,680
What kind of trip is this?

473
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,480
I don't think it's right. It's just similar.

474
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,280
But what's its name?

475
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,440
The name doesn't sound good to us.

476
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,320
Maybe a Persian name?

477
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,600
Meow, that's a cat.

478
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,360
Just a moment.

479
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,080
It's like we remember.

480
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,960
Its name is

481
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,840
Is that Xia?

482
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,760
We heard that it's in the same gang as Liu.

484
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,240
Is that Tom?

485
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,160
So you're Tom?

486
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,240
Such a thin waist

487
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,080
Do you still call me Tom?

488
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,960
I don't know.

489
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,760
We think it's a bit strange and bold.

490
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,120
Liu is not a tomboy. Liu just doesn't like men.

491
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,640
Bully Addicted Bully Addicted

492
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,480
Mr. Teasing

493
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,600
but

494
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,720
Seriously, man.

495
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,520
That guy named Sia.

496
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,560
The size of the little one

497
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,760
The music lessons we learned when we were kids haven't passed yet.

498
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,600
Very good mark

499
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,760
Still not passed

500
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,800
So how did Xia get in?

501
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,640
We say that

502
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,920
Brother Tham is infatuated again, I guess.

503
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,600
What the hell are you obsessed with?

504
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,920
We mean that Brother Tham likes to give opportunities to children who are not good.

505
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,080
Because these children can develop.

506
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,800
Stop talking. The more I listen, the more irritated I get.

507
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,360
Oh wow type

508
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,440
You're the first one, Type.

509
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,680
Oh, right. I forgot.

510
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,640
Let's do this, let's do that.

511
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,560
We have a plan to prank it.

512
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,320
Go ahead and do it.

513
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,920
Come on, we can do anything you want. It's up to you guys.

514
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,600
Hello everyone, welcome to the channel.

515
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,720
Jodji Yesterday

516
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,200
Today, Jod and friends.

517
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,480
Take a look at the best restaurant in this area.

518
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,080
First of all, let me introduce my friends.

519
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,040
This is the Godfather of Speaking.

520
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,000
Hello, I'm Mok.

521
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,440
Later, my love

522
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,280
My daughter. Just kidding.

523
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,120
This is my love, a beautiful and adorable young lady.

524
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,480
Hello everyone.

525
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,600
And the last one

526
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Liu the lover

527
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,920
Guardian of Little Love

528
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,000
Lover...

529
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,920
Okay, let's take a look at this meal.

530
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,680
Can I eat it right away?

531
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,880
Eat it now.

532
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,080
We're here to treat you, you know.

533
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,840
Let's eat this one. We've been eyeing it for a long time.

534
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,520
That's enough for today.

535
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,080
It's late.

536
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,800
A type

537
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,760
Thank you for helping us today.

538
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,080
Hey hey hey

539
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,680
You guys hurry up and pack your things.

540
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,640
We want to go home and see our little baby, Care.

541
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh, you change girls every four hours, Q.

542
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,600
I can't help it, because I'm handsome.

543
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,720
Enough, enough. You should pack your things. We're going back.

544
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Oh, I'm keeping it here.

545
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,640
Then we'll be going now. Bye-bye.

546
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,760
Bye bye Sia, see you.

547
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,760
Let's hurry back first.

548
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,200
Oh, see you, Q. Nong Care is waiting for us.

549
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,520
Sister Care is waiting for us.

550
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,920
Xia

551
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,360
We didn't mean it, man.

552
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,360
Hey Q, what are you doing? Why aren't you careful?

553
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,160
We really didn't mean it, man.

554
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,000
Q: You apologized to your friend.

555
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,520
You broke your friend's guitar.

556
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,840
Xia

557
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,960
excuse me

558
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,480
We are fine.

559
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,600
It's definitely okay, Sia.

560
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,320
We are really fine.

561
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,480
Oh, I apologize on behalf of Queue again.

562
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,640
It just so happens that my friend

563
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,440
It's a bit stupid.

564
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,400
Yes, yes, yes.

565
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,000
Then let's go first.

566
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,400
meet

567
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,520
Bye bye, Sia.

568
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,960
Come back safely.

569
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,840
My father gave this guitar to me.

570
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,120
Happy birthday!

571
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,080
Xia

572
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,840
Si Luk

573
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,200
Yes, Mom.

574
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,000
Is anything up?

575
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,760
Is there something bothering you?

576
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,560
I see you standing there in a daze like this.

577
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,840
Or do you have a boyfriend but not tell your mother?

578
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,160
Er... It's not like that at all, Mom.

579
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,000
is...

580
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,560
I just came to ask where my student uniform is.

581
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,000
I just can't find it.

582
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,840
It's just this matter.

583
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,720
I saw you standing there in a daze for a long time.

584
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,240
Don't let me find out that you have a secret with your mother.

585
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,200
No, Mom.

586
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,720
I just wanted to ask where the shirt is.

587
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,880
Just in case, I'll go get it myself.

588
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,960
I'll iron it for you.

589
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,320
Then I'll take it to you.

590
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,200
It's late. Go to sleep now, my child.

591
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,840
Okay.

592
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,760
Good night, Mom.

593
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,920
Good night, my child.

594
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,840
Go to bed early.

595
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,080
yes

596
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,000
Xia is the same.

597
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,440
yes

598
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,080
I'm going now.

599
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,360
bye bye

600
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,120
Good night, my child.

601
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,000
Oh, Xia!

602
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,720
yes

603
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,920
Why did you come early?

604
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,080
Is something wrong?

605
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,480
There's nothing. I just want to play music.

606
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,840
What do you say?

607
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,680
Nothing, just came to play music.

608
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,920
That's why I asked you why you came early.

609
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,480
Uh... Brother Tham.

610
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,480
I just happen to have a little problem.

611
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,400
is

612
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,080
My guitar is broken.

613
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,680
Oh, yesterday was still fine.

614
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,400
what happened

615
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,520
I fell down the stairs.

616
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,600
Hey, what's wrong with Sia?

617
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,160
Then it hit the ground.

618
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,880
Does it hurt anywhere?

619
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,520
My neck is broken.

620
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,600
Huh? Your neck is broken.

621
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,800
It means the guitar neck.

622
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,880
Oh, a guitar neck.

623
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,840
yes

624
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,720
But hasn't Sia been practicing recently?

625
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,120
yes

626
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,440
but

627
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,080
If you take it to be repaired, it should still be playable.

628
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,440
But what about Brother Tham?

629
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,920
Whose guitar is that?

630
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,440
It's from the club's people.

631
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Can I play this to relieve my boredom?

632
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Would that be okay?

633
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,320
Well, other people have their own guitars.

634
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,680
And my guitar is broken too.

635
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,160
I probably won't be able to play against other people anymore.

636
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,160
Brother Tham, please let me go.

637
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,640
That guitar

638
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,720
Whose is it?

639
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,360
Will he say anything?

640
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,640
If Brother Tham can talk to him,

641
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,240
Or if it's not convenient, I can go talk to you myself.

642
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Uh...

643
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,560
That is, that is

644
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,760
Yes, Brother Tham.

645
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,000
Please, please.

646
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,920
If Brother Tham lends it to me

647
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,040
I'll take you out to eat right now.

648
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,720
Yes.

649
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,280
okay

650
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,200
but

651
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,440
You have to take good care of it.

652
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,520
yay

653
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,400
Brother Tham is the kindest. Thank you very much.

654
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
yes

655
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,840
Hey, man.

656
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,040
Oh, you're here already?

657
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,280
Hoy!

658
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,120
Did you buy a new guitar?

659
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,920
Never seen it before.

660
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,720
This is not usually the bag.

661
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,200
is

662
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,760
I just happened to have a small problem.

663
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,640
So

664
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,520
I borrowed the guitar from the club room.

665
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,680
Don't tell me those three are teasing you.

666
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,960
Hey, should we go clear this up?

667
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,000
Liu, come with us. Go.

668
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,880
Hey, calm down, we're just kidding.

669
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,240
Sit down first.

670
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,440
Ouch!

671
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,840
You guys should calm down and let Siaman tell the story first.

672
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,800
It might not be like that, you know.

673
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,840
It's like this.

674
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,920
Yesterday after practice

675
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,960
When I was about to return

676
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,080
We got hit by a queue.

677
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,800
The guitar fell off.

678
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,080
When I got home and opened it, it was already broken.

679
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,360
but

680
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,440
You guys calm down.

681
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,760
It was just an accident.

682
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,560
The queue wasn't intentional.

683
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
What a crazy accident

684
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,200
Because it does...

685
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Calm down, man.

686
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,320
Just an accident

687
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,880
Never mind.

688
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,440
Why are those eyes looking at me?

689
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,720
It's like sending a signal to let us know that

690
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,200
We will get to know each other one day.

691
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,320
Where we both are together

692
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,920
Set the clock to run a little slower.

693
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,680
Let me get a little closer to you.

694
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:47,240
Take it slow, there will come a day when we are ready.

695
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:56,360
It's too hard to feel deep inside, it's crying out

696
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,960
She was there and I could only look.

697
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,720
Before we got into a relationship

698
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:13,000
I will write a love song for you to listen to.

699
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,040
From that day we passed each other

700
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,520
What a strange dream!

701
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,000
Hoy!

702
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,720
Love

703
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,440
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

704
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,200
No, I just haven't put on makeup yet.

705
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,200
Haven't put on makeup yet

706
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,880
What did you say?

707
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,520
I haven't put on makeup yet. Oh, look at this. Look at this.

708
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,560
Where is the sunscreen you asked me to buy?

709
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,200
Is this really that good? I've been using it for a long time.

710
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
That's right.

711
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,560
In addition to protecting from the sun, it also prevents acne.

712
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,280
Oh, I understand.

713
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,160
It also protects against pollution.

714
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,760
this

715
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,400
Got it.

716
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,520
The cutest ever.

717
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,080
I'll be there soon.

718
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,160
I'm going now.

719
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,400
I'll be there soon.
