1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,440
Keep an eyes on P’Time.

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
Okay, hurry up.

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,280
Cia, can you do it faster?

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,440
Just a moment.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,040
Cia

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,520
Please do it faster.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,800
Time might wake up soon.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,480
Be quiet i tried to concentrate.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,240
Cia

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,240
Cia

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,600
Behind

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,200
P’Time...

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,960
What are you doing Cia?

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,520
Nothing

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,800
Nothing what

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,360
Well...

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,360
I saw you...

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,240
I really didn't do anything.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,120
I just want to...

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,080
I saw you were arranging stuff

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,680
Why?

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,120
I...

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,520
I just saw that...

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,400
The room was mess.

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,360
And then...

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,440
And then there were
a lot of things fell out.

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,680
For example...

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,880
This file.

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,040
So...

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,080
I’ll come and arrange it for you.

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,400
So you don't practice music?

32
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,040
Well...

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,280
I saw you fall asleep while we were talking.

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,720
So...

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,960
I'll come to clean the club room for you.

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,120
As for the key...

37
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,280
I saw this placed there.

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,080
So...

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,360
I'll come clean the cabinet for you.

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,680
Actually , it doesn't have to be this much.

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,120
I...

42
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,920
I didn't sleep that deeply.

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,520
But now...

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,160
Music comes first

45
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,000
yes

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,760
but...

47
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,560
But you aren’t angry, right?

48
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,320
What should I be angry about?

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,880
About you don't practice music

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,080
Or...

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,560
About you just randomly
to be productive like this?

52
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,440
otherwise...

53
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,720
If there is nothing else

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,480
I'd like to take my leave now.

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
I've been slacking off all day.

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,560
Next time, I'll...

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
Can I come and use the room
outside of business hours?

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,920
Of course.

59
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,040
Anyway, tell me so I can come with you.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,720
okay

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Thank you.

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,280
I gotta go.

63
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
thank you

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,920
See you later.

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,440
What should we do?

66
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,480
The plan

67
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,920
is not that easy.

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,360
That’s fine

69
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,520
We’ll deal with it later

70
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000
We're not  that much  hurry.

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,800
As Time said

72
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,520
You

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,080
You should focus on music first.

74
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,840
But you...

75
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Are you really studying fine arts?

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,440
what?

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,440
What do you mean?

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,960
just

79
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,440
In the club room

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,760
I saw Mr. Acting 101.

81
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,560
You acted really smoothly with Time.

82
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,920
Even though i study
communication arts, i give up.

83
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,280
so exciting

84
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,120
I mean I’m so worried about you.

85
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,320
It's probably from Jod and Mhok.

86
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,880
The way you making excuses

87
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,320
The more you make excuses

88
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,640
The wound gets deeper.

89
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
So do i have any wounds?

90
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,560
Right here

91
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,160
Or here

92
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,440
Or where?

93
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,720
I think you should hurry back home first.

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,160
It's getting late.

95
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,120
That's true.

96
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,240
I'm leaving now.

97
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Next song

98
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,720
Of course, many people

99
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,560
May have some people you used to love

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,320
But today

101
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,520
That person

102
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,360
May not be with us anymore

103
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,000
This song is for you guys.

104
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,840
Let's listen.

105
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,040
Where we both are together

106
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,600
I miss you.

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,040
The guitar string is broken.

108
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,400
Everyone is really into it right now.

109
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,280
So...

110
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,720
I want to...

111
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,520
Thank you everyone for following.

112
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm going to bed now.

113
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,440
Jod, Mhok my friends

114
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,680
You guys watched over me all night.

115
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,640
I'm leaving now.

116
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,640
bye bye

117
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,280
You

118
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Where have you gone?

119
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,480
Thank you. I have to go.

120
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,440
thank you

121
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:55,560
Did you really break the guitar strings, bro?

122
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,640
I’m so confused. the song wasn’t even
over, but the guitar gave up first. LOL

123
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:11,400
Do you have the guitar string to change ?

124
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,360
Yeah, I’ve got one. I’ll change it .

125
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,680
Thank you for earlier this evening.

126
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,280
Alright, P’Tham. I’ll get
going now. Good night.

127
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,680
Alright, Good night and sweet dreams.

128
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,160
Thank you, Cia.

129
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,080
Why are you smile like this.

130
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,880
Hey you.

131
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
Why you showed up

132
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,160
and disappeared up to you want

133
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,720
Why it be like that ?

134
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,400
I don't want to disappear to somewhere.

135
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,520
Sometimes it feels weird

136
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,760
Some things...

137
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
I probably have to...

138
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,720
Understand things about you too.

139
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,360
however

140
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
I am not going anywhere.

141
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,120
I will stay here...

142
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,480
To see your success

143
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,200
I'd better go take a shower.

144
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,200
Wait a minute.

145
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,560
What else?

146
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,320
I’ll go with you.

147
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,600
Stop it.

148
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,240
Don't even think about it.

149
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,360
Last time

150
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,560
Luckily , i didn’t taken it all off yet.

151
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,680
Why

152
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,680
just that

153
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,160
I’ll go to take a shower.

154
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,600
Don’t follow me

155
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,200
That's it.

156
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,440
Don’t follow me

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
I have already submitted the work.

158
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,600
very handsome

159
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,480
So cool

160
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,560
Very responsible

161
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,360
Who else would be like you?

162
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,680
Oh, sis.

163
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,360
Is this Maebia?  you’re a poisonous snake

164
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,280
That's Cia.

165
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,120
Cia

166
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,560
Cia

167
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,680
Get a grip

168
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,440
Come here.

169
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,520
oh

170
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,720
I didn't see it, sorry.

171
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,000
You don't see it.

172
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,000
Or are you focusing on the wrong thing?

173
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,120
Why do you seem to be in such a hurry?

174
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,160
No, nothing.

175
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,400
If i was a police

176
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,920
and i have to catch the
thief who stole the stuff.

177
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,080
I will arrest you first.

178
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,160
There are many suspicious signs.

179
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,680
If you don't want to talk, then don't talk.

180
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,840
But if you can't handle
it or you need advice,

181
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,400
You can talk to us, you know?

182
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,000
Thank you guys so much.

183
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,520
Because we are friends.

184
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,600
Jod

185
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,080
Is that right, love?

186
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,280
Right?

187
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,200

188
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,880

Cia

192
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,600

How are you

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,600
How are you?

195
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,720
what

196
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,000
About i asked you to keep an eyes on

197
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:58,840
Well...

198
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
It’s normal

199
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,160
There is nothing to worry about.

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,880
I think...

201
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,120
You think too much.

202
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,120
Really?

203
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,320
That's right.

204
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,400
but...

205
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,920
You just watch it.

206
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,760
I...

207
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,880
Still not trusting

208
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,120
okay

209
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,640
but...

210
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,880
in fact...

211
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,720
We rarely meet them.

212
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,480
Every time I come to practice

213
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,240
They don't really care.

214
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,520
When i arrived at the club,

215
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,360
Then thet walked out.

216
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,480
So...

217
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,680
If they don't practice...

218
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,120
Then what are they doing?

219
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,000
Suspicious

220
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,400
I think...

221
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,480
It’s not normal

222
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,520
Don’t you think it's strange?

223
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,760
That day...

224
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,680
Type invited me to play basketball.

225
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,600
There is something fishy.

226
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,240
Wait.

227
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,240
Are you Conan?

228
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm afraid that it’s turned
out to be a cow eating grass.

229
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,000
What did you say ?

230
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,800
What's the big deal?

231
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,320
If there is anything

232
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,880
I’ll tell you later.

233
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,240
You can put your mind at ease.

234
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,680
Is that okay?

235
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,160
Well done my friend.

236
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,800
It was worth the trust.

237
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,720
It's too much.

238
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,960
But now...

239
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,160
Can you go now, madam?

240
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:16,920
Look

241
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,200
They've all arrived at the building.

242
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,840
Go, don't stress.

243
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,320
What in the mood, why you come play music.

244
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,560
That's right.

245
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,240
I haven't seen him play for a long time.

246
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,240
Since he put that guitar down

247
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,600
Which was already given to Cia.

248
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,240
What's wrong with him?

249
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,800
Time

250
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,320
Time

251
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Time

252
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,880
Did you see Type?

253
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
Is anything up?

254
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,720
Then why are you guys shouting?

255
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,240
We called out loud but
you didn't turn around.

256
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,800
For real?

257
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,280
So, did you see Type?

258
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,640
Type said he would walk
into the club room with us.

259
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,800
I didn’t see him.

260
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,800
You have been sitting here for a long time.

261
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,640
Probably not in the classroom.

262
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,600
Normally, he’ll enter the
classroom at the end of the class.

263
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,040
Ah, great…

264
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,960
Didn’t he go to meet a girl somewhere?

265
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,680
Or...

266
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,800
Love, do you want to eat
something? I'll go buy it for you.

267
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,600
fried rice is fine.

268
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,760
Do you like rice.

269
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,440
Or do you like me?

270
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,800
What are you playing?

271
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
So cute.

272
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
I’ll go buy some rice.

273
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,320
The food's here, Beautiful girl.

274
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,960
beautiful ? You’re over talking it

275
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,200
if...

276
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,480
If this is not called beautiful.

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,480
So...

278
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,200
What could have been called beautiful ?

279
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,840
Well...

280
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,560
People who’s looks like you.

281
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,000
What people called it beautiful .

282
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,440
and...

283
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,800
cute

284
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,360
Thank you for buying me the meal

285
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,000
It’s nothings much

286
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,840
So…

287
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,720
How’s your friend?

288
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,840
My friend?

289
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,720
Cia.

290
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,760
Isn't Cia your best friend?

291
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,600
Yes, yes, he’s my friend.

292
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,600
He’s in the same club with me, right ?

293
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,240
Yes, yes, yes.

294
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,800
but...

295
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,960
I’m not that close with him.

296
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,760
Can you please tell me about Cia?

297
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,840
Sure.

298
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,920
He…

299
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,240
he’s a very quiet person

300
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,560
like… being an introvert or something?

301
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,600
And...

302
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,640
Mhok

303
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,320
He’s Very talkative

304
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,480
But if it's with someone he didn’t know,

305
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,200
Mhok will be a very quiet person.

306
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,280
Because Mhok’s family is

307
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,760
An diplomat or something like this

308
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,280
So he has to maintained his image.

309
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,040
But recently, Mhok hasn't been
hanging out with his friends much.

310
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,280
After school, he rushed out. Probably
headed to see his girlfriend .

311
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,720
His girlfriend?

312
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,080
don't tell anyone about this.

313
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,720
I don’t want to have any problems.

314
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,840
sure.

315
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,360
I won’t tell anyone.

316
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,920
What kind of person do you think I am?

317
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,520
Mhok

318
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,920
Cher, you came so fast.

319
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,680
Did you wait long?

320
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,880
No, not long.

321
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,680
Let's go we might be late.

322
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,440
Let's go.

323
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,760
Hey, what are you guys doing?

324
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,560
Where have you been, Type?

325
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,120
Where have you been?

326
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,480
You said you were going
to come into the club room.

327
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,080
I went to workshop room.

328
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,560
Why were you go?

329
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,240
There's nothing today.

330
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,240
I went to get the water i bought and forgot.

331
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,680
Anyway...

332
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,760
Don't forget to find time to practice often.

333
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,160
I don't want to lose a talented
younger brother like you either.

334
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,840
Do you understand?

335
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:45,960
yes

336
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,120
Oh, where are you going?

337
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,800
It’s my business

338
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,880
just kidding

339
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,520
I have my own business.

340
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,200
Bye. See you later.

341
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,920
See you, bro.

342
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,640
hello

343
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,160
yes

344
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,080
It's funny now.

345
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,600
Hey guys!

346
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,280
I have something to tell.

347
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, what do you want to say?

348
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,040
About what?

349
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,640
About...

350
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,560
Is this about Cia?

351
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,920
Let's put the matter of Cia aside for now.

352
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,680
This...

353
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,000
Much more better than the story of Cia.

354
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,120
What could be more
exciting than the story of Cia?

355
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,400
Yes, there is.

356
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,120
It's about...

357
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,920
About Mhok

358
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,600
Mhok?

359
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,040
Mhok

360
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,920
What Mhok are you talking about?

361
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,960
Wait a minute.

362
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,840
Is he Cia’s friend?

363
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,960
Yes that Mhok who’s Cia’s friend.

364
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,040
I often see him with Cia.

365
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,840
What would you say? Is
there anything interesting?

366
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
You guys might think
Mhok looks timid like that.

367
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,560
His girlfriend is very beautiful.

368
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,880
Mhok

369
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,800
Where are you rushing to?

370
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,520
What’s the problem ?

371
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,080
No, it's not.

372
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,640
We just wanted to ask you...

373
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Do you have a boyfriend?

374
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,080
What boyfriend?

375
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,800
What boyfriend? really?

376
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,400
You're really good at acting.

377
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,320
But sorry, it's not that smooth.

378
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,800
in fact...

379
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,120
We'll tell you that...

380
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,520
Your girl

381
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,960
really cute.

382
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,920
kidding

383
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,760
but...

384
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,960
Take good care of your girl.

385
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,880
Or if you don't take good care of her...

386
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,040
I...

387
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,600
Or Q

388
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Will take on that responsibility.

389
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,800
You're right, my friend.

390
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
You guys teased him.

391
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,520
You are no joke.

392
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,280
Give me five.

393
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,360
Don't bother me.

394
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,240
Take the time to do your duties.

395
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,680
Because if you guys are still being a loser,

396
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,760
Just want to mess up with
other people's business.

397
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,760
No one wants to mess with you guys.

398
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,280
Are you insulting us?

399
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,240
Cee, calm down.

400
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,000
What do you want me to
calm? He is insulting us like this.

401
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,520
Take it easy.

402
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,960
This is in the university.

403
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,080
Because you only use emotions like this.

404
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,920
Loser

405
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,160
You say i am a loser like
this. You better watch out.

406
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,160
What happened

407
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:09,880
Jod

408
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,000
Are you ok, Jod?

409
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,280
I’m ok.

410
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,400
Type

411
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,240
Where is the car? I can't find the car.

412
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,200
What the hell is this?

413
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,280
Cee, Come with me

414
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,960
Just wait till my turn.

415
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,680
Love, let's go.

416
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,600
Love

417
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,240
Love

418
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,040
No need to call her anymore.

419
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,240
You come and see me first.

420
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,040
It hurts a lot.

421
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,440
This is going to be a long.

422
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,240
Liu

423
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,240
Do you have to go to the United States?

424
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,600
I still have to go.

425
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,440
And...

426
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
I want to go live alone abroad.

427
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,560
I want to prove it to my family.

428
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,600
So...

429
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,240
So when do you have to go?

430
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Still hesitating

431
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,480
Then wait until you graduate and then go.

432
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,200
I'm still not sure.

433
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,400
If i go and i don't like it...

434
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,040
I may come back.

435
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,760
Who knows?

436
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,360
The future is uncertain

437
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,960
That's true.

438
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,360
By the way...

439
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,720
Mhok and Jod

440
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,640
Why is so long.

441
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,760
Liu

442
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,480
There it is.

443
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,120
Very unfortunate.

444
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,560
Are you okay?

445
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,160
what happened

446
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,440
Sorry, did you wait long for us?

447
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,200
What's wrong?

448
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,360
Look at your faces

449
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
I thought you were bitten by a dog.

450
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,520
Well, a dog bit me.

451
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,200
Is that funny?

452
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Dogs fighting

453
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,400
So i went in to stop it.

454
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,120
So...

455
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,960
Got hit by a dog's elbow

456
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,560
What and how

457
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,280
Tell me.

458
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,120
Liu

459
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,360
Do you know where Love went?

460
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,000
She told me that...

461
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,480
Let us go back first.

462
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:11,920
Wait.

463
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,040
She told you?

464
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,840
How long?

465
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,400
It's been a long time.

466
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,760
So

467
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,440
What's going on with you two?

468
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,760
If i tell you, will you be okay, Liu?

469
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,040
Then why did you only ask Liu?

470
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,400
Just say it.

471
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,240
It's better than hear it from other people.

472
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,160
Say it

473
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
We had a problem with
those three engineering guys.

474
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,560
About what?

475
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Is it to the point of having to fight?

476
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,320
It didn't get to the point of fighting.

477
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,320
They just barked away.

478
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,200
I was a little irritated.

479
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,000
Jod came in just in time to stop.

480
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,240
So he got hit hard by the Cee dog’s elbow.

481
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,320
What is he barking at?

482
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,840
I don't care.

483
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,920
All they can do is talk.

484
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,000
But they can't speak like their habit.

485
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,640
It's good that you don't care.

486
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,960
If you care

487
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,600
By now, you must be on the
chopping block for probation.

488
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,880
I’m sorry.

489
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,840
Sorry for made you injury.

490
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
But i have to thank you.

491
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
That you came to stop us just in time

492
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,880
Otherwise, i would have punched them by now.

493
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,600
Alright

494
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,440
Mhok

495
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,480
You are just small like that.

496
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,680
Don’t you look of them.

497
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,760
There are three people.

498
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,040
And then there's the giant Cee.

499
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,400
What is it?

500
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,160
Are they ganged up on you?

501
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,600
I’ll go talk to them.

502
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,440
What’s the problem

503
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,600
That they hit my friend.

504
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,640
calm down.

505
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,480
Well...

506
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,400
It's in the past.

507
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:39,840
and...

508
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,560
It wasn't a big deal.

509
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,480
And...

510
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,480
At that time, it was just a chaotic period.

511
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,120
So Cee's elbow hit my lips.

512
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,680
Look at your lips.

513
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,080
Well, It's good that you’re alright.

514
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,560
Luckily, Love left first.

515
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,160
Otherwise, she would have
to face something like this.

516
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,680
But i found her there.

517
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,120
Mhok

518
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,560
What did you say?

519
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,720
I found Love there.

520
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,320
From what i see

521
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,000
She maybe go see Type play basketball.

522
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,760
And then...

523
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,960
She may go back with Type.

524
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,720
He probably drive her home.

525
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,040
Just like how Type tricked on all the girl.

526
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,280
That's true.

527
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,280
But i don't care where they going.

528
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,640
So, are you okay?

529
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,920
But Love has never lied to me.

530
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,760
Cia

531
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,040
What happened, son?

532
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,640
Are you okay?

533
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,760
Go rest, my child. I'll take care of this.

534
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,000
Go, go and rest.

535
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,520
Cia...

536
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,760
Why are you so clumsy?

537
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,240
Why aren't you careful?

538
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Let's go. Mommy will go treat your wound.

539
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,720
Does it hurt, my child?

540
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,360
Go, son, go.

541
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,880
Does it hurt a lot?

542
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,800
Why are you asking me?

543
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,200
Are you mad?

544
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,640
Still asking?

545
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,440
Would you like to touched by my elbow?

546
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,680
Answer me , please.

547
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,960
I’m answering you.

548
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,480
I will not type.

549
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,640
Until you apologize

550
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,520
I’m so sorry.

551
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,640
What the hell is wrong with you, you weirdo?

552
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:12,440
Don’t be mad, okay?

553
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:19,320
I’m not mad. I just don’t
understand you guys.

554
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:33,400
You don’t have to understand. Just
understand me. That’s all matters.

555
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,320
Enough,I‘ll go to sleep. What are you talking about? I’m so confused. Luckily
you texted. If you’d called, It wouldn be hard to scold at you properly.

556
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,800
Sorry, handsome.

557
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,200
Quiet again

558
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,000
What happened with your hand?

559
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,520
I...

560
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,000
I broke a plate.

561
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,800
Does it hurt a lot?

562
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,120
Just a little bit.

563
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,080
So what's going on with you these days?

564
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,280
Why does your face look not that good?

565
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,920
I...

566
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,240
I feel that...

567
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,920
I have a lot of things to think about.

568
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,160
And thing to worry about

569
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,720
Until i...

570
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
I didn't focus on playing my music at all.

571
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,320
It's okay, Cia.

572
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,320
I understand everything about you.

573
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,080
How about this?

574
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,160
Put everything on hold for
now. Don't think about anything.

575
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,640
And about the music.

576
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,400
Can you take a break for a while?

577
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Isn't your hand hurt?

578
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,880
Don't think too much.

579
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,880
About my death just leave it later.

580
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,920
but...

581
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,120
I’m not sure if i can do it.

582
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,720
Do what?

583
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,800
I...

584
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,040
I want to try writing songs.

585
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,160
Then you...

586
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,840
You should relax yourself first.

587
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,960
Both your body

588
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,760
And your mind

589
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,840
Look at the shop.

590
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,440
very beautiful

591
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,960
It's probably as beautiful
as some people here.

592
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,400
Where are you going? Sit here.

593
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,400
The sea is beautiful too.

594
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,760
See?

595
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,080
beautiful

596
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,960
It's as beautiful as the person who said it.

597
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,800
This is too much compliment.

598
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,560
Just kidding

599
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,280
Where did the employees go?

600
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,280
Here it is!

601
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,560
okay

602
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,320
Would you like to order food now?

603
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,400
I’ll order it now.

604
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,320
okay

605
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,480
Are there something delicious?

606
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,080
Would you like something to eat?

607
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,880
I mean that...

608
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,560
Would i like something to eat

609
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,040
Well...

610
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,440
I'll have pork fried rice.

611
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,240
okay

612
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,800
And...

613
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,160
Do you have a squid tom yum?

614
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:31,840
yes

615
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,720
Take one, please.

616
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,760
And then...

617
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,120
I'll have some shrimp fried rice, too.

618
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,360
There are three things in total.

619
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,000
yes

620
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,240
okay

621
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,480
Please wait a moment.

622
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,520
I eat a lot.

623
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,360
I forgot the menu.

624
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,960
yes

625
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,280
I forgot to give it to you. I'm sorry.

626
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,840
Almost there, huh?

627
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,920
thank you

628
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,160
Is the food complete?

629
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,560
Yes, I got it all.

630
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,120
But you don't eat shrimp, right?

631
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:26,960
I eat it.

632
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,360
Alright

633
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,560
Let's eat now.

634
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,280
It's so beautiful.

635
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,360
The weather is nice.

636
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,720
It's beautiful.

637
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,680
Well...

638
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,560
It’s so good

639
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,760
to travel with you like this

640
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,280
what

641
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,640
It means good.

642
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,400
So...

643
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,320
Where would you like to go next?

644
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,600
The stars are so beautiful today.

645
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,160
TRUE

646
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,120
It's very beautiful.

647
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,000
Do you remember ...

648
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,320
astronomy?

649
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,360
In high school

650
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,600
I like it very much.

651
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,040
because...

652
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,960
It looks mysterious and...

653
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,280
It's worth exploring.

654
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,160
Then why don't you continue studying that?

655
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,400
Well...

656
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,360
sometimes

657
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,320
Things what we like

658
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,760
It might be

659
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,120
something that's not for us.

660
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,040
By the way, right now is good.

661
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,560
I got to sit and watch the stars with you.

662
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,200
Since I met you

663
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,640
You always make me smile.

664
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,560
Really?

665
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,760
Yes

666
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,880
Then...

667
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,640
We...

668
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,360
Let's come together again.

669
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,680
You say that.

670
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,600
The melody you just hummed

671
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,200
I think it's nice

672
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,280
Could you please do it for me again?

673
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,320
Really?

674
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:01,960
Yes.

675
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,440
Alright

676
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,280
Something like this

677
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,400
Would you like to try composing a song?

678
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,600
I think it's possible.

679
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,160
Would it be that good?

680
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,240
It would be great.

681
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
Why would i lie to you?

682
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,240
What did i just hum?

683
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
Are you going to forget again.

684
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,000
yes

685
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,440
That’s right

686
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,280
Try putting it in words

687
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,240
let's try it.

688
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,920
You guys

689
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,720
last night...

690
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,280
I went to the sea.

691
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,720
And then...

692
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,880
I Composed the song too

693
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,920
Could you guys take a look at this for me?

694
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,920
You went to the sea?

695
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,640
With who?

696
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,600
You didn't invite us at all.

697
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,320
I...

698
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,240
I...

699
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,480
Went in a hurry

700
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,560
So...

701
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,440
I didn't plan anything at all.

702
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,320
So next time

703
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Let's go with you guys.

704
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,360
And...

705
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,800
About the song, if i finish composing it.

706
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,960
I'll send it to you in the group LINE.

707
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,160
You still haven't answered Jod's question.

708
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,360
So who did you go with?

709
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,360
Let me take a look.

710
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,080
Hey, it's gonna get crushed.

711
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,960
No, I’ll see by myself.

712
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,840
Give it to me.

713
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,120
If you want it, come in.

714
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,840
Jod give it here.

715
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,640
Where is it?

716
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,120
What did yesterday mean, love?

717
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,200
That's right.

718
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,440
Why...

719
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,160
Why did you go with Type

720
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,080
and...

721
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,960
Where did you guys go?

722
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,560
Take it easy, Let’s talk calmly.

723
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,080
The lyrics are really good.

724
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,320
Very good meaning.

725
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,840
Enough.

726
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,800
This is your song, Cia.

727
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,560
Calm down, Liu.

728
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,720
What does everyone want?

729
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,240
Want to know where did i go with Type?

730
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,760
How did i go?

731
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,840
Is that all?

732
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,120
And if i say that there's nothing

733
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,240
Would you believe it?

734
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,240
Everyone, calm down.

735
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,120
Well...

736
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,640
Let's talk slowly now.

737
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Let's calm down first.

738
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
I think...

739
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,640
Everyone has their own reasons.

740
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,440
Nice

741
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,960
So, let's listen my story first.

742
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,080
I was spoken badly by them.

743
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,520
Talk badly about my girlfriend

744
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,200
I was so angry that i
almost got into a fight.

745
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,520
Jod came to stop and got hit by Cee’s elbow.

746
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,080
That's when Love came in.

747
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,480
But what we saw was...

748
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,640
Love chooses to go back with Type.

749
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,240
And didn’t care about us at all.

750
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,560
I warned you.

751
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,520
But i’m not hurt too badly.

752
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,720
Canker sores are even
more painful than this.

753
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,120
Jod, you...

754
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,360
Then let's say that

755
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,720
Type and I are nothing to each other.

756
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,240
We are just good friends.

757
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,920
Talking with Type makes me feel comfortable.

758
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,720
That's all.

759
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,360
And what about us?

760
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,640
Are you uncomfortable being with me?

761
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,920
Well...

762
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,760
I’ve said it all.

763
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,800
But if everyone doesn't believe it,

764
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,680
It's up to you to think.

765
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,400
Love, wait a minute.

766
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,600
It's too late.

767
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,480
Liu

768
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,440
Liu

769
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,520
Hello Mr. Jod

770
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,080
Wait.

771
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,440
What are you doing here?

772
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,040
Do you ever read Instagram?

773
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,480
Instagram

774
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,440
what

775
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
The message I typed last night

776
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,000
message

777
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,040
You are weird.

778
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,800
How’s weird?

779
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,440
Another one at Daytime

780
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,800
Another one at night

781
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
Another online body

782
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,360
Are you a person?

783
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,000
Never mind.

784
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,680
You have something, we're in a hurry.

785
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,000
Where are you going
in such a hurry, Mr. Jod?

786
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,000
Seriously,

787
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,200
Now our group of friends is having problems.

788
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:33,960
Because of you guys.

789
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,960
Especially type

790
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,240
Sometimes we...

791
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,440
I don't know what to do either.

792
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,280
We understand

793
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,520
sometimes...

794
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,000
You don't have to try too hard.

795
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,280
Be your own person

796
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,280
Your feelings, sir

797
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,480
We're going now.

798
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,840
Should we deliver it?

799
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:51,640
nevermind

800
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,640
I want to be alone.

801
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,480
Type

802
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,640
I heard you've written a new song?

803
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,000
Yes, sir.

804
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,080
Really?

805
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,600
You never tell your friends.

806
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,600
Or...

807
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,480
Type doesn't see you as a friend.

808
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,600
Not like that.

809
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,200
I just finished dressing up.

810
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,960
I really put my heart into it.

811
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,960
So...

812
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,560
No time to tell anyone

813
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,400
So fresh, Type?

814
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,680
It's definitely mine.

815
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,120
I want to listen. You can turn it on now.

816
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,800
Open it, we want to listen too.

817
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,240
TRUE

818
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,600
Would that be okay?

819
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,120
That's good.

820
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,840
Open soon, we want to hear it.

821
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,560
Okay, okay.

822
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,800
I’ll show you guys here for the first time.

823
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
Very exclusive
