1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,680
Cia

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,840
I am sorry.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,000
I didn't mean it.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,240
Do you still dare to say that
you didn't do it on purpose?

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,320
Love

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:24,800
Ohh.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,560
How are you? Are you tired from studying?

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,760
Not too tired

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,160
Are you hungry?

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,520
Not hungry

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,120
So, are you hungry?

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm not hungry yet either.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,120
Today, Cia brought the lyrics for me to see.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,480
The lyrics are something like this

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,760
Cia is lonely and alone.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,680
But she's like secretly in love.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,280
I suspect that Cia must
have a boyfriend these days.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,200
Cia may have a boyfriend.

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,320
Everyone, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,280
Next time, if I go anywhere with Type again

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,920
I will tell you

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,240
Is that okay?

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,360
Love

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,800
Love has never acted like this before.

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,400
Trust our warnings.

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,000
Everyone is really worried about Love.

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,240
I told you what can I do?

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,160
If something happens

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
Do you think your friend will
be able to help you in time?

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,520
Stop messing with Type.

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
If you still want to be friends

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,880
I really feel positive
about Type Like a Friend.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,120
Why doesn't anyone care about me?

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,240
Just come here...

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Expect me

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,640
Work matters, homework matters

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
We are stressed.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,120
All about studying

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,240
All about home

40
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,560
Has anyone ever been interested in us?

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't tell me you're giving
hope to someone like me.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,120
You know, doing that is
like being an experiment.

43
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,000
I guess I'll have to give in.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,560
It is a love that must wait without knowing.

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,000
Which one do you love?

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,840
Brother Tham, is something wrong?

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,120
I see that you don't seem
to be in a good mood.

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,920
Is Cia worried about you?

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,520
Type

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,200
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,440
I'm in a hurry, bro.

52
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,320
Let's talk about it another time.

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Where are you rushing to?

54
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,320
Then what are you looking for?

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm looking for a charger, sir.

56
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,360
I forgot it.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,720
Is this it?

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,720
This is it, brother.

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
How much of a hurry are you in?

60
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,560
Even if we can't talk

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,240
If so, if you have something
to say, hurry up and say it.

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,560
Don't prolong it, it's a waste of time.

63
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,160
About the lyrics

64
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,600
That Type has arrived.

65
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
I think there's definitely
something going on.

66
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,480
What happened?

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,200
It's Brother Tham.

68
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,240
What's the big deal with Cia?

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,360
Why?

70
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,320
It's about the song.

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,040
Do you remember?

72
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,200
The first day you joined the club

73
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,480
You've been through this too.

74
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,600
Can you use your talent to your advantage?

75
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,840
You must apologize to Cia.

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,760
hair...

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Do you need to apologize to it?

78
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
When you took the song Cia

79
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,280
Then claim it as your own.

80
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
You can still do it.

81
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,840
Just apologizing shouldn't be that difficult.

82
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,520
Are you sure?

83
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,800
I'm going to walk away
without feeling guilty.

84
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
Or apologize for what you did

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,400
Excuse me.

86
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,600
Okay, bro.

87
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,320
We were just joking around.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
But we think...

89
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,560
What did you say?

90
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,480
I think you're really wrong about this, Type.

91
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,080
I think it's too strong.

92
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:43,960
Is it strong?

93
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,480
That's right.

94
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,600
What is that force?

95
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,320
You two should think about it carefully.

96
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,640
We also make music.

97
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,880
Music practice

98
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,480
I have played many events.

99
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,040
This matter is also very important.

100
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,960
Copyright, that is.

101
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,920
You guys understand, right?

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,440
Come on.

103
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,560
I think things have gone too far now.

104
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,360
From just joking around

105
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,960
It will escalate into a battle
of pride between faculties.

106
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,720
Yes!

107
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,680
This is the same story.

108
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,680
We say...

109
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,560
Should we stop for now?

110
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
What's wrong with you, Mr. Cee?

111
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,040
Never mind.

112
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,800
We just want to spend time

113
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,360
With more serious music practice

114
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,720
That I don't have to follow
you around all the time.

115
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,200
Another thing

116
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,680
Our goals are also different.

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,040
We're going back.

118
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:27,880
oh...

119
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,920
Cee

120
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,640
Where are you going?

121
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,360
Let it go

122
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,160
It will be back to normal tomorrow.

123
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,200
So who's really annoyed?

124
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,400
Every day there are only problems.

125
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,400
already...

126
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,040
Won't Brother Tham
have a falling out with him?

127
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,720
To be frank

128
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,320
Arguing with them.

129
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,480
It's normal for me.

130
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,920
Cia, don't think too much.

131
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,680
Brother Tham also...

132
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,720
There is also this angle.

133
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,880
You told Tham to go back first.

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,680
Trust us

135
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,480
oh

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,160
Nothing.

137
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,600
I think that

138
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,640
I think I should go back now.

139
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,400
Done

140
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,880
In that case, let's go.

141
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,920
yes

142
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,440
Let's go.

143
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,520
Are you still not feeling well?

144
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,040
is...

145
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,080
To be honest, I still feel sad.

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,440
because...

147
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,960
That song was the first song I wrote myself.

148
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,440
So I feel...

149
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,000
Another thing

150
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,240
The friends in the group also seemed
dissatisfied with what Love did.

151
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,520
Enough, enough.

152
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,280
I think so

153
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,920
I understand now.

154
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,680
Then how about this?

155
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,600
Can Cia come home late?

156
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,760
okay

157
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,560
but...

158
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,480
I have to call my mom first.

159
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,800
If that's the case, then I think...

160
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,800
The two of us...

161
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,760
Let's go do something fun.

162
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,520
I mean...

163
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,480
I know a restaurant.

164
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,000
We can go up and play music.

165
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,480
I go there often.

166
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,520
Are you interested, Cia?

167
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,840
I'm not so sure anymore.

168
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,400
If Cia doesn't try it the first time

169
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,120
There won't be a second or third time.

170
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,480
What are you doing?

171
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,800
Take a shower.

172
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,760
Who do you take showers with?

173
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,840
Take a shower alone

174
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,040
Do you want me to help you take a shower?

175
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:54,240
You say hi to me so often.

176
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,920
I want to talk to you in the morning,
afternoon, evening, before going to bed. Can I?

177
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,120
You look very free.

178
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,800
I mean, I want to say that today
I cleared things up with Type Q.

179
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,600
Explain to them so that they both understand.

180
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,760
I tried my hardest

181
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,560
Chatting heavily on the right again

182
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,120
Blue, what did you find?

183
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,280
I found it!

184
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,360
What did you find?

185
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,520
Blue

186
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,280
What did you find?

187
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,480
Our address information

188
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,440
And then...

189
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,040
There are the names of our younger
sister, family, and close friends.

190
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
Contact number and photo

191
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,720
Where is

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,720
Stay here

193
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,080
Is this it?

194
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,680
Right?

195
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,960
Yes, yes, yes, this one.

196
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,640
Cia

197
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,680
Are you sure no one will see?

198
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,760
Let's hurry up and go.
Someone might find out.

199
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,400
Your parents are all still here.

200
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Plus I have a younger sister.

201
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,960
Then why is there no contact number?

202
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,840
Hoy!

203
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,080
What's wrong with you?

204
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,880
No, no.

205
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,720
We were just thinking about what you said.

206
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,280
From the information obtained here...

207
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,000
It's very basic.

208
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,920
Why?

209
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,080
That's right, why?

210
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,640
Let me try again.

211
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,200
Hoy!

212
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
Try something else, man.

213
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,920
No, never mind.

214
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
At least this information

215
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,240
It also makes us know many things.

216
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,720
You just have to find it.

217
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,080
Mr. Jod,

218
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
Are you done taking a shower?

219
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,280
Did you see us naked?

220
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,600
Hey, calm down.

221
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,480
We're just telling you that...

222
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,400
We've been waiting
for you to say hi all night.

223
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,040
What are you saying?

224
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,040
Are you saying hi?

225
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,440
oh

226
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,440
You like to talk to us.

227
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,720
And then let the chat be heavily
focused on the right side only.

228
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,480
Wait a minute!

229
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,760
Us?

230
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,720
I like talking to you.

231
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, we can do that.

232
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,040
already...

233
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
Then what are you doing near our faculty?

234
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,360
We didn't come to wait to meet you.

235
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
We haven't even talked yet.

236
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,800
Hoy!

237
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,320
Why are you trying to nag us so much?

238
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,240
We're just telling you that...

239
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Let's talk to Type Q.

240
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,560
As you wanted us to warn him.

241
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,080
Yes!

242
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,080
What are you smiling about?

243
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,680
nothing

244
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,960
Is that all you've been waiting for?

245
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,240
Yes!

246
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,880
That's all

247
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,680
Jod

248
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,720
We're really waiting for you.

249
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
We'd like to tell you to relax that...

250
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,480
We did as you told us to.

251
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,760
Are you satisfied?

252
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,640
Yes!

253
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,280
thank you

254
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,720
We say...

255
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,520
After this, we have to look at the situation.

256
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,440
Are you free?

257
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,080
How so?

258
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,960
we...

259
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,080
Asked if you...

260
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,480
Are you free?

261
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,400
You're changing the subject so quickly.

262
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,720
Do you think we should be free now?

263
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,600
We will go to study.

264
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
Hey, let's go together.

265
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,640
Wait a minute.

266
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,400
We study art.

267
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Mr. Engineer

268
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
thank you

269
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,920
Actually, Cia's house is also

270
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,320
It's not far from my dorm.

271
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,880
Thank you for sending me off.

272
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,040
hair

273
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm not bothering you, am I?

274
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,760
Hoy!

275
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,720
What are you bothering me about?

276
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,680
Very comfortable

277
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,520
And here...

278
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,520
Who does Cia live with?

279
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,880
oh

280
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,480
I'm with my mother.

281
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,560
In that case...

282
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,000
Next time

283
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,760
You can come and say
hello to our mother later.

284
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,480
Are you calling your mom too?

285
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,080
Cia, if that's the case...

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,360
Cia

287
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,320
Yes, what do you think, Brother Tham?

288
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,680
Are you okay?

289
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,680
Make a face like you've seen a ghost

290
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,600
oh

291
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,920
No, nothing.

292
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,840
In that case...

293
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,680
I'd like to go into the house first.

294
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,000
today

295
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,080
You're very good.

296
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,720
A lot too

297
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,600
In that case...

298
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,200
If that's the case, I won't
bother you anymore.

299
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,520
There are a lot of dogs in my neighborhood.

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,720
Good night, Cia.

301
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,160
hold

302
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,200
See you in the club room.

303
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,960
Yes, brother.

304
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,440
Good night. Bye-bye.

305
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,520
Bye bye.

306
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,360
Come back safely.

307
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,280
yes

308
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,560
Can we stop for now?

309
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,560
Howling so hard my throat is going to break.

310
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,000
This guy is really weird.

311
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,600
Why are you teasing P'Tham?

312
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,000
It would be nice if you didn't stick your tongue
out and roll your eyes while you were in the car.

313
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,520
like this

314
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,680
Enough!

315
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,720
You can enter the house now.

316
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,640
Hello, how are you, friend?

317
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,360
Tham, who is the young man who
came to sing for our shop today?

318
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,800
Newbies at the club

319
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,640
What's up?

320
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,880
You play well.

321
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,320
Customers like it

322
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,560
I saw that the shop's Instagram
story was full of hashtags.

323
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,440
Really?

324
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,680
That's right.

325
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,520
The music is very catchy.

326
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,720
I'll let you bring me here again.

327
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,480
okay

328
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,520
I'll take you there again.

329
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,360
Okay, that's all for now. We're driving.

330
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,520
Okay, see you.

331
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,400
Thank you.

332
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,200
Just now

333
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,760
You shouldn't have teased P'Tham like that.

334
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,680
What are you pretending to do?

335
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
This is still too little.

336
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,600
Brother Tham...

337
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,200
He will be afraid of ghosts.

338
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,280
Did you hear what we said, Blue?

339
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,560
Blue

340
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,360
I've heard it already.

341
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,160
Why don't you answer?

342
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,320
What's wrong with him?

343
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,320
Just a moment ago, everything was fine.

344
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,480
If that's the case, then we're disappointed.

345
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
We don't want to be ghosts, Cia.

346
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,480
It's beautiful.

347
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,560
What are you looking at?
Aren't you watching a movie?

348
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,520
Here, look at this.

349
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,400
Let's get dirty.

350
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,520
watch

351
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,720
Is the movie fun?

352
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,760
The scene where the ghost
appeared made Type very shocked.

353
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,480
Type

354
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,120
What do you say, love?

355
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,600
Love has something she wants to talk about.

356
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,480
What is the matter?

357
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,240
Love didn't know that before this

358
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,400
What's the problem between Type and Cia?

359
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,560
But now that Love is getting closer to Type,

360
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,560
Love also had a fight with a friend.

361
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,480
Because of what Type did

362
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,760
That is...

363
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,360
Love wants Type to think about it.

364
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,160
Is what Type did really wrong?

365
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,720
Type is sorry for making Love
have a fight with her friend.

366
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,800
People make mistakes.

367
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,320
But don't let it happen again.

368
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,640
What Type did was really wrong.

369
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,840
Stealing lyrics from someone

370
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,560
Intend to do what you love.

371
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,920
Just thinking about stealing is wrong.

372
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
After this

373
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,080
Type will think more about what to do.

374
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Love doesn't want to expect anything.

375
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:56,960
but...

376
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,200
Love just wants her friends to see that

377
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,240
What Love explained to her friends

378
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
Type can really do it.

379
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,320
thank you

380
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,840
Thank you for loving Type.

381
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
nevermind

382
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,560
Liu

383
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,440
Why did Love come?

384
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
What else are you going to trick us with?

385
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,680
Liu, listen to Love first.

386
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,760
Love has said everything.

387
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,920
The best thing Love can do is apologize.

388
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,320
But Love can't go back and fix anything.

389
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,760
Then why would Love tell us?

390
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,720
Because Liu is the friend I love the most.

391
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,000
We are the only two women in the group.

392
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:02,920
Love

393
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,040
Liu understands love.

394
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,680
Love has its reasons

395
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,640
And Liu has his reasons.

396
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,680
Liu

397
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,360
Let's put it this way.

398
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,640
Love doesn't want to be friends

399
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,120
Ours is gone

400
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,040
Love will prove it to everyone.

401
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,640
That Type is not what Liu or everyone thinks

402
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,200
Love

403
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,120
If Love were to say something like this

404
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,040
Liu doesn't want to talk.

405
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,680
Liu

406
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,200
Liu, don't walk away from Love again.

407
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,200
Didn't Liu say it herself?

408
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,680
Use reason more than emotion.

409
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,280
But now, what Liu is doing is
more emotional than rational.

410
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,720
can

411
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,000
If Love says that Liu is using emotion

412
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,280
Liu admitted that Liu used emotion.

413
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,320
But everything Liu did

414
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,200
Liu also has his reasons.

415
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,000
Love, love.

416
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,600
Liu's love for Love

417
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,440
All the goodwill that Liu has for Love

418
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,080
Does Love understand Liu?

419
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,720
Love apologizes

420
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,560
What will happen next?

421
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,360
Love will be the one to leave this group.

422
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,760
Love, can you please apologize, Liu?

423
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,720
Love, can you please apologize?

424
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,000
Oh yeah, you guys too.

425
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,680
Let's practice together. We haven't
played together in a long time.

426
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,760
What about your Type, brother?

427
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,880
Never mind. I'll play instead of Type.

428
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
Brother Tham played it himself?

429
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
It's been a while since I've seen
P'Tham practice with his juniors.

430
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,680
Well...

431
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,000
Have fun playing

432
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,160
It's been a while since I had
time to play with my little ones.

433
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,880
Right? Q Cee

434
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,480
I don't play with you.

435
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,280
I have this position
reserved for only one person.

436
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,520
That's right, bro.

437
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,360
You guys really love each other.

438
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,480
Let's practice some.

439
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,880
Just go play basketball.

440
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,040
Why don't you go join the sports
club? I'll kick you out myself.

441
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,680
Hey bro, calm down.

442
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,600
Don't fire me yet.

443
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,560
I still want to play music.

444
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,280
For your health, brother.

445
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,040
Health comes first, brother.

446
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,680
yes

447
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,480
Then let's practice.

448
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,720
yes

449
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,280
Let's practice, bro.

450
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,160
Okay, okay.

451
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,760
You are the love song I wrote

452
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,480
It is the melody sound.

453
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,480
What I sing is because of you.

454
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,640
Mr. Pakin Chotimethanon

455
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,480
I like playing the guitar.

456
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,520
I have one younger sister.

457
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,120
Weha Chotimethanon

458
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,320
Nickname: Chertam

459
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,120
Hey, what's wrong with you?

460
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,240
have a headache

461
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,280
Is that okay?

462
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,000
Are you okay?

463
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,200
Mr.

464
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,120
How are you

465
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Are you feeling better yet?

466
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,120
It's like we remember our own younger sister.

467
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,320
But it's not like I can remember everything.

468
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,760
My sister's name is...

469
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,400
Chertam

470
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,200
yes

471
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,960
There was one day

472
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,040
Chertam told us to take
her to her tutoring school.

473
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,720
Around there.

474
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,240
Architecture student

475
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,840
We went to a lot of tutoring sessions.

476
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,280
already...

477
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,320
Tutoring

478
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,000
where

479
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,520
That's what I'm about to say.

480
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,920
We can't remember where.

481
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,200
oh

482
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,000
nevermind

483
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,840
You can think about it slowly.

484
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,040
If you think of it, let me know.

485
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,240
thank you

486
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,080
I don't think so

487
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,240
Are you really willing to do this?

488
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,720
Thank you for what?

489
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:37,840
Well...

490
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,720
We have an exchange here.

491
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,400
Then you have to do as you said.

492
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,880
I didn't think you'd be this honest.

493
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,800
What's your problem?

494
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,920
nothing

495
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,880
So cute.

496
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,880
I wonder if I can find it.

497
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:05,880
oh

498
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,240
Mhok

499
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,160
What time do you finish school today?

500
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,960
I get off work around five o'clock.

501
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,440
Mhok

502
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Oh, Cia.

503
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,680
What are you doing here?

504
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,760
Is this around here?

505
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,160
The location you sent me last night

506
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,000
Yes, is there anything?

507
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,320
This is my boyfriend.

508
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,560
name

509
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
I'm going now. I'm running late.

510
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,680
See you at university.

511
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,280
hello

512
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,200
I'm leaving now.

513
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,000
What's that?

514
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,440
I haven't even learned her name yet.

515
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,600
Your friend must be in a real hurry.

516
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,200
It's okay. We can do it next time.

517
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,120
Okay, let's go get something to eat.

518
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,680
yes

519
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,840
Cia

520
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,560
How are you

521
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,720
Tired?

522
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,840
Have you gotten any information?

523
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,880
this

524
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,960
Don't make that face.

525
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,520
You said not to give up.

526
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,040
Are you still able to smile?

527
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,760
This is your business.

528
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,040
But we are stressed.

529
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,600
Don't even bother smiling.

530
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,480
Don't you like my smile?

531
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,840
I don't like my own smile either.

532
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,200
Why?

533
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,080
Because we like your smile more.

534
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,160
Don't even bother playing.

535
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,680
Still have a lot of free time?

536
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,960
Next time, okay?

537
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,400
We'll definitely need more information.

538
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,880
Hey man

539
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,920
Don't tell me that

540
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,520
Mr.

541
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,120
What's wrong again?

542
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Do you have a headache again?

543
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,280
Mr.

544
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,120
Blue

545
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,480
Blue

546
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,480
Eat a lot.

547
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,000
thank you

548
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,880
Is it delicious?

549
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,120
It's very delicious.

550
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,720
Why did Cia call?

551
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,120
Hello sir

552
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,200
Yes, sir.

553
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,440
We have something we want to ask you.

554
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,440
At that time, we were in a bit of a hurry.

555
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,400
What are you doing here?

556
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,840
We happen to have business nearby. Why not?

557
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,840
is...

558
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
We have something to ask you.

559
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,840
We really don't know what to do.

560
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,640
We are looking for someone.

561
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,720
I am an architecture tutor student.

562
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,160
Why are you looking for me, Cia?

563
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,400
Come on, it's necessary.

564
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,880
Please, please.

565
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,160
Do you have any information? Maybe we know.

566
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,720
I see that...

567
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,480
I don't know if you've graduated or not.

568
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,160
But we think that...

569
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,920
You should have graduated by now.

570
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,920
name...

571
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,320
Name: Weha Chotimethanon

572
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,440
Do you know him?

573
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,840
Hello, are you still there?

574
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,920
Liu, do you think your score will pass?

575
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,760
It won't survive.

576
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,800
You guys

577
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,320
Do you want to go to the next booth?

578
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,840
Sorry, Cia. Love has something to do today.

579
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,040
I also have a dinner date with my boyfriend.

580
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,520
Excuse me.

581
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,120
Jod also took a video clip.

582
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,080
Even though I'm pickling it, please take some
pictures. Otherwise, I won't have any work to do.

583
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,120
Would you like us to come with you?

584
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,960
Hey, no need, this clip has sponsors.

585
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,800
We can do it alone.

586
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,160
You go back first, friend.

587
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,840
okay

588
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,880
already...

589
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,840
Where's Liu?

590
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,880
Let's go with Love.

591
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,320
What the hell?

592
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,200
Is there no one free?

593
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,960
I'm bored.

594
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,280
You should go practice
music first and then come back.

595
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,600
Normally, you guys hardly ever let us go.

596
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,520
Why are you telling us to go today?

597
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,880
Hey, crazy. It's normal.

598
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,600
Then let me find something to do.

599
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,360
Are you really busy?

600
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,800
Everyone?

601
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,440
Yes, I'm sorry sir.

602
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,040
Okay, then let's go practice music.

603
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,040
meet tomorrow

604
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,560
meet

605
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,120
bye bye

606
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,800
Are you here?

607
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,400
If you are there

608
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,280
We request this song for you.

609
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,760
I'm back, Mom.

610
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,560
Why is the house so dark?

611
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,520
mother

612
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,440
Mom,

613
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,840
Where are you going?

614
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,640
They don't say anything at all.

615
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,840
surprise

616
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,880
Happy Birthday to you

617
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,440
Happy Birthday to you

618
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,840
Happy birthday Happy birthday

619
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,400
Happy Birthday to Yousia

620
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,720
I thought that

621
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,600
Everyone will forget about it now.

622
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,080
How can I forget?

623
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,960
We were just kidding around with Cia.

624
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,120
You will get a surprise.

625
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,080
Look, my eyes are watering. Just kidding.

626
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,560
Don't cry.

627
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,400
crazy

628
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,240
No need at all.

629
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,280
You can blow out the candles now.
The candles will all go out soon.

630
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Cialuk, don't forget to pray.

631
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,200
amen

632
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,680
yay

633
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,600
So creepy

634
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,120
What are you praying
for? It's taking so long.

635
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
What do you want?

636
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,560
Well, let me say that...

637
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,080
Cia

638
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,560
Don't say anything, son. Otherwise,
your wish won't come true.

639
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,360
already...

640
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,520
Where did the guitar come from, son?

641
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,320
guitar...

642
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,320
It's mine.

643
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,920
That day I went to take pictures for a
project and forgot it in the classroom.

644
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,880
So I asked Cia to carry it back for me.

645
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,120
Oh really?

646
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,080
yes

647
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,760
I think we should go eat some cake.

648
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,160
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

649
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,280
Come on, I'll go get it cut for you.

650
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,360
Thank you, Mom.

651
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,240
Let's go wait for a table.

652
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,080
Yes, thank you.

653
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,400
Sending signals without telling us anything

654
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,680
And here...

655
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,120
summarize

656
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,120
Are you guys playing a trick on us?

657
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,960
And is it smooth? At Jod's level.

658
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,880
But...

659
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,440
Thank you very much for
helping me with the guitar.

660
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,560
So when are you going
to tell his mother the truth?

661
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,480
we...

662
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,960
I want it to be time first.

663
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,120
Today is my birthday.

664
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,600
Let's not talk about stressful things.

665
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,680
Really, I love love Cia.

666
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,960
Cia also loves Love.

667
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,040
What about us? Don't you love us?

668
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,840
Mhok, let's love each other.

669
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,240
What is this?

670
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,120
You have three people.

671
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,320
We have two people who
love each other equally.

672
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,280
We love each other so much.

673
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,840
Hugging each other like little monkeys.

674
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,840
Where can a baby monkey be this cute?

675
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,040
But it's true, mom confirms it for her child.

676
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,160
Let's eat some cake.

677
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,280
Sure, I'll send it to my friend.

678
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,440
Got it

679
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,960
Hey guys!

680
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,240
what

681
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,600
Are you two not going to sleep at all?

682
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,640
Let's tell ghost stories.

683
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,480
Anyone who wants to listen
can listen. I'm going to bed.

684
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,000
The other day

685
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,120
Why don't you guys want to listen?

686
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,160
Hey, if you're going to tell the
story, hurry up and tell it in style.

687
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,480
In that case, let's
just listen to it briefly.

688
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,000
The other day

689
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,360
We walked out of the university alone, right?

690
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,000
You guys know it.

691
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,880
That the atmosphere of the university
when ghosts are drying diapers

692
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,000
How scary is it?

693
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,920
So creepy

694
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
What's wrong with your house's electricity?

695
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,720
Your house's electricity is not working.

696
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,720
Or have we really met?

697
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,240
Love

698
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,440
I don't know.

699
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,960
We say...

700
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,680
Our home electricity
will probably break down.

701
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,560
It's not what you guys think.

702
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,480
Are you sure?

703
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,160
Yes, it's actually been
like this for a long time.

704
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:58,840
We say...

705
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,200
The atmosphere is just right.

706
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,360
Better not tell.

707
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,440
but

708
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,080
We have one more thing.

709
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,800
Oh, that's enough.

710
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,280
We haven't told you yet.

711
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,320
What sound?

712
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,680
What's wrong with you?
You're really startled.

713
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,360
Can't you guys really see this?

714
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
What do you see about you?

715
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,880
Gently

716
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,040
Hoy!

717
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,360
You guys be quiet.

718
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,480
What are you all commotion about, son?

719
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,440
The noise reached my mother's room.

720
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,120
Go to sleep, children. It's late.

721
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,920
Sorry, Mom. I'm going to bed now.

722
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,480
I'm sorry, Mom. Good night, Mom.

723
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,840
Go to sleep.

724
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,480
Jod, it's because of you.
I shouldn't have started.

725
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,800
You two don't have to fight each other.

726
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,080
Go to sleep. It's late.

727
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,840
Go to sleep. You can go to sleep now.

728
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
No more.

729
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,520
We don't want to do this anymore.

730
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,080
sleep

731
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:29,480
Happy birthday to you cia, I
wish you a lot of happiness.

732
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,360
Thank you very much.

733
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,600
Thank you

734
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,160
What the hell are you doing?

735
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,560
Oh, why do you want to sleep?

736
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,280
Well, I went to bed late last night.

737
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,880
The work is not yet finished.

738
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,400
We are tired.

739
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,000
this

740
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,120
Don't come up with excuses.

741
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,840
Well, you fell asleep
yourself, I can't help you.

742
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,280
Still making me want to tease you.

743
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,360
Let me see your face.

744
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,080
Our broker is completely messed up.

745
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,240
Why?

746
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,480
Well...

747
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,680
It's so cute.

748
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,720
I won't talk to you anymore.

749
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,720
It's a good idea, I brought face wash gel.

750
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,320
Gone

751
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,240
Where are you going?
