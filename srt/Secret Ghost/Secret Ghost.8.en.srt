1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,120
Well, look who decided to
show up here. Unexpected.

2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,760
Pretty flowers.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,200
Who's trying to impress you?

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,400
Let me make things right.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,920
Can we start over?

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,640
Do you have any business with me?

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,880
If Type gave you that bouquet,

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,440
just so you know

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,160
you’re not the only one who got one.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,400
What do you mean?

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,720
Wow, déjà vu.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,960
Didn’t I already spell that out for you?

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,480
Wow, can’t argue with that.
You two are a great match.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,840
Getting engaged with no love?

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,760
If Type truly loved you,

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,280
he would’ve never put you in
this situation from the beginning.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,720
Well, if you don’t need anything else,

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,480
I suppose I’ll take my leave now.

19
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,840
Are you okay?!

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,360
What happened with Blue last night?

21
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,120
Is this all about Blue, then?

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,760
So,

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Blue’s your best friend, huh?

24
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,960
yes

25
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,240
Yeah... Ever since I joined the club,

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,440
it’s just been me and Blue

27
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,280
practicing music together all the time.

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,920
So...

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,320
Blue...

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,480
he’s dead?

31
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,160
How do you know that, Cia?

32
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,960
And...

33
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,440
what happened

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,880
to him exactly?

35
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,320
Didn’t you already know that?

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,760
No.

37
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,160
Uh...

38
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,240
it was an accident.

39
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,720
Just... an accident.

40
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,000
Then...

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,120
why is...

42
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,120
his guitar here

43
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
instead of at his house?

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,360
Well...

45
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,600
normally...

46
00:03:59,640 --> 00:03:59,880
Blue

47
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,160
Blue

48
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,680
Blue didn’t really like taking
his guitar home, that’s all.

49
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,560
And...

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,160
on the day of the accident...

51
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,440
where were you?

52
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,920
Cia... that last song you played last night

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,160
Do you know the person who sang it?

54
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,120
Why isn’t this anything
like what I thought I knew?

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,800
Could it be...

56
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,880
Time was really the one
who caused the accident?

57
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,600
Urghh... I can’t... I’m gonna hurl...

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,640
Yo, hold it in!

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,600
Just gulp it down, bro.

60
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,680
Cee, you reek!

61
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,200
God, how are you this heavy?!

62
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,440
Hang on, I’m taking you
to the bathroom right now!

63
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Heeey... where ya goin’ sooo fast...?

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,840
said I’m done... I’m seriously gonna puke!

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,320
I can’t even walk right now...

66
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,840
Yo, why you so loud?!

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,080
Type’s sitting with
that junior at that table.

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,960
Type?

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,840
Yes!

70
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,840
where??

71
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,840
Heeeey, Type!

72
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
Type, dude! Let’s toast, man!

73
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,640
Cee!!

74
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,680
Hey Cee

75
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,280
Cee

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,360
Dude

77
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,680
Hey, Cee are you okay?

78
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,400
I’ll help you get to the bathroom!

79
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,080
3… 2… 1

80
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,640
Get up

81
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
get up!

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,840
I’ll take him myself!

83
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,960
I’ll take him, he’s my friend!

84
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,920
He’s my friend too,

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,480
What’s your problem?!

86
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:31,960
Hoy!

87
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,440
What the hell’s your problem, huh?!

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,120
Stop arguing, both of you.

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,280
I can’t take it anymore.

90
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,680
Just take me to the bathroom. Both of you!

91
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,320
Yeah yeah, go go go!

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,120
go go!

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,080
Move that chair! Get it outta the way!

94
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,280
Hey! not now! Hold it, bro!

95
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,040
We’re here.

96
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
Let it all out.

97
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,480
Look, since we’re all here…

98
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,280
Lemme say something, alright?

99
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,960
What now?

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,400
You two…

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,440
When are you gonna talk
things out like grown-ups?

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,160
Being stuck between you guys

103
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,120
sucks ass, okay?!

104
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
You two guys

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Can you just not fight for once? Please?

106
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,400
I’m asking nicely bleghhh! Uurghhh!

107
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Cee!!

108
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,640
What should we do?

109
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,320
You take over.

110
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,600
I gotta wash my arm, it reeks.

111
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
Help me get him into the car.

112
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,160
Okay

113
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,720
Ugh, you done yet?

114
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,240
come

115
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,840
Goddamn it, you’re a mess.

116
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,320
Hey, walk straight, man.

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,800
God, how are you this heavy?!

118
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Man, that wore me out.

119
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,600
Ugh, my shoulder’s dead now.

120
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,800
Cee, why do you get drunk so damn easy?

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,120
How long are you gonna keep acting like this?

122
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,080
When the hell are you gonna realize

123
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,640
That you had a part in this too.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
What the hell are you talking about?
I don’t even know what this is about.

125
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,240
It’s about Love, man.

126
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,640
You knew I liked her.

127
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
And you still went for her.

128
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
I thought you were joking!

129
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,400
By the time you even said you liked her,

130
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,160
I was already talking to her!

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,280
That’s not okay, Type!
That’s seriously messed u

132
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,320
You already had your own girl.

133
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,120
The whole campus knew it.

134
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,160
And isn’t it because of you

135
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,000
that Love got harassed by Mira?

136
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,920
I’m sorry.

137
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,280
sometimes

138
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,480
I made you feel like crap…

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,760
But honestly, I didn’t even realize it.

140
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,880
Yeah…

141
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,320
I’m sorry too.

142
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,720
I should’ve just told you
properly from the start.

143
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,800
And...

144
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,880
about Love...

145
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,040
if you wanna go after her,

146
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,640
go ahead.

147
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
I’m cool with it now.

148
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,000
But honestly,

149
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,920
you should probably clear things
up with your dad… about Mira.

150
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,880
Hey wait, are you guys good now or what?

151
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,240
That’s what I’m talking about!

152
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,040
Hold up… were you faking being drunk?

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,840
You even went all out and puked, huh?

154
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,680
That’s straight-up Acting 101!

155
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,200
Cee

156
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,920
See, you tryna die or something?

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,360
I carried your ass all the way here

158
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
Do you even know how heavy you are?!

159
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,520
Type Don't!!!

160
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,760
We started drinking together,
but you’re the first one down?

161
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,320
If this photo gets leaked, I wonder
how fun your university life will be.

162
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,440
Yeah, the one in the sports car

163
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,760
with a driver, right?

164
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,800
Yup, that’s her. She’s the one
who stole someone else’s man.

165
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,480
I think...

166
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,200
She looks really familiar to me.

167
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,840
Nothing special, really.
His girlfriend’s way prettier.

168
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,680
For real,

169
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Can’t believe it. She really
snatched someone’s boyfriend.

170
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,760
Is everything okay?

171
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,840
Everyone seems to be looking at you weirdly.

172
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,120
no

173
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,320
This is way out of line.

174
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,600
Isn’t this a bit too much?

175
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,680
Are you gonna talk to them,
or do I have to do it for you?

176
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,200
Let’s go. Now.

177
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,680
Liu

178
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,720
So…

179
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,120
what exactly happened?

180
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,040
What if the rumors are actually true?

181
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,560
You actually believe those rumors?

182
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,160
no

183
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,960
the rumor that

184
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,720
anyone who crosses Mira…

185
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,480
ends up ruined.

186
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,240
Then maybe it is true, after all.

187
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,720
I never thought this would
happen to someone so close to us.

188
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,080
She really shouldn’t have messed with Mira…

189
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,120
Liu...

190
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,040
And...

191
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,520
How did things get this messed up?

192
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,440
Well, Type’s always been the kind of
guy who just... casually dates girls.

193
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,640
And he’s never really
been serious about anyone.

194
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,000
But then he met Love,

195
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,400
and Mira probably started
sensing something was off.

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,600
Off? What do you mean?

197
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,360
I mean, Type might actually
like Love for real this time.

198
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,160
But because of business stuff,

199
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,080
even if he wants to break off the
engagement with Mira, he can’t.

200
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,680
It’d hurt Mira’s pride too much

201
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,160
or something like that.

202
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,160
Yes.

203
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,680
Mira’s totally unhinged.

204
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,440
Don’t worry, Love.

205
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,520
No matter

206
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,120
what happens,

207
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
we’ll be right here for you.

208
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,240
Right?

209
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,840
yes

210
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,080
Yeah, seriously don’t overthink it.

211
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,040
Thank you so much, everyone.

212
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,800
I should’ve listened to
you guys from the start.

213
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
What the hell is this supposed to be?

214
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Where is Love?

215
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,080
I have something important to talk about.

216
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,400
Come have lunch with me at noon, okay?

217
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,040
You said you had
something to talk to me about.

218
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,600
What was it?

219
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,400
Uh… Well…

220
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,080
I’m not here to apologize
on anyone else’s behalf.

221
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
I just want to say sorry…

222
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,560
For making you go through all this.

223
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,360
I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you.

224
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,480
Type

225
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,760
This...

226
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,080
This is way too much, Mira.

227
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,400
This is way too little, to be honest.

228
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
I already told you, right?

229
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,120
If you can’t even handle your own damn life,

230
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,440
don’t drag anyone else into it.

231
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,800
Don’t say a damn thing.

232
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
And don’t let me find out
you’re messing with Love again.

233
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,480
And if a video leaks,

234
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,440
you better start saving your damn money.

235
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,800
Liu

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,560
Sorry, Liu.

237
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,840
And...

238
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,680
I’m sorry for making
everyone go through all this.

239
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,240
I’m really sorry, Liu.

240
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,720
Love

241
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,680
enough

242
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,760
Don’t cry anymore. And don’t blame yourself.

243
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,360
Now, look up.

244
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,640
Wipe your tears first.

245
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,920
I won’t get involved with Type anymore.

246
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,200
I mean it, Liu.

247
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,040
If you think the decision you made is okay,

248
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,160
then it’s okay.

249
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,200
And from now on,

250
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,240
if you decides to be with someone,

251
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,400
just make sure to be careful.

252
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
Thank you, Liu.

253
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,840
Aren’t you ashamed, Mira?

254
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,360
The one who should be ashamed
here is probably you, Type.

255
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,040
If you're going to go this far
and make a public display of it,

256
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,720
at least show some respect for your parents.

257
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,480
Because the one who's
going to be hurt isn't me.

258
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
Keep those words for the press.

259
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,760
Don't tell me about it.

260
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,600
Go ahead, try it.

261
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,680
I've already made my announcement.

262
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,600
If that video leaks,

263
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,320
just be ready for it.

264
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,440
This isn't going to get you anywhere, Type.

265
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,920
Mira, this is all you can think of, huh?

266
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,800
But this time,

267
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,960
you didn’t think it through enough.

268
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,600
Love

269
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
About what happened at noon...

270
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
I am really sorry.

271
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Can we talk outside for a moment?

272
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,600
How are you doing?

273
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,720
The exams are coming up.

274
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,200
I think I can do it.

275
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
Am I good?

276
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,360
You're the best.

277
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,960
You've been preparing for so long time.

278
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,520
I really think you can do it.

279
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,240
hello

280
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,320
What’s up, man?

281
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,600
You called at the perfect freakin’ time!

282
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,200
Uh... How would you feel if I
asked to go over to Chertam’s place?

283
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,160
I’ve got something...

284
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,680
really important I need to
talk to her about — in person.

285
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,160
Are you crazy?

286
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,000
You wanna be alone with my girlfriend
at her house? Just the two of you?

287
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,840
Uh...

288
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,760
It’s not like that, I
swear. You can trust me.

289
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,480
but

290
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,480
it’s something serious. Like, really serious.

291
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,840
Serious enough that you and my girlfriend

292
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,440
have to be alone together?

293
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,000
Wait...

294
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,120
Are you trying to hit on her or something?

295
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,720
What?! No! Come on, man. Are you crazy?

296
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,640
It’s just... it’s really important.

297
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
When I’m ready, I’ll tell
you everything, I promise.

298
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,240
But I need to ask Chertame first.

299
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,120
Alright, that’s it?

300
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, that’s all.

301
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,600
Thanks, man. Let me know what’s up, alright?

302
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,520
okay

303
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,320
Chertame

304
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,680
I heard everything.

305
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,960
Anyway…

306
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,320
what is Cia coming for?

307
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,440
I’m not sure either.

308
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,080
He just told me he had
something important to take care of.

309
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,600
I didn’t dare to ask. It felt like
something I shouldn’t get involved in.

310
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,520
Are you okay?

311
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,960
I remember now.

312
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,080
I'll let Sia know then.

313
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,560
He can come over to my house.

314
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,120
okay

315
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,320
Excuse me…

316
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,800
here’s some water.

317
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,880
Uh… thank you.

318
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,040
Are you looking for something, Cia?

319
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,160
Uh… uh… Are you here alone?

320
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,920
yes

321
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,720
My parents are overseas.

322
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,520
Blue has been taking care of
me since I was in high school.

323
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,080
I’m sorry…

324
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,640
Mhok told me

325
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,720
you had something to talk to me about.

326
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,040
It’s about my brother, isn’t it?

327
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,720
I think I’ve already told you…

328
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,720
I don’t want to talk about Blue anymore.

329
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,200
I understand.

330
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,240
No, you don’t understand.

331
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,720
This is a family matter.

332
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,160
Chertame… please calm down first.

333
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,320
Look...

334
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,680
I didn’t mean for you to misunderstand.
I didn’t want to make you angry at all.

335
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,760
but...

336
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,360
The thing I’ve been trying to understand…

337
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,720
it’s about your brother.

338
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,440
I have my reasons.

339
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,440
One day, you’ll understand.

340
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,840
Have you ever felt like…

341
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,400
someone who’s always
taken care of you so well

342
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
suddenly started breaking down

343
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
from all the pressure?

344
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,240
I’m sorry, Chertame.

345
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,600
If I made you uncomfortable.

346
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,160
but...

347
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,600
now

348
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,880
I think I finally understand
how you must have felt.

349
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,320
You know…

350
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
Blue went through a lot of pain

351
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,600
before the accident.

352
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,960
He was devastated about the music club.

353
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,120
When he came back home that day…

354
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,800
He ran to me, hugged me, and cried.

355
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,560
I’m heartbroken…

356
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,360
that my brother had to
carry all that weight alone.

357
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,400
I miss him. Do you understand?

358
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,800
The only thing that
still makes me feel like...

359
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,400
Blue is right here beside me…

360
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,720
is the music he wrote and sang

361
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,680
straight from his heart.

362
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Blue's Song

363
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,680
yes

364
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,960
Because when I hear it…

365
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,680
it feels like he’s still with me, always.

366
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,920
Chertame…

367
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,720
would you be willing to let me hear it?

368
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,480
Cia, are you okay?

369
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,360
Name Bryde'n whale

370
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,400
Is that Blue's name?

371
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,600
yes

372
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,600
But… I don’t really know
what the lyrics mean.

373
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,120
Blue wrote it.

374
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,920
…Are you okay?

375
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,200
It’s just that…

376
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,720
The first time I listened to
this song, I really loved it.

377
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,600
I kept listening to it,

378
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,480
playing it on the guitar,

379
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,720
singing it over and over…

380
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,200
I...

381
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,240
I don’t even know why exactly.

382
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,080
Like I told you before…

383
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,440
Maybe I’m just attached to the song.

384
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,600
To Blue’s voice.

385
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,920
Even though I didn’t really know him
that well... or wasn’t close to him.

386
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,160
But now…

387
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,520
I think I finally understand who he was.

388
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,200
And

389
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,680
what he truly wanted to know most.

390
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,280
If you don’t mind…

391
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,520
Umm...

392
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,480
May I… ask to go up to Blue’s room?

393
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,520
Of course.

394
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,680
Blue’s room might be a little dusty.

395
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,800
I usually clean it every week,

396
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,920
but I’ve been busy studying for exams lately…

397
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,800
so I haven’t been up there in a while.

398
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,280
It's really beautiful.

399
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,600
The weather is also nice.

400
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,280
It's beautiful.

401
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,160
How come it's so similar to mine?

402
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,840
Excuse me,

403
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,280
yes

404
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,040
do you still have any of the blue diaries

405
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
on that shelf?

406
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,720
believe that's the last
one we have left, sir.

407
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,520
I'm really sorry about that.

408
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,040
Oh, I see. Okay then. Thank you.

409
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,280
Please... don’t disappear on me again.

410
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,560
I told you, didn’t I?

411
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,040
I never wanted to disappear.

412
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,040
I want to be right here with you.

413
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,560
I don’t want to hurt you.

414
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,200
It hurt me too, having to leave like that.

415
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,280
I...

416
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,920
I’ve learned so much about you

417
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,200
And

418
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,960
I’ve come to understand your pain.

419
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,000
What do you mean by that?

420
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,360
Well...

421
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,040
your sister

422
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,840
told me everything.

423
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,440
Like...

424
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,520
this diary, for example

425
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,360
My university life

426
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
seemed smooth on the surface,

427
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,240
thanks to the support and
understanding from my family.

428
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,400
But that very understanding...

429
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,800
turned out to be the
biggest pressure of all.

430
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,000
But then I heard Time say,

431
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,360
'No one is 100% perfect,'

432
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,080
and somehow… that
made me feel a little better.

433
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,920
What does that mean?

434
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,000
Exactly what it says.

435
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,800
Time is seriously so cool...

436
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,120
But wait

437
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,680
Why...

438
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,560
does this part you wrote feel...

439
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,040
It seems like it’s from
the week of the activity fair

440
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,520
when you were in your first year, right?

441
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,600
Mm... What does it say here?

442
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,080
What I saw today…

443
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,440
was too much for me to even put into words.

444
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,680
I froze.

445
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,760
I didn’t know how to talk to Time.

446
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,880
But even if he tried to say anything now,

447
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,320
it just wouldn’t mean anything anymore.

448
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,960
And this part... What does it mean?

449
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,800
Even now,

450
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,480
I still can’t believe it really happened.

451
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,320
Hey… You…

452
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,160
Yeah, of course.

453
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,840
Once the transfer’s done, it’s all set.

454
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,560
I’ll send you the list.

455
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,000
Seriously, if this wasn’t top-tier
stuff, you’d never get it at this price.

456
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,240
Whoa,

457
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,480
they really did that?

458
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,200
I’m not even sure…

459
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,080
how many times it's happened.

460
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
And then

461
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,080
What did you do after that?

462
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,120
I couldn’t do anything.

463
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,160
Time already taken the money...

464
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,600
You know,

465
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,240
at that moment...

466
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,320
I really understood

467
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,600
what it feels like to be
betrayed by someone you trust.

468
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,880
It's okay.

469
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,760
Hey… Can you look at me for a second?

470
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,720
Blue...

471
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,440
Do you really not have any other
important things hidden somewhere?

472
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,720
Is this seriously all of it?

473
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,760
There’s got to be more, right?

474
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,760
Ugh, no, that’s all.

475
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,840
How can that be all?

476
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,240
Even if there was, I wouldn’t remember.

477
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,080
What? Why wouldn’t you remember?

478
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,280
Who were you just talking to, Cia?

479
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,520
Who are you talking to?

480
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,480
Uh...

481
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,440
I...

482
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,200
I was just talking

483
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,280
to myself.

484
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,240
I was reading Blue’s diary, that's all.

485
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,640
But...

486
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,640
I’m pretty sure I heard
more like a conversation.

487
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,120
Oh… it’s nothing, really.

488
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,240
So who exactly were you talking to?

489
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,680
I told you,

490
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,960
I was just reading and talking to myself.

491
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,840
I do that sometimes.

492
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,040
Really.

493
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,920
Then where’s Blue’s diary?

494
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,200
Over there.

495
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,200
Here it is.

496
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,640
Cia,

497
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,880
this page has been torn out of the diary.

498
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,400
What exactly do you want to know about Blue?

499
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,680
I'll be honest with you.

500
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,400
since

501
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,840
you've known Blue…

502
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,360
did you ever see him writing in a diary?

503
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,720
There's a first diary that he
kept. It should be in his bedroom.

504
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,120
And…

505
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,720
do you know about the last page?

506
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
It was torn away.

507
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,080
The last page?

508
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,840
What could’ve happened…?

509
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,800
It’s alright.

510
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,080
I’ll look around here a bit more.

511
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,920
Maybe I’ll find something.

512
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,200
Okay…

513
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,920
Then I’ll help you look.

514
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,000
Alright, thanks.

515
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,720
Are you alright?

516
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,120
I’m fine.

517
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,240
I probably just got clumsy.

518
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,720
Let me move this over here then.

519
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,640
It’s kind of in the way.

520
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,920
okay.

521
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,320
But…

522
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
you’re really okay, right?

523
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,160
Really. I’m okay.

524
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,840
Cia,

525
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,560
yes

526
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,880
I think we should head home
now. It's getting pretty late.

527
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,360
And I have something
else I need to take care of.

528
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,880
but...

529
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,880
I think I need to wait for Cee.

530
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,960
Cee

531
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,760
He said…

532
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,800
Well, he told me...

533
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,400
Hey there.

534
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,040
Where are you guys headed?

535
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,240
Oh,

536
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,960
Cee, aren't you the one
asking? Where are you going?

537
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,040
Cee

538
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,920
Jod’s coming back with us too.

539
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,840
Jod, huh?

540
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,360
yes

541
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,520
He’s coming with me.

542
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,760
Jod, right?

543
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,440
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,080
What’s up?

545
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
Uh... so, you sure you don’t
wanna head back with me?

546
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,840
I’m good. Thanks.

547
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,720
Alright then.

548
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,720
Don’t come home too late, okay?

549
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,800
okay

550
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,800
And can you lock up the room for me?

551
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,840
Got it. See ya.

552
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,720
See ya.

553
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,080
See ya.

554
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,440
See ya, bro.

555
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,280
See ya.

556
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,880
Get home safe, man.

557
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,920
Let's go! Let's go!

558
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,400
Man, getting old really
messes with your hearing, huh?

559
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,800
What about Jod?

560
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,040
Dude, what’s wrong with you?

561
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,600
You’re the one who said
Jod were coming earlier!

562
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,560
Coming where??

563
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,320
What

564
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,880
how did you even get here?

565
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,800
Uh…

566
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,800
Are you going back yet?

567
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,920
Whoa Jod!

568
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,680
No shoes in the club room, man!

569
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,320
You talk too much.

570
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,360
So, where exactly are you guys dragging me?

571
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,080
Oh, right! Jod, you
came at the perfect time.

572
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,720
Umm...

573
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
I’ve got something I need to
take care of real quick.You free?

574
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,520
Huh? you need something?
I’m just passing by.

575
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,160
I didn’t just pass by.

576
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,160
You came to find me on purpose?

577
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, I came to find you.

578
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,640
Hey, enough already, you guys.

579
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,120
So, where are you guys taking me?

580
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,680
Do you see me alone,

581
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,680
or are you...?

582
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,000
Enough, seriously.

583
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,160
Just thinking about it is already wrong.

584
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,800
Sorry.

585
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,240
Hey, Jod,

586
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,800
Are you free today?

587
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,280
I heard you wanted to find a
chill place to hang out, right?

588
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,880
Perfect,

589
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,720
Cee is free too, he’s just bored

590
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,800
Take him with you.

591
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,600
I was thinking of writing a song for
a bit, then I'll head home later.

592
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,920
Sure, my friend.

593
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
I'll go with Zee.

594
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,480
Thanks, man.

595
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,000
What are you laughing at?

596
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,520
Nothing, nothing.

597
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,120
Are you going?

598
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,880
If you're going, then follow me.

599
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,440
Let's go, let's go!

600
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,080
Why are you in such a hurry?

601
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,880
So, where are you taking me?

602
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,640
Oh, we're filming a video.

603
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,560
Oh,

604
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,560
Wait,

605
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,920
hold on.

606
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,200
You brought me here

607
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,360
to film a video?

608
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,600
Enough already.

609
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,040
I have to send my work.

610
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,720
Oh, just a sec.

611
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,360
Come closer. You're tall.

612
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,640
Alright, now,

613
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,840
come closer.

614
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,080
Come closer. Okay, now.

615
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,600
Is this close enough?
