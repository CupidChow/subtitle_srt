1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:04,533
I often think of the things
that happened in 2019：

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:08,500
The 70th Anniversary of the
Great Motherland's Birth, Brilliant years

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,300
Forging ahead

4
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,367
The characters of 《The Wandering Earth》

5
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:15,467
was unforgettable.
Regardless of the return date.

6
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,400
An unexpected fire

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,833
Took away the Notre Dame de Paris
described by Hugo.

8
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,833
And the story of me and Yang Yuhang,
in that hot summer

9
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:30,267
started with the extra lessons in the third
year of high school and a special letter.

10
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:33,567
(Every Moment that I Think of You)
(Episode 1)

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,467
Dear Iron Arm Calabash Brother,
how are you?

12
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:39,100
Recently, we started the extra lessons
for the third year of high school.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,233
This is really a torment for me,
who is at the bottom of the class.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,000
But fortunately, I have your constant
updates on LOFTER to accompany me,

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,733
and it makes me happy.

16
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:04,400
I always think that such a
hardworking man must look good.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,667
It's okay, if it doesn't work this time,
I'll give it to you next time.

18
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,300
That Yang Yuhang,

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,167
the prettiest girl in the grade has
sent him the love letter,

20
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:26,900
how come he is still indifferent?

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,700
He is cocky, that's why.
This the the third time already.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,000
Liu Bei paid three visits to the thatched cottage,
and he succeeded in inviting Zhuge Liang to be his military adviser.

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,700
Speaking of my recent life

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,067
there is one thing I want to share with you.

25
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:37,000
I noticed that although Yang Yuhang,
the study committee member of our class,

26
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,067
is a star student who has good grades,

27
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,300
and looks also handsome
while just a bit worse than me,

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,333
he's always alone and has no friends.

29
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:50,167
When going out to do exercise,
everyone else is in groups.

30
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,533
While he goes alone

31
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:53,867
When eating in the canteen,

32
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:57,933
everyone else is in groups,
while he goes alone

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,967
Whether it's going to school or after school,

34
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:05,533
everyone else is in groups,
while he goes alone

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,033
He's like a lonely prince living
in a glass cover.

36
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,667
He's always alone.

37
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,033
Seeing him like this,

38
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,600
I suddenly remembered something you said.

39
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,300
I hope that every lonely person can
experience a warm companionship.

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,300
No matter how long it takes.

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,300
I decided to do something for this lonely boy

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,367
to make his life a little different.

43
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,567
Yang Yuhang, wake up.

44
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,300
Who are you?

45
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,833
Your classmate, the most handsome guy
in the class, Chen Zihao

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,133
The one who never handed in homework

47
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:07,933
and always took the last one
in the exam, Chen Zihao?

48
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:13,800
Those are not important,
the important thing is that from today,

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,967
I, Chen Zihao, is your best friend,
Yang Yuhang.

50
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,667
Nope

51
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:39,400
It's okay. You refused me, while I'll still do
what I decided to do. No big deal.

52
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:44,167
Although my first initiative was rejected
by him decisively,

53
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,667
it just aroused my desire to win.

54
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:49,067
It made me want to be a good friend
with him even more,

55
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,267
and get to know this boy who has been
in the same class

56
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:54,133
for three years but is always alone.

57
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,967
Hey

58
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,900
What are you thinking about,
let's go play basketball.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,333
- Nah, quite busy right now.
- Come on.

60
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:05,200
I have carefully read everything
you have written.

61
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,367
Finally, in the novel you wrote,
I came up with a three-step strategy.

62
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,700
The first step is to have
something in common.

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,600
Everyone likes people
who are similar to them.

64
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,700
So I decided to imitate him
to get his attention.

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,667
Study more,

66
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,767
read more,

67
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,100
and listen to music.

68
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:39,033
Um... however, he didn't notice my existence at all.

69
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:42,233
The first step, Out!

70
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,833
The second step is to keep being nice to him.

71
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:49,233
As the saying goes, when fate is
not enough, just keep going relentlessly.

72
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,900
If I keep being nice to him,
then he must accept me someday.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,533
There are routines in the novel
to buy a delicious breakfast,

74
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,867
and the probability of success is very high.

75
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:59,633
So I...

76
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,633
Knowledge points should be
reviewed repeatedly

77
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:12,433
to be able to remember them firmly,
just like having God helping us.

78
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:13,967
So I...

79
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,900
Study committee, how do you
calculate this question?

80
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,100
So I... After PE

81
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,933
A bottle of ice water will definitely
make him accept me!

82
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:31,367
So I... Um... It's too difficult.

83
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,700
The second step, Out!

84
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,600
The third step is to tease him hard.

85
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,300
He looks so weak with
thin arms and short legs.

86
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
It looks like that he can do
nothing except studying.

87
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,433
He must be such a pushover.

88
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:50,133
So I decided to tease him.

89
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,567
In this way,

90
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:56,700
he will definitely admire the power of me,
Black-Faced King Kong.

91
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:12,133
No one ever told me.
Yang Yuhang learned Taekwondo.

92
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:15,933
The third step, definately Out!

93
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:19,300
Iron Arm Calabash Brother,
After half a month of my persistence,

94
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,467
It can be said that my relationship with
Yang Yuhang has not progressed

95
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,867
or even worse.

96
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,533
Although you said that,
As a man sows, so he shall reap.

97
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:31,767
But you also said that you can take a
horse to water but you cannot make it drink.

98
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:34,500
Although I feel a bit down,

99
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,500
I have decided to respect classmate Yang.

100
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,533
That's it about my life lately.

101
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,700
Dear Iron Arm Calabash Brother,
this is my 52nd letter to you.

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,833
I hope to hear from you this time.

103
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:51,333
Also, thank you for the companionship
by the novel as always.

104
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:55,633
It's bringing infinite joy to my
otherwise boring life, superb!

105
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,467
Class, let's go through the key exercises.

106
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,767
Take out the exercise book.

107
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:13,933
As usual, go outside and stand by wall,
if you forgot your exercise book.

108
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,033
How can you still forget to bring your
exercise book in the third year of high school.

109
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:19,200
Are you going to forget to take
National College Entrance Examnation?

110
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,533
Miss, I forgot to bring it.

111
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,533
Chen Zihao, you again,

112
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:43,433
you're not even sure whether you can go
to university with this grade,

113
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,100
and you still don't take classes seriously.

114
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,333
Won't you feel disappointed to yourself
and your parents?

115
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,000
Go outside and stand by wall,
write a review tonight.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,133
The label of adolescence is filled
with passion, impulsivity,

117
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,833
and doing things not knowing why it is so.

118
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:17,200
Sometimes many stories start on impulse.

119
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,267
I have no idea why I threw the exercise
book to Yang Yuhang that day.

120
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,933
I don't understand why Yang Yuhang
started looking at me that day.

121
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:28,400
I only know that that day,
the wind and the clouds were light.

122
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,100
The sun is shining brightly
on the white shirt than ever.

123
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,933
And the relationship between me
and Yang Yuhang

124
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:38,033
doesn't seem to be as awkward
as it used to be.

125
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,433
Dear Iron Arm Calabash Brother,
how are you?

126
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:53,033
Speaking of which, 2019 so far...
the three-steps strategy...

127
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:01,233
You are Iron Arm... Calabash Brother?

128
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,333
Stop, stop!

129
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
I have liked you for a long time.

130
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,533
- Oh! Is that so? Black-Faced... King Kong?
- Stop! Please stop!

131
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:21,100
I always thought Black-faced King Kong
was a muscular guy.

132
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:30,067
Who says that King Kong can't be an
innocent high school student? Huh?

133
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:32,100
It's discrimination, Calabash Brother.

134
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:39,600
I... I've been reading your article for two years.

135
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:43,500
I know, and I have been reading
your letter for two years.

136
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,033
The 52nd letter.

137
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,100
Then why did you never reply?

138
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:52,400
Knowing you are there is enough.

139
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,200
Oh!

140
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,933
Thank you for your exercise book that day.

141
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:06,833
Well, no big deal, I don't understand anyway.

142
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,167
Chen Zihao, as a senior high school student,

143
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:13,233
you can't even do well in studies,
what else can you do well?

144
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,867
It seems to make sense,

145
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,767
but I just don't understand it, what can I do?

146
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,767
I'll help you out.

147
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:20,767
What?

148
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:23,733
I said, I'll help you.

149
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,533
Do you charge, teacher Yang?

150
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,233
Charge your ass.

151
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:32,133
The summer of 2019 was really special.

152
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,033
I finally met Iron Arm Calabash Brother,
who never replied to me,

153
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:39,467
and he turned out to be
my classmate Yang Yuhang!

154
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,367
As a man sows, so he shall reap.
That's true.

155
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,700
I gradually became good friends with him.

156
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
With his help, I studied harder than before.

157
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,600
There has also been a
great improvement in results!

158
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,033
I wasn't the worst in the class anymore,

159
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:55,467
and progressed to the tenth to last.

160
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,833
Sure enough, the harder you work,
the luckier you will be.

161
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,700
Class, it's winter vacation soon.

162
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,633
Keep learning at home.

163
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,233
Senior year is about racing against time.

164
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,467
Otherwise, you can't win the battle, got it?

165
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:25,967
Got it.

166
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,133
Okay, class dismissed.

167
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,000
Hey, are you looking for Yang Yuhang?

168
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,400
Hmm

169
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,900
Well, he's busy dating.

170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,333
What? When did he fall in love?

171
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,400
Childhood sweethearts'
they have been together since childhood,

172
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,967
it's been a while.

173
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,567
Okay...

174
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,500
Who said I was in love?

175
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,533
Don't ruin my luck in love.

176
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,800
I'm afraid that will affect your study.

177
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,033
We have to study hard
and make progress every day.

178
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,300
Yuhang

179
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,233
Hmm?

180
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,967
Winter break is coming soon,
remember to keep in touch.

181
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:25,667
Okay.

182
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:27,033
Remember to hang out together.

183
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,333
Okay.

184
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,533
Be a good boy, and remember to miss me.

185
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,500
O... Are you out of your mind?

186
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,000
Dear Iron Arm Calabash Brother,

187
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,267
oh, I should call you by your real name now.

188
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:42,333
Yang Yuhang，winter break is coming soon,

189
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:43,933
I hope that in this winter vacation,

190
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,000
I can still see your articles.

191
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,367
Yang Yuhang, when are you gonna
update this chapter

192
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:48,633
I've been refreshing the page all day.

193
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,900
Got it，got it，stop urging.

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,600
I hate it when people urge me to update.

195
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,900
I hope that in this winter vacation,

196
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,533
my study will progress
and shine as we wish.

197
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:03,500
I hope that in this winter vacation,
we will keep in touch,

198
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,233
and we can meet each other
whenever we want!

199
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,033
I hope that in this winter vacation,
the earth is peaceful,

200
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,267
and we will have a happy new year.

201
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,033
My parents might have a divorce.

202
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:21,967
Can we still go somewhere to
celebrate New Year's Eve this year?

203
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:22,867
I will sleep together with you.

204
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:25,067
Yang Yuhang，are you home?
Yang Yuhang.

205
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:41,167
You are the joy of youth.
