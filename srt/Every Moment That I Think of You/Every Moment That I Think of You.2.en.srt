1
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,500
The pig's flying!

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,000
Which holiday do you not sleep till noon?

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,300
Mom, I've got something important to do.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,100
What? trying to study hard?

5
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,567
Rounding up is also a review.

6
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,733
It must be ancestors' blessing.
My son's getting somewhere.

7
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,333
The winter vacation in 2020

8
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:33,667
was a different winter vacation for me.

9
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,200
(Every Moment that I Think of You) (Episode 2)
The earth rotates repeatedly every day,

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,867
and the comet didn't hit Earth either.

11
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:40,767
The days repeated,

12
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:43,667
But it would surprise or
frighten the original cycle

13
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:48,067
because of another person's
appearance in life.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,867
We're wearing the same dress,
Are you imitating my outfit?

15
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,167
How is this called imitating?

16
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:02,900
It's called chemistry, got it?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,867
Okay, chemistry.

18
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:09,233
Let's go, today's mission is to
take you to the seaside.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,500
Didn't we have the agreement to study?

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,200
In order to let you serialize the story
of the sea on LOFTER,

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,300
I decided to take you there.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,733
Okay, all right, but promise me
to study tomorrow.

23
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,667
Guaranteed to complete the mission!

24
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,233
Let's go.

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,733
Obviously, the appearance of
Yang Yuhang was a surprise.

26
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,933
It made my goalless life

27
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:33,700
begin to have some wild imagination.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,900
And it also made every day sparkle.

29
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:06,200
How is it, great writer, look at this blue sea.

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,600
Did it stimulate your desire of writing?

31
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,233
It's already a rare chance to hang out,
and there's even a task for me to do?

32
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,333
That's because it looks like
you've got something on your mind.

33
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:17,233
Something on my mind?

34
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,167
Look at you, you look worried.

35
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,700
My parents might have a divorce.

36
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:46,300
It's fine though, they've been
arguing for over ten years.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,467
It's only a matter of time.

38
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:55,367
Don't you think that people
always say goodbye?

39
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,400
Life is like a train.

40
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,800
Some people get on
and some people get off.

41
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,433
It's common to have separation
and reunion in life.

42
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:08,000
But don't you worry.

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,800
Believe me, I won't leave you.

44
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,667
My Mom and Dad also have their own lives.

45
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,300
If they are not happy together,

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,300
then we should respect their choice.

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,167
They also have their own
happiness to look for.

48
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,367
Okay.

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,800
In the winter vacation of 2020,

50
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,933
I shuttled between two homes.

51
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,400
Although the college entrance
examination is coming soon,

52
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,967
I am happy every day.

53
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:46,400
Yang Yuhang would chatter with me
about the Zodiac Signs occasionally.

54
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,967
I didn't believe in Zodiac Signs before.

55
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:53,067
Because he likes it, so I have
become fond of it as well.

56
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:57,000
He told me that I'm a Virgo
and he's a Taurus.

57
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,200
These two are the most
compatible Zodiac Signs as friends.

58
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,867
Because he likes Mayday,

59
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:03,300
and he loops their songs all the time.

60
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,067
So I also fell in love with Mayday

61
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,267
And I got the habit of listening to music.

62
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:10,533
Because he likes sunflowers.

63
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:13,033
He said that it's a thriving hope.

64
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:17,133
So I went to the flower shop every day
to pick up a flower, and bring it to him.

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,300
Happy days are always short.

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,533
Soon the new year will come.

67
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,600
However, this year's New Year
is a little different.

68
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,867
Mom, are we still posting
Spring Festival couplets this year?

69
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,000
Of course. Chinese traditions
cannot be forgotten.

70
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,300
And I believe our country
will overcome difficulties.

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,133
Everything's gonna get better and better.

72
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,300
Okay!

73
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,700
Mom's going to cook you a
New Year's Eve dinner!

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,067
Okay, I'll help you out later.

75
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:46,767
The Spring Festival of 2020
was a special Spring Festival.

76
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,400
Due to the pandemic,

77
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,267
we were all worried,

78
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,633
while we were never really afraid.

79
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:58,267
Because we believed that nothing
in the world can beat us.

80
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:03,367
"Nian" is a new, warm word for saying
goodbye to the old and welcoming the new.

81
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:06,433
We all believe that this year
will be a good year as well.

82
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:09,900
Your grades gotta get better this year.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,567
- Have some more meat.
- Thanks, dad.

84
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:15,300
Mom, eat this, What a tiring day.

85
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:19,600
Happy New Year, Yang Yuhang.

86
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,400
Happy New Year, Chen Zihao.

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,633
What's going on, it's New Year.

88
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,567
Why is your house so quiet?

89
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,400
I... I'm home alone.

90
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,033
Wait.

91
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,833
Dad, Mom, I'll go back to my room
and answer my classmate's phone.

92
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,000
Yang Yuhang, are you still there?

93
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,067
Yep.

94
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:43,233
I'm here to accompany you
for the New Year.

95
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,967
Silly you, how are you
going to accompany me?

96
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,167
We just need to keep our
phones on like this.

97
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:50,033
I'll accompany you for the New Year,
accompany you to stay up late,

98
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:51,767
and accompany you to sleep.

99
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:54,567
Good, thank you, Chen Zihao.

100
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,300
Don't mention it.

101
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,600
Yang Yuhang, you told me last time that

102
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,767
our Zodiac Signs are 100% compatible.

103
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,500
Is that true?

104
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,600
The constellation book said so.

105
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,033
Then tell me, as I have a bad temper,

106
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,133
what if I get into a fight with you?

107
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:11,967
You're not gonna fight with me.

108
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,033
The sun rises every day.

109
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,733
The tide recedes every day.

110
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:21,767
And I and Yang Yuhang kept in touch,
even if we couldn't meet sometimes.

111
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:24,800
On this special New Year's Eve in 2020,

112
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,000
we talked a lot.

113
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,033
About the Zodiac Signs, about learning,

114
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:32,967
about dreams, about the future.

115
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,533
Even it's a mess outside in the world,

116
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:38,000
We felt safe and sound because of

117
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,667
having each other on the
other end of the phone.

118
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,833
At least, we were seeing the same moon.

119
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,367
Three, two, one

120
00:06:55,467 --> 00:07:00,267
Happy New Year, Yang Yuhang,
I wish you good health every year.

121
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,767
Happy New Year, Chen Zihao

122
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:04,867
I wish you good health and happiness,
and progress in learning.

123
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,433
Good morning, Yang Yuhang.

124
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:44,567
Morning, Chen Zihao, get up.
Get ready to study.

125
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:48,400
What? Are you asking me to study
on the first day of the New Year?

126
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,033
I've been studying for an hour already.

127
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,867
Check the time for yourself, the college
entrance examination is in a few days.

128
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:57,867
Okay... I'm getting up.

129
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,900
Yang Yuhang said, as high school seniors,

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,167
preparing for the exam and studying hard

131
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:12,167
are the most correct things
we should do now.

132
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:16,000
Although we couldn't go to school,
and online lessons were being so laggy,

133
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,767
we would never stop chasing dreams.

134
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,833
In order to help me,

135
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:25,200
Yang Yuhang gave me video calls
every day to study with me.

136
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,900
Where there is a will, there is a way.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,367
My grades have improved significantly.

138
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,967
My parents and I were very glad.

139
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:42,567
Days went by, nothing changed.

140
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:47,200
Until his birthday in April,
I lost contact with him.

141
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,533
Mom, get me a mask. I have to go out.

142
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,067
There is an epidemic outside.

143
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,700
Although we have no cases here,

144
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,867
it's best not to go out.

145
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,933
Mom, I know, I have a classmate
who lost contact.

146
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,800
I'm worried about him,
I have to go check it out.

147
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,367
His house is not far, it's just there.

148
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:14,967
But...

149
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:18,133
Mom, my grades have improved
all because of him.

150
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,900
I still need his help, please.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,633
Well, then you must wear a mask
when you go out.

152
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:25,300
Also put on the gloves,
don't take them off, ok?

153
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,633
Thank you, mom.

154
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,967
Yang Yuhang, Yang Yuhang,
are you at home, Yang Yuhang?

155
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,333
Yang Yuhang.

156
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:53,333
What the hell happened to you?
You haven't spoken for half an hour.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,733
My mom... My mom said that I won't be
allowed to apply for the Chinese department.

158
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:08,400
I said that I like writing
and I want to be a writer.

159
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,267
She said that it is useless.

160
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,200
That's all?

161
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,500
You're just overwhelmed by this,
and decided to give up?

162
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,367
I... I don't know.

163
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,233
Yang Yuhang, let me ask you,

164
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,067
Mayday were once also not favored, right?

165
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,533
But which of them did not give up
their so-called stable life,

166
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:29,667
and which of them did not gave up the
so-called right path in the eyes of others?

167
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:32,433
Just in order to chase a
seemingly elusive dream?

168
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:36,133
They sang in the tavern before,
and now they sing at National Stadium.

169
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:39,467
Isn't it because of their perseverance
that made their dreams came true?

170
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:47,900
Your dream is to be a writer,
and write a lot of novels.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,633
As for me, I didn't have a dream before.

172
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,967
I only knew that the day went by
day by day.

173
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,567
But it's different now.

174
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,067
I'm going to be a photographer.

175
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,600
I will take a lot of photoes for your novels.

176
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,133
How is it, isn't it great?

177
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:07,333
So, You have to believe that they did it,

178
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,033
and so can we.

179
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:11,733
So can we.

180
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,300
That's it.

181
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
We can make it.

182
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,900
Yes we can.

183
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,433
By the way,

184
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,900
the cake shop isn't open now.

185
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,433
I can only prepare you this first.

186
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,767
I'll make up for you someday.

187
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:53,200
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you

188
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,533
Make a wish.

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
What is it?

190
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,133
I can't tell you.

191
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,233
Fine, doesn't matter.

192
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:12,000
I hope that the two of us can go to
the same city for college in the future.

193
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,867
I think that will do, I'll study harder.

194
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,767
What if you don't pass the exam?

195
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:20,800
Then you go to the best one.

196
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,233
I go to the worst one.

197
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,133
It's ok as long as we are in the same city.

198
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,400
After that, I studied even harder

199
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,533
just to be able to fulfill the wish
we made together

200
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,467
that night under the candlelight.

201
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:37,700
In our spare time, We would also
find time to meet and chat.

202
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,733
And I believe that the most
precious thing in the world

203
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,367
is that someone is willing to
spend time for you.

204
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:47,000
I think, Yang Yuhang and I both
cherish each other very much,

205
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,033
that we made time to meet each other
even when we were busy.

206
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,900
In 2020, the college entrance examination
has been delayed by a month.

207
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,567
For high school students in the third year,
there was more suffering than joy.

208
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,733
But we kept going

209
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,467
and finished the marathon successfully.

210
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,933
We gathered again in front of
our ivory tower.

211
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,767
How was the exam?

212
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,367
Okay, how about you?

213
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:18,333
Same.

214
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:19,667
Let's go.

215
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,700
The classmates had a great time
at the graduation party that night.

216
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,267
And I and Yang Yuhang,

217
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:34,000
not knowing if it would be the night
to say goodbye,

218
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
were hesitating for the unknown road.

219
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,133
Let's go to university together.

220
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,867
Together.

221
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:45,033
You... you can't break your promise.

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,933
I won't break my promise,

223
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:55,733
even if... I say, even if we're not
in the same city,

224
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,700
we have to keep in touch.

225
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,433
Let me down.

226
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:10,533
Listen to me now,

227
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:17,633
we must go to the same city,

228
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,733
it's a must.

229
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,767
Okay.

230
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:34,033
That summer night in 2020 was long
and the dream was bright.

231
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:37,100
The promise between the two teenagers
was sincere and true.

232
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,833
So that in the long years to come,

233
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,033
whenever I think of that night,

234
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:46,433
think of the two teenagers who were so
determined to guard the same wish,

235
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:51,200
I will overcome all difficulties
and move forward bravely.

236
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,933
(The world was crazy, we were blooming.)

237
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:13,200
(About the future, you should write it.)
