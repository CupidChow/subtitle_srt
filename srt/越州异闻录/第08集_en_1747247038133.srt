1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,160
V

2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,240
As communication

3
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,160
You came

4
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,440
Master

5
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
Master!

6
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,940
Watch a show.

7
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,940
What do you want?

8
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,940
I apologize for what happened that day.

9
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,440
I drank too much and my brain is not clear.

10
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,940
Get out!

11
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,940
Let me tell you something.

12
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,440
Our Su family has a good relationship with Jing Zhao Yin.

13
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,940
Just because these children have no parents,

14
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,940
and your parents are in our Su family,

15
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,440
I can let Jing Zhao Yin sentence her

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,440
to the crime of abducting women and children.

17
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,940
She will be beheaded.

18
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,940
And these children will be expelled.

19
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,940
What do you want to say?

20
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,940
Go back with me.

21
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,940
I don't think I saw this.

22
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,940
There is a system in our dynasty called Dian Qi.

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,940
Women can be sold.

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,940
Yes, I was sold to you.

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,940
But I don't think you want to take a body back.

26
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
Su Hang, you...

27
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,940
Children, don't be afraid.

28
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,940
Kidnapping children and women is a law in our dynasty.

29
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
I don't want to see you.

30
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
I don't want to see you.

31
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
I don't want to see you.

32
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,940
I don't want to see you.

33
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,940
I don't want to see you.

34
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,940
You and I are a couple.

35
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,940
How about you play a game with me?

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,940
If I win, you let them go.

37
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,940
If you win, I'll go with you.

38
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,940
Interesting, Ai Qi.

39
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,940
Ai Qi, have you decided on a game?

40
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,940
This is the game.

41
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,940
Whoever calls first loses.

42
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,940
You don't have to put your life here.

43
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,940
I don't know who's life is here.

44
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,940
Zhao Di, I don't like you that much.

45
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,940
But you are not enough for me.

46
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,940
Actually, I don't like you that much.

47
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,940
But you are pretty enough.

48
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,940
You deserve me.

49
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,940
So you lied to me from the beginning.

50
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,940
But even if you don't lie to me,

51
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,940
I can't escape, right?

52
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
You want to die?

53
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,940
I don't want to die.

54
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,940
I want to live well.

55
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Su Jia's business is not good recently.

56
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
She needs me.

57
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,940
I can't die.

58
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Then you admit defeat.

59
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,940
Impossible.

60
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,940
Stop.

61
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,940
You are not dead.

62
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,940
You are not dead.

63
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,940
You are not dead.

64
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,940
You are not dead.

65
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,940
You lost.

66
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
Let them go.

67
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,940
Let them go.

68
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,940
You go.

69
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,940
Go.

70
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,940
You are poisoned.

71
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
Fifty-three.

72
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,940
It's not poison.

73
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,940
But it's not strange that you eat it for the first time.

74
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,940
Haven't you heard of the poisonless husband?

75
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,940
Look.

76
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
The moon is so round today.

77
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,940
Su Lang.

78
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,940
Why are you hitting people?

79
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,940
Are you okay?

80
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
Su Hang.

81
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Why did you fall to the ground?

82
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
Get up.

83
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
Are you okay?

84
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,940
I'm okay.

85
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
Sir.

86
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
I fell down.

87
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,940
Put it in.

88
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
Good job.

89
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,940
Like this.

90
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
Water.

91
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
Water.

92
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,940
Where is the monk?

93
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Shanshanfang.

94
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Shanshanfang.

95
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Where is the monk?

96
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,940
Shanshanfang.

97
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,940
You are dead.

98
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
It's not because of you.

99
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,940
It's because of me.

100
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
Go.

101
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,940
Go.

102
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
Go.

103
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,940
Go.

104
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,940
Go.

105
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Go.

106
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,940
Go.

107
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,940
Go.

108
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,940
Go.

109
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,940
What happened when you took him back?

110
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,940
I was actually very good to him.

111
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Until the Su family went bankrupt,

112
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
we couldn't pay the debt.

113
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,740
My father didn't want to see him with a grandson,

114
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,340
so he sold him to the Yihong House.

115
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,940
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,940
Take them to the Zhou family.

117
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,940
Yes.

118
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,940
Si Gong, something happened to your family.

119
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,940
How is it, doctor?

120
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,940
How is the girl?

121
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
I'm not good at math.

122
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,940
I've never seen anything so strange.

123
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,940
Wait, doctor.

124
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,940
Si Gong is back.

125
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
Father.

126
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,940
The girl has been feverish since yesterday.

127
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,940
The doctor only found this handprint after he looked at it.

128
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,940
I really don't know how it came from.

129
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Shan Shan, do you want to take my child away?

130
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,940
What's going on?

131
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,940
What's going on?

132
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,940
Did something dirty really get into our house?

133
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,940
It's all fake.

134
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,940
I will solve these mysteries.

135
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Don't worry.

136
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,940
I will protect you and the girl.

137
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,940
Do you remember the first child we had a few years ago?

138
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,940
Xin Er?

139
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,940
You haven't eaten yet?

140
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,940
I have.

141
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,940
I will be going to Chang'an after I finish my meal.

142
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,940
It will take several months.

143
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,940
When I come back, Xin Er will be born.

144
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
You can go.

145
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Maybe when you come back, Xin Er will be able to crawl.

146
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,940
When I'm not around, if you need anything, just ask.

147
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,940
Don't worry.

148
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,940
I will take care of her.

149
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,940
Eat more.

150
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,940
Eat your meal.

151
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Didn't we agree not to mention this matter?

152
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Didn't we agree not to mention this matter?

153
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,940
I don't want the girl to be like Xin Er.

154
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,940
I don't want the girl to be like Xin Er.

155
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
I don't want the girl to be like Xin Er.

156
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,940
The first child that Yun Nu and I had was called Xin Er.

157
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,940
She was born half a month ago.

158
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,940
I went on a business trip to Chang'an for a few months.

159
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,940
I only found out about it after I came back.

160
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
I felt very guilty about this matter.

161
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
I was unwilling to mention it.

162
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
Take good care of the girl.

163
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,940
If you need anything, let me know.

164
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Even if I can't come back, Lu Wen Zhao will come to help.

165
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,940
You also take good care of yourself.

166
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
I will take good care of her.

167
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,940
I will take good care of her.
