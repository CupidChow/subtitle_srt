1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The End

2
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,500
General

3
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,500
General.

4
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,220
If he doesn't wake up,

5
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,140
your evil plan will succeed.

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,020
Mountain God has been involved in his dream

7
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,780
and became a new devil.

8
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,100
There is no Mountain God.

9
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,020
It's you who poisoned the Niuyuan Lies.

10
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,820
The Niuyuan Lies

11
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,740
As for the illusion I saw last time,

12
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,820
you saved me with the talisman water

13
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,020
because you used the antidote to decoct the talisman.

14
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,020
So you stopped my toxicity.

15
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,300
Right?

16
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,260
Slowly.

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,620
How is it?

18
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,420
Do you feel better?

19
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,740
Young Master Si,

20
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

21
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,500
After the poison enters the body,

22
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,620
you use the magic to lead people

23
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,660
to create new demons and fears.

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,420
Right?

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,220
Young Master Si,

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,340
you should tell the truth.

27
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,740
At first,

28
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,180
Lu Wenzhao told me the story of the Eagle Mountain.

29
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,220
In the north of the city of Yuezhou,

30
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,460
there is a mountain called Eagle Mountain

31
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,140
with a great view.

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,900
It's because you knew Lu Wenzhao

33
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,620
a year ago

34
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,900
and told him the story.

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,060
As for Liu Qingsong,

36
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,980
Su Heng and Zhao Tianming,

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,380
they are all like this.

38
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,780
So many people saw the ghost god.

39
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,260
Did I poison them?

40
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,820
The crow is the way you spread the poison.

41
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,580
The crow you raise

42
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,140
is covered with poison powder.

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,580
They attack people,

44
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,660
and people are poisoned.

45
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
You are really imaginative.

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,900
Don't argue.

47
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,620
Just check the crow tears

48
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,140
and the poison you grow.

49
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,900
Show if there's poison in your home

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
and you will know if I am right or not.

51
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,620
I haven't felt universe tired

52
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,140
despite many years of searching.

53
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,780
I can do the TEK no limit

54
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,580
You're going out for a business trip at this hour.

55
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,580
You have to treat us later.

56
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,700
You must have a colleague.

57
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,500
After Taoist Feng's death,

58
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,860
I went to Liu Zhao's room.

59
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,580
According to the confession,

60
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,100
the owner was crazy in his room,

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,540
not in the air.

62
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,380
It was just a play by the Western Department.

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,980
Who would perform like a play

64
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,260
and perform heavily?

65
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,100
It was Yu Wenxian himself.

66
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,740
You want to send me away?

67
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,620
As for Su Heng, he's a coward.

68
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,580
It's easier said than done.

69
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,220
Xu Tian is your man.

70
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,980
You invited Lao Xu.

71
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,020
Am I right?

72
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,940
You even pretend to be blind.

73
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
I did all of this.

74
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,900
I admit my guilt.

75
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,300
What's your motive?

76
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,980
Who ordered you?

77
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,500
Take him back.

78
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,060
Wake General Zhao up.

79
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,060
If he's still alive,

80
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,100
I'm going home to plant the soil.

81
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,060
Yes.

82
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,380
I'll find out the truth as soon as possible.

83
00:04:45,260 --> 00:05:09,740
rait

84
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,460
the little fairy of tonight.

85
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,660
You solved the case?

86
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,860
Soon.

87
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,180
But I need you to tell me

88
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,660
what happened to you and Xian

89
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,380
when Liu Zhao was 25 years old.

90
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,660
Go solve the case.

91
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,460
Why are you still asking?

92
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,660
Just go.

93
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,980
This antidote can only temporarily stop the toxicity.

94
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,820
If you can't solve the case,

95
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,220
you will still have hallucinations

96
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,980
and die.

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:06:02,340
Mr. Liu's

98
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:14,080
That Liu Zhao

99
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
I'm a swordsman.

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,480
I've already helped him to get used to it.

101
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,320
But he doesn't know how grateful I am.

102
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,520
Why don't you want to see me recently?

103
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,360
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,520
The Yihong House is quite famous in the Zhe Dong area.

105
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,280
If it's reasonable,

106
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,760
everyone in Yuezhou knows it.

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,680
It's just a taboo.

108
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

109
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,120
Thank you for your kindness

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,920
and protecting me all year.

111
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,840
But I'm afraid

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,600
I hope you won't come to me often.

113
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,120
You heard that, right?

114
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,840
A'xing gave it to me.

115
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,080
His Majesty granted the 7th Princess

116
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,080
to you.

117
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,560
It's a good match.

118
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,280
I've already got used to it for you.

119
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,680
You're free now.

120
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,920
You can go home with me.

121
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,840
You're better than a concubine here.

122
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,320
You're making decisions for women again.

123
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,880
But I'm doing well now.

124
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,360
I don't want to leave.

125
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,680
You're poisoned with the 5-star poison.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,840
I helped you to cure it.

127
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
You were bullied.

128
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,880
I stood up to help you.

129
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
You're a swordsman.

130
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,680
I helped you to comb your hair.

131
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
Don't you feel grateful for that?

132
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,320
Thank you, General.

133
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,560
But I don't want to leave.

134
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,880
Please leave.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Aren't you afraid of death?

136
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,080
It seems that you will use this kind of trick.

137
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,240
Be gentle, Your Highness.

138
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
Great General Zhu,

139
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,280
you're in LORD Bai brain.

140
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,960
So

141
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,880
What's up?

142
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,320
Drink?

143
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,360
No mood

144
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,920
I thought I would be famous in Yihong House

145
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,600
But no one has ever seen my hard work

146
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,200
I thought someone would be there to help me

147
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,480
But I never have

148
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,880
Zhaodi can always get what I want

149
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,960
It's not fair

150
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,280
Drink with me

151
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,400
I'll tell Zhaodi

152
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,560
Nothing to say

153
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,120
Isn't it sad to be driven away like this?

154
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,280
I thought you were being mean

155
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,720
That's why you said that

156
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,600
You are more like a man

157
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,640
Than Zhaodi

158
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Do you know

159
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,920
Liu Zhaodi still loves that man

160
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,440
He often goes to a temple in the mountains

161
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,480
He once said

162
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,800
You can speak your heart there

163
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,360
You should ask him

164
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,760
That bitch

165
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,480
She is only six inches tall

166
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,080
But she is very soft
