作�works seeded by B derrière

作曲者 音乐 编曲 吉尔唱 ,杨彬一、 ethical pursuing

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,200
Solo

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,940
You went back

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,500
Will he blame you?

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,940
These days he didn't come to me after he went out for a drink

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,640
maybe I'm OK

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You... have you ever thought about leaving him?

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I have, but where can I go?

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What's wrong?

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What's wrong?

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's nothing, just a little cold.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's good that you're fine.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
How about I...

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't say it.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We all have our own fate.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I didn't know then that he said it was because of the cold.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now I feel very guilty.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's you.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In the past few months, Zhao Di has been asking about a man named Siwen.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What else do you know?

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
At that time, the Su family was about to go bankrupt.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And Zhao Di was sold to the Yihong House by Su Heng.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
At the beginning, he was also a dead man.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But after a long time, he knew he couldn't change it.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So he started to accept the arrangement of fate.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's the new dance of the Yihong House.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's so beautiful.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It has a kind of love and hate feeling.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's very interesting.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Miss, can you introduce yourself?

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm the first one.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm the second one.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm the third one.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm the fourth one.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm the fifth one.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm the sixth one.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Miss, can you introduce yourself?

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm the Golden Egg Flower.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm from the Ma family in Jiangnan.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
My family is in Yuezhou.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Maybe he also wanted to die.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But I think he chose to live more than to be a real man.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Isn't it more admirable?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Even if he became the dance of the Yihong House,

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
he would still come to the temple often to bring food to the children.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He seems to have a sun in his heart.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
At that time, didn't you know about this?

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
At that time, I was already a bad person.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That year, I went to Yangzhou with Yuezhou Prefecture.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This song is from the last two years.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You want to escape from him?

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The Su family has power and power.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't want to disturb him.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm afraid I'll hurt him.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What else do you know?

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How is he?

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Later, I heard that he knew a general named Zhao Tianming.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't know much about them.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Then he disappeared.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When I heard about him,

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
you told me that he was dead.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Sir, please enjoy your meal.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We'll eat this too.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What would you like to eat?

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Two bowls of noodles.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
One more fish.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sir, we have to save money for the gold exchange.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I remember that your favorite fish is this one.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When we move out of the city, we rarely eat it.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We've recorded so many times in Yuezhou Prefecture.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's eat it soon.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hua is waiting for us at home.

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But I want to go to the west street.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll buy a dress and some meat.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll cook something delicious for you two.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Is it delicious?

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Is my meat delicious?

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What's wrong with you?

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll eat your meat when you arrive at the underworld.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What's wrong with you?

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That fish is talking.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How could it be?

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's just a normal fish.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It must be Liu Zhaodi.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Tell the people of the city temple to help me.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I've been in the underworld for half a year.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I've been to Liu Zhaodi's house.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Time is running out.

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't go out.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Mom, I'm sleepy.

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hua, be good.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Dad is playing martial arts here.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There are many crows.

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Master, there are so many crows here.

103
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Go forward. Don't look back.

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They are coming.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't be afraid.

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We are all in the same boat.

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We can't fight them.

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hurry up.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
All the people have passed.

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The ghosts are blocking the way.

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Where is the fire horse?

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Hurry up.

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hurry up.

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Who are you?

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Tell me your name.

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Master.

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Liu Zhaodi.

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll kill you if you don't go away.

119
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Stop.

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Go.

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Go forward.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Leave this place.

123
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The crows have been driven away by the fire.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They won't come back.

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

126
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Where is the master?

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Su Lan.

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Where is he?

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Where is my husband?

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Where is he?

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Where is he?

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What is this place?

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The End
