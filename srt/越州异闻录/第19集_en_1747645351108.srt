00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is all.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I understand.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The mark on my hand...

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You said you wanted to kill me.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Right?

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Killing is a life.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I should be caught.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To leave a mark for you.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I wanted to be caught by you.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I know you can break the case.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why?

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Because I'm waiting.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
To say goodbye to you.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
As for those kids,

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I was the one who got them.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was the one who was the culprit.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I hope the government will punish me.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't worry.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll arrange the painting today.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And I'll go to the Zhou family to surrender.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll be back.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Give her a name.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Call her Hua Hua.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How about it?

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hua Hua?

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll call you Hua Hua.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Siwen,

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
do you know?

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My life is dark and dark.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm wavering.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm waiting.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Until you show up in my world.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I hope

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can stay here.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I really thought

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I was going to

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
have a good ending.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Then I realized

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
love

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
is only

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
My inner desire is just the strength of my life.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Siwen, goodbye.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Zhao Di, goodbye.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Siwen

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Si Gong

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Wen Zhao

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Siwen

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now everyone knows that you have infected the Ghost God

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and will die within seven days.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Today you are just fine.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It was you

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
who spread the news of my being infected by the Ghost God

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
to the people of Yuezhou City.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let me tell you, the news I know...

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The mark on the girl's chest was drawn by you.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have been lying.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Maybe it's retribution.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You are not the one who did it.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You are the one who did it.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Listen, Zheng Yunu, my wife, I lied to her.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I didn't tell anyone about this secret.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The restaurant.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Miss.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The restaurant is crowded.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's not the place you should go.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can go wherever I want.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's none of your business.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You are the daughter of Mr. Zheng.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The court said that your father will be promoted next month.

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There are some people in the restaurant who are gambling.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If you go in,

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
what if something happens?

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Go.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You are just bad people.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You are just a temporary employee.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You are just a temporary employee.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You are just a temporary employee.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let her go.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We can't stop her anyway.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Go.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We are waiting for you here.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You think I dare not?

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Go.

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Come on, put the pig down.

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Put the pig down.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Go.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Look.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Open.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Give me five.

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Come on, put the pig down.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Put the pig down.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hurry up.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Put the pig down.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Put the pig down.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The little girl is so beautiful.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's all mine.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's all mine.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Come on, come on.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Go on.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Put the pig down.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Put the pig down.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Big sister.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Put the money on the table.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't let anyone touch the pocket.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hurry up.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You are so annoying.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Put the money on the table.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How dare you?

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How dare you commit a crime in Yuezhou?

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I didn't expect that

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
there is a woman who took the sword

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and gambled on the restaurant.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Who are you?

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Listen up.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I am the daughter of Mr. Zheng.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I advise you to commit a crime.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Otherwise,

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
my father will not let you go.

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I am so embarrassed.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you know that

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
my brother is a fugitive of Yue's family?

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Brother, kill him.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Those bastards are the officers.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Give me a lesson.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Brother, kill him.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You are the one who is to blame

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
for the crime on the way to the hell.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I am sorry.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I am sorry.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I am sorry.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I am sorry.

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I am sorry.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I am sorry.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I am sorry.

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I am sorry.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I am sorry.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I am sorry.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I am sorry.

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I am sorry.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I am sorry.

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I am sorry.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I am sorry.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I am sorry.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I am sorry.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I am sorry.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I am sorry.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I am sorry.

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I am sorry.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I am sorry.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I am sorry.

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I am sorry.

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I am sorry.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I am sorry.

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I am sorry.

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I am sorry.

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I am sorry.
