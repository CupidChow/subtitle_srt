1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,840
1889

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I know.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What else do you know?

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When Sister Zhaodi left,

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I wasn't here yet.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I was seven or eight years younger than her.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So I don't know anything except her name.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You dress up like a Zhou family?

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then why don't you ask the owner of Yihong House?

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He must know everything.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They only know how to shoot a few guns.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They won't tell you anything.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Then I can't live here either.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Excuse me.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Mr. Zhang,

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Xiaoling is not here.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't lie to me.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Xiaoling is definitely in the room.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Xiaoling, I'm coming.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Xiaoling,

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I saw you playing the zither yesterday.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I said I'd come to see you today.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why didn't you come out and beat me?

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mr. Zhang,

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm just a zither player.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't dare to confess.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I take it as a joke.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yihong House

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
is said to be a school's shrine.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It was founded by the Ministry of Education.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But what's the difference between you and the brothel?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm the fourth rank.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I think you're lucky.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mr. Zhang, I beg you.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let me kiss you.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're attacking the court official.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is a death sentence.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
When he wakes up, tell him

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that it was Zhao Tianming

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
who attacked the Military Commissioner of the East Army.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He will leave by himself and won't ask.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why?

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The Ministry of War is on a business trip here.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He doesn't dare to offend the Military Commissioner.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He won't ask.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you for saving me.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's okay.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're a good person.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You live in Zhao Di's room.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You see many of his things.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You know a lot about him.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He's a fierce woman.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I admire him.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I know a little about him.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What do you want to ask?

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I want to know about him and Zhao Tianming.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I heard...

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
At that time,

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
General Zhao often went to see Liu Zhaodi.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He didn't do anything.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He just watched him quietly.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He didn't even drink tea.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He just sat there.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Isn't it boring?

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you feel uncomfortable,

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
just pretend I don't exist.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're kidding.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're a living person.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How can you pretend you don't exist?

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm a deputy commander of the East Army.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:15,680
I may be a

74
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
I'm just a concubine in the Yihong House.

75
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
I don't know music.

76
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
I don't know how to play the instrument.

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
I only know how to play the flute in front of men.

78
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
I can play the flute with my bare hands.

79
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Why bother to think about it?

80
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Why bother to think about it?

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
What tea is this?

82
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
It's a snake.

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Yesterday, the East Army was in the dark.

84
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
My best friend died.

85
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
He likes snakes.

86
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
So,

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
it's this taste.

88
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Thank you.

89
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Thank you.

90
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
This is the medicine I asked for from the doctor.

91
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
I drink it every day.

92
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
The poison will be cured in one or two months.

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
The relationship between two people lasted for a year.

94
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Until one day.

95
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Until one day.

96
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Until one day.

97
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Great.

98
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Great.

99
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Great.

100
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Great.

101
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
We are here to listen to music.

102
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Great.

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Great.

104
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
General Zhaozhou, this way please.

105
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Come.

106
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
What's the name of this girl?

107
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Liu Zhaodi, a dancer.

108
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Let her come here.

109
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Dance for me.

110
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Go.

111
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Great.

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
Zhaodi, the general wants you to dance for him.

113
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
You said I was a little cold.

114
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
OK.

115
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
He said he was a little cold today.

116
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
He was afraid to infect the guests.

117
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Great.

118
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
He looks down on me.

119
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
General Zhaozhou, you are a distinguished guest.

120
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
The people of the Zhou family are waiting for you.

121
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Don't let him wait too long.

122
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Go.

123
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
This way please.

124
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Boss, two bowls of cherry juice.

125
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
OK.

126
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Sit down.

127
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Zhaodi, the cherry juice here is very delicious.

128
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
You must try it.

129
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Sir.

130
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Please enjoy.

131
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
There is really cherry inside.

132
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
You...

133
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
It's delicious.

134
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Thank you, A'xian.

135
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
You are welcome.

136
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Thank you, A'xian.

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
You are welcome.

138
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
We are good sisters.

139
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,680
We are like two free people now.

140
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Zhaodi, you are really beautiful.

141
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
A'xian, you are also beautiful.

142
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Zhaodi,

143
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
you should go dance for those nobles.

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
By then,

145
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
there must be many princes

146
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
who will fall in love with you and be jealous of you.

147
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
A day is a short period of time.

148
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
You can never get rid of the prejudice of others.

149
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
A'xian.

150
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
A'xian, I am not talking about you.

151
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
I mean

152
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
your dream will come true.

153
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Really?

154
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Of course.

155
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
You are different.

156
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
I am the best at playing pipa in the red building.

157
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
I think one day,

158
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
I will be able to fill the whole Yuezhou.

159
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
By then, there must be many royal families

160
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
who will come to me.

161
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
By the way, Zhaodi,

162
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
I saw a man asking about you yesterday.

163
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
He seems to be a bad person.

164
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
I am going to be a bad person.

165
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
I may die at any time.

166
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
I have no official position.

167
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
What is your name?

168
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
I don't know.

169
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
What?

170
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
You know him?

171
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Maybe he is an old friend.

172
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Maybe

173
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
it's just a coincidence.

174
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
You bitch!

175
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Why did you offend General Zanzhuo?

176
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Master Zhu,

177
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
the one in charge of the red building is a musician and dancer.

178
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
But he didn't say he was a prostitute.

179
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
In my opinion,

180
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
it's nothing special.

181
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
That's the biggest scandal

182
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
in our country.

183
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
It's hard to say.

184
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Sometimes, it may not be a good thing.

185
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
What are you doing?

186
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
Greetings, General Zanzhuo.

187
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Get lost!

188
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Bitch, you lied to me.

189
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Bitch,

190
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
tonight,

191
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
I will make you happy.

192
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
I will make you live.

193
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,680
Master Zhu,

194
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,680
I have to go.

195
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Please, General.

196
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
General Zanzhuo,

197
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
we need to talk.

198
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Don't block the way.

199
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Are you okay?

200
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
I'm fine.

201
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Greetings, General Zhao.

202
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Zhu Cheng.

203
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
Yes, yes, yes.

204
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
I often come to see this woman.

205
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
You know that.

206
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
General Zhao,

207
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
she is a bitch.

208
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
General Zanzhuo asked her to accompany him tonight.

209
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
It's a little difficult to do.

210
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
How about...

211
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Xin,

212
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
you should accompany General Zhao

213
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
to play your pipa.

214
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
Go away.

215
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Yes.

216
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
Go away.

217
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Stay away from me.

218
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
I may hurt you.

219
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Tonight, I will get this woman.

220
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Don't fight with me.

221
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Try it.

222
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Zhao Di.

223
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Go.

224
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Go.

225
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Master Jing, go.

226
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,680
Are you okay?

227
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
General Zhao, I...

228
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
I'm fine.

229
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
I appreciate your kindness.

230
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
I hope you don't think

231
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
I'm just a joke.

232
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Remember my words.

233
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Other men come here

234
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,680
just for fun.

235
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
And I, Zhao Tianming,

236
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
am serious about you.

237
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Thank you.

238
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
See you.

239
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Thank you.

240
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,680
Thank you.

241
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,680
The End
