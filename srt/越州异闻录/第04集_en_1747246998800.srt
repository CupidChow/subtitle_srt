00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:58,040
çš†

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
Ah!

3
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,200
Ah!

4
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,400
Ah!

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,600
Ah!

6
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Ah!

7
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,600
Master.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,800
Master.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,800
Master.

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
Master, wake up.

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,600
He is dead.

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Amitabha.

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
Master, wake up.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,400
What kind of murder is this?

15
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,400
Master.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Is there really a ghost in this world?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,400
Because of the new murder case,

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,800
I went back to Yuezhou Prefecture last night

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
and reported the situation of Shanyin County.

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
This is the reply I received this morning.

21
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
I was in a hurry to go back.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,000
I sent it to you.

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
I took you back to get the body.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,400
You don't have to worry about the rest.

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,400
Master Pei said that the Taoist Feng who was killed

26
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
for Yuwen Xian was found in Zhou Prefecture yesterday.

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,200
It was the Taoist who deceived Liu Qingsong

28
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
to bury his daughter at the age of seven.

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
It seems that Taoist Feng's death was not an accident.

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
This is getting more and more obvious.

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
What's that sound?

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,400
What's wrong?

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,800
Listen.

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,400
Why do crows appear every time?

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,200
Why do crows appear every time?

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Could it be that he's here?

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
Who? Who's here?

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Master.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Master.

40
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Master.

41
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Master.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Master.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Master, what's going on?

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
Master, help me.

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Help me.

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Help me.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
What's wrong with you?

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you okay?

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
It's so painful.

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll tell Master Pei when I get back.

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
I won't play the zither anymore.

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,600
Cut the crap. Come and help me.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,200
Come on. Slow down.

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
It's good that you're okay.

55
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
What are you looking at?

56
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,800
It's not far from the Drugstore.

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
The Drugstore?

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Is it the Drugstore that I asked Zhaodi to help me

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,200
with the prescription many years ago?

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,200
Let's go and have a look.

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,400
Let's go.

62
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's go.

63
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Is anyone here?

64
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
There's someone else here.

65
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
The drugstore

66
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,000
was opened more than ten years ago.

67
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
Now it's closed.

68
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
I have to ask him for advice.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,200
It's a secret prescription.

70
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,000
Why did you call me Zhaodi?

71
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,000
I wanted to call my family a little brother.

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
Master, come and have a look.

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,800
Tang Lao has passed away.

74
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
Who lives here?

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Master is not home.

76
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,800
It's not good for us to touch other people's things.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm thirsty. I'll have some water.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
I'll just come back and give him money.

79
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,800
Tang Lao is a weirdo.

80
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,800
He doesn't value money.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,600
Master, do you know him?

82
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,200
Yes.

83
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
Zhaodi and I have been here.

84
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
The flowers bloomed just right.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,800
Siwen.

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,400
Tomorrow is my birthday.

87
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,400
How about you spend it with me?

88
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,600
Okay.

89
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,200
Excuse me. Excuse me.

90
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Excuse me.

91
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Siwen.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm here.

93
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,400
Slow down.

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Give me your hand.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,600
Why are you here so early?

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,400
I want to see you earlier.

97
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
You are really not simple.

98
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:39,980
You are a

99
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,980
ladyboy.

100
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,180
Let's go and watch the opera.

101
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,380
Or there's no seat left.

102
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,780
It's so late.

103
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,180
Your parents won't blame you, right?

104
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,780
Our nobleman told them.

105
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,780
Such a difficulty.

106
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,180
Add more!

107
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,980
Someone here can continue to perform opera.

108
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,780
You dunno that?

109
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,780
This is the old man with a child, right?

110
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,220
I'm happy to invite the next troupe.

111
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,940
Sing for three days in a row.

112
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,380
There's such a tradition?

113
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,380
When I was born,

114
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,700
I heard that I didn't even have a red egg.

115
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,860
It seems that I was born with a daughter.

116
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,820
I have no face to say it at home.

117
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,100
This idea is really stupid.

118
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,260
By the way,

119
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
what do you think I brought?

120
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,540
Yellow wine?

121
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,860
I've been drinking yellow wine for 20 years.

122
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,740
How did you get the money?

123
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,420
I exchanged it for two wolf-hawks.

124
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,740
Then for your two wolf-hawks...

125
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,340
Cheers!

126
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,140
Drink!

127
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,780
Lower your voice.

128
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,340
Drink!

129
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,740
Stop!

130
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,940
You are a man of the wild,

131
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,660
and you ruin the reputation of the Liu family.

132
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,580
Your father has no time to care about you.

133
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,300
You must care about him as a mother.

134
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,140
Isn't it a good thing

135
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,660
to let me get married early?

136
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,260
When did the Liu family let you make the decision?

137
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,700
You are from the Liu family.

138
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,980
Who will you marry?

139
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,380
The Liu family will decide.

140
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,260
So am I just a product of the Liu family?

141
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,580
How dare you talk back?

142
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,900
This is the daughter you taught.

143
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,300
Everything is better than you.

144
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,740
You are still stubborn.

145
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,820
Continue to fight!

146
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,740
Brother Zhao.

147
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,140
Brother Zhao, just give me a word.

148
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,100
Just say that you will not contact that man again.

149
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,860
Otherwise, your father will not let you go.

150
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,700
I won't let you go!

151
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,900
You...

152
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
Raise your head.

153
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,780
You can just scare him.

154
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,180
Are you really going to kill him?

155
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,260
If you don't know how to teach,

156
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,140
get out of here!

157
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,740
Raise your head.

158
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,740
Kill me?

159
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,540
I'll kill you!

160
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,540
Zhao Ti!

161
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,380
You are not obedient.

162
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,260
I'll kill you!

163
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,220
Weihai Temple

164
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,900
Zhao Ti.

165
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,020
Zhao Ti.

166
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,260
What's wrong with your face?

167
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,260
You shouldn't have come.

168
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,260
Go back.

169
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,260
I came to give you a birthday gift.

170
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
I didn't have the time to give it to you last time.

171
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Your birthday gift.

172
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,260
I'm going to find your parents.

173
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,260
I don't believe they won't be reasonable.

174
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,260
It's no use.

175
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,260
Unless you take me away.

176
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,260
Take you away?

177
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
If they report me,

178
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,260
I will be sentenced to life imprisonment.

179
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,260
I will be in prison for a lifetime.

180
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,260
A lifetime?

181
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,260
I was just kidding.

182
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,260
You are going to take the exam for the civil service.

183
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,260
I was kidding.

184
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Zhaodi was brought back to the mountain.

185
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,260
I will stay in Yuezhou for the exam.

186
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
I wanted to take a post of a doctor.

187
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,260
I will go back to find him.

188
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Who are you?

189
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Miss, our carriage is broken nearby.

190
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,260
He knows the previous owner, Tang Yaoshi.

191
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,260
So...

192
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Hello, my name is A Xian.

193
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,260
Sit down.

194
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Miss A Xian,

195
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
I am Lu Wenzhao, the director of Yuezhou.

196
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,260
This is Siwen, the young master of Yuezhou.

197
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,260
This is the family member of our case.

198
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,260
Is this Liu Zhaodi's mother?

199
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,260
I heard about Yuezhou.

200
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,260
You don't have to be surprised.

201
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,260
I met Zhaodi in Yihonglou.

202
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,260
We are friends.

203
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,260
He danced and I played pipa.

204
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,260
No wonder.

205
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,260
I had a play before.

206
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,260
Zhaodi asked me to find Tang Yaoshi to fix it.

207
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,260
I came here many times.

208
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,260
I also recognized Tang Yaoshi as my master.

209
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,260
After my master died,

210
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,260
I stayed here and learned some medicine.

211
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Can you tell us about Zhaodi?

212
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
Yes.

213
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,260
I don't know much about him.

214
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,260
I just met him in Yihonglou.

215
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,260
He is a good man.

216
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
He played pipa?

217
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,260
Nothing special.

218
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,260
Thank you for finding us a good horse.

219
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,260
Thank you for your help.

220
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,260
I hope you can solve the case soon.

221
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
Miss A Xian, see you later.

222
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,260
See you later.

223
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,260
Hurry up.

224
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,260
It's better to see you later.

225
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,260
Zhaodi

226
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Zhaodi
