1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,640
I don't understand how you made it.

2
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,320
Episode 28

3
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
This clue

4
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Liu Zhaoji married a rich man many years ago

5
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Su Heng

6
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
Contact the government of Yuezhou

7
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
Contact the government of Yuezhou

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
and the government of Dao

9
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,640
and find Su Heng

10
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Yes

11
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Huan

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Come in and eat

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Let's eat

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Mom

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
Let's go

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Let's eat

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Huan, eat more

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Come

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
How many days are left in the family?

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,640
About three or four days

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
I know

22
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Let's eat first

23
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Who?

24
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
Who?

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Is it Su Heng's family?

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
What are you looking for me for?

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
We are new neighbors

28
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Tonight

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
I want to ask you to sing a play

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
Black umbrella in the daytime

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,640
You are a ghost

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
I am a ghost

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
I am a ghost

34
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
I am a ghost

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
I am a ghost

36
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
I am a ghost

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
I am a ghost

38
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
I am a ghost

39
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,640
You said you would sing at night

40
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
That's a ghost play

41
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
You don't sing

42
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
To be honest

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,640
We moved into this village two days ago

44
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
After moving in

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
My son always thinks

46
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
What is on his body

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
There is no wind and water in the village

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
I happen to hear that

49
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
You sang at the temple

50
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Five voices of the temple

51
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,640
I want you to sing

52
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
To push the ghost

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Since the late emperor

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
There is this custom

55
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
To sing at the temple

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
To drive the ghost

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
But the cost

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
But I am afraid of the dark

59
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
How about

60
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
You invite your son

61
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
To this yard

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
We sing here

63
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
OK

64
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
As you wish

65
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
After dark

66
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
I will bring my son here

67
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Husband

68
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Come back and eat

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Don't you say something

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Do you have any food

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Yes

72
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Yes

73
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Xiao Cui

74
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Go to the kitchen and bring the food

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Yes

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Eat slowly

77
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
I have to work on the case

78
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
You have to eat well

79
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
I asked Xiao Cui to make you a fish

80
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
I'll go and see

81
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
OK

82
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Is that gold real?

83
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,640
I used to deal with gold

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
I won't admit my mistakes

85
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
I don't know

86
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
I don't know

87
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
I don't know

88
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
I don't know

89
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
I don't know

90
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
I don't know

91
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
I don't know

92
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
I don't know

93
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
I don't know

94
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
I don't know

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Su Lang

96
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Every time you wear this suit

97
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
I remember

98
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
That day was possessed by the hooligan

99
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Just

100
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
You sang a temple meeting

101
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Pass through the half-price palace

102
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
The past that drove them away

103
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
I didn't mean to do that

104
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
But I always feel

105
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
Guansheng people are righteous

106
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
What's that sound?

107
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Go and see

108
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
What is it?

109
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
A crow

110
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Died by a bump on the window

111
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Disgusting

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Throw it away

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Throw it away

114
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Go to hell

115
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Go to hell

116
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Su Lang

117
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
Go tell the three of them

118
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
To sing in the yard

119
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
To play the role

120
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Okay

121
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Wait

122
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Don't tell them about the gold

123
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
If they ask

124
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
One person only gives fifty

125
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Okay

126
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
According to the guard's observation

127
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Su Heng should be in front

128
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Go ahead and see if there are any houses

129
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Yes

130
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
I didn't expect

131
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
The family of the merchant Su

132
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,640
It's a ghost place

133
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Thirty years of the He Dong and He Xi

134
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
It's all like this

135
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I don't know

136
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Su Heng

137
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Su Heng

138
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Su Heng

139
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
It's all like this

140
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Si Gong

141
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
You and that Su Heng

142
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Old love

143
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
You won't do it later

144
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
I see I'll touch you first

145
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm relieved if you don't do it

146
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
There is a house ahead

147
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Someone lives

148
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Go

149
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Third and fourth

150
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
Sister Su Heng

151
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
What wind blew you here

152
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Third

153
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
You call the fourth

154
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Come to my house in half an hour

155
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Sing for five saints

156
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
One person fifty dollars

157
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Okay

158
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Okay, let's keep it here

159
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Row

160
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Huan Er

161
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
Why are you out

162
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Your father made money

163
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
We two have food to eat

164
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Come over

165
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
You two are visiting late at night

166
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
What is your feeling

167
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
We are looking for Su Heng

168
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
I am

169
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
We are from the head of the Yue Zhou

170
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
I ask you

171
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Has anything strange happened recently

172
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
For example

173
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Crow

174
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Strange dream

175
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Weird people in wedding clothes

176
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
Second Su Lang

177
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Second Su Lang

178
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Where is Huan Er

179
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Huan Er is sleeping in the room

180
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
What's wrong with you

181
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Two adults

182
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Just now was the inside

183
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
Please forgive

184
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
We are on duty in the Zhou family

185
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
What happened

186
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
What's wrong with you

187
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
You talk

188
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
I'm back on the road

189
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
I seem to have a ghost

190
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
What are you talking about

191
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Two adults came in

192
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
The sword is crazy

193
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
No need to care

194
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Su Heng

195
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Liu Zhao Di is dead

196
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
We came because of his life

197
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Liu Zhao Di

198
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
I don't know this person

199
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
He was your wife

200
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
