00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:59,160
countless andereacks

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,480
You're writing nonsense.

4
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't call me sister.

5
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,120
I'm not his wife.

6
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,760
The Liu family only has Xuer now.

7
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,520
For the sake of Xuer,

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,680
you should help Master.

9
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,440
Look at his fate.

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,760
Minister,

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,920
why don't you eat the duck from Shanyin County?

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,160
You're so stubborn.

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,920
Then I'll eat it.

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,880
Eat.

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,160
This is the Liu family.

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,000
Master Liu and his concubine

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,160
should still live here.

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,520
As for Mrs. Liu,

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,880
she was a Buddhist many years ago.

20
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,480
She went to the Beishan Temple for practice.

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,960
Listen.

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,880
There seems to be a monk's voice inside.

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,240
Minister,

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,560
you know me.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,520
I get dizzy whenever I enter the temple.

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,400
How about this?

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,320
You go in.

28
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,640
I'll help you with the wind.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,240
What wind?

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,760
Let's go.

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,360
Thousands of years have passed.

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,920
I have the hell or the hell.

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,480
I have the woman.

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,840
What happened here?

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,360
I'll go ask.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,320
Madam,

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,720
what's wrong?

38
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,880
I heard Master Liu was poisoned.

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,200
He saw his late mother, Bai Yingshou,

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,320
and said she would come again.

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
I can only ask the Beishan Temple's priest

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,560
to calm him down.

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
We're from Yuezhou Prefecture.

44
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,720
Your daughter Liu Zhaodi

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,000
is dead.

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,200
Poor child.

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,320
It's because she became your child

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,680
that she's pitiful.

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,080
I think I know you.

50
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,640
You...

51
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,280
You're Zhaodi's friend.

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,160
I hate people like you

53
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
who pretend to know you

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,320
when they see you.

55
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,520
I didn't expect you to remember me.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,640
It's me.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,160
After I met Liu Zhaodi that year,

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,920
I saw the fear of the Liu family.

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
The Liu family

60
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,720
You look comfortable.

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,200
Why are you sitting here?

62
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,840
Later,

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,880
I always dreamed of this.

64
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,760
I dreamed of seeing her for the first time.

65
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,960
I'm from Muzhou.

66
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,480
I'm going to Yuezhou to take the exam.

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,760
I happened to pass by.

68
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,920
I was tired and rested here for a while.

69
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
I just ran into the rain.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,760
Muzhou?

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,800
Do you want to hear what you're talking about?

72
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,520
If you walk from there to Yuezhou,

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,280
you may not be able to walk for ten days or half a month.

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
I can walk.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
But I'm afraid I can't.

76
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm afraid I can't.

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
I'm afraid I can't.

78
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
I'm afraid I can't.

79
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm afraid I can't.

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
I'm afraid I can't.

81
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
I'm afraid I can't.

82
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm afraid I can't.

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
I'm afraid I can't.

84
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm afraid I can't.

85
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,560
So cute.

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,160
You went to the exam and you're still wearing a cat.

87
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
I just got it.

88
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,360
This cat walked under the bridge.

89
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
It fell down by accident.

90
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
I caught it.

91
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,240
You're kind.

92
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Come with me to a place.

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,880
Passerby.

94
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Coming.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Where are you going?

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
I won't tell you.

97
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Are you hungry?

98
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,040
Eat less. It's okay.

99
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Why is there a Buddha in the water?

100
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,280
It is said that the previous dynasty had a master who was willing to give up his life for the sake of his son.

101
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,480
But he failed.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,200
He killed his son and his wife and his grandson.

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,800
He has 37 merits.

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
My name is Siwen.

105
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
What about you?

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Liu Zhaodi.

107
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
He's already dead before he was born.

108
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,200
I don't know if it's his life or not.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
This used to be a Taoist temple.

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Now it has become a paradise outside the city of Taoism.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Come on.

112
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Come on.

113
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Zhaodi.

114
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,600
I brought you your favorite Yuezhou ten bowls of rice.

115
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,000
And your favorite yellow wine.

116
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll give you a drink first.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I hope I can live in a place where there is a mountain and a river.

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And live here for a long time.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why did you call yourself Zhaodi?

120
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,520
It means to have a brother in the family.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The name doesn't matter.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What matters is to live out yourself.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Everyone is unique.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You are the only one.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You are the only one.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You are the only one.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are the only one.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You are the only one.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You are the only one.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's time for me to go.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So you two don't know each other.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But you two are good friends.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No wonder you want to investigate this case.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's go.

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Shizhu.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
All of these are fake.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
True or false.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
True or false.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's true.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
False is true.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
False is true.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
True is false.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Master, what if they come to me again?

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't mind them. They won't see you.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Remember, you can't erase any of the spell on your body.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Master.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Master, can we really get rid of the evil?

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The devil is evil.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If he can hold on to his heart, he can get through this.

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Master.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The master means that there is no ghost in this world.

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's all fake.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But the fake one can affect people's hearts.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right?

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Amitabha.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There will be ten thousand opinions for ten thousand people.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Master, you can rest in the east room tonight.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you.

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Please.

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It doesn't seem that simple.

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Master, will you go back to Yuezhou after that day?

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll stay with Master Tang for a few days.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You just can't bear to leave.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Master, then you two will...

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Will you get along with each other?

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't ask if you shouldn't.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Go to sleep.

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's boring.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Master.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Father.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Father.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Father.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I found you, little bastard.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Little bastard, what are you doing here?

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Father, I really have nothing to do with my father.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You are no longer a member of the Liu family.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Speak.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why are you back?

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Father, have you really never loved your daughter?

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You were sold to the kiln by your ex-husband.

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you think I don't know?

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You have embarrassed yourself.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Get out of here.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You...

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Stop.

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Stop.

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Liu Zhaodi, you are acting like a ghost.

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
These demons can't see me.
