1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
key..

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
..

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
rest..

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I have nothing to do with him.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He has hidden so many things.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You have seen him?

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
On the way back to Yue City two days ago.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A few years ago, he was kicked out by Yihong Luo.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then he disappeared.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ah Xian, Zhao Tianming.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They are not that simple.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Is there anything else I don't know?

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
General Zhao often took Zhao Di out to play.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He bought him clothes and jewelry.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then one day, they suddenly stopped contacting each other.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Zhao Di disappeared at that time.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Something important must have happened during that time.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Maybe this is the key to the case.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Zhao Shi is going to wake up.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I have to tell you everything.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You should go.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you for telling me so much.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Zhao Di.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I met a bad guy a few days ago.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He asked me to come to him.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I thought it was you.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I went back to East Capital.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I heard that the Su family was bankrupt.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So I started to look for you immediately.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's why I was sold to Yihong Luo by Su Heng.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I was so happy.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I was so happy.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I was so happy.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was so happy.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's why I was sold to Yihong Luo by Su Heng.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But it's good now.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Come with me.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Siwen.

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You don't want to go with me.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Siwen.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Actually, you are impulsive now.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
When I leave here, you will regret it soon.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Where can you go when a woman from Yihong Luo runs away?

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can't live in the capital.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't remember the house.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We will go to Yichou and Lingnan.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If we don't go, we will go to Nanzhao.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But you said that we can't support ourselves.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We can do a small business.

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We can support ourselves by selling wood, cattle, sheep, men and women.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If I put these words a few years ago, I will go with you.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Sorry.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm late.

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's my fault.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I made you wait for five years.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Give me another chance.

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Where's your friend?

60
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Go to my buddy, send him the horse.

61
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And we meet the money.

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Come on.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How are you?

64
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Come on.

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How much?

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We'll leave the city before the curfew.

67
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
When the curfew is announced tomorrow,

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
we'll be 100 miles away.

69
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Do you know?

70
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I've been waiting for this moment for five years.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We're almost there.

72
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is my friend's house.

74
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll go borrow the horse.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Wait for me.

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Wait for me.

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're so mean.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You don't even want your life.

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Master Zhu,

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
why are you here?

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Zhaodi,

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
if you leave like this,

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
it'll be hard for me to find General Zhao.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm begging you, Zhu Chen.

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Please let me go.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm begging you.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You've always been so kind.

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Liu Zhaodi, who's so stubborn,

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
is begging for help.

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's a pity.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's going to die.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let him go.

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll go with you.

97
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let him go?

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Give me a reason.

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This...

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This...

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll pretend I don't know what happened tonight.

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But I want to see you in Yihong House

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
within a week.

105
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll go.

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll go.

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll go.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll go.

110
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll go.

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll go.

112
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Zhaodi.

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Zhaodi.

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The horse is here.

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can go now.

116
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What's wrong?

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Siwen,

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't want to go with you.

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What are you talking about?

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I didn't tell you just now.

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
A general is going to help me.

122
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm free,

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and I'm rich.

124
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm in your support.

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're lying to me.

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're lying to me.

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm not lying to you.

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I just wanted to see

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
if you, who has always been so weak,

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
would really take me away.

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I didn't expect

132
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you would really take me away.

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're so naive.

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's true, right?

135
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Zhaodi.

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm very satisfied with this play.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's stop here.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Zhaodi.

139
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Are you okay?

140
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm rich and famous.

141
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Why...

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why isn't it me?

143
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm rich.

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
From that moment,

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I decided

146
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
to be a noble man.

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I must be a good man.

148
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Fang, let's go.

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Or we'll be in trouble.

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We'll be home soon.

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Fang, no.

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
My stomach...

153
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Stomachache?

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What's wrong?

155
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why is your stomach aching now?

156
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm going to give birth.

157
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What should we do?

158
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm going to give birth.

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hold on.

161
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'll go and beg the lord.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Lord, please help me.

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Save my wife.

164
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Please.

165
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Please, lord.

166
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
My stomach hurts.

167
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Lord, please save my wife.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Save my wife, lord.

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Wait.

170
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll go and tell the general

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
if he's willing to help you.

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Thank you, lord.

173
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you, lord.

174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It hurts.

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
My wife.

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Hold on.

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll go and beg the lord.

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Wait.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hurry.

180
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why do you have a strange smell?

181
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I can't hold on.

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's like the smell of an animal.

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Lord,

184
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I bought a chicken today.

185
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You mean this?

186
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's like the smell of an animal.

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's like the smell of an animal.

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's like the smell of an animal.

189
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's really a little smelly.

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
All right.

191
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You stay here.

192
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't go anywhere.

193
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
All right, lord.

194
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
My wife, hold on.

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
My wife.

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Hold on.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
General Zhao.

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes.

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
A team of people

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
came to the gate of the camp

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
to deliver the food to us.

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
My wife is looking for help.

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
General Zhao, please decide.

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Just drive them away.

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

206
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Come back.

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Come back.

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The Heavenly Empress calls us to love the people like her own children.

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's a matter of life and death.

210
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We can't just leave it alone.

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Baoxiang,

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
don't worry.

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Our old military doctors

214
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
are very skilled in medicine.

215
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you, General Zhao.

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a good thing I met you.

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Otherwise, where would I find a doctor at this time of night?

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't worry.

219
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
After your wife and son get through the difficulties,

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you can talk to the people of Yuezhou

221
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
about this matter tomorrow.

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And let everyone know about this good deed.

223
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Our Zhendong Army is not too busy.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Of course.

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Definitely.

226
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Come on.

227
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Congratulations.

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You're a boy.

229
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Thank you.

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Honey, are you okay?

231
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're a boy.

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
General, they are safe.

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You should go back and rest.

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay.

235
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes.

236
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Thank you.

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Honey, what's wrong?

238
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Honey, what's wrong?

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Junyi,

240
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
why is this?

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's possible that it's twins.

242
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No, this...

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No, this...

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's really twins.

245
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Congratulations, General.

246
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You saved three lives again.

247
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
There will be another good story in Yuezhou tomorrow.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No.

249
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It can't be three twins, right?

250
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Honey, hold on.

251
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Hold on to me.

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The sixth one.

255
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The sixth one.

256
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
How can a normal person have six children?

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's impossible.

258
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
General, maybe they are not human at all.

259
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The seventh one.

260
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000

The ninth one.

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
