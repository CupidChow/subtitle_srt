Episode 15

3
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Did you hear the woman crying?

4
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,700
Don't talk nonsense.

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,300
Let me tell you.

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,800
There's nothing.

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,300
Listen to me.

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,400
Take everything you see outside.

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,100
Then burn it with fire.

10
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,200
Okay.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,400
I'll do it.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,900
That's a success.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,400
Okay.

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Let's go.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Let's go.

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,900
Yuwen Xian.

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,900
You... You're not moving.

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,900
Go.

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,900
Go.

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,900
Go.

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
Who's after me?

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Help me.

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
Who's after me?

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Help me.

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
Help me.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,200
Pull him up.

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Who's after me?

28
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,200
Who's after my leg?

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,200
Hurry up.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Help me.

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Are you going to send me away?

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
I'm actually a family priest.

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
In the city of Yuezhou,

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
how dare those refugees in the west

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
do such a cruel thing?

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
We should protect the crime scene.

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I was careless.

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
I tried my best to get him.

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
If you can't get rid of the ghost,

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,200
then you'll have to trouble us.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Yes.

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
It's hard to get rid of the ghost.

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
If you pretend to be a ghost,

44
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
then run away.

45
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
You're so rude.

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Leave now.

47
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
This...

48
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Look.

49
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Amazing.

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Amazing.

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
How much?

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
That's a lot of power.

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Yes.

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Amazing.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
I didn't expect that my master's blood is quite useful.

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
No.

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,200
You all have to die.

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Hurry up.

59
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
If it's just a door,

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I won't go in.

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Hurry up.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Master,

63
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
that Taoist priest is dead.

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
This is the master's house.

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
It's dangerous.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
The source of the source is found.

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
The source of the source is found.

68
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
The source of the source is found.

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
What does it mean?

70
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Go to the mountain.

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
There's a place to investigate him.

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Wait for me.

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Wait for me.

74
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Wait for me.

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Master,

76
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Master,

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
the mountain is in the area of Yuezhou,

78
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
but the duck is unique.

79
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
When we get there,

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
I'll go to the old man's house and get you some.

81
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
I've eaten it.

82
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
When did you go?

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Then you have to try this.

84
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
If the rumor is true,

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
then today is the third day.

86
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
If you go to the ancestral temple,

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
you will die within seven days.

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
You must have never tried it.

89
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
You're so elegant.

90
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
You even have a swimming pool.

91
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Did you fall into the water?

92
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Master,

93
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Master.

94
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
You're finally awake.

95
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
You've been sleeping for hours.

96
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
How do you feel?

97
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Do you feel better?

98
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
What happened?

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
You fell into the water.

100
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
I don't know swimming.

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
I had to call someone to save you.

102
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
It was the new governor who passed by.

103
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
He saved you.

104
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
How far is it from the mountain?

105
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Not far.

106
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
There's a five or six miles.

107
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I just heard from Lu Shi about the case.

108
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Liu Zhaodi grew up here.

109
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
You know him?

110
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I've been working in the Yamen for many years.

111
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I've been through a lot.

112
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,200
He's a poor child.

113
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,200
The Liu family in Shanying County is a big business.

114
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
But their family is very hard to deal with.

115
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Liu Zhaodi was never valued by his family since he was a child.

116
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
When Liu Zhaodi was seven years old,

117
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
his brother fell into the water and died.

118
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
You still have the nerve to come?

119
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Who told you to take him to the water?

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Why didn't you drown?

121
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Let his sister see the death.

122
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
My sister said she would be with you forever.

124
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
But she can't be with you.

125
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
What's wrong?

126
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Is my son alive?

127
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Take a look.

128
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Hurry up.

129
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Mr. Liu,

130
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
his son is not breathing.

131
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
We can't explain what happened just now.

132
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
How about asking a Taoist to take a look?

133
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Zhaodi,

134
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,200
why did you say you would be with him forever?

135
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
How can you let him leave?

136
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
You stupid thing.

137
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
You stupid thing.

138
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
I'll beat you to death today.

139
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
I'll beat you to death.

140
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
How much hope does this family have?

141
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
You're the one who died.

142
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I'll beat you to death.

143
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Not my son.

144
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
I'll beat you to death.

145
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
So,

146
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
all the scars

147
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
were found on Liu Zhaodi.

148
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
As the saying goes,

149
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
the person who died just now

150
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
may have a congenital concussion,

151
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
but his nerves

152
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
will react to the stimulation of the body.

153
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
According to what you said,

154
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
they want Liu Zhaodi

155
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
to die with him.

156
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Later,

157
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Zhaodi, are you hungry?

158
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Come on, eat some fruit.

159
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Master.

160
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Master Feng,

161
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Liu family

162
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
must want a son.

163
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
As I said,

164
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
your dead child's soul

165
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
can be at peace.

166
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
And,

167
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
your family will have a son.

168
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Forget about the soft heart.

169
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
But,

170
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
you have to be strong.

171
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
You have to be strong.

172
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
You have to be strong.

173
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Of course.

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
But,

175
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
you have to pay the money.

176
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
If you want to blame me,

177
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
blame yourself for killing my son.

178
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Didn't you say

179
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
you would stay with your brother forever?

180
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Then I'll help you.

181
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Father.

182
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
At that moment,

183
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
that man was not a father anymore,

184
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
but a puppet beast.

185
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Let me out.

186
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Let me out.

187
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Let me out.

188
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
I want to go out.

189
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Sirs,

190
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
you can't do that.

191
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Stop.

192
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
You can't break the coffin.

193
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Take the rabbit out.

194
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Take the rabbit out.

195
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Come on.

196
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Come on.

197
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Come on.

198
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Come on.

199
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Come on.

200
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Come on.

201
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Come on.

202
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Come on.

203
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Come on.

204
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Come on.

205
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Come on.

206
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Be careful.

207
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
That night,

208
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I was lucky to arrive in time

209
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
and saved Liu Zhaodi.

210
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Don't move.

211
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
But that liar Feng Daocheng

212
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
was let him escape.

213
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
It's really unfortunate

214
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
to have such a child.

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
You scumbag.

216
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
What happened after that?

217
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Later,

218
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
the county magistrate warned the Liu family.

219
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Although Liu Zhaodi is no longer in danger of life,

220
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
he still got the same treatment.

221
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Where is the Liu family now?

222
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
It's still in the old place.

223
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
But it was in the past few years.

224
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
It's already in a bad shape.

225
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Let's go.

226
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Sir,

227
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
it's getting dark now.

228
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
You also caught a cold.

229
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Let's go tomorrow.

230
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Let's go tonight.

231
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Somebody.

232
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Somebody.

233
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Somebody.

234
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Somebody.

235
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Sir,

236
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
keep your voice down.

237
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Xuan'er is asleep.

238
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Besides,

239
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
our servant

240
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
asked you to pick me up.

241
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
You are like a dead man

242
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
with a white cloth.

243
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
You should have kept it up.

244
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Sir,

245
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
I practiced horsemanship

246
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
with Xuan'er all day long.

247
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
You are not doing business well.

248
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
You even spent money recklessly.

249
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
I will beat you to death.

250
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
You can beat me to death.

251
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I am doing this for this family.

252
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Those rich young men

253
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
all love horsemanship.

254
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I just want to let Xuan'er

255
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
have a good time with them.

256
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Who else

257
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
should we have a good time with?

258
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
You should have told me

259
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
ten years ago.

260
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Stop burning.

261
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Go back.

262
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Go back!

263
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Go away!

264
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I don't want to see you again.

265
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Go away!

266
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
It's too strong.

267
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
I am starting to panic.

268
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Come on.

269
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Come on.

270
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Come on.

271
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Come on.

272
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Come on.

273
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Come on.

274
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Come on.

275
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Who are you?

276
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Why are you eating at my house?

277
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
This is my house.

278
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
I am going to report you.

279
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Don't worry, master.

280
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
I know this is your house.

281
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
But we have already told him.

282
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Have you?

283
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
You told him.

284
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
He is not qualified to be the master.

285
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
We will leave after three days.

286
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Let's eat together.

287
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Okay.

288
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Okay.

289
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Okay.

290
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,200
You are wearing the wrong clothes.

291
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
In ancient times,

292
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
left is Yin and right is Yang.

293
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Your clothes are in gold.

294
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Left, right and right are worn by living people.

295
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Your clothes are like the clothes of the beast.

296
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,200
What is the point of putting three incense sticks on the cakes?

297
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
People are afraid of three long and two short.

298
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
First, they are afraid of two short.

299
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
This is not right.

300
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Why don't you eat?

301
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
I will eat if you don't.

302
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
It's been a long time since I saw you.

303
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Mother.

304
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
You have been dead for many years.

305
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Yes.

306
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,200
So thank you for coming to my 93rd birthday banquet.

307
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Mother.

308
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
I am still alive.

309
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Mother, I will burn incense for you.

310
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
I will burn incense for you.

311
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Mother, I will burn incense for you.

312
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Mother.

313
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Mother.

314
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Mother.

315
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
The incense is so delicious.

316
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Mother.

317
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Master.

318
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Master.

319
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Master.

320
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Master.

321
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Master.

322
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Thank you.
