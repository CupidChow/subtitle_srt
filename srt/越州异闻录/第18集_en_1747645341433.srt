1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Zhaodi, I saw your letter.

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't leave with you half a year ago.

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you still mad at me?

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're right.

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If we had really run away,

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
we might have been in jail.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They said you went to Yuezhou.

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Your general must have been worried about you.

10
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're going to the general's house soon.

11
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's good.

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm happy for you.

13
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I heard that you and your daughter...

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You two are very close.

15
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't know about the others.

16
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If I say I'll take you away now,

17
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
will you be willing to?

18
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If you tell me now that you're taking me away,

19
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
how nice would that be?

20
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm happy for you.

21
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's really snowing.

22
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Zhaodi, I wish you a happy and prosperous year.

23
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Today's winter snow is also a good start.

24
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What did you say?

25
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I said I wish Siwen a happy and prosperous year.

26
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're right.

27
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm happy for you.

28
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm happy for you.

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm happy for you.

30
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I wish you a happy and prosperous year.

31
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I wish you a happy and prosperous year.

32
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I wish you a happy and prosperous year.

33
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
After we met for the last time,

34
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I left the Red-Eye.

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yin Zhao Tianning made me leave the Sword Realm.

36
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Then no one wanted to find me.

37
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I understand.

38
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Xu Tian, Xiao Shen Po, Yu Wen Xian,

39
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
are those three children.

40
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Those three children.

41
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then why did you kill Xian?

42
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Later, I moved into the west of the city.

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I was a secretive citizen.

44
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I did a lot of illegal business.

45
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Life became very beautiful.

46
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But until a year ago...

47
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You...

48
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Are you buying cloth?

49
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Xian.

50
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Zhao Di.

51
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're useless.

53
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You kicked me out.

54
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is some money I saved.

55
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Take it and start a new life.

56
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm still a prostitute.

57
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What else can I do?

58
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I've figured out a reason.

59
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
As a woman,

60
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you always rely on men.

61
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Some people rely on children.

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But in fact, the one who should be the most dependent

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is yourself.

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
From the perspective of a prostitute,

65
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
anyone can reason with me.

66
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Anyone can scold me.

67
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Right?

68
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Xian.

69
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Brother, you're here.

70
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I told you before.

71
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We don't kill people.

72
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I didn't ask you to kill people.

73
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Just cut his hands off.

74
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're so cruel.

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why?

76
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He took all my hopes in Yihong Restaurant.

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Now he can live on his own hands.

78
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's not fair.

79
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Miss,

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
it's not enough.

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll pay you.

82
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is it enough?

83
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Enough.

84
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Now they can exchange.

85
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's go.

86
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Miss, you'll pay us.

87
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll find out what Xian did in the end.

88
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What are you doing?

89
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
From that moment on,

90
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I can't play the flute

91
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
or walk in the sand.

92
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No!

93
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But my brother is dead.

94
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And Uncle Yu.

95
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No!

96
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No!

97
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The End
