00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
General, maybe they are not human at all.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
General, how about I go and kill them?

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You don't know anything.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Uncle.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Uncle, you are a child.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You are so naughty.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Junyi, it's okay.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You go back and rest.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You will be fine after you are sent away.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
General.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thank you, General Zhao.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
My wife and I came down from the Eagle Mountain.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Thank you for your kindness.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When I get home, I will give you a gift.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you, General Zhao.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I will remember it.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you, General.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
General Zhao.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why are you here?

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I found out that you and Liu Zhaodi have a good relationship.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I came to tell you that you must be careful of the crow and some strange things.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
General Zhao, this is the little godmother of the west.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She is young, but she is very good.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Last time she helped Young Master Sigong to escape the mountain god.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
General Zhao, you are in trouble.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
These are not human.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You can see what they are with the tears of the cow.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
General Zhao, can I see something?

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What?

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I believe you know that Liu Zhaodi's suicide case

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
brought the curse of the mountain god.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Liu Qingsong of the mountain god,

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Su Heng of the city god,

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and Liu Zhaodi of the mountain god

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
were killed by Liu Zhaodi.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Liu Qingsong of the mountain god,

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Su Heng of the city god,

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
all have such a mark.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So?

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You are the next one.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
General, we don't know who put it in here.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It was not even on patrol.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is the gift they said.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I am the general of the east army.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I am afraid of these.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Maybe the mountain god is here.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Here he comes.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What can we do?

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I am the king of the east army.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I am the king of the east army.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I am the king of the east army.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I am the king of the east army.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Did you hear that?

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The army of the east army is going to attack the enemy.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Is it related to the death of the flower?

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I heard that the young master of the Eight-Eyes was infected with evil.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He can't live tonight.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Father.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yue Nu?

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you going home tonight or to investigate?

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
To investigate.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Be careful.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The mark on the girl's body is said to be made of blood.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There is no ghost god in this world.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I will definitely break their diamond.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I will break their ways of doing things.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I will definitely break the case tonight.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't worry.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
When it's all over, I'll rest.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Take you and the girl to Luoyang.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
See her uncle and aunt.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I had a dream today.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What do you guess?

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What dream?

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I dreamt that we just met.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Do you remember?

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I remember.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You were a bad person at that time.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I have a very deep impression.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
At that time...

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's talk about it when we get home.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hurry up.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Then go home early.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This coffin is too short.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I can't even stretch my legs.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Come.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Somebody!

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Somebody!

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Where are they?

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Where did they go?

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Where are they?

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You're here.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Zhao Tianming is also in trouble?

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But don't worry.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The little godmother who helped you last time is here.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is it her?

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't think about it.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Sit down.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Sit down and drink.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Do you remember the wine?

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Now I like to add some brown sugar.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It tastes different.

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come and taste it.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Come.

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The wine with sugar.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The little godmother who drank that night added some good water to her.

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I feel better.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There's something wrong with that good.

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What?

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I went to Yihong House today.

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Before I went to Yihong House, I also went to Zhou Mansion.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We re-examined the crow's body.

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Those crows were raised by a kind of poison that can make people confused.

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I guessed that the murderer would appear in the case of the crime.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There's something wrong with that little godmother.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The little godmother who drank that night added some good water to her.

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I feel better.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There's something wrong with that little godmother.

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Before I went to Yihong House today, I also went to Zhou Mansion.

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.

133
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.

134
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.

136
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I accompanied my wife from the Sacred Capital to Zhangyu.
