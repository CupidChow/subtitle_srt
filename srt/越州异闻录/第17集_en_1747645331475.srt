00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Miss, Miss.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please, please.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Give me a meal.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Here.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Thank you, Miss.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you, Miss.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Xian told me that

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Liu Zhao Di often goes to a temple in Shangshanfang.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So one night,

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I followed him.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Children,

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I brought you some delicious food.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Here, here.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So delicious.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Here.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It smells so good.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You go get some food.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, okay.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll take this.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll take this.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yu.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is for you.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, no, no.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yu,

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
since I made the flower cake,

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
saving money has become easier.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can leave these to the children

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to buy some delicious food.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This...

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
By the way,

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
last time I asked you to inquire about

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the untamed person in Yuezhu's mansion, Siwen.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This time,

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I want to ask you to

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
give this letter to him.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I've got the information

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you asked me to inquire about.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He is now

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
a official of Yuezhu's mansion.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There is a person

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
named Zheng Yuenu by his side.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
She is the daughter of

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Minister Zheng of the Ministry of Justice.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
She follows him every day.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's only been half a year.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He has entered Yuezhu's mansion.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's great.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's delicious, right?

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes, it's delicious.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In a few days,

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
it will be the Spring Festival.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I want to ask him out for a walk.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's delicious.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Is he a thief?

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Give me that letter.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My friend took the letter away.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why?

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Without me,

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
he is just a traitor

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and a low-ranking official.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Am I not good enough to him?

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What else does he want?

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's okay.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Just bury him.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Come on.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wei!

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hurry up.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hurry up.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hurry up.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hurry up.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Come on.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm not a bad guy.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He is a bad guy.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He is a bad guy.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We must not believe his words.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Open the door.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Open the door.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Open the door.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm scared.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't be scared.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So,

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I set the house on fire

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and burned it.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The children's life is too bitter.

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They are so cruel.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's me.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I helped them end this pain.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You hurt the court and our children.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You are a devil.

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Are you crazy?

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm a general.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Aren't you afraid of death?

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You have been poisoned.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Take care of yourself.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Wait.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
General Zhao said

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
he stabbed Liu Zhaodi's collarbone with a dagger.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But when we examined it,

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
there was no trace of the collarbone.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The body is complete and has no internal injury.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The body is complete and has no internal injury.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That body is not Liu Zhaodi.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Who is that?

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Six-inch-long feet.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That body is a small foot.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Six-inch-long feet.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And Zhao Tianming said that A'qian is a small foot.

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
General.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
General.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
General.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Catch him.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Catch him.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Doctor.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Doctor.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hurry.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Help me stop the bleeding.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why don't you let us see the illusion first?

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The illusion.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's dawn.

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I have lived for seven days.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It can be seen that superstition is true.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's unbelievable.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Come.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Why are you here, my lord?

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How's Zhaodi?

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's why you look like a young master of the Zhou family.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can solve the case now.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You killed Xian.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I've changed my face for you, right?

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We've been apart for eight years.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Time flies so fast.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So, little godmother, Xu Tian, Yu Wen Xian, who are they?

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Come and have some tea.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll tell you.

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The night Zhao Tian Ming followed me,

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I found out later.

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Miss, let me remind you.

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
When you passed by,

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
someone was following you.

145
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Following you?

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Finally, I found them in the small house in the back hill.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But it was a big fire.

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm Liu Zhaodi.

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm Xiao Xu, Xiao Xian.

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Protect them.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Stay away from the door.

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll cover your nose.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You...

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You...

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But Xiao Fan died.

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He died.

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And Uncle Yu.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You two stay alive.

159
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't try to avenge them.

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay?

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Kids,

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll take you to a place.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's Shan Yin Xian, a paradise.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You two stay there, okay?

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Sister Xiaodi, will you go with us?

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If I go, it's easy to expose you.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll hide in the west of the city.

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll visit you often.

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay?

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay, don't cry.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't cry.

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Don't cry.

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's the New Year's Eve in a few days.

174
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I made an appointment with a friend.

175
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The End
