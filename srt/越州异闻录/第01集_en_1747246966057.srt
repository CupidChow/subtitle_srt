1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,940
If you're coming from the gods,

2
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,420
bring it on!

3
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,540
lt seems

4
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,620
l's coming l's coming

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,640
hw

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,380
If this is what you're after,

7
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,860
it stands in your way

8
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,420
If you're ì„±

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,540
l'm afraid

10
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,840
you're quite possible

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,700
But his castle

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,000
ribs

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,340
my

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,960
although

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,660
you're brooding

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,140
l'm watching

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,340
Let's go inside.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,020
Really?

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:00,980
Wait a minute.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:18,620
We order Madam to take this

21
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,660
Mr. Zhang,

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,300
I'll check it out.

23
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,460
I'll check it out.

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,660
I'll check it out.

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,340
No.

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,460
This tenant owed money.

27
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,460
The landlord came to the door and found the body.

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,060
Open the door.

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
It stinks.

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,420
Why are there so many crow corpses on the ground?

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,900
The face is already rotten.

32
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,020
Is the Niuwu City here?

33
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,020
Coming. Coming.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,300
Be careful.

35
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,620
Yes.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,900
The landlord's report says

37
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,900
the windows and doors of the house were locked.

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
This is a secret room.

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,100
What is this?

40
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,900
Minister, you've asked the right person.

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
This is a very important statue.

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Every twenty miles from the city of Yuezhou,

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
there is a mountain called the God of Humanity.

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
It's called the Eagle Mountain.

45
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
The Eagle Mountain?

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,100
The Eagle Mountain is a mountain

47
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,700
called the Eagle Mountain.

48
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,900
Why is it called the Eagle Mountain?

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,300
After many people in the city

50
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,500
gave birth to the female eagle,

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,300
they didn't want to raise it anymore.

52
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,100
So they sent them to the mountain

53
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,300
to die.

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,300
There is a tower in the mountain

55
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,300
called the Eagle Mountain Tower.

56
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,100
There are a lot of eagle bones in it.

57
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,100
People say that this mountain has the spirit of mountain gods.

58
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,900
The soul of the eagle can be at peace.

59
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,500
This is the statue of the Eagle Mountain.

60
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,900
We don't allow strange forces to cause trouble in the Zhou family.

61
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,900
Minister, give me two bottles of wine.

62
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,900
I'll go back to work.

63
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Minister.

64
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
The victim is a middle-aged woman.

65
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,900
She is over thirty years old.

66
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
She is six inches nine.

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,900
She is 48 years old.

68
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,900
Her bones are intact.

69
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,900
No internal injuries.

70
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,900
There is no impure food in her stomach.

71
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900
There is water before death.

72
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
Maybe she starved to death.

73
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,900
In addition, the surface of the body has begun to rot.

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,900
Her face is most seriously damaged.

75
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,300
Check again.

76
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
Report to me immediately if you have any clues.

77
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Yes.

78
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,300
Boto, come here.

79
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,300
According to the forest,

80
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
there are often crows and rats around here.

81
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,300
Women's families often feed them.

82
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,300
It seems that this woman's family is the victim.

83
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,300
Minister.

84
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,300
The people here are good at clearing the area.

85
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,300
But only this peasant is not good at it.

86
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
The birthday gift for you.

87
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
What's wrong?

88
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,300
This peasant looks like a friend.

89
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
What's wrong?

90
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,300
My blood is bleeding.

91
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
My blood is bleeding.

92
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,700
Where are you?

93
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,700
I have a report to make.

94
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,700
Right, Minister.

95
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
Madam Pei told me

96
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,700
that this case is a suicide case.

97
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,700
Minister,

98
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
a letter was sent to me.

99
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,700
According to the letter,

100
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
the victim's name is Liu Zhaodi.

101
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,700
How could it be her?

102
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,700
Minister, do you know her?

103
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Zhaodi, why don't you talk?

104
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,700
I am feeling the youth of this moment.

105
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Nonsense.

106
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
It's so noisy here.

107
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
How can it be quiet?

108
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Siwen.

109
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Happy birthday.

110
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Siwen, look.

111
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
It's snowing.

112
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,700
Zhaodi.

113
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,700
It's snowing.

114
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
I wish you a happy birthday.

115
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Zhaodi wishes Siwen

116
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,700
a happy birthday this year.

117
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Happy birthday next year.

118
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Happy birthday every year.

119
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,700
It's the last time I see her.

120
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,700
I thought she would be innocent and happy.

121
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,700
I didn't expect to see her again.

122
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,700
She is always innocent and brave.

123
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
Husband.

124
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Husband.

125
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,700
Are you thinking about the case?

126
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
Yes.

127
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,700
Is the case important

128
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,700
or the dishes your wife cooked?

129
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
You are important.

130
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
Eat.

131
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,700
Zhaodi.

132
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Liu Zhaodi's case made me a nightmare.

133
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,700
Maybe I can go to the west again.

134
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,700
The West is cursed by the mountain gods.

135
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,700
If you go to the west to be cursed,

136
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
you will die within seven days.

137
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Zhaodi.

138
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,700
What happened to you these years?

139
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
This letter

140
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,700
is the pen I left you.

141
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,700
But why did you stay with me for so many years?

142
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
Who is it?

143
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,700
Who is it?

144
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
How dare you pretend to be a ghost?

145
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
What?

146
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Is it a nightmare again?

147
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Why do I always dream of the shape of the mountain gods?

148
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
What on earth is going on?

149
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Zhaodi, you are very brave.

150
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
You are very serious.

151
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,700
It seems that woman is really going to be cursed.

152
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Excuse me. Excuse me.

153
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Excuse me.

154
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Everyone in the West is cursed.

155
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
This woman is going to be cursed.

156
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
We must send her away today.

157
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Don't be afraid.

158
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Taoist Feng is here.

159
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Yes.

160
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
Let's go.

161
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
We can't burn her stuff.

162
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Let's send her away.

163
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
But the government has put a seal on it.

164
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
Can we go in?

165
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
The law is not strict.

166
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
As long as everyone goes in,

167
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
the government has no choice.

168
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Let's go.

169
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
Okay. Let's go.

170
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Let's go.

171
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,700
I'll break the seal in one, two, three.

172
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Okay.

173
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,700
One, two, three.

174
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Who said three?

175
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
I'll kill you.

176
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Taoist, you should come.

177
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
I have paid the money.

178
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,700
You dare not open the door.

179
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,700
You are a fake Taoist.

180
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,700
You...

181
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,700
Why do you say I am a fake Taoist?

182
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
I am not a human being.

183
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
How can I let you slander me?

184
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,700
You slander me?

185
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,700
What? You don't accept it?

186
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
You are so unlucky.

187
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
I'll kill you now.

188
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,700
I'll let you die.

189
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Give it back.

190
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,700
Give it back.

191
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,700
Give it back.

192
