The Legend of Qingcheng

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That year, our Su family was still in a big trouble.

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The Liu family was in a hurry to get a son.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So they married Liu Zhaodi to us.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Liu Zhaodi

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Heng.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Father, I heard you gave the Liu family one thousand taels of silver.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is Liu Zhaodi worth that much money?

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Heng, our Su family started with salt business.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But since ancient times, the government is in charge of the production and distribution of salt.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Last year, the Zhe Dong changed a governor.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Our Su family is like a army.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The relationship between the Liu family and the Jiedushi family is probably only our Su family.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But I haven't even seen Liu Zhaodi.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What if he's ugly?

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What should I do?

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're a man.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Such a mother-in-law.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Besides, it's normal for men to have three wives and four children.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No need to be satisfied with every one.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Liu Qing is here.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Uncle Liu.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Still calling me uncle Liu?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's time to change the name.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Liu, where's Zhaodi?

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Come in, Zhaodi.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Uncle Liu, since Zhaodi has passed the door, let me come.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He's a little stubborn.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I've been locked up at home for more than a year.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He's much better now.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I know, uncle Liu.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're really beautiful.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We agreed to get married.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why do you force me to get married?

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm not getting married.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let me go.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let me go.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
How can you defy the order of your parents?

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't have you in my heart.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I beg you.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let me go, okay?

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Our father won't agree.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Besides, there are so many people outside.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How can you escape?

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's pretend to get married first.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
After we get to the room, we'll figure out how to save you.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Come.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Look, why are we all out of breath?

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Will you really help me?

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Congratulations.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Really?

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The person I like is in Yuezhou.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's a student who took the exam this year.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Help me find him.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What's his name?

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Siwen.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's go.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's welcome the groom and bride to bow to heaven and earth.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I won't bow.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I won't.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Bow to heaven and earth.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
At that time, I often asked about Zhao Di.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let go.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I knew he came to Yuezhou.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I asked him if he was here to get married.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I was in a bind that year.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He didn't wait for me as promised.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let me in.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let me in.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let me in.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Who are you?

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Zhao Di.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Zhao Di.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't shout. Are you crazy?

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Zhao Di.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Brother, go and notify me.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll wait here, okay?

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you talking about?

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He's already in the wedding hall.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Didn't you hear that?

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Zhao Di.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Zhao Di.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why should I help you?

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Unless...

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Zhao Di.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You kneel down.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, I kneel down.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I kneel down.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Go.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Go.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Get up.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Wait for me.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Father, have some tea.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let go.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You...

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I know.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I just saw him.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What?

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Heng, what's up?

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There are some wild dogs at the gate.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I've sent someone to send them some meat.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mr. Su is so kind.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Good. Good.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Have some tea.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let go.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What are you doing?

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That Liuzhao Di you mentioned is our Young Mistress.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She said that from now on, you have nothing to do with each other.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't believe it.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't believe it.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hit him harder.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hit him harder.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's how we became relatives.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Bastard.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why are you so rude to me?

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do we know each other?

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Who are you?

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I've married Zhao Di.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Your relationship is a kind of harm to her.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, you wrote a letter to her as I said.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I... I don't believe it.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to see Zhao Di.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I want to see Zhao Di.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let go of me.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I like her.

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She is mine.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If you still don't understand,

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
your right hand will be like this.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You still want to take the exam, right?

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If the other hand is injured,

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you can't take the exam.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you going to write or not?

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Think about it.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can give Zhao Di a better life.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Besides, she doesn't want to see you now.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Wait.

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll write.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll write.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What?

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll write!

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Sir.

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sir.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What's wrong with you?

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Mr. Su.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I brought your son here.

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What do you mean?

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You want to help me?

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Sir.

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
His son was poisoned.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I sang at the Taiping Society.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So they invited me to help them.

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Sir, come here.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Sir.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Sir.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
People involved in this case are so strange.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Look carefully.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Maybe there's something wrong.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Why don't you kneel down?

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You're fake.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We're coming.

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We're coming.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Sir.

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Come here.

171
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Stop!

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Son, what's wrong with you?

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Dad.

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Dad.

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Dad, take me away.

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm scared.

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Son, do you remember the 8th day of your birthday?

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yes.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Tell us.

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Tell us.

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Now?

183
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If we tell you, we'll believe you're fine.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Come.

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How do I know his 8th day?

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He's not my son.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Leave here now.

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If you don't come back,

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll kill you.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Do you remember me?

192

Su He.

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why are you hiding here?

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No matter where you hide,

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I can find you.

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm your wife.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Liu Zhaodi.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What?

199
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
