1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,320
才会见面, mais segur地 tratar你。

2
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,660
I am your wife,

3
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,040
Liu Zhao Yin.

4
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
Hey.

5
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,320
Su Heng,

6
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,320
how long are you going to keep me in the dark?

7
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
You're drunk.

8
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
I found him.

9
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Si Wen?

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Where is he?

11
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
He said

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,400
you were married,

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
so he disappeared.

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Impossible.

15
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
He won't disobey me.

16
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
He gave it to you.

17
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,720
Liu Zhao Di,

18
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,280
thank you for your brief contact.

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,840
But now you have a family,

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,320
you should start a new life.

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
I wish you happiness,

22
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
and a long life.

23
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Si Wen is dead.

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Tell me where he is.

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm going to find him.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You can't escape.

27
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't make the decision.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,080
Let me go.

29
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
I'm going to find him.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,680
You've been married for half a month.

31
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
I treated you like this.

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,760
Why did you humiliate me?

33
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
I didn't mean it.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
You bastard.

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
What did you say?

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
Let me go.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Say it again.

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
I said you're a bastard.

39
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,240
How dare you insult my finger?

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,800
You're narrower than me.

41
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,800
How bold you are!

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,760
Prudence can kill you.

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,480
But a heart is selfish.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
What do you think?

45
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Help me!

46
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Help me!

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
We can't go any further!

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Master!

49
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Go!

50
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Help me!

51
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Help me!

52
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Help me!

53
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Help me!

54
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Help me!

55
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Help me!

56
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Master Su...

57
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Master Su...

58
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Master Su...

59
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Master Su...

60
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Master Su...

61
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Go and get your child out.

62
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
What are you doing?

63
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Try it.

64
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Master, what should I do?

65
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Hua Er, call your father.

66
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Hua Er, call him!

67
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Hua Er...

68
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Father!

69
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Father! I'm Hua Er!

70
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Father, come back!

71
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Father!

72
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
I'm Hua Er! Come back!

73
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Go on.

74
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Father!

75
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
I'm Hua Er! Come back!

76
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Father!

77
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Father!

78
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Father!

79
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Father!

80
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Father!

81
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Father!

82
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
It's fake!

83
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
It's fake!

84
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Come back!

85
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Master Su...

86
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Master Su...

87
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Master Su...

88
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
He has a wife and a son like this.

89
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Master Su, what about that lunatic?

90
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Take him to the Zhou Manor.

91
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
What did you see when you were unconscious?

92
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
I...

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
It was all me.

94
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
I couldn't see anything.

95
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
No...

96
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
There seems to be a monster.

97
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
No, it's a ghost.

98
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
It must be a ghost!

99
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Liu Qingsong died in this way.

100
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Do you remember who I am?

101
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,400
You gave me this scar.

102
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Scar...

103
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Siwen?

104
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Master, I was wrong.

105
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Please forgive me.

106
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Please forgive me.

107
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
I'm here to solve cases.

108
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
I'm not here to search for the city.

109
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Sit down.

110
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
I just need to know

111
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
what happened to Liu Zhaodi.

112
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
After we got married,

113
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Liu Zhaodi has been very protective of me.

114
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
I...

115
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
I hit him several times.

116
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
I also beat him several times.

117
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Then he ran away.

118
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
He ran away overnight.

119
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
He rushed back to the old house of Shan Yixian.

120
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
He ran away.

121
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
At that time,

122
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
his mother had gone to the Beishan Temple to get married.

123
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
His father also married a concubine.

124
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
That concubine gave birth to a son for the Liu family.

125
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
That concubine gave birth to a son for the Liu family.

126
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
The Liu family finally has a son!

127
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
The Liu family finally has a son!

128
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Let's call him Xuan'er.

129
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
At that moment,

130
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
he realized that the Wu family was precious.

131
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
When Wu Lu died,

132
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
he was taken in by a monk.

133
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Miss.

134
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Miss.

135
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Miss, wake up.

136
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm sorry, Master.

137
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I'll leave now.

138
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Miss, are you hungry?

139
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Come.

140
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Come.

141
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Eat.

142
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Thank you, Master.

143
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Eat slowly.

144
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Master,

145
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
whose children are they?

146
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
At that time,

147
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
it seemed peaceful.

148
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
But there were many people

149
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
who couldn't afford to raise children.

150
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
I picked them up.

151
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
There are not many good people like you.

152
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
There are not many good people like you.

153
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
They are lucky.

154
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Some parents

155
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
will send their unborn children

156
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
to the Eagle Mountain Tower.

157
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
There is no chance of survival there.

158
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Have you been there?

159
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I have been there a few times.

160
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
There are many accidents.

161
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Some children have very small feet.

162
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Most of them are female.

163
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
If there is really a Buddha in this world,

164
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
I hope he can help these children.

165
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
You have a new friend.

166
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Master,

167
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
you have a new friend.

168
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Master,

169
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
this is...

170
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
This is Lv Yi.

171
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
She often comes here to see children

172
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
and bring them food.

173
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Just call me Lv Yi.

174
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Lv Yi, I am Liu Zhaodi.

175
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
It seems that Lv Yi and Master

176
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
are all admired.

177
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
You are called Zhaodi,

178
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
but you are a man.

179
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Different thoughts.

180
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Let's try it together.

181
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Children, come and eat.

182
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Come on.

183
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Zhaodi has been hiding

184
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
in Shangshan Temple for several months.

185
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
I found him.

186
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Children, I brought you some delicious food.

187
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
You are here.

188
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Master,

189
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
I am here.

190
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
I am here.

191
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I am here.

192
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I am here.

193
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
I am here.

194
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
I am here.

195
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
I am here.

196
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
