1
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,720
do

2
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,720
yeah

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Si Gong, the government has spread the news about your marriage.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What happened?

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Meicheng Xiang, my family is also involved in it.

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What?

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Si Gong, don't worry.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We will definitely solve the case.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Mr. Tai.

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I sent someone to the temple in Shangshanfang this morning.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Search!

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But now it's all gone.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
My people asked the local government and found the scrolls of the temple.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That monk had died a long time ago.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But those children are also missing.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But the one named Lv Yi can still be found now.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lv Yi?

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Su Heng should have died long ago.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You shouldn't have saved him.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The bad people did bad things.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Tang Lv will punish him.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
As a young master, I can only save him.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
After Zhaodi was brought back to the Su family by Su Heng,

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
he was controlled like a bird in a cage.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He could only come out for a few months.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He would also bring some food and clothes to the temple for the children.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Of course, I have seen him before.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Once...

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Once...

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm here to deliver some medicine to Mrs. Su.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come in.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You don't have any wine.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I brought you some wine today.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't want to drink today.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's been more than a year since we got married.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I respect you enough.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you think you hurt yourself or do you feel guilty?

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why do you always say such harsh words?

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You are the one who is using the boat.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You belong to the Su family.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You are also a member of the Su family.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Do you think I should thank you?

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you, 53.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I told you.

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't like you that much.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But I don't like your arrogant eyes.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So I want you to be the dog of the Su family forever.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If I had found out that I am a 13-year-old girl earlier,

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I wouldn't have done this.

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Your Highness, please help me to get some wine.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's you again.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You owe me more than 20,000 yuan.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm a small business.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you want to get some wine, you have to pay me back first.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This is the last time.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I will pay you back next time.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No, no.

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Brother.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If you have no money, just leave.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Just take my money as your dog food.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Can you stop being so mean?

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Get out, brother.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You come to play when you have no money.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Long time no see.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Long time no see.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I...

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Drink.

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Boss, some wine.

71
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Siwen.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Do you want to drink?

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you doing well?

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
When I was forced to get married, you were not there.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
When I was homeless, you were not there.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
When I was humiliated, you were not there.

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you think I'm doing well?

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't like to hear you say that.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Drink.

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Your wine.

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Thank you.

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You should hate me.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But why are you looking for me?

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't go.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In Yezhou, there is such a beautiful girl.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Come with me.

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What are you doing?

91
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let me go.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come, let me help you.

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Get off me.

94
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Get off me.

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Get off me.

96
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Get off me.

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Get off me.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Get off me.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Get off me.

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Get off me.

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Get off me.

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Get off me.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You wait for me.

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's okay.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's okay.

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's okay.

107
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why are you here?

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm late.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Why are you here?

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Come in.

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's dark.

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Come in.

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You live here?

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a little messy.

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You can sit anywhere.

118
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You...

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You guess my house.

120
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's so small and messy.

121
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How much is it?

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Five hundred.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You guess again.

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Six hundred.

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Eight hundred.

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's expensive.

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a street.

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is...

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is for home.

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's drink some.

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's okay.

132
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Drink less.

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's okay.

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I remember the first time I saw you,

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you took this food box

136
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and told me

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
to eat less.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's okay.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's been more than two years

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
since I've been to the nursing home.

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Have you ever thought of me?

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I dare not disturb you.

143
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I want to find you,

144
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
but I can't.

145
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Is your maid Xiaoju

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
okay now?

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She's dead.

148
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
She's gone.

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
She's gone.

150
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
After the wedding,

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the Su family used her

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
as a slave

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and beat her to death.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I know

155
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
she helped me once.

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's why the Su family

157
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
chose to settle the score.

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The government won't

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
interfere in this matter

160
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
because she's a servant

161
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
who only earns

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
two taels of silver.

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Her death

164
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
is like a slave's death.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The leaves

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
are lifeless.

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
She's alive.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No one cares

169
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
if she's dead or not.

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This world

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
will eat people.

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I shouldn't have mentioned the past.

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes.

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We won't mention the past.

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We won't.

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's meet again.

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I have something to ask you.

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Why did you write

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
that letter

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
when I got married?

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Family

183
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
is not something

184
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
we can decide.

185
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

186
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In the agreement,

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
the father should sign,

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
the Su Heng should sign,

189
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
the Su Heng's father should sign,

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
but the woman shouldn't.

191
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But the one who got married

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
was me.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Even if I got married,

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
what can I do?

195
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Will anyone agree?

196
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But why didn't you ask me

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
if I was willing to?

198
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't

199
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
be with you.

200
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I was

201
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
caught up again that year.

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I was caught up twice.

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Maybe I'm really useless.

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I can't enter the Yuzhou mansion

205
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
for the rest of my life.

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The case of Yinyangzhou is in a mess.

207
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The people from the Zhaomu tribe of Yuzhou

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
are going to Yanzhou to file a case.

209
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Hello.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The people from the tribe of Yuzhou are signing.

211
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Sign it.

212
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Now you understand, right?

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm going to be a bad person.

214
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Without a job, I'll die at any time.

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm the same as Xiaoju.

216
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can't enter the mansion.

217
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I can't get a job.

218
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I can't compete with the Fu family.

219
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I can't even support myself.

220
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Not to mention marrying you.

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You are a coward.

222
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But why

223
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
can't I forget you?

224
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm not a coward.

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I just want to face you for the first time.

226
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You are like a

227
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
mysterious and yearning name.

228
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But no one cares about the path.

229
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Seeing the flowers,

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I pass by the machine again.

231
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Listening to the moon and the sound of the sound of the footstep.

232
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Memories

233
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm afraid that the red candle will not fill the heart of the farewell.

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I will leave you the last mark.

235
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The thought of the end has not stopped.

236
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The decisive sun has passed thousands of miles.

237
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm afraid that the heat will wake up.

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The decisive sun has passed thousands of miles.
