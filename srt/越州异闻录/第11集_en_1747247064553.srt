1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
There are many

2
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,200
other gymnasias

3
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,400
that are real

4
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,240
and real

5
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,440
Hard to have

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,300
if they couch

7
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,580
the days

8
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,940
Bring away all reality

9
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:19,600
and bad

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,060
That's what I would非常ly

11
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,560
say

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm scared to death.

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm scared to death.

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
You go there and check.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
I'll be here to look for it.

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Song Lang.

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Mom.

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
Mom.

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Mom.

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
Mom.

21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Mom.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Mom.

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
Mom.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
Mom.

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Mom.

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Mom.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,560
The night road after the alarm is quite deep.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,560
It feels like a stranger is going to the road.

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Do you think he can really do it?

30
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,560
I think you and your family are really being harassed by ghosts.

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
This little lady is very good.

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
Let's talk about it later.

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Hey, little lady.

34
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Little lady, are you asleep?

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
If you're asleep, forget it.

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Don't.

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Why are we here?

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Little lady, little lady.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Who?

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
I, Lu Wenzhao.

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
You counted for our family.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Do you remember?

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
I remember you.

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
I also remember him.

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Right here.

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
We met.

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Yes, we met.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
What are you doing?

49
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
What are you doing?

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
What is this?

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,560
I told you about the God of Mount Ying.

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm asking you why you're offering this.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Si Gu Wen, calm down.

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Calm down.

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,560
This god is very smart.

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
And he's not as good as Yuezhuang.

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
He's not as good as Yuezhuang.

58
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
He's not as good as Yuezhuang.

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
He's not as good as Yuezhuang.

60
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
And he's very close to Yuezhou.

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Why can't we offer this?

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
Right, Si Gong.

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
There are many people who offer this in Yuezhou.

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Write down your birthday card.

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Birthday card.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
You shouldn't give it to anyone.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,560
You don't believe in the God of Ghosts.

68
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Why do you believe in this?

69
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Of course I don't believe in it.

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Then what are you afraid of?

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Besides, when the sun rises,

72
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,560
it will be your seventh day.

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Ridiculous.

74
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
I really don't know what I'm wasting my time doing here.

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,560
Why did he leave?

76
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
It's fake.

77
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
It's all fake.

78
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Brother.

79
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Brother.

80
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Brother.

81
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Brother.

82
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Brother.

83
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Brother.

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Brother.

85
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Why did you write this letter?

86
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
You've already married me.

87
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
I don't want to be with you anymore.

88
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Can you marry me?

89
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Yes.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Nanran.

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Is it you?

92
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Is it you, Zhaodi?

93
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
I know it's you.

94
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
I know it's you.

95
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,560
I know you're back.

96
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Zhaodi.

97
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Minister.

98
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
I know you're back.

99
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
What's wrong?

100
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Hold him.

101
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Zhaodi.

102
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Zhaodi.

103
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Come.

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
How are you?

105
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Are you feeling better?

106
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Minister.

107
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
You scared me.

108
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Thank god this little witch saved you.

109
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
What did you give me?

110
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
It's a blessing from the gods.

111
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
It's a blessing from the gods.

112
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Thank you.

113
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
How is it?

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Do you believe it now?

115
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
She's really capable.

116
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Can you help me save my daughter?

117
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Do you care about your daughter?

118
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Of course.

119
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,560
You're even willing to die for her?

120
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Yes.

121
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Overcoming your fear

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,560
may give you a chance.

123
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
How to overcome my fear?

124
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Wherever your fear is,

125
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
you go.

126
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
To Ying Shan?

127
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Okay.

128
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
I'll go to Ying Shan tonight.

129
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
I'll meet Shan Shan.

130
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Shan Shan.

131
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
I'm here for you.

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
I don't want to be like Xin Er.

133
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
I don't want to be like Xin Er.

134
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
I don't want to be like Xin Er.

135
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
I don't want to be like Xin Er.

136
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
I don't want to be like Xin Er.

137
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
What does Xin Er have to do with Shan Shan?

138
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Xin Er.

139
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
I can't grow up with you.

140
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,560
I want to take you to find Shan Shan.

141
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Yunu.

142
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Xin Er.

143
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Yunu.

144
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Yunu.

145
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Xin Er.

146
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Xin Er.

147
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Is this...

148
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Xin Er.

149
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
This is the Yunu from five years ago.

150
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
It's the Yunu I found when I was on a business trip in Cheng An City.

151
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Xin Er.

152
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,560
It turns out that after Xin Er was killed,

153
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Yunu sent Xin Er's body to Ying Shan.

154
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Xin Er.

155
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Xin Er.

156
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Are you hungry?

157
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
I really want to feed you.

158
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
I wonder if you are cold here.

159
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Yunu.

160
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I shouldn't have left you five years ago.

161
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,560
I didn't know you had to face so much alone.

162
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Xin Er.

163
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Why are you so cold?

164
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Yunu.

165
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
Xin Er.

169
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Daddy.

170
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Your name is written by daddy.

171
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Do you like it?

172
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
You miss daddy.

173
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
I miss your daddy too.

174
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Xin Er wants to play with other kids.

175
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Okay.

176
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
I'll take you to play with other kids.

177
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
I'll take you there.

178
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Yunu.

179
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
I'm sorry, Yunu.

180
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Xin Er.

181
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
I'll take you to play with other kids.

182
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
I'll take you to play with other kids.

183
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
Ah.

184
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Xin Er.

185
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
