a long time since

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,370
Fucheng had such good sunshine.

38
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,780
Your surgery went smoothly.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,940
Heaven is congratulating you.

40
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,860
I did a great job giving birth to you.

My son is so handsome.

42
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,700
Your hair has grown long.

43
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,260
It needs trimming.

44
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,860
Do you remember

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,740
when you were little,

46
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,720
how much you loved it
when I trimmed your hair?

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,460
You were so quiet when I did it.

48
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,220
Of course I remember.

49
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,560
Mom,

50
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,700
once you're completely recovered

51
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,860
and we're back home,

52
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,260
my hair is all yours.

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,140
You can style it however you want.

54
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,180
That sounds good.

55
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,940
Hey, listen,

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,960
help me with

57
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,560
the discharge procedures

58
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,940
tomorrow, alright?

59
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,140
Hey, I can't do that.

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,940
Mom, why are you rushing?

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,360
Your surgery has just finished,

62
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,040
the doctor said you need to stay
for observation.

63
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,920
You can't go home now.

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,700
But you said the surgery was successful.

65
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,740
- Mom.
- And I'm recovering quite well.

66
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,500
You can try this bed.

67
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,040
I can't sleep well on it.

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120
If I stay longer,

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,520
my bones will fall apart.

70
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,800
Mom, please stop.

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,760
You can't leave now.

72
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,960
I want to go outside

73
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,160
- and enjoy the sun.
- No, you can't.

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,380
- Take me out to soak up some sun.
- Oh, Mom,

75
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,040
don't be difficult.

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,740
- I must...
- Hey, Mom, please.

77
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,230
What's wrong?

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,660
Dad, please talk to Mom.

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
It's okay, it's okay.

80
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,750
She hasn't had her post-op checkup yet,

81
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,480
and she wants to leave.

82
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,880
What post-op checkup?

83
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,980
Just wasting money.

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,320
I know what's going on

85
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,220
with my body.

86
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,360
Dad.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,320
After all these years, don't you

88
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,460
know your mom's temperament?

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,580
Just let her be.

90
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,200
Look.

(Name: Bai Lan, Applying for
English Translation Position)

94
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,980
You want to work on a ship?

95
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,720
But it's all men on board.

96
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,680
They don't want women.

97
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,860
Women can't endure that hardship.

98
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,100
Manager, I can endure hardship.

99
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,420
I can do anything.

100
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
Whatever men can do, I can do too.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,840
I still have to say no.

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,860
There's no precedent for this.

103
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,820
Do you need a doctor on your ship?

104
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,040
I studied medicine before

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,180
and worked as a factory doctor.

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,140
What is the problem?

107
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,360
We use

108
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,620
the finest bricks of black tea.

109
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,040
And cola,

110
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,540
no problem at all.

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,640
Manager,

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,100
let me help you check.

113
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,160
Thank you.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
The black tea here

115
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,380
refers to the thing we call "red tea",

116
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,360
and the sparkling water

117
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,340
refers to soda water.

118
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,860
Your English is good.

119
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,260
I've been self-studying all along.

120
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,700
So, do you need
a translator on your ship?

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,780
After all, this is an international
shipping company.

122
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,220
Let me be honest with you.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,400
From the captain to the crew,

124
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,480
everyone on this ship is male.

125
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,300
It's too dangerous for a woman.

126
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,560
Besides,

127
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
why can't you do anything else?

128
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,540
Do you have to work on the ship?

129
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,140
Actually,

130
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
I just don't really want

131
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,540
to stay in Shanghai anymore,

132
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,060
but for the moment,
I don't know where to go.

133
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,020
So I want to spend some time at sea.

134
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,480
But it's okay.

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,660
If there really
isn't a suitable position for me,

136
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,580
I'll look elsewhere.

137
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,520
Thank you.

138
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,560
If you're willing,

139
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,480
you could consider joining our company
as a translator.

140
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,900
We happen to need bilingual talents.

141
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,420
If you perform well,

142
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,540
there will be many opportunities

143
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,960
for overseas inspections in the future.

144
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,800
Really?

145
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,680
But let's make it clear upfront.

146
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,160
Our rule is to
have a one-month trial period

147
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,560
without salary before
becoming a formal employee.

148
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,020
How about a ten-day trial?

149
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,240
Fifteen days.

150
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,400
Okay.

151
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,540
Do you remember

152
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,020
this yellow sweater?

153
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,960
You gave it to me

154
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,100
when I first started at the factory.

155
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,120
Back then, when you

156
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,300
wore this sweater,

157
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,100
everyone would take a second look at you.

158
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,480
Of course.

159
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, this sweater was

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,760
what you wore when you won first prize

161
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,020
in the singing competition last time.

162
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,080
Are you talking about

163
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,200
when the leader personally awarded us?

164
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,660
The time we sang "Sing Sing So".

165
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,680
No, when we sang "Sing Sing So",

166
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,860
we were wearing red coats.

167
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,340
No,

168
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,700
it was this one.

169
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,080
You're remembering it wrong.

170
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,360
I wore the red coat.

171
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,000
I didn't forget. It was this one.

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,080
There is a photo.

173
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,580
- Let me find it.
- Where is it?

174
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,800
- Look.
- Look at you.

175
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,460
- You just don't believe it.
- Not the red one, no.

176
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
You've got it wrong.

177
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,680
It's this one.

178
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,600
Let me search in that room.

179
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,980
Just wait a moment.

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
You're mistaken.

181
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,440
What's wrong?

182
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,320
Come, come, get up!

183
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,340
Get up, get up!

184
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,760
Why are you so careless?

185
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,320
- What were you doing?
- I'm fine.

186
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,620
- Come on, get up.
- It's okay.

187
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,220
- Mom!
- Mrs. Lu!

188
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,840
What's wrong?

189
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,240
- It's nothing.
- It's okay.

190
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
- It's okay.
- Let me put on the shoe.

191
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,240
She slipped.

192
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,140
She just slipped.

193
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,200
Here.

194
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,680
What were you trying to get?

195
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,520
Come on.

196
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,600
Put her on the sofa.

197
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
On the sofa.

198
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,820
Are you okay, Mrs. Lu?

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,400
Sit down, sit down.

200
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,300
I just...

201
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,960
I...

202
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,520
I was just

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,980
trying to get

204
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,860
Xiaolu's

205
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
Certificate of Merit

206
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,820
from that

207
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,940
red suitcase.

208
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,420
Mom, the doctor said
you need to rest well.

209
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,980
You should listen to him.

210
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,920
You can ask my dad to get it for you.

211
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,140
It's okay.

212
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,720
I've been lying on that

213
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,220
hospital bed for too long,

214
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,440
so my legs are weak now.

215
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,880
How can you say it's okay? You...

216
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,380
Enough, stop talking.

217
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,980
Since he came back from Shanghai,

218
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,380
he's been nagging nonstop.

219
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,460
Mrs. Lu,

220
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,360
look, I brought you some tasty treats.

221
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,720
You need to replenish your nutrition
after surgery,

222
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
so you'll recover soon.

223
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,020
Xiaoying is really thoughtful.

224
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,300
Oh, that's enough.

225
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,500
Enough for me.

226
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,240
Come on, eat.

227
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,640
Why are you all

228
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,860
staring at me

229
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,760
- like I'm a criminal?
- Alright, alright.

230
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,900
We won't stare.

231
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,700
I'll recover soon.

232
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,800
Xiaolu.

233
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
Mom.

234
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,280
This is

235
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,780
what I think.

236
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,620
If you feel really unhappy

237
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,060
working at this factory,

238
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,860
if you're not happy,

239
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,780
you can just quit.

240
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,980
It's no big deal.

241
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,980
You're still so young.

242
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,820
There are other ways out for you.

243
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,780
My son will be excellent.

244
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,940
I have always believed in this.

245
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,900
But I...

246
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,100
I also think

247
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,820
finding a girl you like

248
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,500
is quite important.

249
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,580
Having a good relationship

250
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,180
and starting a family,

251
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,820
then I would be at ease.

252
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,160
Actually, in Fucheng,

253
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,300
there are plenty of good girls.

254
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,280
You can surely find one

255
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,720
more considerate

256
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,880
and better than Bai Lan.

257
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,720
Isn't that so?

258
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,580
I think Xiaoying is quite nice.

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,900
I really like you.

260
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,280
Mrs. Lu,

261
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,560
I'm...

262
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,980
I'm not with Xiaolu as you think.

263
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,340
Mom.

264
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,700
He's my father's apprentice.

265
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,500
My dad treats him even better than me.

266
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,740
I've always treated him
like a little brother.

267
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,060
Quick, call me sister.

268
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,200
Quickly.

269
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,880
Sister.

270
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,860
From now on, I'll rely on you.

271
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,000
Is that okay?

272
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,240
Auntie, don't worry.

273
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,460
I'll look after him in the future.

274
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,480
Look,

275
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,780
I have made another mistake.

276
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,120
If I had a daughter like you,

277
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,220
that would be great.

278
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,480
I've struggled so much,

279
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,780
but I haven't had a daughter.

280
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,300
What's good about sons?

281
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,340
They just cause trouble.

282
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,640
Daughters are always

283
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,300
the most thoughtful.

284
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,900
Brother and sister,

285
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,940
that's also good.

286
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,100
Both of you

287
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,900
must take care of each other.

288
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,180
You're not young anymore.

289
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,240
You should know

290
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,540
how to take care of your dad
in the future.

291
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,140
We've received the third call from Hong Kong
asking for an explanation.

292
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,700
Who will explain the situation?

293
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,980
Last week, after receiving a warning
about severe weather,

294
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,100
all ships on this route stopped.

295
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,500
But the storm ended yesterday.

296
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,320
It's been over 20 hours.

297
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,700
Why hasn't shipping resumed yet?

298
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,180
The passenger volume has surged,

299
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,700
causing congestion on the route.

300
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,100
Currently,

301
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,820
there's still a queue.

302
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,900
Both passenger and cargo shipping

303
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,100
serve people.

304
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,420
There are three days left.

305
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,940
I don't care what methods you use,

306
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,420
but this batch of goods must be delivered
within the contract period.

307
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,800
Manager,

308
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,660
I have a suggestion.

309
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,940
Go ahead.

310
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,160
I know cargo transportation

311
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,260
is Europa's traditional business,

312
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,860
and passenger transportation
is a new service

313
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,420
opened in Shanghai in recent years.

314
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,980
To build a good reputation
for the new business,

315
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,500
priority has been given
to open new routes.

316
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,380
This can be understood.

317
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,760
But is it possible

318
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,640
to integrate the two businesses?

319
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,900
This way, no one has to yield to anyone.

320
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,100
No one has to yield?

321
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,500
You want them to fight at the ports?

322
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,160
Because I found in the data
that the passenger

323
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,940
occupancy rate of the ferries
in the past two months

324
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,180
was less than 50 percent.

325
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,720
So, can't we use the remaining capacity

326
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,700
to carry goods?

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,100
You understand this?

328
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,920
I just happened
to read it in the newspaper

329
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,520
about the construction of the Zilan,

330
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,580
and I made a connection.

331
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,060
Also, this year coincides with
Hong Kong's return.

332
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,560
There will be more people traveling

333
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,440
for family visits and business.

334
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,940
The demand will increase.

335
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,280
If at this time,

336
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,000
we can do both businesses well,

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,020
we'll be seizing the market preemptively.

338
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
Alright.

339
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,280
Then I'll leave this batch of goods

340
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,380
for you to arrange.

341
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,000
If you don't do it well,

342
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,660
then your internship period will...

343
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,880
I'll definitely do it well.

344
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,920
I promise.

345
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,100
Wasn't this Hong Kong route
under your responsibility?

346
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,140
You came here
half a month earlier than her,

347
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,940
so how did she take over
as soon as she came?

348
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,060
Who knows?

349
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,840
She's from out of town

350
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,560
and wants to secure a stable job.

351
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,780
She's willing to do anything.

352
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,760
I also think so.

353
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,520
Xiaoying,

354
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,460
why are you going for blind dates?

355
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,360
What's wrong with that?

356
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,400
Can't I?

357
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,540
You are

358
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,040
not only beautiful

359
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,200
but also good at cooking.

360
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,920
You'll definitely find someone.

361
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,180
Why do you need to go for blind dates?

362
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,340
What's wrong with blind dates?

363
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,700
My dad and mom met through blind dates.

364
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,700
My dad loved my mom all his life.

365
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,600
Are you doing this

366
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,800
because of Xiaolu?

367
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,820
What are you saying?

368
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,140
Can't I pursue my own happiness?

369
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,120
Also,

370
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,060
what concern is it of yours
that I go on blind dates?

371
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,780
How is it not my concern?

372
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,880
I...

373
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,680
I understand now.

374
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,460
What do you understand?

375
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,780
You're the kind of weirdo

376
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,800
who can't find a wife for yourself

377
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,740
and can't stand others being happy.

378
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,920
That's why you went to great lengths

379
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,820
to fool me.

380
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,540
But I won't be fooled by you.

381
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,380
That's not true.

382
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,700
Oh, your orange juice.

383
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,420
You're not what I expected.

384
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,060
Oh, really?

385
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,420
Aunt Dong said you're a college graduate.

386
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,220
I thought you were a bookworm.

387
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,660
You're also not what I expected.

388
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,880
Really?

389
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
What do you usually

390
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,340
like to do?

391
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,320
Cooking.

392
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,940
I enjoy exploring various recipes,

393
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,400
steaming, stir-frying,

394
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,440
sweet, spicy, meat, vegetarian.

395
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,280
I can do them all.

396
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,860
Just cooking?

397
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,980
Doesn't cooking count?

398
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,920
Then...

399
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,280
Isn't it almost like

400
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,100
finding a nanny?

401
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,820
Besides that,

402
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,260
what else?

403
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,520
Watching movies.

404
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,420
I like both Stephen Chow
and Jackie Chan's movies.

405
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,040
You're just all about fun and games,

406
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,100
laughter and jokes.

407
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,140
Don't you usually read books?

408
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,820
Books?

409
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,080
Let's

410
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,420
cut to the chase.

411
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,060
Actually, I believe you can see

412
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,620
that with my conditions,

413
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,360
if my family hadn't arranged it,

414
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,020
I wouldn't have to
come out for blind dates.

415
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,300
Look at you.

416
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,580
If you were a bit prettier,

417
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,660
a bit slimmer,

418
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,380
had a better job,

419
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,740
and read more books,

420
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,500
then I might consider it.

421
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,340
But

422
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,540
with your current condition,

423
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,740
I don't think you're my type.

424
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,380
Are you done?

425
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,480
Before judging others,

426
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,780
take a good look at yourself.

427
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,640

You seem like such a respectable person,

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,300
yet you were expelled from school
for theft.

509
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,140
Do you have anything to say about it?

510
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,760
No.

00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,700

513
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,780
I should have realized earlier.

514
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,820
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

515
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,760
Before coming here,

516
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,980
I also applied for many jobs,

517
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,660
but because of this reason,

518
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,040
no company was willing to hire me.

519
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,320
But you must know,

520
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,600
for companies like ours,

521
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800
any dishonorable past

522
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,820

you want to dismiss me?

00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,160

530

the goods successfully arrived
at the port this morning.

531
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,640
So, she came to Shanghai
after being fired from the factory.

532
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,700
First, she was fired from the factory,

533
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,220
and then expelled from graduate school.

568
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,720
It's urgent.
My mother's having a relapse,

569
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,820
and I need a car.

570
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320

Xiaolu,

573
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,260
sorry, I forgot to tell you earlier.

574
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,860
The car went out of town
to pick up Secretary Hong.

575
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,140
Please think of another solution.

576
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,980
Where's the car?

577
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:45,720

580
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,940
Mrs. Lu,

581
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,940
you have been

582
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,940
taking care of us

583
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,700
over the years.

584
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,220
How could you just leave like that?

585
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,940
I still have so much to say

586
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,860
and don't know who to say it to.

587
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,480
Sorry for your loss.

588
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,060
Sorry for your loss, Xiaolu.

589
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,240
What did Ding Dezhong do wrong?

590
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,000
I heard he embezzled money
from the factory

591
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,040
and used it

592
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,000
for usury,

593
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,020
but the usury company got taken down.

594
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,480
He is so greedy.

595
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,320
Yeah.

596
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,540
Was it you who reported me?

597
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,640
What do you think?

598
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,720
I kindly allowed Qin Juan to date you,

599
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,400
and this is how you repay me?

600
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,440
I never expected you to be

601
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,300
such an ungrateful person.

602
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,680
Didn't you also do the same

603
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,740
to Dajiang back then?

604
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,540
I learned from you.

605
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,600
- You...
- Enough.

606
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,440
Cut the nonsense.

607
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,280
Get in the car quickly.

608
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,900
Stay in prison and repent.

609
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,460
Need any help?

610
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,160
See,

611
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,620

Look,

619
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,540
this is a photo of you in third grade.

620
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,940
At that time,

and were model students,

624
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,660
but you were

625
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,420
awarded for saving the cinema
from a fire.

626
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,800
Dad,

627
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,800
have I always

628
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,140
been disappointing to you both?

629
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,460
Of course not.

630
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,180
Your mom was so happy

631
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,720
and told everyone

632
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,240
how amazing

633
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,160
our Xiaolu is.

634
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,320
She almost stuck this photo

635
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,420
on her forehead.

636
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,900
But,

637
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,540
during my mom's final moments,

638
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,900
I wasn't by her side.

639
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,620
Dad, do you think I'm slow-witted?

640
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,180
I should've realized how ill my mom was.

641
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,320
If I had known
how serious her illness was,

642
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,320
I would never

643
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,780
have stayed away.

644
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,340
I should've come back earlier.

645
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,080
Dad,

646
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,380
don't worry.

647
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,260
I won't let you

648
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,820
worry about me like before.

649
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,460
Mom would be relieved
if she could see this.

650
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,000
Alright,

651
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,640
time to say goodbye.

652
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,320
Are you sure

653
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,180
you won't do business with us?

654
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,720
Guangnan,

655
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,500
you know I'm not cut out for that.

656
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,180
Do you remember

657
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,860
during Chinese New Year

658
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,420
when people asked for their wishes?

659
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,140
Everyone shared theirs,

660
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,540
but I didn't dare say mine

661
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,040
because I was afraid

662
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,260
you'd all laugh at me.

663
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,860
What is it?

664
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,320
I hope that

665
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,700
one day

666
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,700

667

I'll be the first to buy your album.

670
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,640
I'll be the second.
