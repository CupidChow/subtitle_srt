Earlier, I...

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Do you still want me
to help you catch that flasher?

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,480
Let me tell you, no way.

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,000
Hold on a second,

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
I just helped you out.

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
Why are you turning against me now?

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,480
You don't really think

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,800
I wanted to kiss you, do you?

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,120
You've got it all wrong.

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,440
I was just helping you out.

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,840
I just had to go all the way.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,120
Otherwise, how would you escape?

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,720
Could they really kidnap me?

37
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,840
Hard to say.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Lu Xiaolu,

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm starting to think

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,160
you're the pervert who followed me.

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,320
Bai Lan, you're too full of yourself.

42
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,880
Everyone else might not know
what you're like,

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,000
but I sure do.

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,320
You appear all angelic on the outside,

45
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,720
like a fairy come down to earth,

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,600
but in reality, you're just a scoundrel—

47
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
rough, cunning,

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,840
heartless,

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,760
and even a bit crazy.

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,040
Why should I follow you?

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
You know I'm a scoundrel

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
and still keep bothering me.

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,400
Do you believe I'd kill you with a knife?

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
I don't.

55
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,840
Because you can't beat me.

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,680
You...

57
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,740
What are you doing?

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,920
- Let go.
- I won't.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
You...

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
You even use sneak attack!

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,680
Thank goodness I reacted quickly.

62
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,600
You...

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
You kissed me without my consent.

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
That's harassment.

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,040
Apologize to me.

66
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,040
I won't.

67
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,640
You repaid kindness with enmity

68
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,480
and attacked suddenly.

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
Why should I apologize to you?

70
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,280
Bai Lan, let me tell you.

71
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,280
In my dictionary,

72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,000
there's no such thing as "I'm sorry"!

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,120
=Episode 3=
=Thank You, I'm Sorry for the Trouble=

74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,480
Why are you venting
on an iron bar in the morning?

75
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,400
Lu Xiaolu.

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
Good for you.

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,360
You are famous already.

78
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,080
You brought honor
to our maintenance department.

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
You've really got Dr. Bai.

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,160
What do you mean?

81
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,680
Lu Xiaolu,

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,840
the Labor Department received a report

83
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
saying you harassed Dr. Bai.

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,040
Come with me
to explain to the supervisor.

85
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,440
I am innocent.

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
There is nothing to explain.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,840
Come here.

88
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,880
Come.

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,240
Why

90
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,720
did you kiss her?

91
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,040
If you're not harassing her,

92
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,880
then

93
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,400
are you two together?

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,560
How is that possible?

95
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,480
She's such a two-faced woman.

96
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,280
I will never like her.

97
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,520
You should go explain to everyone

98
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,360
that you two...

99
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,240
No pulling and pushing during work hours.

100
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
You still know it's work hours?

101
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,080
There's a job for you.

102
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,880
- What kind of job?
- What is it?

103
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,760
The kind that'll open your eyes.

104
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,240
Dr. Bai.

105
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,480
Get out.

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,520
Sorry,

107
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,760
I didn't know there was a patient inside.

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,520
Dr. Bai, are you okay?

109
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,000
Lu Xiaolu didn't hurt you, did he?

110
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,280
This is my private matter.

111
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,240
No need to trouble you.

112
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,360
I actually have
something private to ask you.

113
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
Do you really have a boyfriend?

114
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
It's none of your business.

115
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,360
Looks like
this has had quite an impact on you.

116
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,800
I'll come back

117
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,710
when you're feeling better.

118
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,360
No need to see me out.

119
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,480
Secretary Bi is much better

120
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,920
than the workers at our factory.

121
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
He's a junior college graduate.

122
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,220
His dad is the deputy director
of the Second Light Industry Bureau.

123
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
You should consider it.

124
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,880
That way,
you don't need to study so hard.

125
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,400
Then why don't you go pursue him?

126
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
Since when do girls pursue guys?

127
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,000
Could Lu Xiaolu really like you?

128
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Impossible.

129
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,320
He was arrested because of me,

130
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,520
missed the college entrance exam,

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,840
lost his welding mask,

132
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,480
was suspected of being a flasher,

133
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,720
and was even forced
to fix a bicycle by me.

134
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,680
I think he's the person in the factory

135
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,520
who hates me the most.

136
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,400
So many things have happened
between you two.

137
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,440
I had no idea.

138
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
I don't want to talk about him.

139
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
Lie on your back.

140
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,920
I thought you were dead,

141
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,680
not moving for ten minutes.

142
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,280
Let's go watch a movie this weekend.

143
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,600
A movie?

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Is there anyone worth seeing recently?

145
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,280
All's Well, Ends Well Too?

146
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,000
Fight Back to School?

147
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,760
Why is your head always
filled with such dirty thoughts?

148
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,000
Disgusting.

149
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,880
What's dirty about that?

150
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,760
I just wanted to confirm something.

151
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,120
Confirm what?

152
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,560
In reality,

153
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,480
why do those women wear

154
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,680
such different things

155
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
than in the movies?

156
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,920
How do you know they're different?

157
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,760
Have you seen it?

158
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,960
You pervert!

159
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
You are still full of dirty thoughts.

160
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,880
Sleep.

161
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,040
Why did you throw that at me?

162
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,200
Bai Lan.

163
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,000
Bai Lan.

164
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,160
Xiaolu.

165
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,240
So much food.

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,280
Can you finish it all?

167
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,840
He helped Xiaoying catch the pig.

168
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,320
Xiaoying gave him the food.

169
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,720
Beautiful, huh?

170
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,000
Not at all.

171
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,360
I didn't even say what I was saying.

172
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
Why are you looking down
if it's not beautiful?

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,760
I didn't sleep well last night.

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
I'm tired.

175
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,120
You didn't sleep well?

176
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,160
He had a nightmare last night,

177
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,080
scared me.

178
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,960
What kind of dream?

179
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,840
Let me interpret it for you.

180
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,520
Since when do you interpret dreams?

181
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,360
Impressive.

182
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,200
All girls in our department can do it.

183
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,440
Just for fun.

184
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,160
Xiaolu, tell me.

185
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,560
Did you dream about

186
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,800
something or someone that scares you?

187
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Kind of.

188
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,800
If so,

189
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
there are two types of people
you're afraid of.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,880
One is someone
who will change your destiny,

191
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
and you're worried
about your destiny changing,

192
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,840
so you're afraid of them.

193
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,600
The other is someone

194
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,080
you love dearly,

195
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,400
and you're worried about losing them,

196
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,560
so you're afraid.

197
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
Which one are you?

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Aren't those

199
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,640
the same?

200
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,560
How could they be the same?

201
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,460
Are you even listening to me?

202
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,160
You care about the first one
and like the second.

203
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,210
- Guangnan.
- Since you like them...

204
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,970
Something's happened.

205
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,760
What happened? What's going on?

206
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,120
Come with me and you'll know,
and you too.

207
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,400
Come on, come on, hurry.

208
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,120
What's going on?

209
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,960
Wait a minute.

210
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,120
Turn that breaker back on for me.

211
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,960
Okay.

212
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,240
Do you know why they respect your master?

213
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,760
Because he's good.

214
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,600
It's because he fixed foreign water pumps,

215
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,960
beat the workshop manager,

216
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,560
and even blew up in the sky
with the reactor once.

217
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,720
Nothing major,
maybe a loose screw inside.

218
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,960
Open this big cover for me.

219
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,320
Okay, Master.

220
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,520
- Don't do it.
- Hurry up.

221
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Don't touch it.

222
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,440
This machine was imported from abroad.

223
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,760
(Ding Dezhong, Director of the Factory Office)
There's only one in Fucheng.

224
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,080
If you break it, who will be responsible?

225
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,600
I find it strange.

226
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,800
At this time, he shows up.

227
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,920
Ding,

228
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,920
tell me,

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
is there a machine in the factory
that I can't fix?

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,840
Every horse has its saddle.

231
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,320
This is a German machine.

232
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,600
We can invite a German expert to fix it.

233
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,640
Hey, Director Ding.

234
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
So what you're saying is

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,080
my master isn't qualified

236
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,600
to fix this German machine?

237
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,000
Look at him being so obsessed
with foreign things.

238
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,040
Foreigners' farts would be his perfume.

239
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,880
You...

240
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,960
Ding, when will

241
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,160
this expert arrive?

242
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,320
It might take a week.

243
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,240
A week?

244
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,960
That's too long.

245
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,480
- One long week.
- Once the production line stops,

246
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,030
one day's losses
are over a hundred thousand.

247
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,680
Waiting

248
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,520
for a week

249
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,560
means losing the bonus.

250
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
Anyway, no matter what,

251
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,600
nobody can touch it.

252
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,440
Hey, Ding.

253
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
What's more important,

254
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,080
the person or the machine?

255
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
I've said my piece.

256
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,320
You can touch it.

257
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,360
If you break it,

258
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,000
it's on you.

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,840
Master.

260
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,240
Let's go.

261
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,200
Should we talk to Master?

262
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,040
Sometimes it's better
to have fewer problems.

263
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,120
Talk to him how?

264
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,040
When has our Master

265
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,300
ever endured this kind of frustration?

266
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,660
He's about to retire, and that Ding Dezhong

267
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,090
is stomping all over him.

268
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,040
If it were me, I couldn't swallow
this insult either.

269
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,200
But the director
doesn't care about the shutdown.

270
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,920
Why rush ourselves?

271
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,840
Big Feet, you go talk to Master.

272
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,640
How can you do this to me?

273
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,640
Everyone knows
that person will get scolded.

274
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,280
Xiaolu is bold. Let him go.

275
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,640
So Xiaolu,

276
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,040
you do it.

277
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,080
Master,

278
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
I'll do it with you.

279
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,360
Let's do it together!

280
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,800
Count me in too.

281
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,000
You little brat,

282
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,640
look at what you've got.

283
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,320
How do we approach that?

284
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,120
There are two doors in that workshop,
one north and one south.

285
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,040
Enter from the south door,
turn right for 20 meters,

286
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,260
and you'll reach the ventilation area.

287
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,160
Enter the corridor
to reach the cold storage room

288
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,240
where the broken machine is.

289
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,000
But the security guards outside

290
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,320
the cold storage room patrol every night.

291
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,400
If we want to get in,

292
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,920
we'll need to distract the security guards.

293
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,280
Not bad, Xiaolu,

294
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,400
you've only been there twice.

295
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,400
How do you remember?

296
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,960
With my brain.

297
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,620
(Cold Storage, Corridor, Dark Hallway)
Master, will we fix it or not?

298
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,960
Just tell us about it.

299
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,000
You think you can read my mind?

300
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,200
Who said we would go?

301
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,040
No one's going.

302
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,920
Not a single person.

303
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,680
Who are you?

304
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,400
Master?

305
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,840
Didn't I tell you not to come?

306
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,840
But you came too.

307
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,680
I...

308
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,800
Anyone else?

309
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,240
Master.

310
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,480
- You all...
- Master.

311
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,200
Debao is the shiftleader.

312
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,120
If something happens to him,

313
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,880
the entire maintenance team
won't have anyone to lead.

314
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,440
So I didn't call him to come.

315
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,880
Look at you

316
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,400
making arrangements.

317
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,200
- Let's go.
- Come on.

318
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,240
Go, go, go.

319
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,280
Hurry.

320
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,440
Take this.

321
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,360
Someone's coming, someone's coming.

322
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,600
Over here, over here.

323
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,960
What's going on?

324
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,280
Ma! Ma!

325
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,120
There's a ghost, a ghost!

326
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,920
Why are you yelling like that?

327
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,880
Are you the ghost?

328
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,320
There really is a ghost.

329
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,480
Wearing a white robe, floating

330
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
with long legs.

331
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,160
What are you two waiting for?

332
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,280
Come with me.

333
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,320
You go!

334
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
Wait for me!

335
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,520
Wait for me!

336
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,040
(Security Department)
Wait for me! I'm scared!

337
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,480
People are coming.

338
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,280
Watch closely.

339
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,160
Big Feet,

340
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,760
please don't take it off.

341
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,520
Stop right there!

342
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,440
Hey, don't run!

343
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,960
Stop, be it ghost or human!

344
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,560
Hurry, hurry.

345
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,760
- Who are you?
- Stop running!

346
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,800
- Hurry, hurry!
- Don't run!

347
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,720
- Get him!
- Stop!

348
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,080
Stop right there!

349
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,520
I'm sorry, sorry.

350
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,640
- Dr. Bai?
- Big Feet?

351
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,600
Why are you pretending to be a ghost?

352
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,560
I'm not, I'm not.

353
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,360
Caught you!

354
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,880
Dr. Bai,

355
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,160
did you see a ghost?

356
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,400
Are you talking about this?

357
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,200
You go, you go, you go.

358
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,320
This is ridiculous.

359
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,310
- Dr. Bai, look.
- Dr. Bai.

360
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,920
Master!

361
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,400
Master!

362
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,520
Did you hear?

363
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,560
There was a ghost
in the bottling workshop last night.

364
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,320
Really?

365
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,400
Where did the ghost come from?

366
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,920
Can something like that happen?

367
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,360
Yeah, it's strange.

368
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,160
It's true,

369
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,600
and because there was a ghost last night,

370
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,800
the German machine is working now.

371
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,120
It's a shame that

372
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,680
Director Liu and Ding Dezhong
still won't let us work.

373
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,960
Why not?

374
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,440
Why do you think?

375
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,760
They insist on
waiting for that foreign expert.

376
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,040
(Warm Welcome to German Expert)

377
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,680
Do you need a hand?

378
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,040
No, I'll do it myself.

379
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,800
Okay.

380
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,200
So what do you think the problem is?

381
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,280
Is it because of the machine's engine?

382
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,560
Of course not.

383
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,000
This is not our original screw.

384
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
I don't know where it came from,

385
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,870
but it definitely shouldn't be here.

386
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,280
Is this not an original one?

387
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,120
No.

388
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,360
He said that this screw is not original.

389
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,960
Explain it to me.

390
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,440
Why was there a Chinese screw

391
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,720
in the German machine?

392
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,640
The German machine

393
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,320
is used in China,

394
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,400
so it's not surprising
to find a Chinese screw in it.

395
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,560
If there were an American screw,

396
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,200
that would be strange, wouldn't it?

397
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,560
Bai Lan, could you explain to him

398
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
what the German expert said?

399
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,280
The German expert said that

400
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,000
we cannot change machine parts
without authorization,

401
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
otherwise

402
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,050
they will no longer provide
maintenance services

403
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,040
and we will have to pay
a penalty of 100,000 yuan.

404
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,400
A hundred thousand

405
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,320
for just one screw?

406
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,440
Isn't that robbery, Director?

407
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,640
Mr. Niu,

408
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,200
I have great respect for you
after all the years

409
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,360
you've worked in the factory.

410
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,240
We should value contract

411
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,800
and honesty,

412
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,560
or nobody will work with you.

413
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,680
The factory pays me

414
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,800
and I do what I should do.

415
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,520
I don't know anything

416
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
about a contract.

417
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,920
I've never read it anyway.

418
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,960
Get out of the way.

419
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,040
Director,

420
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,120
we shut the machines down

421
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,920
just for this little screw?

422
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,120
We lost over

423
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,800
one hundred thousand a day

424
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,920
and you know that.

425
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,280
Mr. Niu,

426
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,160
you are an old employee of our factory.

427
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,760
I remember you were already here
when I entered the factory.

428
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,560
But why are you
becoming unreasonable now?

429
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
If I remember correctly,

430
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,680
you're about to turn 55 in two years,
right?

431
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,200
What are you trying to say?

432
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,040
We won't discuss who's right or wrong

433
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,360
in this matter for now,

434
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,160
but for the sake of our factory's interests,

435
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,440
we should give the Germans an explanation.

436
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,720
What explanation do you want?

437
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,600
What do you want?

438
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,600
If you want to fire me, go ahead.

439
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,760
If that's your attitude, how will we

440
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,720
- solve this matter?
- Master!

441
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,100
- Xiaolu.
- Master.

442
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,120
Lu Xiaolu,

443
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,120
why are you

444
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,160
in every trouble?

445
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,200
Director Liu,

446
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
I came up with the idea

447
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,680
to fix the machine that day,

448
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,080
I drew the topographic map,

449
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,720
and I handed the tools to my master.

450
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,400
If you want to punish someone, punish me,

451
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,280
not my master.

452
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,240
I kept watch that night.

453
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,440
I did that too.

454
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,760
Anyway,

455
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,560
my master's business is our business.

456
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,760
You can just fire us all.

457
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,160
Do you think Big Feet can do it?

458
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,500
Among the few of us,

459
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,000
he is the only one
who knows a little English.

460
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,800
- Hello.
- It has to be him.

461
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,920
Tell him

462
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,080
Mr. Niu is our master.

463
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,360
Hey, man.

464
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,280
Don't be arrogant.

465
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,120
Do you know who we are?

466
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,320
We apologize to him.

467
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,760
Believe it

468
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,040
or no believe it,

469
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,160
we can beat you down.

470
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,000
We are sincere.

471
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,480
Let you see what we are.

472
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,000
You better shut up.

473
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,240
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

474
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,440
- Lu Xiaolu.
- You better run. Beat it.

475
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,280
Come out with me.

476
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,680
- Go.
- Eat. Eat.

477
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,680
What are you doing?

478
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,680
That's also what I want to ask you.

479
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,400
I am trying to apologize to him.

480
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,520
We admit that

481
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,820
violating the contract was wrong,

482
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,040
but replacement comparison method

483
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,200
is a basic method

484
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,640
that I knew about since middle school.

485
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,200
He wouldn't even let us touch it.

486
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
I just want him to trust us.

487
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,840
Rules are rigid,

488
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,080
but people can not be.

489
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,640
Could you please stop causing trouble?

490
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,360
Trouble?

491
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,880
Are you also just like Bi Zhigang

492
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,960
and Ding Dezhong,

493
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,680
thinking we workers know nothing

494
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,560
but making trouble?

495
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,600
Isn't that true?

496
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,720
You sneaked into the workshop at night

497
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,060
and let Big Feet play the ghost,

498
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,580
and now you are
threatening the German expert.

499
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,360
Didn't you do all that?

500
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,740
How do you know about Big Feet
playing a ghost?

501
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
Do you think you are being a hero

502
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
and solving problems?

503
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,160
Let me tell you,

504
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,560
in my eyes,
you're just like a clumsy bear.

505
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,360
Master,

506
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,720
do I really

507
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,280
look like a bear?

508
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,480
Bear?

509
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,280
You are my bloodline,

510
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,360
how can you be a bear?

511
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,080
Bloodline?

512
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,040
What do you mean?

513
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,880
Your veins flow

514
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,920
with my blood.

515
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,880
Didn't your mom tell you?

516
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,720
No, no, no, Master,

517
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
you can't say things like that.

518
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,440
What do you mean my veins flow
with your blood?

519
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,400
You mean my mom...

520
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,560
You little rascal,

521
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,200
what are you thinking?

522
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,560
When you were little,

523
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,560
you fell down the stairs

524
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
in the factory

525
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,720
and got seriously injured.

526
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,160
We have the same blood type,

527
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,080
so I gave you a big bag of blood.

528
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,760
You scared me there,

529
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,640
you shouldn't start the story like that.

530
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,720
Drink up, Master.

531
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,360
Drink.

532
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,920
You have

533
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,000
my blood flowing in you,

534
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,000
so your temper

535
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,880
and character are just like mine

536
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,400
when I was young.

537
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,800
The day

538
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,120
you joined the maintenance team,

539
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,880
when I saw you,

540
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,120
I thought,

541
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,800
isn't this my son?

542
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,990
Mr. Niu,

543
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,080
think before you say anything!

544
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,920
If he's your son,

545
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,840
then what am I?

546
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,600
So,

547
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,120
you two can be

548
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,280
brother and sister.

549
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,120
No!

550
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,600
He can't be my brother.

551
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,560
Wait,

552
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,840
why is she angry?

553
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,880
I've been

554
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,560
in this factory

555
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,880
for over 40 years,

556
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,600
never late

557
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,280
or left early once.

558
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,400
When Xiaoying's mother passed away,

559
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
I only took half a day off.

560
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,880
There's no machine in this factory
that I can't fix.

561
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,600
With me around,

562
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,240
I'll never let the production line stop.

563
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,760
But they

564
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,440
said I'm

565
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,880
outdated

566
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
and asked me to leave.

567
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,160
I...

568
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,440
Master,

569
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,720
don't be sad.

570
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,960
You still have me.

571
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,240
Good.

572
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,160
Good.

573
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,040
(Gongyuan)
We are very sorry for this mistake.

574
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,720
Hope there will be opportunities
for cooperation.

575
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,840
Bye-bye.

576
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,400
Come in.

577
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,040
Secretary Bi.

578
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,440
Dr. Bai?

579
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,120
Why are you here?

580
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,680
This is for you.

581
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,320
For me?

582
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,160
Yes.

583
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,840
Didn't you say last time
that you wanted to learn English?

584
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,480
These tapes should be helpful.

585
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,760
(University English)

586
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,720
I appreciate it.

587
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
Next time, just let me know.

588
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,280
You didn't have to come personally.

589
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
I could go pick it up.

590
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,480
How about this?
I'll treat you to dinner tonight

591
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,480
as a token of thanks.

592
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,560
No need to be so formal.

593
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,200
I'm not being formal with you.

594
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,200
By the way,

595
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,320
are all the contracts
of the factory with you?

596
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,160
Yes.

597
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,560
Can I borrow the contract signed with

598
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,440
the German manufacturer?

599
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,680
I mainly want to learn

600
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,960
how English contracts are written.

601
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,840
Although my spoken English is not bad,

602
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,400
reading is quite difficult for me.

603
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,680
So, I thought I could learn a bit more.

604
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,360
It's better to be a slow learner
than not at all.

605
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,760
How can you be a slow learner?

606
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,160
You're so smart.

607
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,680
So, are you refusing to lend it to me?

608
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,240
Of course not.

609
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,360
Well, I...

610
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,520
You can't take the contract
out of this room.

611
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,600
It's a rule.

612
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,880
I'll read it here.

613
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,840
You can watch me.

614
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,960
There won't be a problem.

615
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,560
Okay, okay.

616
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,920
- Wait for me a moment.
- Sure.

617
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
For January and February...

618
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Wait, hey!

619
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,320
Wait a minute! Hey!

620
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,760
Dr. Bai!

621
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
What is this?

622
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,680
Hop on!

623
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,040
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

624
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,880
Let's go.

625
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,360
Can you go any faster?

626
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,520
Don't worry. Xiaolu will surely
hold the German expert off.

627
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,760
Dr. Smith.

628
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,800
Lan.

629
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,240
Sorry.

630
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,480
This man is crazy.

631
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,680
- Xiaolu!
- Please take me away from here.

632
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,000
I just got something
very urgent to tell you.

633
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,360
This is our contract.

634
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,560
I just read through it.

635
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,640
And seems like we were not the one
who broke it.

636
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,280
So according to it, we should

637
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,280
be given solutions within three days.

638
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,000
After which we can open the shell
of the machine.

639
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,840
What?

640
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,640
So your company is the one
who breached the contract first.

641
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,080
Your persistence really beat me down.

642
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,200
This is not just about persistence.

643
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,880
It's just that we have the right

644
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,720
to speak for ourselves and find out the truth.

645
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,720
Can you let me go

646
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,520
if we withdraw
our breach-of-contract claim?

647
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,200
Of course!

648
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,160
We are friends.

649
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,640
Friend.

650
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,480
Xiaolu...

651
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,800
Although we don't have to
compensate the Germans anymore,

652
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,920
is this your achievement?

653
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,440
It's all thanks to

654
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,080
Dr. Bai Lan.

655
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,000
However,

656
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,880
for not following
the factory's regulations

657
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,960
and repairing equipment privately,

658
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,000
I still

659
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,680
need to punish you.

660
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,200
Plus that Lu Xiaolu,

661
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,680
you three will all be punished.

662
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,000
Director,

663
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,760
are you only punishing the three of us?

664
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,960
Our master won't be punished?

665
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,440
What does this have to do with Mr. Niu?

666
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,880
He fixed the machine,

667
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,080
so let's call it even.

668
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,480
Thank you, Director. Thank you.

669
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,200
But to redeem himself,

670
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,520
Xiaolu also got injured.

671
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,960
Is this a negotiation with me?

672
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,160
No.

673
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Considering your

674
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,760
dedication to the factory,

675
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,240
just write

676
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,000
a self-criticism report each.

677
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,000
That's it?

678
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,280
You want more?

679
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,320
How about

680
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,440
you write it in another language?

681
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,560
No problem.

682
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,400
Let's go.

683
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,800
Thank you, Director.

684
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,680
Dr. Bai.

685
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,680
Stop pretending to be asleep

686
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,600
and get up.

687
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,360
If you keep sleeping,
you'll really be a bear.

688
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
I'm warning you,

689
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,480
don't call me a bear again.

690
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,960
Didn't you see

691
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,880
how cool and stylish I looked

692
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,400
in that windbreaker?

693
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,080
Yeah, you did look cool,

694
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,320
like a kid

695
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,240
wearing adult clothes.

696
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,320
But what you did

697
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,040
was quite manly.

698
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,640
(Gongyuan)

699
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,480
What are you doing?

700
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
- Master.
- Master.

701
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,320
When I'm not around,

702
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,960
no one's working?

703
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,520
No, we were just waiting
to welcome you back.

704
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,840
Glib-tongued.

705
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,920
Big Feet,

706
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,360
sing a song to celebrate!

707
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,760
You can sing, Big Feet?

708
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,600
Oh.

709
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,040
You didn't know?

710
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,280
Big Feet is the most famous

711
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,720
singer in our factory.

712
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,480
No, no, I really can't sing.

713
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,600
I really can't.

714
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,600
Set sail!

715
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,680
Depart!

716
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,560
