25
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,250
Professor Wang,

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,600
thank you for accepting me.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,400
You don't need to thank me.

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,960
This is the result of your hard work.

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,680
Moreover, with your work experience

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,880
in a state-owned factory,

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,920
you surely have a deeper understanding

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,440
of the urgent need
for economic system reform.

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,880
After the semester begins,

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,000
I hope you can engage in

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,740
more discussions with your classmates
on this topic.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,680
I believe

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,480
you have a bright future ahead.

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,520
No problem.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,960
Since I am able to return to campus,

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,880
I will cherish this opportunity.

41
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,080
The semester hasn't started yet,

42
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,490
and the dormitories
haven't been assigned.

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,240
Where are you staying?

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,480
I've rented a small place.

45
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,640
I want to get into study mode
as soon as possible.

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,360
Are you eager
to experience the atmosphere

47

of this big city, Shanghai?

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,240
Oh, by the way,

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,840
I heard from the admissions office that

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,520
your file hasn't arrived yet.

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,440
The semester is about to start.

52
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,000
Make a call and ask about it.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,040
Don't let it be a trouble.

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,960
Really?

55
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,680
Okay.

has a profound history.

59
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,480
I hope you can study hard here

60
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,880
and get good scores.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,650
(Public Telephone)
They haven't received the files?

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,760
How is that possible?

63
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,880
Every year, the files are sent out

64
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,720
from the factory months in advance.

65
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Is it stuck somewhere?

66
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,660
You have a cadre status,

67
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,160
so it's not handled
by our Labor Department

68
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,220
but the Administration Office.

69
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,240
You know that.

70
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,240
But I'll start school next Monday.

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,840
Can you ask again for me?

72
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,240
Okay, okay, don't worry.

73
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,600
I'll ask my uncle later

74
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,480
and call you when I have news.

75
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,320
Okay.

76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,600
Yeah.

77
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,880
Xiaolu?

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
There's a problem?

79
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,000
Bai Lan's personnel file
hasn't been received.

80
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,560
Didn't you say

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,960
you wouldn't be involved

82
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,200
in her affairs
after she went to Shanghai?

83
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,560
Did I say that?

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,320
Yes.

85
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,880
I forgot.

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,880

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,680
- What are you...
- Uncle Ma.

89

Let me in.

90
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
This isn't your concern.

91
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,800
I...

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,360
You need to calm down.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,840
Let me tell you,

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,560
Director Ding said it was sent out,

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,880
so it must have been sent.

96
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,200
Why would we lie to you?

97
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,080
You wouldn't lie to me,

98
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,240
but Ding Dezhong might.

99
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,360
Hey,

100
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,360
Xiaolu.

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,240
You're still part of the factory.

102
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,920
I'm not from now on.

103
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,640

104
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,680

Lu Xiaolu.

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,480
Outrageous!

107
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,120
Absolutely outrageous!

108
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
Secretary Hong, look at this.

109
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,800
Look at what he's done to my office.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,040
Ma, shouldn't we call the police?

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,240
That's enough.

112
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,480
Lu Xiaolu.

113
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,680
What are you doing?

114
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Secretary Hong, let me ask you.

115
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,240
Did the factory allocate a spot
for someone to go to college?

116
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,080
Yes, why?

117
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,520
Bai Lan got into graduate school.

118
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
Did the factory agree to let her go?

119
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
No problem.

120
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you think that

121
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,640
as a secretary, I would go back

122
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,640
on my word?

123
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,760
You wouldn't go back on your word,

124
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,280
but someone might.

125
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,680
Bai Lan is about
to start school in Shanghai,

126
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,800
and the school
still hasn't received her file.

127
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,160
Can you tell me why this is happening?

128
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,840
This is under
the Administration Office's jurisdiction.

129
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,280
Director Ding,

130
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,080
do you know what's going on?

131
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,720
How would I know?

132
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,160
You don't know?

133
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,960
Okay.

134
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
You said you sent it out,

135
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,740
show me the registered mail receipt.

136
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,360
I don't keep that kind of thing around,

137
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,720
I don't know where I put it.

138
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,560
Is that so?

139
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,560
- Of course.
- Feeling guilty?

140
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,440
Lu Xiaolu,

141
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,280
let me tell you,

142
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,280
stop trying to slander me.

143
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,360
I have better things to do.

144
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,040
Why would I keep Bai Lan's file?

Is this the Golden Peacock Food Factory?

146
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,540
Could you please transfer me
to the Administrative Office?

147
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,520
Secretary Hong,

148
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
I dare to bet with you that

149
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,680
the file is right in this drawer.

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,880
Do you believe it or not?

151
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,000
Can't I even take a call?

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,360
If I can't get the file today,

153
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,320
no one can do anything!

154
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,160

155
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Could you please transfer me
to the Administrative Office?

156
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,920
Director Ding,

157
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,680
open the cabinet

158
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,600
and let him see.

159
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,640
Secretary Hong, I don't have the key.

160
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,550
No need to trouble yourself.

161
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,760

162
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,440
- Look, look.
- Xiaolu!

163
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,440
I said it's not in there.

164
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,160
Lu Xiaolu,

165
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,480
stop making things difficult
for Director Ding.

166
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,960
Apologize to Director Ding

167
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,600
and let's just move on from this.

168
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,840
Apologize and move on?

169
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,480
Secretary Hong, you can't let him
get away with this.

170
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,840
Look at how
he's made a mess of my office.

171
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,160

where Bai Lan's file is?

181
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,720
end up with you?

182
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,760
Ding Dezhong gave it to my dad.

183
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,600
I stole it from his office.

184
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,560
Why are you helping me?

185
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
I am not helping you

186
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,920
but Bai Lan.

187
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,880
I remember you slapped Bai Lan

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,160
because of your dad.

189
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,960
(Good food at a low price,
long live delicious food)

190
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,840
You know,

191
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,760
everyone envies me because

192
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm the son of a deputy

193
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,040
factory director.

194
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
And then?

195
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,200
So what?

196
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,400
The person I envy and am jealous of

197
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,480
the most

198
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,760
is you.

199
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,520
Your cousin loves you.

200
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,840
Bai Lan loves you.

201
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,160
Your parents also love you.

202
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,720
You can be yourself.

203
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,560
You...

204
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,360
You can do whatever you want.

205
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,320
What about me?

206
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,840
I've been forced to follow my father's lead
since I was a kid.

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,480
Follow my father's lead!

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
Follow my father's lead!

209
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,560
But you know what he did.

210
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,600
You saw it.

211
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,520
Hey, I don't even know...

212
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
I just wanted to know

213
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,640
what it's like to be self-willed.

214
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,800
I also want to try

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
to follow my heart.

216
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,200
This,

217
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,080
this thing,

218
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,200
is my first try.

219
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,400
In a few days,

220
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,200
I'll be transferred away
from the food factory.

221
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
Farewell.

222
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,320
In my opinion,

223
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,680
they both deserve it.

224
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,680
That's right.

225
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,320
If Deputy Director Bi can do such things,

226
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,920
how much better can his son be?

227
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,800
I think Secretary Bi is pretty good.

228
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Good looks,

229
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
education,

230
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
and taste.

231
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,880
Although he didn't win Bai Lan over,

232
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,720
he truly loves her.

233
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,480
This is called deep affection.

234
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,760
Deep affection?

235
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,840
So you just said I'm good, right?

236
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,160
Then how about I marry you tomorrow?

237
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,880
Marry her?

238
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,320
Are you crazy? You are drunk!

239
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,640
(Welcome New Students)

240
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,480
Miss.

241
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,400
Hey, Miss.

242
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,040
Please wake up.

243
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,680
Why are you sleeping here?

244
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,360
Ma'am, you're finally back.

245
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,960
Hello, I'm Bai Lan.

246
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,120
I have something very important

247
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,160
to talk to you.

248
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,800
Because I don't have
your contact information,

249
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,720
I've been waiting here

250
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,840
since yesterday afternoon.

251
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,040
It's okay, take your time.

252
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,840
Please listen, my file
still hasn't been delivered,

253
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,560
but could you please
make an exception for me

254
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,120
and give me a little more time?

255
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,000
This is really important

256
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,880
for me.

257
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,200
Although I know it's against
the standard procedure.

258
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,280
The school has rules, you know.

259
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,320
Our school has already made
all the schedules

260
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,800
open to the whole society.

261
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,900
It's impossible to make an exception
for just one person.

262
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,520
But could you be a little flexible?

263
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,040
I've put in a lot of effort

264
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,800
to pursue this master's degree.

265
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,480
By 5:00 this afternoon,

266
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
we need to enter

267
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
all the new students' files.

268
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
If you can't get it here by then,

269
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,200
I might not be able to help you.

270
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,480
Can't you give me a bit more time?

271
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,640
If you can't make it this year,

272
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,680
why not try again next year?

273
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,920
Our school welcomes every student
who strives for progress.

274
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
- But...
- Sorry, I need to take this call.

275
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,040
Hey, Miss!

276
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,600
Miss!

277
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,760
Wait a moment.

278
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,640
The receiving office
just called to say that

279
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,200
a young man delivered your file

280
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,520
a minute ago.

281
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,440
Young man?

282
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,120
Yes, you will be accepted.

283
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,840
Oh, where is he?

284
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,800
He just left.

285
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,840
Okay.

286
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,320
- Thank you, Ma'am.
- You're welcome.

287
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,280
Lu Xiaolu!

288
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,120
Lu Xiaolu!

289
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,600
Stop right there!

290
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,200
Why are you running?

291
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,360
I'm...

292
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,960
I'm just here to deliver your file,

293
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,880
not to see you.

294
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,680
I have to catch a train.

295
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,960
You rushed over here in such a hurry

296
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,080
and haven't eaten yet, right?

297
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,480
Let me treat you to a meal
before you go.

298
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,920
Picking vegetables, huh?

299
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,240
You are off work?

300
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,600
We are here.

301
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,880
Shh,

302
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,960
keep it down. The landlord
is very sensitive to noise.

303
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,960
Okay.

304
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,680
Come in.

305
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,400
You've been living in

306
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,440
such a small place
for the past two months.

307
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,240
Anyway, school is starting soon,

308
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,760
and I'll move to the dormitory.

309
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,080
Oh, I have a lot of things.

310
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,320
Can you help me move them?

311
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,240
Looks like
there's no such thing as a free lunch.

312
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,440
Tell me.

313
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,080
Lu Xiaolu,

314
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,120
do you really have a grudge
against my suitcase?

315
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,280
- Who's it?
- Get up, get up.

316
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,040
Ma'am,

317
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,080
I've told you many times,

318
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,640
you have to knock before entering.

319
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,800
What are you doing?

320
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,440
Why is there so much noise?

321
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,600
I was moving a suitcase.

322
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,760
You know,

323
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,080
my nephew is studying downstairs.

324
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,200
He can hear even

325
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,960
the slightest noise from upstairs.

326
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
He's just a primary school student.

327
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
I know.

328
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,560
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,760
Miss Bai,

330
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,720
we agreed before that

331
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,480
you'd live here alone

332
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,840
without any issues.

333
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,440
But

334
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,200
if it's two people living here,

335
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,000
I definitely wouldn't have agreed.

336
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,080
You young people

337
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,040
are too noisy

338
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,400
at night.

339
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,680
Young man,

340
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,800
come out.

341
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Stop hiding.

342
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
Ma'am,

343
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,200
this is my younger brother.

344
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
He's not feeling well.

345
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
He came to Shanghai
for medical treatment.

346
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,520
When is he leaving then?

347
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,400
He'll leave
after he finishes his treatment.

348
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,400
The sooner, the better.

349
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,840
Oh my...

350
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,920
It's really unlucky for me.

351
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,080
He can't stay here for long.

352
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay.

353
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,400
It's the last box, right?

354
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,920
Thank you.

355
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,960
Bai Lan,

356
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,080
you've moved to the dormitory?

357
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,000
Is this your boyfriend?

358
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,960
Ah, no.

359
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,240
- No.
- Yes.

360
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,320
Well, you two go ahead.

361
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,440
I have a class to attend.

362
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,960
Is that the Oriental Pearl Tower?

363
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,040
It's really tall.

364
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,760
Yes,

365
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,520
too bad I don't

366
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,720
get a chance to take you around,

367
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,160
and show you some good places to eat.

368
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,280
These pan-fried buns are delicious.

369
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,280
Didn't you say before that

370
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,320
delicious food isn't necessarily
found in fancy restaurants,

371
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,000
but in those street corners?

372
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,440
Let me try your beef bun.

373
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,760
Want to try mine?

374
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,880
Young man,

375
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,200
can you help me take a picture?

376
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,040
Sure.

377
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,440
Three, two, one.

378
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,520
Thank you, thank you.

379
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,960
Do you want me
to take a picture of you two?

380
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,680
No need, we didn't bring a camera.

381
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,160
It's okay, I have one.

382
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,600
I'll take the picture and send it to you.

383
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,000
Let's take one together.

384
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,960
We won't know
when we'll meet again after you leave.

385
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,040
Right, right, make a memory.

386
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,280
Okay.

387
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,760
Get closer, closer.

388
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,800
Okay, look here.

389
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,960
Smile.

390
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,080
One, two, three.

391
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,600
Okay.

392
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,360
Give me your address.

393
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,160
Here's my address.

394
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,400
Okay,

395
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
I'll make sure

396
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,440
to send you the photo,

397
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,120
but it might take a while.

398
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,560
But you're both young

399
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,960
- and you can wait.
- Thank you.

400
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,040
- Okay, thanks.
- Goodbye.

401
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,160
Once I receive the picture,

402
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,040
I'll send it to you.

403
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,200
Okay.

404
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,800
And you can write to me.

405
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
You have my address, right?

406
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,600
Yeah,

407
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,960
I know it.

408
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,160
Maybe

409
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,480
I should leave in a couple of days.

410
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,240
You're right.

411
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,840
It's rare for me to visit Shanghai,

412
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,160
but I haven't seen much yet.

413
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,160
I'll stay for a couple more days, okay?

414
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,600
Sure.

415
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,480
Hey, what's with this kid?

416
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,280
He's been in Shanghai for so many days.

417
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,480
Why hasn't he come back yet?

418
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,100
It's rare for him to go to a big city.

419
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,680
Let him have some fun
and broaden his horizons.

420
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,880
Isn't that good?

421
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,360
Are you heartless or what?

422
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,640
Come on, dear, have a bite.

423
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,320
Am I not letting him have fun?

424
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm worried that

425
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,000
he won't come back.

426
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,840
Where else would he go if not back?

427
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,440
He'll definitely come back.

428
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,280
Don't worry.

429
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,000
Look at this one.

430
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,680
Phone call.

431
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
- Hello?
- Mom.

432
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,480
Lu Xiaolu,

433
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,040
you finally remembered to call home.

434
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,800
(Convenience Store)
Mom, calm down.

435
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,520
I want to discuss something with you.

436
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,000
Just say it.

437
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,480
I want to stay in Shanghai for a while.

438
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,360
I still want to go to college.

439
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,240
Lu Xiaolu,

440
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,920
you said

441
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,080
you wouldn't repeat a year

442
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,160
or go to college.

443
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,520
Now

444
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,400
you're saying you want to go to college?

445
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,120
Do you want me to spend my life
carrying sacks in the warehouse?

446
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,040
Even if I go back to the repair team,

447
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,240
what's the difference?

448
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,680
It is still a dead-end job.

449
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,520
I don't want to live like that again.

450
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,840
After all this talk,

451
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,880
it's still because of Bai Lan, right?

452
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,560
Yes,

453
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,720
it's for Bai Lan.

454
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,800
I came to Shanghai because of her.

455
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,480
But after arriving here,

456
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,040
I realized that Shanghai and Fucheng
are like two different worlds.

457
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,240
Looking at these skyscrapers,

458
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
I feel full of motivation.

459
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,000
Mom,

460
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
I want to work hard

461
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,040
and strive for a better future.

462
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,920
Is that not okay?

463
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,360
Let me talk to him.

464
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,200
Mom,

465
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,280
why aren't you saying anything?

466
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,560
Xiaolu,

467
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,800
you really need to think this through.

468
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,880
What is that place?

469
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,600
That's Shanghai.

470
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,720
It's not easy to stand firm in Shanghai.

471
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,280
(Convenience Store, Public Telephone)

472
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,640
It takes a lot of hardship,

473
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,840
it's not easy at all.

474
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,000
Mom, I know it's not easy,

475
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,120
but I still want to give it a try.

476
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,320
I plan to

477
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,440
start looking for work today,

478
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,560
earning money to support myself

479
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,360
while preparing for next year's
college entrance exam.

480
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,720
Who knows,
if things go well in the future,

481
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,560
I might be able to bring
you and Dad here to enjoy life.

482
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,840
Don't worry about me and your dad.

483
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,720
But you have to think carefully

484
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,520
about your future plans.

485
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,160
Hello?

486
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
Oh honey,

487
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,880
your health matters the most.

488
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,360
Eat more fruit to calm down.

489
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,200
Calm down.

490
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,840
Here you go.

491
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,640
Bai Lan,

492
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,520
there's a new student exchange meeting
in the auditorium tonight.

493
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,360
Are you going?

494
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,840
I'm not going.

495
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,160
I have a friend coming to see me.

496
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,080
You mean boyfriend?

497
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,840
Come on.

498
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,160
Please come.

499
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,000
Next!

500
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,520
Your resume.

501
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,520
What?

502
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Your resume.

503
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,640
That.

504
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,840
Xiaolu.

505
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,400
Oh, right.

506
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,880
- Xiaolu.
- What position are you applying for?

507
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,080
What position?

508
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,280
Position.

509
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
The position you're applying for.

510
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,640
Maintenance Manager.

511
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,440
Maybe assistant?

512
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,320
Alright,

513
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,560
go back and wait for news.

514
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,400
Okay.

515
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,840
(Taihe Hotel)

516
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
I've worked as an electrician,

517
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,820
handling both high and low voltage,
installation, debugging,

518
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,000
and line maintenance, no problem.

519
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,860
(Housekeeping Department)
I just arrived in Shanghai,

520
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,080
so I'm not very familiar with the area,

521
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,160
but I can learn.

522
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,200
(Are you smiling today?)
Smell? What smell?

523
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,680
I have a smell?

524
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,120
But I took a shower.

525
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,840
Could you reconsider?

526
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,640
I really can learn.

527
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,520
Alright, don't move.

528
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,880
Not bad.

529
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,800
Let me see.

530
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,880
Look. It's beautiful.

531
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,720
It's all a blur.

532
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,640
Juan.

533
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,010
(Convenience Store, Public Telephone)
I've received the things you sent me,

534
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:43,680
such a big box.

535
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,120
They are some items you left in the dorm

536
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,440
and some snacks.

537
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,200
I know you like them.

538
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,000
They're all the things I love,

539
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,840
and I've been missing them for so long.

540
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
You've been gone for so long.

541
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,600
Don't you miss me?

542
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,800
I see.

543
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,560
It's because Xiaolu is with you,

544
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,120
and you have no time to miss me, right?

545
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,320
How is that possible?

546
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,600
Of course, I miss you too.

547
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,600
But speaking of which,

548
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,400
thanks to you both
for sending me the file,

549
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,640
otherwise, I would have
got expelled from school.

550
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,090
It's really thanks to that file

551
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,880
that you and Xiaolu could meet again.

552
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,320
Otherwise, the misunderstanding
wouldn't have been resolved.

553
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,320
Misunderstanding?

554
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,560
What misunderstanding?

555
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,720
You are back.

556
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Come on, give it to me.

557
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,710
Alright.

558
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,160
Look,

559
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,880
I've fixed the curtains.

560
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,120
Little Pouter told me everything.

561
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,200
What did she say to you?

562
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,520
She said there's only one spot
for further education in the factory,

563
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,760
and you gave it to me.

564
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,280
Why didn't you
tell me about this earlier?

565
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,920
There was only one spot,

566
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,600
and I couldn't do anything about it.

567
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,400
So I had to...

568
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,960
From now on, no matter what happens,

569
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,000
you have to tell me, okay?

570
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,760
I want to be involved
in every step of your life.

571
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,680
Bai Lan.

572
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,760
I'm afraid...

573
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,460
I'm afraid I won't be able to do anything,

574
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,960
like last time.

575
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,480
It won't be like that,

576
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,000
because we're together again.

577
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,200
Yeah.

578
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,560
I can't finish all of this by myself.

579
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,160
So I need your help.

580
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,560
Master,

581
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,680
your meal is so plentiful.

582
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,240
There's a reason.

583
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,720
She's been like this

584
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,720
since Xiaolu left.

585
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,800
Eat.

586
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,440
Smoked duck.

587
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,820
Crispy outside, tender inside.

588
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,680
I learned this recently.

589
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
Xiaoying, Xiaoying,

590
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,040
that's enough.

591
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,800
Sit down and eat with us.

592
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,360
Yes, let's eat together.

593
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,720
Too salty.

594
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,080
It's not salty.

595
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,200
Not too salty at all.

596
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,920
It's just right.

597
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,160
Right, Master?

598
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,800
Oh, right. Not too salty.

599
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,880
Nonsense. It's definitely too salty.

600
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,400
Xiaolu loves sweet food the most.

601
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,840
He loves to eat lychee meat,

602
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,760
and would finish
the whole dish every time.

603
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,560
And southern fried liver.

604
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,680
It's so sweet,

605
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,560
ordinary people can't eat it every day.

606
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,320
But he just loves sweet food.

607
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,520
Xiaolu doesn't actually like sweet food.

608
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,400
- Actually, it's me...
- I can also cook spicy food.

609
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,320
But now that he's gone,

610
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,800
no one will eat the food
I make every day.

611
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,200
If he doesn't eat,

612
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,880
I will.

613
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,760
Slow down, slow down.

614
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,520
Stop writing, honey.

615
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,320
Xiaolu is already feeling it.

616
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,080
Keep writing, keep writing.

617
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,240
Come on, continue.

618
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,000
I have a suggestion.

619
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,920
Don't you like
watching "Shanghai Beach"?

620
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,120
I'll accompany you to watch it again.

621
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,240
Don't mention "Shanghai Beach" to me.

622
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,400
I'm so annoyed with Shanghai

623
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,480
and "Shanghai Beach" right now.

624
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,360
I won't mention it again.

625
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,120
What's wrong?

626
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,280
Is your stomach hurting again?

627
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,600
This has happened so many times.

628
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,480
Should we go to the hospital to check?

629
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,440
What's going on?

630
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,080
I'll massage your hand.

631
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,040
Go to the hospital?

632
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,400
The factory doesn't reimburse
medical expenses anymore.

633
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,520
Why waste money?

634
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,760
Honey,

635
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,920
don't let this rascal get to you.

636
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,240
With just one word from you,

637
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,680
I'll immediately take a train to Shanghai

638
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,040
and bring him back to apologize to you.

639
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,000
Bluffing.

640
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,880
You're just bluffing.

641
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Don't you know

642
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,600
what kind of temper your son has?

643
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,840
When he sets his mind on something,

644
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,960
who can change his mind?

645
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,480
Tell me,

646
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,400
what's the weather like in Shanghai now?

647
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,520
Shanghai

648
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,160
should be colder than Fucheng.

649
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,880
It's already the beginning of autumn.

650
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,320
I wonder if Xiaolu

651
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,560
brought enough clothes

652
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,520
and if he can handle

653
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,320
the food in Shanghai.

654
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,080
(Xiaolu, come home. Miss you.
Xiaolu, be safe and smooth.)

655
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:19,760
(Mom and Dad miss you in Fucheng.)

656
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
You said you have maintenance experience?

657
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,400
I worked in a factory
with over a thousand people.

658
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,920
I can repair circuits,
pipelines, water pumps,

659
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
and blowers—all of it.

660
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,950
Do you have an electrician's certificate?

661
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,020
An electrician's certificate?

662
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,520
Well, we do need an electrician here,

663
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,480
but without a certificate,
you can't start working.

664
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,880
Manager, I do know how to do it.

665
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,040
Why would I lie to you?

666
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,640
Our factory machines were

667
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,760
much more complex than yours here.

668
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,720
I can fix them all.

669
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,920
If you don't believe me,
give me a trial period,

670
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,760
how about that?

671
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,200
Nowadays, you need a certificate
for everything.

672
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,400
No certificate, no discussion.

673
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,480
You should leave now.

674
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
(Personal Resume: Lu Xiaolu,
native of Fucheng)

675
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,520
Fellow-townsman?

676
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,840
Yes! Fellow-townsman!

677
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,600
How about this,

678
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,520
the intern's salary will be halved,

679
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,620
you can work here if you accept it.

680
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,920
Okay, no problem.

681
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,580

That's not good.

701
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,200
Let's endure a little longer.

702
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,840
When I save up enough money,

703
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,760
we'll move to a bigger house.

704
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,800
How about that?

705
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,880
Did you find a job?

(Work ID)

707
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,720
Tomorrow I can officially start working

708
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,640
as an electrician.

709
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,800
The manager said that if I do well,

710
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,040
I'll get promoted and a raise.

711
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,880
Really?

712
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,920
I also have good news.

713
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,320
Our teacher recommended me for a job

714
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,480
at a fashion company

715
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,800
with a salary.

716
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,200
A fashion company?

717
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,600
That sounds good.

718
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,960
It's just what you like.

719
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,880
But your main task is still studying.

720
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,080
Don't tire yourself out too much

721
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,040
for the sake of making money.

722
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,600
If we don't make money,
how can we move to a bigger house?

723
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,720
I'll support you.

724
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,120
Who would believe that?

725
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,280
Do we need

726
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,640
that cloth curtain?

727
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,400
Who knows if you'll do something

728
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,800
in the middle of the night?

729
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,480
Can a curtain stop me?

730
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,240
The landlord will hear you.

731
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,640
When I earn enough money,

732
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,440
I'll rent a bigger house

733
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,200
right outside your dormitory.

734
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,680
Then we won't have to be

735
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,960
so careful anymore.

736
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,920
Whenever you finish class,

737
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,160
I'll cook for you.

738
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,680
Do you like animals?

739
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,520
How about we raise a puppy?

740
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,280
I've already thought of a name for it.

741
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,560
Lucky.

742
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,840
We can also raise a parrot.

743
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,480
So every morning when we wake up,

744
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,520
we'll hear it say,

745
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,320
"Bai Lan, good morning,

746
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,640
Xiaolu, good morning."

747
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,960
It must be fun.

748
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,960
When it's mealtime,

749
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,480
you'll sit down at the table

750
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,960
and shout loudly,

751
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,640
"Xiaolu, I'm hungry!"

752
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,800
At that moment,

753
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,560
I'll bring the meals I've prepared

754
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,600
to the table.

755
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,320
You'll unabashedly devour the bones.

756
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,560
Oh no,

757
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,280
you'll handle the pork ribs,

758
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,120
and the puppy will handle the bones.

759
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,160
How beautiful.

760
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,720
After we finish eating,

761
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,240
if we have nothing else to do,

762
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,640
we'll watch TV.

763
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,320
While watching,

764
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,880
we'll both get sleepy.

765
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,640
At this point, I suddenly realize
you haven't brushed your teeth yet.

766
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,080
I'll remind you to brush them,

767
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,040
but you won't.

768
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,560
You insist that I carry you to bed.

769
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,320
I brush my teeth every day.

770
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,120
But

771
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,440
will this come true?

772
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,600
Yes.

773
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,280
So let's work hard together.

774
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
No problem.
