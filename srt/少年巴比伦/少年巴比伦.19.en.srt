(Shanghai)

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,310
Why didn't you let me know

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,470
before heading to Fucheng
straight from Lhasa?

27
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,570
Mr. Huang,

28
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,850
for these past few years,

29
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,840
almost every weekend
I've been working overtime.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,420
This is the first time,

31
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,510
do I need to report to you?

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,510
Wanna file a complaint?

33
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,680
Went back to see an old friend?

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,860
Yes,

35
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,520
an old friend got married.

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,120
Hello, Mr. Chen.

37
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,010
Yes.

38
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,380
The contract for Mulan Winery

39
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,070
is about to get ready.

40
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,650
It should be sent to you

41
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,630
within about a week.

42
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,680
Alright, don't worry.

43
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,890
When you come to Shanghai,

44
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,250
I'll personally take you
to tour the Bund.

45
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,790
Alright, thank you.

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,770
Goodbye.

47
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,250
I heard you've submitted
an application again

48
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,010
to the subsidiary
for the general manager position.

49
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,860
Yeah,

50
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,280
the first year the board
said I was too young.

51
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,540
The second year,

52
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,190
they said they needed to

53
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,310
prioritize senior veterans.

54
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,650
This year, I've secured

55
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,030
three major projects for the company.

56
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,400
Let's see what excuse
they have to reject me this time.

57
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,960
You want to leave my side that bad?

58
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,350
I've been an executive assistant

59
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,310
for too long.

60
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,290
Moreover,

61
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,070
when I become the manager,

62
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,720
I can help you earn more money.

63
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,120
Are you hungry?

64
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,470
Let me take you to eat something.

65
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,980
Forget it.

66
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,850
I'll just go back to the company
and have boxed lunch.

67
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,210
I heard the competition

68
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,340
for the Lhasa project is fierce.

69
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,600
I want to strike while the iron is hot.

70
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,140
Good,

71
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,870
looks like you'll get it for sure.

72
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,530
I've been on this project for three years

73
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,870
and waited for three years.

74
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,000
When I become the general manager,

75
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,960
then you can celebrate my success.

76
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,860
What do you think?

77
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,470
Fucheng has changed a lot

78
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,990
in the past two years, right?

79
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,050
Dajiang,

80
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,980
you know what?

81
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,550
People's Park has been demolished.

82
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,470
(Fucheng)

83
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,820
Now, a commercialized residential area

84
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,670
has been built there.

85
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,910
Many wealthy people
have bought houses there.

86
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,400
So where is the park now?

87
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,960
It moved to the west.

88
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,810
Fucheng First High School
and People's Hospital

89
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,880
are also going to move there soon.

90
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,760
In recent years,

91
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,910
real estate in Fucheng
has developed rapidly.

92
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,250
In the future, that area

93
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,320
will be called the High-Tech Zone.

94
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,570
They say many high-tech companies

95
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,760
will be introduced there.

96
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,900
Dajiang,

97
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,320
are you going to

98
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,590
leave again?

99
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,840
I'm not young anymore.
Time to settle down.

100
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,230
Your mom...

101
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,840
Did she feel disappointed in me
before she passed away?

102
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,550
How could she?

103
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,660
If she knew you were performing well

104
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,500
and released early,

105
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,880
she'd be delighted.

106
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,370
However, these past two years,

107
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,670
you've been drifting alone outside.

108
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,200
She must be worrying.

109
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,180
Let's not talk about it.

110
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,020
It's all in the past.

111
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,110
You know what?

112
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,980
The guys knew you were coming back today

113
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,820
and are all excited.

114
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,940
Let's go to Ms. Tao's hotel for a meal later.

115
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,990
Everyone wants to welcome you.

116
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,470
Dajiang, you get off here.

117
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
I'll go park the car.

118
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,480

=The One You Miss but Are Afraid to Meet=

120
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,720
Does he not want to see me?

121
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,430
Wait for me here.

122
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,490
I'll go find him.

123
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,420
If you're not ready

124
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,260
to meet them today,

125
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,760
you can choose not to.

126
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,180
I need to go
to the neighborhood committee.

127
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,020
Maybe another day.

128
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,900
And after that?

129
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,690
I'll go home.

130
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,340
Okay.

131
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,550
I've tidied up the house for you.

132
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,470
You don't need to accompany me.

133
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,350
I can live alone without any problems.

134
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,520
Who wants to accompany you?

135
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,300
I just like your houseboat.

136
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm used to living there.

137
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,650
What?

138
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,960
Are you trying to kick me out?

139
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,550
You rascal.

140
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,640
If you're willing to accompany me,

141
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm happy.

142
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
Dajiang,

143
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,680
let's go home.

144
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,720
Let's go.

145
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,160
Dajiang, what are you watching?

146
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,920
Back when we watched
Young and Dangerous,

147
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
they fought with real blades and guns.

148
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Now, a flash of light

149
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,240
and the world collapses.

150
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,540
I don't understand this at all.

151
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
Dajiang,

152
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,040
that's just the trend.

153
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,360
Nowadays,
young people love watching this.

154
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,480
Come on.

155
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,040
Welcome home.

156
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,520
How are our old brothers doing?

157
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,000
Which one are you asking about?

158
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,760
Haonan or Shanji?

159
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,840
Tell me about both.

160
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Brother Haonan

161
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,680
lost a hand

162
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,620
and went back to his hometown.

163
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,160
Brother Shanji is doing business
and became a boss.

164
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
Who did Haonan end up with?

165
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,280
How would I know that?

166
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,160
Probably living alone.

167
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,480
What?

168
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,280
Can't I sit with you?

169
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,960
Dajiang,

170
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,480
how about this?

171
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,880
Come to my company.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,840
Let's work together.

173
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,680
No need.

174
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,040
The neighborhood committee
introduced me to a job.

175
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,120
As for business matters,

176
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,580
I've long stopped thinking about them.

177
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,440
Dajiang,

178
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,480
as long as you're willing to join,

179
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,640
my company
will always have a place for you.

180
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,680
You brat,

181
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,120
you're handling everything for me now?

182
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,200
How have you been recently?

183
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,840
Still cooking for yourself all the time?

184
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,360
Not really.

185
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,520
I cook when I have time.

186
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,880
Usually, work keeps me busy,

187
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,040
so I just eat whatever.

188
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,120
Why don't you have a woman by your side?

189
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,000
Right now, I just want to make money.

190
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,760
I'm not interested in women.

191
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
You're handsome and wealthy.

192
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,720
How can you not
have girls chasing after you?

193
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,120
Back when you were running
the ice skating rink,

194
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,880
weren't you handsome and rich?

195
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,640
How come there was no woman around you?

196
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,760
I did have a woman.

197
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,200
She was just not by my side.

198
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,560
She was in my heart.

199
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,920
Then why don't you hurry up and meet her?

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,960
You don't have someone

201
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,720
you want to see but are afraid to see?

202
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,680
Are you still thinking about Dr. Bai?

203
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,600
Come on.

204
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,120
Manager Bai!

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
Manager Bai!

206
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,360
What's the reason this time
for not choosing me?

207
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,320
This was the board's decision.

208
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,600
Is it really the board's decision

209
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,440
or just because she's the daughter
of a company director?

210
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,760
Actually,

211
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,960
it's not like what you think.

212
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
She studied finance in Switzerland

213
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,560
and interned at the head office for a year.

214
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,160
What about her project experience?

215
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,600
Last year, you used that as a reason

216
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,440
to reject me.

217
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,920
So, no matter how many projects I do

218
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,120
or how much money I make for you,

219
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,080
I still can't reach where I want to be.

220
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,400
This is the third time already.

221
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,560
Why can others,

222
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,520
but not me?

223
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,520
Every time, there's always some reason.

224
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Can't there be at least one instance
solely based on merit?

225
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,800
Have you ever thought that

226
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,280
it's because I value you

227
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,400
that I've kept you by my side?

228
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,160
Alright,

229
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,040
instead of being a general manager,

230
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,720
I have a more important task for you.

231
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,400
How do you see me?

232
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,520
As a gunman?

233
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,640
Your vanguard?

234
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,160
Or just a pawn you can command?

235
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,560
Have you forgotten how you convinced me

236
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,520
to give you a job and how you fought hard

237
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,200
to prove yourself
when you were desperate?

238
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,320
The choice you're making now

239
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,240
comes at a high cost.

240
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,440
As you can see,

241
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,680
I'm at my wit's end.

242
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,480
I need a job opportunity.

243
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,640
Why should I help someone

244
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,680
who forced herself into a corner?

245
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,440
But this isn't the endgame.

246
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
In a game of chess, the final piece,

247
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
although seemingly

248
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,680
without hope of survival,

249
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,880
isn't a lost cause.

250
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,280
As long as there's a glimmer of hope,

251
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,600
it can unleash its greatest vitality.

252
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,480
Over these years,

253
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,600
you've risen from the lowest level intern

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
to where you are now.

255
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,920
Are you going to give it all up

256
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,920
and return to square one?

257
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm sorry,

258
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,560
this is not the Bai Lan I know.

259
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,160
Last month,

260
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,960
I talked over the phone with Mr. Mancini

261
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
from Italy.

262
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,040
He owns a very high-quality

263
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,000
chocolate business in Italy.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,360
I plan to control a domestic food company

265
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,320
and transform it into

266
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,720
an Italian brand OEM factory.

267
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,720
In the future,

268
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Italians will provide technical support

269
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,160
and help open up European sales channels.

270
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,880
Currently,

271
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,120
we have data
on three purchasable companies.

272
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,160
As for how to choose,

273
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,440
advice.

274
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,360
I vote for Suzhou.

275
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,200
Firstly, it's an old brand,

276
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,480
and the local government's
support policies

277
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,720
are quite favorable.

278
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,920
But I think this company in Guangzhou

279
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,200
has better transportation

280
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,880
and close business ties

281
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,640
with the Hong Kong headquarters.

282
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,360
I'm also supportive
of this Guangzhou company.

283
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,640
If it were me,

284
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
I would choose Golden Peacock

285
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,840
Food Factory in Fucheng.

286
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,360
I remember
on my first day at the company,

287
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,440
you told me that

288
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,800
the most important factor
for investing in a company successfully

289
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,520
is to have eyes to find undervalued areas.

290
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,120
Many markets in Guangdong cities

291
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,480
have already developed very well,

292
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,480
which obviously doesn't meet our needs.

293
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,120
I just visited Fucheng,

294
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,880
and although the local development

295
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,220
is not as good as Guangzhou and Shenzhen,

296
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,400
this gives us a chance

297
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,640
to seize the market.

298
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,520
Moreover, the local land
and sea transportation

299
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,800
is very convenient.

300
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,480
So from the perspective
of return on investment,

301
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,520
it's very high.

302
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,800
You've worked at this food factory

303
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,680
before coming to Shanghai, right?

304
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,760
Yes,

305
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,320
the workers there
have high technical skills,

306
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,430
and the equipment in the factory
is comprehensive.

307
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,600
Most importantly,

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
the factory is currently

309
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
at a low point,

310
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,880
having undergone several reforms

311
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,920
without success.

312
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,880
So if we

313
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,120
make a move now,

314
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,560
we can acquire it

315
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,120
at a very good price.

316
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,480
I still think

317
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,600
Guangzhou is more convincing

318
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,800
for the Italians.

319
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,840
And I think the development prospects

320
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,320
in Fucheng are still uncertain.

321
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,720
Isn't your plan a bit too risky?

322
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,080
How big is this

323
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Golden Peacock Food Factory?

324
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,960
It's over 13 hectares,

325
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,680
and Fucheng has beautiful scenery.

326
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,920
Why not give it a try?

327
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,760
Perhaps the Italians will like it.

328
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,160
Thank you, guys.

329
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,360
- I'll treat everyone to ice cream later.
- Okay.

330
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,560
♪Mission is ready♪

331
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,400
Mr. Li,

332
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,640
how much are these two trucks
of ice cream worth?

333
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,410
Probably tens of thousands of yuan.

334
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,960
Tens of thousands?

335
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,640
That's nothing.

336
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,240
There will be ten more trucks
coming in this afternoon.

337
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,040
Director Li, it's been especially hot
this summer.

338
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,560
If you sell dozens of trucks of ice cream,

339
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,120
I bet you can afford a sea-view house.

340
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,280
Given the high rent

341
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,840
we pay for this cold storage,

342
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,180
of course we should use it to the fullest.

343
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,320
I understand now.

344
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,720
You're becoming
the richest in our Fucheng.

345
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,600
Don't say that.

346
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,440
Thank you.

347
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,360
It's okay.

348
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,600
What is it?

349
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,880
Lately, there have been

350
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,000
some rumors
that aren't very favorable to you.

351
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,760
What rumors?

352
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,480
People are saying that

353
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,720
you're selling cold drinks

354
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,200
and ice cream outside,

355
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
making tens of thousands a month,

356
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,440
but only paying a few hundred yuan
in rent to the factory.

357
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,360
They say you are taking advantage
of the factory,

358
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,960
and they want to drive you out.

359
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,160
Master, don't listen to their gossip.

360
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,760
A few hundred yuan?

361
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Last year, Xiaolu and I

362
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
personally talked to Secretary Hong.

363
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,040
The rent is clearly stated as

364
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,840
2,000 yuan per month, in black and white.

365
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,400
We haven't taken advantage
of the factory.

366
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,600
Master, it's true.

367
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,200
No need to explain.

368
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,800
You two are my apprentices.

369
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,160
How could I not trust you?

370
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,760
But, you know,

371
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,680
a tall tree catches the wind.

372
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,160
Over these years, you've made some money,

373
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,640
and many people are envious.

374
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,400
So there's gossip.

375
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,560
You two

376
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,400
should keep a low profile,

377
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,960
or else it will undermine morale
in the factory.

378
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,200
Master,

379
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,040
our factory has been struggling
for so many years.

380
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,240
What morale is left?

381
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,080
But...

382
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,520
Yes,

383
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,000
this factory is really impoverished now.

384
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,000
But that is precisely why

385
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,080
people are short-tempered.

386
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,440
You two,

387
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,240
don't let people's envy get to you.

388
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,440
You've prospered now,

389
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,880
but you should also consider

390
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,680
the mentality of those
who are still struggling.

391
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,280
We have not prospered at all,

392
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,360
Master.

393
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,200
Look, look.

394
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,960
In the future,
when you come to the factory,

395
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,840
can you not drive this car in?

396
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,000
Just walk in

397
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,520
and don't make a grand entrance.

398
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,600
Understand?

399
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,720
Okay,

400
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,640
Master.

401
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,840
We'll listen to you.

402
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,120
Alright!

403
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,040
Okay.

404
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,400
I've said what I wanted to say.

405
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,560
I'll take my leave now.

406
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Take care, Master.

407
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,840
Take care, Master.

408
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,280
I just don't understand.

409
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,690
We're earning money by our own abilities.

410
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,880
Why would others be jealous?

411
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,520
If you have grievances,
keep them to yourself.

412
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,720
Why kick us out?

413
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,960
Haven't you seen BMWs before?

414
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
It looks like...

415
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,120
Never mind.

416
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,120
Let's go.

417
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,880
Okay, just leave it here.

418
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,840
Thank you.

419
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,960
Bai Lan!

420
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,960
I never expected

421
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,120
you'd come back to the factory.

422
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,440
Should I call you Manager Bai
or Director Bai?

423
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,480
Cut it out.

424
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,440
I'm still Bai Lan.

425
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,320
Are you planning to stay here?

426
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,920
There are so many good hotels

427
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,760
in Fucheng.

428
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,280
Staying at the factory is convenient.

429
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,640
So I don't have to waste time
on the road.

430
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,520
Look at you, so austere.

431
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,120
With such a great leader like you,

432
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,600
reform finally has a chance.

433
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,880
But it'll be dark at night.

434
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,920
Will you be scared alone?

435
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,560
How about I accompany you?

436
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,080
I wouldn't dare take you away
from Li Guangnan.

437
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,560
He would kill me.

438
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,720
He wouldn't dare.

439
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,480
It's okay.

440
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,840
I can stay alone.

441
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,800
But recently, work has

442
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,400
overwhelmed me a bit.

443
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,640
I need your help.

444
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,720
I'm just a small clerk
in the Labor Department.

445
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,600
How can I help you?

446
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,760
The reason I came back this time

447
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,260
is to lead
the food factory's transformation

448
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,520
into an Italian brand

449
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,600
OEM enterprise,

450
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,720
manage working capital,

451
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,840
and turn losses into profits.

452
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,120
But this isn't an easy task,

453
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
so I need

454
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,120
a trustworthy CFO.

455
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,960
A CFO?

456
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,320
You're not talking about me, are you?

457
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,560
Of course it's you.

458
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,320
Others might think

459
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,760
you got in the factory

460
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,120
because you're Ding Dezhong's niece,

461
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,280
but I know you taught yourself

462
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,560
high school math

463
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,200
when you graduated middle school.

464
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,840
You're quick with three-digit addition,

465
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,250
subtraction, multiplication, and division.

466
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,960
When our factory distributed
year-end bonuses

467
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,000
to thousands of employees,

468
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,480
you handled it perfectly.

469
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,920
Listening to you,

470
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,400
I guess I am pretty good.

471
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,520
Definitely.

472
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
And after so many years in the factory,

473
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,760
you know it best.

474
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,720
So after thinking it over,

475
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,720
there's no one else I'd pick.

476
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,440
Alright, as long as I can help you,

477
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,640
I'm all in.

478
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,520
We can fight side by side again,

479
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,800
like before.

480
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,360
But this time

481
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,000
is different from before.

482
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,720
It won't be so easy.

483
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,880
The factory's short on funds

484
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,640
and has disputes inside and out.

485
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,960
There's a lot of mess to clean up.

486
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
If we leased out space and equipment,

487
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,000
we need to reclaim everything.

488
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,000
We have to make a clean list

489
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,760
to convince the Italians.

490
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,600
What about Xiaolu and

491
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,240
Li Guangnan's rented cold storage?

492
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,840
Do we have to reclaim that too?

493
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,520
I thought

494
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,800
he left the factory long ago.

495
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,320
True,

496
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,640
but for many years,

497
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,840
the factory has relied on
leasing space and equipment

498
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,400
to maintain cash flow.

499
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,520
They also relied on the factory

500
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,040
for backup.

501
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,640
The cold storage is crucial to them.

502
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,480
We should treat everyone equally.

503
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,440
I'll compensate according to the contract.

504
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,120
Have you seen Xiaolu since you came back?

505
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,480
Not yet.

506
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,720
I think you should meet him

507
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,640
and have a good talk.

508
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,400
Maybe there's room for compromise.

509
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,400
I came back to work this time.

510
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,360
I don't want him to affect my decisions.

511
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,280
What?

512
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,920
More orders?

513
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,320
No problem.

514
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,040
You're my big customer.

515
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,560
I'll make sure to accommodate you.

516
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,080
Alright, consider it done.

517
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,040
Wait for my message.

518
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,200
Alright.

519
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,760
Hello?

520
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,720
Mr. Liu,

521
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,400
there's been a change.

522
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,320
We need five more vans,

523
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,360
making it a total of ten.

524
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,120
You must arrange this.

525
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,080
Otherwise, the people of Fucheng

526
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,480
won't have ice cream tomorrow.

527
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,520
Sure,

528
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,720
I'll leave it to you.

529
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,560
Thanks.

530
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,000
I'll come by another day to thank you.

531
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,560
Alright.

532
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,200
Mr. Lu.

533
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,200
Do you have time to chat?

534
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,720
(Xiongdi Food Trading Company Ltd)

535
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,680
Try it.

536
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,640
Milk tea?

537
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,520
I invented it.

538
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,880
I don't usually make it

539
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,920
for just anyone.

540
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,360
Why did you stop pursuing
your milk tea business?

541
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,360
Because being a brand agent

542
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,760
is more profitable.

543
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,320
I came to see you

544
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,080
for business today.

545
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,240
My investment company in Shanghai

546
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,760
is preparing to acquire all the shares
of the food factory.

547
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,360
What do you mean?

548
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,240
Our board has been

549
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,880
researching Fucheng for a long time.

550
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,440
We believe

551
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Fucheng is
one of the most promising cities

552
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,600
for development
along the southeastern coast.

553
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,440
Acquiring the food factory

554
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,840
is just the first step.

555
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,600
We plan to modernize it

556
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,200
into a manufacturing enterprise
for foreign products.

557
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,720
I didn't expect you to have

558
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,960
such strong feelings
for the food factory.

559
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,120
Not really.

560
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
I have my own motives.

561
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,400
But I'm no longer associated
with the food factory.

562
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,360
What can we discuss?

563
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,200
We need to reclaim

564
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,400
all the leased-out spaces and equipment,

565
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,560
including your cold storage,
this is necessary

566
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,160
for negotiations with our partners.

567
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,400
So you came to me

568
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,680
for this matter?

569
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,480
What else would I come for?

570
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,360
Okay,

571
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,400
then I'll tell you.

572
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,120
It's absolutely impossible.

573
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,200
Without the cold storage,

574
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,240
I have nowhere to store my ice cream.

575
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,360
Fucheng has more than one cold storage.

576
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,880
If you need,

577
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,040
I can help you find another.

578
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,320
You don't understand.

579
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,280
Ice cream melts.

580
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,000
Only the food factory's cold storage,

581
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,280
located in the city center,

582
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,960
meets our transportation standards.

583
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,080
Then I'll compensate you.

584
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,760
You can use the money

585
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,480
to rent refrigerated trucks.

586
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,440
Bai Lan,

587
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,400
I remember back when

588
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,600
we negotiated with the German expert,

589
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,040
you told me about the importance
of honoring contracts.

590
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,680
So why

591
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,200
are you now suggesting
breaking the agreement?

592
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
The cold storage is a vital resource
for the food factory.

593
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,000
I have to do this.

594
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,680
Sorry.

595
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,120
It's important to you,

596
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,560
but it's even more important to me.

597
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,760
Well then, name your price.

598
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,400
I don't want to discuss money with you.

599
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,040
Just leave.

600
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,040
How about double the compensation?

601
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,600
Bai Lan,

602
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,000
I think you know me well.

603
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,880
Money won't make me back down.

604
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,600
Or are you deliberately
trying to trample on

605
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,600
our relationship?

606
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,160
What relationship do we have?

607
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,000
Nothing.

608
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,320
If there's nothing else,

609
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,840
please leave.

610
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,120
Fine.

611
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,320
Since you don't want to talk,

612
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,320
I'll give you a week

613
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,960
to clear out the cold storage.

614
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,480
Bai Lan, don't think money

615
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,760
can solve everything.

616
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,120
Listen carefully.

617
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,200
I won't leave.

618
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,440
You are acting on impulse.

619
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,920
You have been

620
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,880
moping around today.

621
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Lu Dajiang!

622
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,160
Ms. Tao.

623
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
Why are you here?

624
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Where's Lu Dajiang?

625
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,760
He isn't here.

626
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,160
Lu Dajiang!

627
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,720
Lu Dajiang!

628
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,600
Come out, Lu Dajiang!

629
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
I'm not here to cause trouble!

630
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,720
You don't even dare to see me!

631
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,360
What kind of man are you?

632
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,080
Jerk!

633
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Jerk!

634
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,800
Coward!

635
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,360
You'd better be avoiding me forever.

636
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,280
Ms. Tao,

637
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,440
forget it.

638
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,240
I know you can hear me talking.

639
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,280
We've known each other

640
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,240
since we were teenagers.

641
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,640
We know each other so well!

642
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,080
We have gone through ups and downs
together!

643
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,920
Why are you doing this now?

644
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,600
If you don't want to see me,

645
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
I won't force you.

646
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
But let me tell you,

647
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,280
smoke less, drink less,

648
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
and don't cause trouble.

649
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
You'd better live well.

650
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,360

Otherwise, why not see her?

657
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,840
You never mentioned this to me

658
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,240
over the past years.

659
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,400
To be honest,

660
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,160
I couldn't possibly match her status.

661
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,880
She's a lady from a prominent family,

662
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,690
with a grandfather
who's an overseas Chinese

663
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,840
doing business abroad.

664
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,880
After the reform and opening up,

665
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,440
her father went to find her grandfather.

666
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,920
She and her mother were left at home,

667
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,720
facing bullies from local ruffians.

668
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,920
Once,

669
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,240
I encountered it

670
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,280
and couldn't just stand by, right?

671
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,520
Later,

672
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,840
she followed me wholeheartedly

673
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,120
until I got into trouble

674
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,080
and fled to Hong Kong myself.

675
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,960
She's had a tough time,

676
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,280
and we never had peaceful days together.

677
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,880
I didn't want to drag her down

678
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,560
or make her wait for me forever,

679
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,080
so I deliberately avoided her

680
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,480
to let her find a better life.

681
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,080
She thought you abandoned her,

682
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,360
but it made it harder
for her to forget you.

683
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,440
But how did she

684
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,560
become a karaoke bar owner?

685
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,160
Later, her father became

686
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,440
a university professor in Canada

687
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,960
and brought her there to study.

688
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,720
Then,

689
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,480
she didn't want to continue university,

690
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,560
so her father gave her money

691
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,680
to start a business back in China.

692
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,440
I was the one who ran away at the time.

693
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,960
Now, how can I face her?

694
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,760
Dajiang,

695
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,440

Going to Fucheng?

717
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,360
Have you thought it over?

718
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,040
I have.

719
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,200
Having connections is an advantage,

720
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,760
but it's also challenging.

721
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,120
As long as you're determined,

722
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,360
I can hand over this project to you.

723
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,080
Are you questioning my ability?

724
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,080
I'm just understanding your weaknesses.

725
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,760
I'll prove it to you that

726
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,360
only I can take on this project.

727
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,480
Acquiring and rebuilding a factory

728
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
is not as simple as constructing a resort.

729
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,640
It takes at least a year or more
to get out of it.

730
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,240
Rather than engaging in something
with uncertain results,

731
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,640
I'd prefer you

732
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,840
to help me conquer different cities.

733
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,600
Since it's so challenging,

734
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,200
I want to add a condition.

735
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,680
Say it.

736
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,360
If the project succeeds,

737
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,800
I want to go independent.

738
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,440
Do you want to leave me that bad?

739
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,080
Mr. Huang,

740
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,640
you've helped me a lot over these years.

741
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,240
When I was nothing,

742
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,480
you guided me from project to project.

743
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,880
I'm grateful

744
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,120
and don't want to owe you anything.

745
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,840
But I want freedom.

746
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,760
Alright,

747
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,000
I agree.

748
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,320
But if it's not completed,

749
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,000
you'll help me for another ten years.

750
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,720
It's a deal.

751
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,000
(Director's Office)

752
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,520
(Auditorium)

753
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,400
It's regrettable that

754
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,160
under my leadership

755
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,240
for so many years,

756
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,280
our food factory

757
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,120
hasn't achieved better results

758
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,880
in the tide of reform.

759
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,000
Here,

760
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,360
I sincerely apologize to everyone.

761
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,800
(Hong Jianying, Bai Lan)
Soon, I will pass the baton

762
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,640
to a new manager.

763
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,200
Our food factory has weathered storms.

764
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,640
Who would have thought that

765
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,920
Ms. Bai Lan, who once worked

766
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,520
in our food factory,

767
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,760
would represent Huaxing Investment Group

768
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,880
and become our factory's new manager?

769
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,920
Now, let's warmly welcome

770
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,040
Ms. Bai Lan back home

771
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,400
with enthusiastic applause.

772
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,120
Now, let's invite Ms. Bai Lan

773
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,520
to say a few words to us.

774
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,720
Vice Mayor Bi,

775
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,800
why are you here for

776
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,880
such a small ceremony today?

777
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,400
It's the day

778
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,760
our food factory is reborn.

779
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,880
No matter how busy I was, I had to come.

780
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,760
I see.

781
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,680
Miss Bai.

782
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,600
Long time no see.

783
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,680
Hello, Mayor Bi.

784
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,240
More accurately, I am just a Vice Mayor.

785
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,400
I'm in charge of

786
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,620
the restructuring of enterprises.

787
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,120
We'll be working together again
in the future.

788
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,080
Please support our work.

789
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,320
I've always been supportive.

790
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,640
Yes.

791
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,400
Comrades,

792
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,640
I believe that

793
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,840
under Comrade Bai Lan's leadership,

794
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,640
our food factory

795
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,560
will definitely overcome difficulties

796
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,840
and be reborn.

797
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,560
The city government has 40% of the shares

798
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
of the factory,

799
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,120
right?

800
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
But today,

801
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,200
on behalf of the municipal party committee
and government,

802
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,520
I want to state that we fully support

803
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,200
Comrade Bai Lan's reform.

804
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,560
We won't rest

805
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,720
until we achieve our goals.

806
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,040
Let's applaud.

807
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,040
Let me calculate for you.

808
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,680
We had to give away two cartons

809
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,840
of Chungwa cigarettes for the van deal,

810
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,080
costing us 1,000 yuan,

811
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,840
and 500 yuan

812
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,360
for the tea factory.

813
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,960
If we rent another cold storage,

814
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,240
it will cost thousands more.

815
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,280
We've had a huge deficit this month.

816
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,120
We really can't give up that cold storage.

817
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,040
What are you looking at?

818
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,240
I'm calculating

819
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,160
how much money is needed

820
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,320
to build a cold storage in the city.

821
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,360
Are you crazy?

822
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,440
Why build one when

823
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,560
there's a ready-made one?

824
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,160
Xiaolu,

825
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,720
are you planning to compromise
with Bai Lan?

826
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,320
We definitely can't compromise.

827
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,800
But you know Bai Lan's

828
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,720
personality well.

829
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,240
We need to be prepared for both sides.

830
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Bai Lan's personality?

831
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,840
I know it very well.

832
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,880
Quite stubborn.

833
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,920
But you're no pushover either.

834
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,200
Have you forgotten

835
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,480
that you are known as

836
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,160
the fiercest man in Fucheng,

837
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,960
and the man who loves Bai Lan the most?

838
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,080
Think of a way.

839
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,680
I once thought I could persuade her,

840
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,560
but today I realized that

841
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,760
after five years,

842
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,800
many things have changed.

843
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,520
If she's changed, change her back.

844
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,080
Let me tell you,

845
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,240
just set aside your so-called dignity,

846
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,560
put on some hair gel,

847
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,520
spray some perfume,

848
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,000
show Bai Lan

849
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,160
your most charming side,

850
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,240
and ask her to change her mind.

851
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,120
That's a different thing.

852
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,560
Besides,

853
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,000
I don't know what

854
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,200
she's thinking now,
whether she has a boyfriend

855
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,320
or how she's doing.

856
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,680
How can I bring this up?

857
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
Recall the beautiful past.

858
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,080
You two had so much sweetness,

859
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,120
and it wasn't fake.

860
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,080
If you can't be lovers,

861
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,160
can't you be friends?

862
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,440
Xiaolu,

863
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,880
Xiaoying got into a fight
with people from the factory,

864
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,920
and I can't stop the fight.

865
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,000
Hurry to the factory and help.

866
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,240
Who dares come near!

867
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,400
Niu Xiaoying,

868
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,960
let me tell you,

869
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,200
you're not an employee here anymore.

870
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,640
If you keep causing trouble,

871
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,560
the factory

872
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,800
won't protect you.

873
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,800
Ma,

874
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,320
who is this factory protecting now?

875
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,040
Is it you?

876
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,040
You?

877
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,200
Or you?

878
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,040
When outsiders come,

879
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,600
you're all like lapdogs.

880
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,120
You...

881
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,440
Fine,

882
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,440
say whatever you want.

883
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,880
Let me tell you,

884
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,520
as long as this factory exists,

885
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,680
whether it's under Hong's

886
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,000
or Bai's leadership,

887
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,560
I'll stand firm

888
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,560
as the head of security, right?

889
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,400
Yes!

890
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,120
Stop talking and move the boxes!

891
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Who dares come near!

892
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,840
I dare you!

893
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,200
Hurry up!

894
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,920
Niu Xiaoying, let me tell you...

895
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,320
People from security, remember!

896
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,840
- Get down!
- No fighting!

897
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,080
- Stop!
- Get away!

898
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,760
Just move the goods, no fighting.

899
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,840
I dare you to come closer.

900
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,920
Who gave you the right
to touch our cold storage?

901
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,320
It is still under our lease.

902
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,760
I can sue you for this, you hear me?

903
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,800
Sue us?

904
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,960
Who are you going to sue?

905
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,360
What yours

906
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,760
or ours?

907
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,680
You little rascals

908
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,600
ate the factory's food,

909
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,200
lived in the factory's houses,

910
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,600
and what now?

911
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,080
Now you think you have grown up

912
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,200
and can claim things yours now?

913
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,400
Ma,

914
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,560
I understand your responsibilities,

915
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,480
but I have my principles.

916
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,840
This is our warehouse,

917
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,760
and today, no matter what you say,

918
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,720
I won't compromise.

919
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,080
Xiaolu,

920
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,120
then don't blame me.

921
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,920
- Do it!
- I dare you to come closer!

922
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,840
Stay away!

923
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,080
- Step back!
- Come up!

924
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,720
Remember, no fighting,
no physical contact!

925
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,560
Xiaoying!

926
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,080
Take this!

927
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,200
Xiaolu!

928
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,280
- Xiaolu!
- Are you okay?

929
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,400
How could this...

930
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,720
Look at you!
