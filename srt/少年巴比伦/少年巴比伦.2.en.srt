This is my mask, Uncle Ma.

Why is it with you?

29
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,480
That's for you to answer.

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,940
What were you doing last night?

31
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,460
Last night?

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,080
I went to watch videos with Li Guangnan.

33
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,720
We came back around midnight.
What's wrong?

34
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,740
What videos did you watch?

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,920
Why do you care about that?

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,760
Tell me.

37
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,540
"Once Upon a Time in China 3"

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,300
and

39
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,420
"The Provocative Lady".

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,940
Aren't you too young to watch that?

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,080
It's just the name that's a bit provocative.

42
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,480
It's actually nothing like that.

43
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,600
We were tricked.

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,780
Alright,

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,340
show me the tickets.

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Those underground theaters
don't sell tickets,

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
Uncle Ma.

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,320
What's wrong?

49
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,700
Why are you interrogating me?

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,800
Tell me,

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,900
what's going on?

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,760
Stand up.

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,260
Who told you to sit down?

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,480
Let me tell you,

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,820
last night,

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,260
that pervert in a raincoat
appeared again.

57
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,660
This thing

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,460
fell off him.

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,460
Are you suspecting me?

60
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,540
Why not?

61
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,340
How come it's you again?

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
You're falsely accusing me!

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,620
The evidence is here.
Is it a false accusation?

64
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,840
I swear this mask

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,340
must have been stolen by someone.

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
It's just what you say.

67
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,560
Listen,

68
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,760
why would I do such despicable things?

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
"Our grudge isn't settled yet."

70
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,760
Didn't you say this yourself?

71
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,280
Fine.

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,680
You don't believe me, right?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,320
Then go ask Li Guangnan.

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,400
He's the most honest person.

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,520
He won't lie.

76
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Do you doubt that

77
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,000
Li Guangnan is an honest person?

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,040
That makes sense.

79
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,960
But I'm really not lying.

80
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,520
Alright, go back for now.

81
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,360
But

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,400
we'll continue the investigation.

83
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,280
Whether it's you or not,

84
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,400
the truth will come out eventually.

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,240
Alright,

86
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,040
when the truth comes out,

87
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,320
don't forget to apologize to me.

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,800
Hey, Xiaolu,

89
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
that's evidence.

90
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
Give it back to me.

91
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,200
Dr. Bai,

92
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,840
do you think he looks like that...

93
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,280
But you were just...

94
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,200
So I...

95
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,120
I couldn't say that to him.

96
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,200
It's okay.

97
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,480
I have a way.

100
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Have you heard?

101
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,000
That pervert appeared again last night.

102
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,160
But in the end,

103
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,680
he was driven away

104
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
by Dr. Bai.

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,320
Dr. Bai

106
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,560
usually looks

107
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,640
quite weak and delicate.

108
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,720
I didn't believe those rumors before.

109
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,880
But after what happened last night,

110
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,440
I started to doubt it.

111
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,600
Well, by the way,

112
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,560
Dr. Bai is always

113
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,480
dressed so provocatively.

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,000
No wonder
she attracted the pervert's attention.

115
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,960
Do you want to try it?

116
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,960
Dr. Bai taught me this. It is delicious.

117
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,000
No.

118
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,080
Let me tell you,

119
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,040
women shouldn't dress too provocatively,

120
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,240
let alone invite trouble actively.

121
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
What's wrong with you?

122
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,480
Oh, Dr. Bai...

123
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,560
You finished your lunch? Sit down.

124
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,440
You look so good today.

125
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,320
- Isn't it, Dr. Tian?
- Yes. Yes.

126
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,480
- Aunt Dong,
- Yeah?

127
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,880
even if I dress like you,

128
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,400
perverts would still appear.

129
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,800
Well said.

130
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,840
Perverts don't choose their targets,

131
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,360
and they don't care about age or status.

132
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,480
- No, this...
- Dr. Bai,

133
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,040
I rushed over as soon as

134
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,680
I heard about yesterday's incident.

135
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,240
Are you alright?
Did the pervert hurt you?

136
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,080
You're alright?

137
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,080
Of course I'm alright.

138
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
That's good.

139
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,600
(Medical Room)

140
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,400
Today is the day for the new workers'
physical examination, right?

141
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
At this time,

142
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,200
they should have gathered at the hospital.

143
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,320
Alright, I'll go take a look.

144
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,560
Why are you going there?

145
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,040
This used to be handled by the hospital.

146
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,560
No need for us to make a trip.

147
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,400
True.

148
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,800
You think that pervert

149
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,760
is one of our workers?

150
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,880
Not necessarily,

151
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,560
but let's rule out the suspicion.

152
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,320
As long as we can catch him,

153
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,720
I'll fully support you.

154
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,040
Wait a moment.

155
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,440
My dad brought this
from the exhibition in Hangzhou.

156
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,360
Whenever I got frightened as a child,

157
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
I'd have something sweet.

158
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,200
It worked wonders.

159
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,040
- Take it. It'll calm your nerves.
- Thanks.

160
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,640
Yesterday, we strolled around

161
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,080
the cafeteria with the masks on.

162
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,600
Then, I put...

163
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,400
I put it...

164
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,520
Where did I put it?

165
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,880
Who could have stolen it?

166
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,680
Most importantly,
if you can't find that person,

167
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,480
you'll always be the No.1 suspect.

168
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Nonsense.

169
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,960
Just because of her words,

170
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,040
am I now a pervert?

171
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,080
Come on, fill out
the physical examination form.

172
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,520
Dr. Bai,

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,240
isn't this for men's health?

174
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,400
Why are you here?

175
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,000
What will you check later?

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,960
Do we have to undress?

177
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
Since it's a comprehensive examination,

178
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,480
of course, you have to undress.

179
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,600
Completely undress?

180
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,600
Yes.

181
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,720
Everyone, pull your pants down
below your knees.

182
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,800
Underwear too?

183
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,040
Have you had a prostate exam?

184
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,920
Then let's start with you.

185
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,320
Okay.

186
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,040
Turn around.

187
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,630
Take it off.

188
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,920
Alright!

189
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,200
Keep going.

190
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
Come on.

191
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,240
Do it.

192
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,800
Take off your underwear too.

193
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,160
You...

194
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,080
I give up.

195
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,360
Xiaolu!

196
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,600
Be serious.

197
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,720
Why are you laughing?

198
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,520
It's your turn.

199
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,400
Got bullied by a girl?

200
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,280
Just bear with it.

201
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
What can you do?

202
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,680
Can you fight back?

203
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
I definitely can't hit a woman.

204
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,520
But if it keeps going like this,

205
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,240
I'll be too embarrassed
to stay in the factory.

206
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,120
I think this might not be a bad thing.

207
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,440
Sometimes, the harder you fall,

208
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,080
the better the chance
to turn things around.

209
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,320
Boss,

210
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,920
we've prepared everything

211
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,960
and are ready to leave at any time.

212
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,120
Where are you going now?

213
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,360
A group of thugs
from Eastern Fucheng came.

214
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
The leader is Boss Hu.

215
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,000
He used to be under me,

216
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,760
but now he's competing for the contract
of the skating rink with me.

217
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,240
Everybody knows that

218
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,160
three kilometers around the food factory
is my turf.

219
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,000
If he wants to compete for business,

220
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,160
I must crush them.

221
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
Why not just drive them out of Fucheng?

222
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,200
Do you need
to have a big fight with them?

223
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,480
You don't understand.

224
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,840
Subduing them is just one aspect.

225
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,480
I've already secured the skating rink.

226
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,560
You've already secured it?

227
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
I've secured the skating rink

228
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,320
and many people are envious.

229
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
I have to let everyone know my strength

230
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
and not bother me in the future.

231
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,480
This sounds exciting,

232
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,960
count me in.

233
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,680
Don't follow my footsteps in fighting.

234
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,360
Since you've entered the factory,

235
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,920
find a way to make a name for yourself.

236
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,040
This is your best opportunity.

237
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,560
If you dare do things others dare not to

238
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,280
and you can achieve something
others can't,

239
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,360
no one will dare
to bully you in the future.

240
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,000
Dajiang,

241
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,640
when should we set out?

242
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,400
Be patient.

243
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,960
I'll first arrange to meet with them
for negotiations.

244
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,200
When the time comes,

245
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,520
we'll set an ambush

246
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,120
and wipe them out.

247
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,000
Alright!

248
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,080
Boss Ma,

249
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,600
please bless me

250
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,160
to be victorious.

251
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,240
Look, I didn't know
which flavor you liked,

252
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,360
so I bought one of each for you.

253
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,050
You were also involved in this?

254
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,040
Yeah,

255
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,840
it's my goodwill gift.

256
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,960
But he paid for it.

257
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,920
Why suddenly be so nice to me?

258
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,120
What's your motive?

259
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,240
I was falsely accused
by that witch Bai Lan.

260
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
Did you know?

261
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,040
I know.

262
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,360
Li Guangnan told me.

263
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm not that perverted stalker.

264
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,120
Do you believe me?

265
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,120
Of course I believe you.

266
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,280
She

267
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,200
always acts superior,

268
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,920
thinking everyone is interested in her.

269
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,040
Like everyone wants to stalk her.

270
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,840
In reality, no one cares about her.

271
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,200
I can't carry this false accusation.

272
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,600
I've thought about it.

273
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,760
As long as I catch
that perverted stalker myself,

274
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,560
I can clear my name.

275
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,800
But even the police couldn't catch him.

276
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,360
Plus, no one knows what he looks like.

277
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,200
How will you catch him?

278
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
What others can't do,

279
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,120
I, Lu Xiaolu, may be able to do it.

280
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,760
I've investigated.

281
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,520
This person always appears

282
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,680
after 7 p.m.

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and frequents the area within

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,610
a three-kilometer radius
around the three forks.

285
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,880
He specifically stalks lone women.

286
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,640
As long as we can lure him out,

287
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,960
I don't believe I can't catch him.

288
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,560
Quick!

289
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,480
Here he comes!

290
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
I think I understand now.

291
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,360
You want Little Pouter to be the bait.

292
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,080
No wonder you were suddenly so attentive.

293
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,440
So you had this plan.

294
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,800
- Lu Xiaolu.
- Little Pouter.

295
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,960
I think your idea is pretty cool.

296
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
I'll help.

297
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,520
Really?

298
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,120
So how will you thank me?

299
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,840
I...

300
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,480
I'll cover all your soda for this summer.

301
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,040
- How about that?
- Deal.

302
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,280
Which color do you think looks better?

303
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,200
No, wait, wait.

304
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,720
Wait a minute.

305
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
I haven't agreed yet.

306
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,800
This is too dangerous.

307
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,560
Won't you two secretly protect me?

308
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,720
Yes.

309
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,000
What if the pervert
is big and carries weapons?

310
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
What if we can't protect you?

311
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,120
You're a man, yet so timid?

312
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,120
Anyway, Lu Xiaolu,
find someone else to do it.

313
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,040
We've only been in the factory
for a short time.

314
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,120
We barely know anyone.

315
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,560
If not Little Pouter, will you help me?

316
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,440
Maybe I can do it,
but Little Pouter can't.

317
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,080
You?

318
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,520
(Boss Hu)

319
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,520
Can you stop being so cowardly?

320
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,160
The stick is too slippery.

321
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,240
What's that?

322
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,160
Nothing.

323
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,120
My mom said

324
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,880
wearing this can bring safety.

325
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,240
Superstitious.

326
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,360
Beauty.

327
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,880
Sir, what do you want?

328
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,760
Boss, you won't like me.

329
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,600
I'm a guy.

330
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,080
Oh my...

331
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,880
You blockhead.

332
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,940
Are you kidding me?

333
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,320
Who is it?

334
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,120
Run!

335
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,920
- Stop!
- Xiaolu?

336
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,200
What's going on?

337
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,360
Don't run.

338
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,280
Why is he here too?

339
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,920
Brothers,

340
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,400
attack now!

341
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,320
Go!

342
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,520
(Gongyuan)

343
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,800
Now this is a mess.

344
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,240
We didn't catch the pervert

345
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
and ruined my cousin's ambush.

346
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,000
Don't mention it.

347
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,520
I almost lost my life.

348
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,640
It's all because you were too nervous.

349
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
You were exposed before you even spoke.

350
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,320
It seems we need to find someone

351
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,440
with more courage.

352
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,440
Give it up. Your plan is too dangerous.

353
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,040
Only someone like Bai Lan can handle it.

354
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,760
Dangerous or not, it needs to be done.

355
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
If we can't catch the pervert,

356
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,480
I'll never be able to lift my head

357
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,320
in front of that witch.

358
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,600
But where will you find another Bai Lan?

359
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,320
Get out of the way!

360
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,560
Get out of the way!

361
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,000
The pig's gone mad!

362
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,840
Get off me!

363
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,720
You pervert!

364
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,640
I was protecting you.

365
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,160
Don't just sit there,

366
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,440
come and help!

367
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,240
Who is this?

368
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,880
She's Mr. Niu's daughter,

369
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,840
Niu Xiaoying.

370
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,800
(Niu Xiaoying)

371
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,360
So, you're that perverted Lu Xiaolu?

372
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,040
I am Lu Xiaolu,

373
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,080
but I'm not perverted.

374
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,160
On the contrary,

375
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,600
I've come to ask for your help

376
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,680
in catching that pervert.

377
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,200
Why me?

378
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,600
Because...

379
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,040
Don't say it

380
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,520
if it is because

381
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,520
I'm beautiful.

382
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,080
Tell me something new.

383
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,840
To lure out this pervert,

384
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,320
it's not only about being good-looking,

385
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,040
but also being brave enough

386
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,380
to remain calm in the face of danger.

387
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,040
Looking across the entire food factory,

388
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,480
only you can handle this important task.

389
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,520
What if I'm in danger?

390
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,680
There was also danger
when the big pig went mad.

391
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,800
But you were the bravest,

392
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,160
rushing to the front.

393
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,960
I didn't expect you
to understand me so well.

394
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,160
I'll tell you,

395
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,360
you've found the right person to do it.

396
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,040
It's settled then.

397
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,880

Why are you crying and howling

413

in the middle of the night?

414
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,040
Grandma,

415
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
I'm here to protect the people from harm!

416
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,480
Will the pervert come out like this?

417
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,680
Definitely not.

418
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,600
Can we ask her to keep it down a bit?

419
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,640
Definitely not.

420
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,480
Come out!

421
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,120
Is that pervert blind?

422
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,800
I'm such a beautiful woman,

423
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,360
walking alone on the street late at night,

424
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,760
yet he could resist not coming out?

425
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,960
Miss Niu,

426
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,680
I have to say that your outfit last night

427
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
- was awesome.
- Right?

428
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,000
But what you did last night...

429
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
Wasn't it a bit...

430
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,880
A bit frightening.

431
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,920
Was it?

432
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,760
Wasn't it?

433
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,570
I did it to lure him out.

434
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,360
Then I'll change my style tomorrow.

435
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,110
I'll be Christy Chung
from "Love on Delivery",

436
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,840
or Sharla Cheung
from "Fight Back to School".

437
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,400
I'll be Sharla Cheung. She has short hair.

438
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,960
- Oh, no need, no need.
- Ah, you are it!

439
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,800
No, no need.

440
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,840
The problem is...

441
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,080
The problem is...

442
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,280
Tomorrow is the weekend.

443
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,720
The pervert doesn't work on weekends.

444
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,400
- He will rest.
- Exactly.

445
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,680
So, you also will have to rest.

446
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,120
Then next week.

447
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
I'll be available anytime.

448
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,480
Please go back to work.

449
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,960
Thank you. Thank you.

450
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,310
Looks like,

451
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,880
we still need her to solve the problem.

452
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,040
Get off me!

453
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
You pervert!

454
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,720
Dr. Bai,

455
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,240
do you need help?

456
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,120
Did you do this?

457
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,520
When you're out in the world,

458
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,720
you're bound to get cut.

459
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,200
Although you're a female thug,

460
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,600
Fucheng is not a place
for you to act recklessly.

461
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,080
But, I'm a generous person.

462
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,920
I can forgive you.

463
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,480
I'm giving you a chance to make amends.

464
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,920
Just agree to cooperate with me

465
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,800
to find the person
who stole my face mask.

466
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,480
Not only will I fix your bike

467
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,600
and escort you home,

468
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,560
but we'll also settle

469
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,960
our past grievances.

470
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,800
You're calling black white.

471
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,680
How ridiculous.

472
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,760
You are the one calling black white!

473
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,920
You forgot your bike!

474
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,160
Are you crazy?

475
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,320
Don't you understand?

476
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,160
Cooperate with me now

477
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
while you still can.

478
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,840
You scoundrel!

479
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,120
Fix my bicycle and then

480
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,360
send it to my dorm.

481
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,400
You witch.

482
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,320
You're the female scoundrel here.

483
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,040
Who's in there?

484
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,480
Who's in there?

485
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,160
Lu Xiaolu?

486
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,440
- What?
- Why are you here so early in the morning?

487
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
Oh, nothing much.

488
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,600
Just taking a break.

489
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,360
Why does this bicycle look so familiar?

490
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,000
It's Bai Lan's.

491
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,520
Why were you sneakily
fixing her bike this morning?

492
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,600
Who was being sneaky?

493
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,160
I'm doing this openly, you know.

494
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,840
Then why cover it up with a cloth?

495
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,680
I'm afraid Mr. Niu will see and accuse me

496
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,720
of using public property
for personal matters.

497
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,200
But my question is,

498
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,000
why were you sneakily fixing

499
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,600
Bai Lan's bike?

500
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,160
It's a long story.

501
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,320
We were all naked,

502
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,120
and Dr. Bai was just looking at us.

503
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,680
I felt awkward

504
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,800
but she didn't even bat an eyelid.

505
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,920
Is that how a woman should act?

506
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,760
You know nothing.

507
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,920
Dr. Bai went to a university.

508
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,800
She's open-minded.

509
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
You can't compare her
to the female workers in our factory.

510
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,120
Those girls

511
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,280
blush at

512
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,760
the slightest joke.

513
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,440
If Dr. Bai could be my wife,

514
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,400
that'd be so great.

515
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,000
But unfortunately, she doesn't fancy us.

516
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,520
Well, you never know.

517
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,560
You can pursue her

518
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,440
and he can also do that.

519
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,960
Maybe Dr. Bai likes

520
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,720
our working-class.

521
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,760
Yeah, exactly.

522
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,680
I have

523
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,760
better chances than you.

524
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,480
She would never choose
a drunkard like you.

525
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,440
She graduated from a university

526
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,660
yet you didn't even finish high school

527
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,680
and got expelled.

528
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,240
Where's your confidence coming from?

529
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,520
I'm the Chow Yun-fat of Fucheng.

530
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,920
Then I'm Andy Lau of Changle.

531
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,680
Let's make a bet.

532
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,480
Come on. What's the bet?

533
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,440
Let's bet on
who can win over Dr. Bai first.

534
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,080
How about a month's salary?

535
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,480
If I win her over...

536
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,080
Congratulations to you.

537
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,960
Get ready for the wedding.

538
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,560
Are you crazy? Why threw a rag at me?

539
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,840
That's what I wanted to do.

540
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,000
Watch your mouth,

541
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,480
or next time, it won't be a rag.

542
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,160
- Thanks.
- Have a good one.

543
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,560
(Convenience store)

544
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,000
They want to pursue Bai Lan,

545
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,520
why do you care so much?

546
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,680
I just can't stand

547
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,160
a group of men
talking about a girl like that.

548
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,320
That is Bai Lan,

549
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,080
the girl you hate the most.

550
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,600
I get it now.

551
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,080
Are you starting to like her?

552
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,880
What are you talking about?

553
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,120
After hugging her in the canteen,

554
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,160
you thought it felt good,

555
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,920
and your heart started racing,

556
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,120
thinking you should pursue her.

557
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,920
Nonsense.

558
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,640
How could I like her?

559
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,560
There's only hatred between us.

560
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,560
So what's going on? She likes you?

561
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,680
Li Guangnan, let me tell you.

562
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,380
Between me and Bai Lan,
it's nothing but hatred.

563
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,880
There's no love.

564
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,480
Alright, why get so worked up?

565
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,640
What I mean is,

566
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,920
if you really manage to win Bai Lan over

567
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,920
and help her escape
from those people harassing her,

568
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,880
maybe

569
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,920
she'll cooperate with you.

570
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,720
Not bad. Your little brain

571
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,280
sometimes comes in handy.

572
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,800
Of course.

573
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,400
(Lady Chatterley's Lover)

574
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,720
(Lady Chatterley's Lover)

575
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,240
Was the one on the loudspeaker her?

576
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,760
Yes, it's her.

577
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,240
Do you think she looks like a murderer?

578
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,920
I think she does.

579
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,440
Maybe she's carrying
several lives on her back.

580
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,280
Keep your voice down.

581
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,440
What are they doing?

582
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,200
Ignore them.

583
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,480
I'm Afang.

584
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,520
I live in the room next to yours.

585
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,160
These people

586
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,320
do nothing all day

587
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,280
but gossip about others.

588
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
You're so pretty,

589
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,840
I definitely don't believe those rumors.

590
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,120
But what if they're true?

591
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,120
Thank you,

592
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,080
but I don't mind.

593
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
Hey, are you reading

594
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,560
Xu Guozhang English?

595
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,720
Yes.

596
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,480
Do you want to study abroad too?

597
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,040
Maybe.

598
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,840
Have you talked to Director Ding
at the administration office?

599
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,160
If you want to study abroad,

600
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,400
you have to go through him.

601
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,600
I've talked to him.

602
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
He said I could take the exam,

603
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,800
but whether I can get in depends on me.

604
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,700
I've been studying all the time,

605
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,000
but

606
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,360
they laugh at me,

607
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,170
saying I'm overestimating myself.

608
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,200
Do you need reference materials?

609
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,840
I have a lot in my dorm.

610
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,880
I can lend them to you.

611
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,440
Really?

612
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,840
Come on.

613
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,560
You timely mended your mistakes.

614
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,120
So you are not completely hopeless.

615
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,720
Get up, I'm leaving.

616
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,240
Wait a minute.

617
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,920
What?

618
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,040
I have something important
to discuss with you.

619
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,040
You really act like a clingy dog.

620
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,240
You're mistaken.

621
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,400
I'm not a clingy dog.

622
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,880
I'm your suspect.

623
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,280
I'm glad you know that.

624
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,640
Those workers are betting on you.

625
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,600
Can't you see it?

626
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,840
So? Do you want to join them?

627
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,440
I'll help you out.

628
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,640
You can be so kind-hearted?

629
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
I'm not doing it just to help you.

630
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,240
We can make a deal.

631
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,080
I'll help you get rid of those workers,

632
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,320
and you'll help me catch the pervert

633
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,760
and clear my name.

634
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,240
Are you threatening me?

635
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,960
Not at all.

636
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,960
It's mutually beneficial.

637
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,120
Think about it.

638
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,280
(Medical Room)

639
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,320
- Does it hurt here?
- Oh, lower, lower.

640
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,240
- Here?
- Lower, lower.

641
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,200
Lower, lower.

642
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,280
Does it hurt here?

643
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,720
Lower, lower, lower.

644
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,160
Workers in your gel workshop
bend to work every day,

645
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,840
so muscle strain is normal.

646
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,080
How did you hurt your buttocks?

647
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,920
To be honest, Dr. Bai,

648
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,440
ever since you saw my buttocks

649
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,320
during the last physical examination,

650
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,080
they haven't been feeling great.

651
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,800
You must take responsibility for it.

652
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,680
Okay, how do you want to treat it?

653
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,840
Should I give you a painkiller injection

654
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,800
or

655
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,320
perform surgery directly?

656
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,160
Dr. Bai,

657
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,720
isn't there a gentler way?

658
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,720
Oh, you lazy thing!

659
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,880
You're the number one slacker.

660
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,920
Don't move, just lie here.

661
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,720
I'll call your workshop director for you.

662
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,560
Secretary Bi,

663
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,000
please don't badmouth me.

664
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,400
I have muscle strain.

665
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,360
Is it that serious?

666
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,160
Let me arrange early retirement for you.

667
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,520
Your seniority shouldn't be
less than 30 years.

668
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,000
What retirement?

669
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,640
I received a tip-off

670
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
that workers are lining up to see you.

671
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,160
I thought something was wrong,

672
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,680
afraid you might be harassed.

673
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,400
So I came to help you out.

674
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,400
Lining up?

675
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,200
There were several more outside.

676
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,480
Don't worry,

677
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,000
I've already sent them all away.

678
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,840
Why are you helping me?

679
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,920
Since that scoundrel Lu Xiaolu

680
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
said on the loudspeaker
that you're a murderer,

681
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,440
I'm afraid these workers
won't be friendly to you.

682
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,440
I can't stand

683
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,720
bullying and oppression,

684
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,200
especially bullying the weak

685
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,720
by the strong.

686
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,280
If they all think I'm a murderer,

687
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,520
how could they dare to bully me?

688
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,160
But the key is, you're not a murderer.

689
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,560
I've seen your file.

690
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,800
I just feel you're

691
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,000
a person with a tough life.

692
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,240
- So...
- Bad news! Bad news!

693
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,320
Dr. Bai,

694
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,520
some workers got drunk at Good Cat Stall

695
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,600
and got into a fight,
and someone got injured.

696
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,840
I'll go with you.

697
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,160
Dr. Bai, let's go quickly.

698
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,080
Another fight?

699
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,680
- Let's go.
- Secretary Bi.

700
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,080
I'll send you there.

701
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,920
Can you fight?

702
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,520
Who's injured? Let me see.

703
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,080
- I'm injured.
- It's okay, it's okay.

704
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,160
Just a little scrape.

705
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,240
With Dr. Bai's arrival,

706
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,200
I'm already healed.

707
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,680
Dr. Bai,

708
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,320
I heard you're also from the north,

709
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,960
so we're half-fellow countrymen.

710
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,280
These are dumplings I made myself.

711
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,800
Dumplings?

712
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,520
I'm Sun Guanghui.

713
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,600
These dumplings
have shrimp and crab meat.

714
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,760
I'm Lin Weihao.

715
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,080
These are egg dumplings
made by a special chef

716
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,840
from the No. 2 Light Industry Bureau.

717
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,200
Dr. Bai, try them.

718
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,000
Sit down. Sit down.

719
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,120
Sit down.

720
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,840
Dr. Bai, these are dumplings
I made myself.

721
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,320
My dumplings
are top-notch in our factory.

722
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,280
Have a taste.

723
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,120
Dr. Bai, let me tell you...

724
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,200
Dr. Bai, have some.

725
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,440
Don't be shy.

726
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,600
Try mine. Try it.

727
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,800
Enough with the dumplings.

728
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,600
Take them back.

729
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,640
Alright, it's a shame.

730
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,400
Why did you trick me here?

731
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,600
How could we be tricking you?

732
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,840
Dr. Bai, you've been at our factory
for two months,

733
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,200
and we haven't had a chance

734
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,160
to get to know you.

735
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,640
It is a good opportunity for us

736
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,480
to sit together and get to know

737
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,560
each other today.

738
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,400
- That's right.
- Well,

739
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,320
maybe

740
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,280
it could lead to something more.

741
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,280
Exactly.

742
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,280
I think you've misunderstood.

743
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,640
Misunderstood?

744
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,680
I'm here at the factory to work,

745
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,320
not to make friends.

746
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,600
The examination I did the other day

747
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,640
might have been a bit offensive,

748
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,040
but it doesn't mean I have any interest

749
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,200
in any of you.

750
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,760
And also...

751
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,200
And also what?

752
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,640
And also,

753
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,720
she already has a boyfriend.

754
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,320
Lu Xiaolu?

755
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,480
What are you doing here?

756
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,360
I heard you were here to rescue someone.

757
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,520
I'm here to pick you up after work.

758
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,600
These are your gifts

759
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,100
for my girlfriend, right?

760
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,240
Thanks to everyone
for looking after my girlfriend.

761
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,400
Please order anything you like.

762
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,520
Dinner is on me.

763
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,760
Lu Xiaolu,

764
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,320
stop pretending!

765
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,640
Everyone here knows that

766
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,520
you and Dr. Bai are at odds.

767
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,440
- Right.
- Exactly.

768
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,760
Her boyfriend? Ridiculous.

769
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,600
Calm down.

770
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,480
I know it's hard for you all to accept,

771
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,360
but that's the reality.

772
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,840
Darling,

773
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,840
look at my watch.

774
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,640

778
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,120
