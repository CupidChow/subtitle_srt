It's okay.

31
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,120
Get some more sleep.

32
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,400
The breakfast will be ready soon.

33
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,560
The last dish.

34
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,960
Not bad.

35
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,160
Try them.

36
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Try this first.

37
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,840
Fish ball soup.

38
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,280
Doesn't it taste good?

39
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,560
Bai Lan,

40
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,760
although the steak you cooked before

41
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,920
wasn't good,

42
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,560
it's still much better than this fish ball.

43
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,240
How did you know I made the steak?

44
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
What do you think?

45
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,680
In Fucheng,

46
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,880
not many cooks would

47
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,360
cook vegetables with roots

48
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,080
or fish with gills.

49
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
Then try this.

50
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,000
Alright, no one is forcing you to eat.

51
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,120
Come on.

52
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,080
When you go to Shanghai,

53
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,450
you don't have to cook anymore.

54
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,120
Just leave it to me.

55
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,080
Do you think we'll be able to

56
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,350
successfully make it to Shanghai?

57
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,440
Of course.

58
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,080
If it weren't for you,

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
I might never take the college
entrance exam again.

60
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,600
Since I've decided,

61
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,520
I'll definitely succeed.

62
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,640
Will we have our own home

63
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
in Shanghai?

64
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,250
Definitely.

65
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,600
By then,

66
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,490
we'll buy a small television

67
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,840
and a record player.

68
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,300
If you don't want to stay in the house,

69
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,640
I'll take you to eat your favorite

70
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,280
steak and coffee every day.

71
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,440
But you can't eat steak every day.

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
There's so much
delicious food in Shanghai,

73
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,320
like soup dumplings,

74
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,280
pan-fried buns,

75
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,260
and yellow croaker noodles.

76
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,040
We'll try them all.

77
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
Yeah,

78
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,080
we should try them all.

79
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,960
Hey, I heard that Shanghai

80
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,880
has built a very tall TV tower.

81
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,640
I really want to go see it.

82
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,000
Sure.

83
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,280
Bai Lan, you may not know that

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,600
after my cousin was arrested,

85
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
I didn't know

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
where my life was heading.

87
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,640
Fortunately, I met you,

88
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
and for the first time,
I feel like my life has a direction.

89
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,000
Will we always be together?

90
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,640
Yes.

91
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,240
Definitely.

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,400
By the way,

121
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,360
are you really planning

122
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,880
to not talk to Xiaolu anymore?

123
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,960
He was the one who was being

124
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,880
disloyal and heartless.

125
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
He's just pursuing

126
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,000
his own love and life.

127
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,160
What's wrong with that?

128
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,240
Actually, I don't blame him.

129
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,680
I blame myself.

130
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,960
I owe him a lot.

131
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,600
Wait,

132
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,080
you guys are good friends.

133
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,120
How could you

134
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,960
owe him anything?

135
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,720
If I tell you,

136
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,040
will you promise not to hate me?

137
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,600
I have known you for so long.

138
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,440
I won't hate you for anything.

139
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,120
Li Guangnan, you're a jerk!

140
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,640
You said you wouldn't hate me!

141
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
I had no choice at the time.

142
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,680
Lu Xiaolu has been so good to you,

143
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,920
and so has Lu Dajiang.

144
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,040
You're just a traitor.

145
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,880
No, come on.

146
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,040
Xiaolu,

147
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,840
you seem energetic today.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,400
You've finished work so quickly.

149
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,840
This is my last shift after all.

150
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,200
I won't come here tomorrow.

151
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,680
Why?

152
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,960
Are you going back to the repair team?

153
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,200
No,

154
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,360
I'm going to take
the college entrance exam.

155
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,080
Get lost if you don't want to work!

156
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,040
The factory doesn't need
slackers like you.

157
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,320
With your donkey brain,

158
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,200
you think you can make it to college?

159
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,680
What's wrong with going to college?

160
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
Going to college
is disrupting production,

161
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,560
it's like a parasite in the factory.

162
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,040
Do you know why the efficiency

163
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,920
of the factory is so bad?

164
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
It's because of people like him,

165
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
they're always

166
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,160
thinking about leaving.

167
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,040
How can they work well like that?

168
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,240
Cut the crap!

169
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,600
Watch your mouth!

170
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,320
Lu Xiaolu, what are you doing?

171
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,840
Do you also want to go to college?

172
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,760
Chen Guowei,

173
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,920
clean up the sugar syrup.

174
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,880
From now on,

175
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,480
you'll carry sacks together

176
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,440
with Lu Xiaolu in the warehouse.

177
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,520
Whose motorcycle is this?

178
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,000
It's mine.

179
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,680
What?

180
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,720
How did you afford a motorcycle?

181
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,000
It's none of your business.

182
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,120
Lu Xiaolu,

183
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,320
let me remind you.

184
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,520
Don't show off too much.

185
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,280
You might fall.

186
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,000
Is that so?

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,200
Let's wait and see.

188
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,680
Okay.

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
Xiaolu,

190
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,680
do you think I'm done for?

191
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
It's not a big deal.

192
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,160
I get scolded every day,

193
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,480
but I'm still doing fine.

194
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,120
But I'm not like you.

195
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,920
Your mom is the union chairwoman,

196
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,480
your dad is a factory cadre,

197
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,920
and your cousin is Lu...

198
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,160
Honestly,

199
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,880
I envy you.

200
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,800
My dad passed away early,

201
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,680
my mom's health is poor,

202
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,720
and we have no money at home.

203
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,640
Everything depends on me.

204
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,600
If I don't succeed,

205
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,480
everyone will

206
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,600
look down on me,

207
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
including Xiaoying.

208
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,800
But now,

209
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,920
before I could go to college,

210
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,760
I've become a parasite in the factory.

211
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,560
Stop it.

212
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,200
Don't bring that

213
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
old fart's words to heart.

214
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
For so many years,

215
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,520
you've been the most

216
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,600
dedicated worker in the factory.

217
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,840
It's not your fault that
the factory is not doing well.

218
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,480
Is that so?

219
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,720
Big Feet,

220
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,640
you must study hard,

221
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,800
and you must keep going.

222
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,360
You have your future.

223
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,680
He can see the end of his life already.

224
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,240
But how can I study?

225
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,520
I don't even have any books left.

226
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,260
I shouldn't have studied.

227
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,050
If I hadn't studied,

228
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,710
I wouldn't have been distracted
and fallen asleep.

229
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,510
If I hadn't fallen asleep,

230
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,920
I wouldn't have forgotten
to change the can.

231
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,210
If I hadn't forgotten to change the can,

232
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,250
the syrup wouldn't have spilled.

233
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,230
Don't worry about it.

234
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,720
I have to go clean it up.

235
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,120
I'll go with you.

236
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,480
Really?

237
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,960
Don't take it to heart.

238
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,360
Okay.

239
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
What is this?

240
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,360
Don't you understand what I said?

241
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,920
I wanted Buddha Jump and
Pickled Bamboo Shoots Fish.

242
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,360
What is this that you've given me?

243
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
Those are dishes meant for humans.

244
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,760
- You're not worthy of them!
- You...

245
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,640
What?

246
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,560
Now that the factory's in trouble,

247
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,400
yet you're

248
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,800
enjoying lavish meals every day.

249
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,240
If accountability were to be placed,

250
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,920
you'd be the first one to face the axe.

251
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,760
Comrade Niu Xiaoying,

252
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,040
please clarify your words.

253
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,440
Don't accuse others unfairly.

254
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,080
I'll clarify it right now.

255
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,560
You wait.

256
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,120
Xiaoying! Xiaoying!

257
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Why didn't you stop her?

258
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
I tried but failed.

259
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,200
Extra! Extra!

260
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,240
Exclusive news!

261
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,280
Do you know

262
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,600
how capable

263
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,840
Director Ding is?

264
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,040
When the price of eggs went up,

265
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,600
even the canteen couldn't get enough.

266
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,440
But his family

267
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,240
were throwing them into the trash can.

268
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,150
Every time the canteen received
ten tons of vegetables,

269
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,840
he would take one ton for himself.

270
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,240
Not only did he embezzle,

271
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,040
he also purchased expired food
for kickbacks.

272
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,080
Without any evidence,

273
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,280
you are spreading rumors!

274
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,120
Rumors?

275
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,600
Zhang, the food material deliverer,

276
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,080
is a distant relative of yours.

277
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,960
Do you think I don't know what you did?

278
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
Last July,

279
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,880
dozens of people in the factory
got food poisoning.

280
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,720
Why?

281
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,000
Because he

282
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,520
bought cheap diseased pork
from the countryside!

283
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,660
Plus the expired canned goods
from this year,

284
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,040
and gutter oil from the year before.

285
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,800
Just the canteen's operations alone,

286
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,520
he's done so many unethical things.

287
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,400
You're the biggest parasite
in our factory!

288
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,240
- Well said!
- Well said!

289
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,680
This is madness!

290
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,400
Don't listen to her nonsense.

291
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,440
Where are the security guards?

292
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,040
- You are still eating!
- Security guards!

293
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,320
You always rely on the security guards!

294
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,840
Xiaoying! Xiaoying! Calm down!

295
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,560
- Don't be impulsive.
- Don't resort to violence.

296
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,320
- Don't use violence.
- What are you doing, Ding Dezhong?

297
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,400
I know the reason now.

298
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,120
You're defending

299
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,480
Chen Guowei, right?

300
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
So what if I am?

301
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,120
You know clearly how many

302
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,360
unethical things you have done.

303
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,400
You tore his book up,

304
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,600
so I'll tear you up!

305
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,440
Nonsense!

306
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm telling you all,
I will discipline you!

307
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,080
Go ahead and discipline us.

308
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,760
I've been wanting to leave anyway.

309
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,200
Fine, I'll fulfill your wish.

310
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,280
Madman, slacker, rat droppings.

311
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,640
People like you should be expelled.

312
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,400
Xiaoying, calm yourself!

313
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,480
Xiaoying! Xiaoying!

314
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,600
Calm down!

315
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,480
Big Feet!

316
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,600
- Big Feet.
- Are you alright?

317
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm fine, I'm fine.

318
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,960
Xiaoying's hits don't hurt.

319
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,120
Alright.

320
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,760
Here.

321
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,360
Are you okay?

322
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,200
We're almost there.

323
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,800
I don't understand.

324
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,960
Why did you do that?

325
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,000
What benefit does

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,600
offending Ding Dezhong bring to you?

327
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,320
I have offended him enough already.

328
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,700
One more time won't make a difference.

329
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,880
He bullied Afang, demoted Bai Lan,

330
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,780
and framed Dajiang up.

331
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,420
I should've settled this score with him
long ago.

332
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,080
There's a saying,

333
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,280
"It's easy to deal with a gentleman,

334
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,680
but hard to guard against a villain."

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,400
Someone like Ding Dezhong

336
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,160
will make sure to get back at you.

337
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,440
What am I afraid of?

338
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,040
I'm leaving soon anyway.

339
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,600
I will be so far away from him.

340
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,880
Can he reach Shanghai?

341
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,720
What?

342
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,040
You don't think I can pass,

343
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,920
do you?

344
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
Believe it or not,

345
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,520
in the two practice exams,

346
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,040
I was first in the whole class.

347
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,280
Really?

348
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,520
See?

349
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,840
That's my son.

350
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,480
My son is smart of course.

351
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,000
If you don't pass this year,

352
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,960
you'll try again next year.

353
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,040
Xiaolu,

354
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,640
it's not that I don't support you,

355
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,120
but you need to be mentally prepared.

356
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,040
For what?

357
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,880
I just received news that

358
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,440
this time the factory

359
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,960
only has one spot

360
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,840
for study in Shanghai.

361
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,560
Secretary Hong!

362
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,400
Secretary Hong!

363
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,000
Secretary Hong is out of town.

364
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,640
What's the matter?

365
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,680
Let me ask you,

366
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,600
is it true that there's only one spot

367
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,440
for studying abroad

368
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,400
this year?

369
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,160
You're well-informed.

370
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,280
Why?

371
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,510
There were always three to five spots
available in previous years,

372
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,480
but why not this year?

373
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,960
The factory's performance isn't good
this year.

374
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,680
If we lose more workers now,

375
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,680
it'll only make people more unsettled.

376
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,680
Everyone wants to leave.

377
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,480
What will the factory do?

378
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
It'll just become an empty shell.

379
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,920
No way.

380
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,360
Don't lie to me.

381
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,920
Call Secretary Hong yourself

382
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,240
and see if it's true.

383
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,080
I know you want to leave.

384
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,040
This place is like stagnant water,

385
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,320
dreary,

386
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,000
oppressive,

387
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,280
suffocating.

388
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,840
Who doesn't want to leave?

389
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,600
But who can escape?

390
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,960
Some things

391
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
are destined from birth.

392
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,320
You can't escape,

393
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,120
and neither can I.

394
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,880
What about next year?

395
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
Just wait and see.

396
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,760
Everything will only get tighter

397
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,560
as the factory

398
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,880
gets through this rough patch.

399
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,960
How long do we have to wait?

400
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,640

I'm wondering,

461
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,160

what about the living expenses?

many things
that might happen in the future.

476
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,000

I mean if,

00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,320
I don't make it to Shanghai,

484
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,760

Yes, I can.

You agreed so quickly,

487
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,080
you didn't even ask me why.

488
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400

489
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm willing to wait for you.

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,920
You don't care about your results at all?

564
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,000
Or did you already know the outcome?

565
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
I care.

566
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,480
Of course, I care.

567
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,240
I was just afraid I didn't do well,

568
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,480
so I went to the movies.

569
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,360
Don't lie to me.

570
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,240
I called the provincial examination office,

571
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,050
and they said they didn't
have your results at all.

572
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,480
Explain this to me.

573
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,680
I didn't write my name.

574
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,240
I really didn't write my name.

575
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,960
There were several questions
I couldn't answer

576
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,920
and left blank.

577
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,840
I thought if the results came out

578
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
and my name was announced,

579
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,880
it would be so embarrassing.

580
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,000
So I...

581
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,440
You ranked in the top three
of the cram school.

582
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,280
How bad could it be?

583
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,440
Okay, I confess.

584
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,800
I confess now.

585
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,840
I went drinking with Li Guangnan.

586
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,240
I got drunk.

587
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,080
The next morning,

588
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,760
my head was buzzing like hell.

589
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,160
How could I do the test?

590
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,480
I definitely wouldn't know anything.

591
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,040
You went drinking the night
before the exam.

592
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,340
Did you really not have a clear mind,
or do you just not want to leave?

593
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,080
Can you stop lecturing me?

594
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,280
Yes, you're right.

595
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,640
I just don't want to leave.

596
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,280
I don't want to leave Fucheng.

597
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,320
Fucheng is my home.

598
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,700
Li Guangnan and the others are waiting
for me to do business.

599
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,520
Here is great.

600
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,800
But Shanghai...

601
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,240
What's so good about Shanghai?

602
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
I don't know anyone there.

603
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,880
What would I gain
from going to Shanghai?

604
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,920
You are serious?

605
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,920
I bought that cream

606
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,360
specially for you when I went to

607
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
take the exam in Shanghai.

608
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,840
I thought you might like it.

609
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,560
It's the hottest brand this year,

610
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,350
and you can't get it
anywhere else but Shanghai.

611
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,600
Are you

612
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,680
really leaving like this?

613
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,600
Yeah.

614
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,760
Shanghai is quite far from here, right?

615
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,000
Actually, it's not that far.

616
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,280
If you take a boat

617
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,200
and then a train,

618
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,480
it'll take about two days.

619
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,560
Oh, by the way,

620
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,200
I don't need these stuff anymore.

621
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,520
Can you help me dispose of it?

622
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,120
You don't want any of these things
that are still usable?

623
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,040
I want to leave behind some memories

624
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,800
and not take them with me.

625
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,080
What about me?

626
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
After you go to Shanghai,

627
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,280
will you forget about me?

628
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,280
Don't be silly.

629
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,120
Once I settle down there,

630
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,560
I'll write to you and call you.

631
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,440
It's a promise.

632
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,800
Promise.

633
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,080

We're all working overtime tonight
to catch up on production.

640
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,080
The factory can't pay wages.

641
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,880
Why is she back again?

642
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,510
Maybe she failed
making a living out there.

643
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,160
Why does she look like she's been fired?

644
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,840
Someone with no conscience like her

645
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,200
deserves to be fired.

646
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,240
The other day I heard,

647
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,160
she got a job in the bureau.

648
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,920
How did she end up back here?

649
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,240
She's superficial

650
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,280
and lacking in integrity.

651
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,360
I've always thought she was like this.

652
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,720
Exactly.

653
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,240

Let me tell you,

661
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,760
it's fate that made you stay.

662
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,200
Are you

663
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,240
feeling a bit smug now?

664
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,560
Xiaolu, I do not understand

665
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,960
why you can't just explain things
clearly to her.

666
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,400
What should I say?

667
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,800
Should I tell her that

668
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,840
I gave up my spot for her,

669
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,920
so she'll feel guilty

670
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,440
and grateful to me forever?

671
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,320
Have you thought about

672
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,000
taking the exam again next year?

673
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,760
Of course I have.

674
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,120
But who knows
if there will even be a spot

675
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,040
available next year?

676
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,240
I can't let her hold onto uncertain hope

677
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,760
and wait for me.

678
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,960
Besides,

679
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,200
even if I could go to Shanghai next year,

680
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,680
she might not accept me anymore.

681
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,200
You see, you're quite
clear-minded about this.

682
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,800
There's a saying,

683
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,560
when fate arrives, accept it.

684
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,360
If you can't go to Shanghai,

685
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,960
let's focus on running our business well.

686
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,240
Who needs that degree?

687
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,520
We can still make money.

688
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,040
Come on.

689
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,560
But are you feeling upset

690
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,040
about not going to Shanghai?

691
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,040
Are you trying to get yourself drunk?

692
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,440
Drink.

693
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,120
Li Guangnan,

694
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,920
I've had enough of you

695
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,880
always talking about money.

696
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,760
Look at you.

697
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,720
Can't you have some higher aspirations?

698
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,760
Lu Xiaolu,

699
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,600
do you know that I'm fed up with you too?

700
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,720
Your mouth is full of ideals

701
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,080
and dreams.

702
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,120
And you want to go to a big city.

703
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,520
What's so good about big cities?

704
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,520
You bumpkin,

705
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,960
you know nothing.

706
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,440
So what if I'm a bumpkin?

707
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,040
And what about you?

708
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,480
Do you think you're some celestial crane?

709
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,040
Let me tell you,

710
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,080
you're

711
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,120
at most just a

712
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,480
decent rooster

713
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,840
that

714
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,280
wants to fly high.

715
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,520
See?

716
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,360
You are down on the ground.

717
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,640
I'll tell you,

718
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,600
even if I'm a rooster,
I'm a fighting rooster.

719
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,000
The two of us together are a team.

720
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,160
What team?

721
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,440
Bumpkin Rooster Stew!

722
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,120
What are you saying?

723
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,000
But sounds delicious.

724
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,160
Li Guangnan,

725
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,320
actually, staying here isn't bad at all.

726
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,000
You're right.

727
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
I was being heartless before.

728
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,360
It's not that you're heartless.

729
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,880
It's that you were too sentimental.

730
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,840
I was the one being heartless.

731
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,400
You and Dajiang

732
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,160
treat me so well,

733
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,440
yet I betrayed you.

734
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,560
Not just Little Pouter
who looks down on me,

735
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,520
I look down on myself too.

736
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,480
What are you saying?

737
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,320
What do you mean?

738
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,720
I, Li Guangnan,

739
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,480
as an employee of the skating rink,

740
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,560
under Lu Dajiang's command,

741
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,720
engaged in illegal activities.

742
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,000
Now, I admit my mistakes

743
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,720
and report to the authorities,

744
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,360
hoping for leniency.

745
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
What are you saying?

746
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,080
They forced me to do it.

747
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,410
Otherwise,
both of us would end up in jail.

748
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,160
Xiaolu, I'm begging you.

749
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,440
You jerk!

750
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,680
I treated you like my best brother.

751
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,280
How could you do that to me?

752
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,480
My cousin treated you
like his own younger brother.

753
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,720
How could you do that to him?

754
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,520
Wretch!

755
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,200
Jerk!

756
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,080
Wretch!

757
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,000
Jerk!

758
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,640
Wretch!

759
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,600
Xiaolu,

760
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,520
I owe you so much.

761
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,040
As long as I have

762
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,120
something to eat,

763
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,840
I will never forget you.

764
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,440
From now on,

765
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,480
we are not friends anymore.

766
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,000
Dad,

767
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,240
I want to continue cooking for him.

768
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,360
Li Guangnan,

769
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,080
what's wrong with you?

770
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,280
How did you get injured like this?

771
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:52,880
What?

772
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,560
I

773
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,280
told Lu Xiaolu about it.

774
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,800
He told me

775
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,400
he'll never forgive me.

776
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,280
For over ten years,

777
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,440
Lu Xiaolu was my only friend.

778
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,880
But he told me

779
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,480
I'm not his friend anymore.

780
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,960
Why?

781
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,600
I desperately

782
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,040
try to

783
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,240
keep all of you here,

784
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,760
but why don't any of you want me?

785
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,880
Why?

786
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,120
What did I do wrong?

787
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,160
I will be with you.

788
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,000
I'll always be there for you.

789
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,520
What's that sound?

790
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,080
The boiler exploded.

791
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,920
Poisonous gas!

792
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,760
Come down quickly.

793
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,360
Hurry, hurry, run!

794
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,160
Earthquake, earthquake!

795
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,000
It's an earthquake!

796
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,960
- Hey, Xiaolu.
- Mom, what's wrong?

797
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,920
People are running out
due to the explosion,

798
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,560
why are you running inside?

799
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,320
Dad, Mom, you go first, hurry.

800
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,640
- Where are you going?
- You go first.

801
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,080
Why do you want to go in there?

802
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,680
Xiaolu, are you trying to kill yourself?

803
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,280
Mom, go, go!

804
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,120
You crazy kid,

805
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,960
where are you going?

806
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,360
Bai Lan,

807
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,480
have you lost your mind?

808
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,420
It's exploding
and you're not running away.

809
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,680
Are you afraid of death?

810
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,240
Aren't you afraid of death?

811
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,520
I'm not afraid of death,

812
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,480
but you're afraid
of even going to Shanghai.

813
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,000
Coward.

814
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,240
Bai Lan,

815
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,880
I love you.

816
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,560
Xiaolu,

817
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,520
I'm sorry.

818
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,240
Why apologize?

819
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,640
(Gongyuan)

820
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,800
I've figured it out.

821
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,040
I was wrong from the beginning.

822
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,720
I shouldn't have disrupted your life

823
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,840
and taken away your happiness.

824
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,640
You belong here.

825
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,840
Maybe here is where you can

826
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,000
truly be yourself,

827
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,400
but I don't belong here.

828
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,160
So in the end, we have to part

829
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,840
and return to our own worlds.

830
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,480
(Safety First)

831
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,000
Hey, comrade.

832
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,200
Wait, wait.

833
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,160
- Have all the passengers boarded?
- Yes.

834
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,000
We're ready to set sail.

835
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,520
Comrade,

836
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,840
please do me a favor.

837
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,680
I want to order a song

838
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,560
dedicated to someone.

839
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,640
Hmm, go ahead.

840
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,200
Bai Lan!

841
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,120
Bai Lan!

842
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,120
Bai Lan!

843
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,560
Dear passengers,

844
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,320
all our crew members

845
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,160
greet you

846
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,480
and wish you a pleasant journey

847
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,800
and a safe trip.

848
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,920
Next, we'll play a song

849
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,280
ordered by someone

850
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,760

851
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,000
