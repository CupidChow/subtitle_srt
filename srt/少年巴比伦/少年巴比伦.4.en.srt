According to the police station's notice,

the raincoat pervert appeared again

at the three-way intersection

29
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,240
500 meters west of the factory last night.

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,720
Currently, the police are making
every effort to solve this case.

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,740
I hope

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,040
all female workers in our factory
stay safe.

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,760
Why won't this person disappear?

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,380
(Security Department)
I heard the flasher has appeared again.

36
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,110
I want to confirm the time with you.

37
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,640
It should have been around

38
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,550
9 o'clock last night.

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,080
Then it wasn't Lu Xiaolu.

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,560
How do you know?

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,680
We were together at that time.

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,320
After we sent the German expert away,

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,760
we went to the Good Cat Stall.

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
Dr. Bai,

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,320
can I ask you a question?

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,240
Is Lu Xiaolu bothering you?

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,560
If so, tell me,

48
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,080
and I'll keep him away from you.

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,480
There's no need for that.

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I actually misunderstood him before.

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,640
If needed,

52
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,200
I can vouch for his innocence.

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Okay.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,200
Dr. Bai,

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
actually,

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,400
I didn't

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
believe it was Lu Xiaolu
from the beginning.

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,160
I've practically watched him grow up.

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,840
When he was young,

60
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,040
although he was lively,

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,880
he often helped the elderly
in our factory

62
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,240
by carrying things around

63
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,480
and running errands.

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,160
He's a good-hearted kid.

65
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,360
He wouldn't do that.

66
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,160
Of course,

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,520
solving the case
can't just rely on feelings, right?

68
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,240
You're right.

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,200
We need to find the real flasher

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,200
to clear Xiaolu's suspicion.

71
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,480
Right.

What are you doing here?

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
It's so dangerous.

77
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,720
I have quicklime.

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,200
I'll sprinkle it on him
when he gets close.

79
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,440
Your plan is not so great.

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,520
Stop talking and chase him!

81
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,360
Stop running!

Are you serious?

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,280
Do you have to yell so loudly?

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
You startled me.

86
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,640
That was my trick.

87
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
Whenever my dad hit me, it hurt a lot,

88
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
so I would scream

89
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,760
really loudly,

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,560
and then he wouldn't hit me so hard.

91
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,600
Actually, it didn't hurt at all.

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,440
Is that so?

93
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,000

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,120

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,680

Oh well, forget it.

105
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Just ignore it.

106
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,800
I'm fine now.

107
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,480
I didn't expect you
to be quite conservative.

108
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,800
My butt can only be shown
to my future wife.

109
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,480
How can I let you see it?

110
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,560
Will you marry me?

111
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm a doctor,

113
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,120
do I need to marry every patient?

114
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,560
If you don't want me to check, forget it.

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,880
What are you doing?

116
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
Nothing.

117
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,160
You had dust in your hair.

118
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,320
I wanted to blow it off for you.

119
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,240
Then help me get the electric fan.

120
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,280
You're quite clever.

121

Here.

122
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,360
Is it clean now?

123
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,360
Yes, much cleaner.

124
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,560
Isn't this great?

125
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,880
Do you finally believe

126
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,480
I'm not that pervert?

127
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,640
But I think today's person

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,040
is not the same as last time.

129
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,400
What do you mean?

130
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,600
Exhibitionism
is a psychological disorder.

131
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,800
Generally speaking,

132
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,480
their behavioral patterns don't change.

133
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,840
But today, this person

134
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,320
had no intention of flashing.

135
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,360
He attacked me with a stick right away.

136
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,240
And when I struggled with him,

137
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,200
I noticed his body was soft.

138
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,960
But the person from last time

139
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,320
had well-developed muscles.

140
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,880
I understand.

141
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,640
You must have suspected it was me

142
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,320
because he had great muscles.

143
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Lu Xiaolu,

144
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,920
you're shameless.

145
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,050
No wonder you've been beaten
since you were little.

146
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,200
Actually, you are wrong.

147
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,040
No one could beat me since I was little.

148
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,960
That just means
you've been beaten too little,

149
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,000
that's why you are so annoying now.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,360
I've always been annoying.

151
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,520
I think you knew it well.

152
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,800
It hurts!

153
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,920
You are less annoying now.

154
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,920
Are you crazy?

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,680
That hurt so much!

Oh, perfect timing.

159
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,440
I've discovered a new way to eat.

160
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,360

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,200
Want one?

162
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,680
I'll pass.

163
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,120
I have something to ask you.

164
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
- What's up?
- Look at this.

Don't joke with me like this.

169
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,840
The security department is watching.

170
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,240
This was from that pervert.

171
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,800
I don't have this.

172
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,200
Birth control supplies

173
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,360

by the trade union Chairwoman.

174
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,560
She's friendly and will

175
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,120
give them to anyone who asks.

176
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,120
You should

177
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,120
talk to her about this.

178
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,120
- Is it good?
- Yes.

179
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,360
I'm going to the medical room then.

180
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,200
Okay.

181
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,640
Three bamboos.

182
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,160
- Wait.
- Mom, Aunties.

183
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,560
Hey, Xiaolu,

184
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,720
- why are you back?
- You are back.

185
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,400
I came back to get some clean clothes.

186
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,680
Wait for me to finish this game,
and I'll get them for you.

187
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,640
Just focus on your mahjong.
I'll get them.

188
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,440
Look how considerate Xiaolu is.

189
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,000
You don't need to worry about him.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,240
Oh yes.

191
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,800
My son has been

192
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
playing with him

193
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,040
all the time.

194
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,560
He's smart. South.

195
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,480
I wonder who will be

196
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,360
so lucky to marry him in the future.

197
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,760
Not you for sure.

198
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,320
Excuse me, is this
Chairwoman Zhao Lizhen's house?

199
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,880
Who is it? Come in.

200
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,230
- Give me Five Characters.
- Alright, take it.

201
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,090
Five Characters?

202
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,160
- Hey, I, I...
- Who is it?

203
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,120
- Six Characters.
- Chairwoman Zhao.

204
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,800
Are you the new Dr. Bai?

205
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,560
We are playing mahjong.

206
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,720
Hey, these ladies

207
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,040
are all from our factory

208
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,200
and have been here for a long time.

209
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,800
You came to...

210
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,260
I went to the union this morning
to find you.

211
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,440
They said you weren't feeling well

212
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,760
and were resting at home.

213
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,840
Do you need me to check on you?

214
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,120
It's nothing.

215
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,920
It's just my son.

216
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
He moved to the factory.

217
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm not happy about it

218
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,000
and can't eat much.

219
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,240
My stomach hurts.

220
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,520
It's an old problem.

221
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
I just needed some rest.

222
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,040
Thank you for asking.

223
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,120
Come on, have a seat.

224
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,520
Oh, is there something wrong?

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,840
It's like this.

226
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,320
I heard that the birth control supplies

227
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,600
are kept with you, right?

228
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,480
Ah, yes.

229
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,720
They're in that room.

230
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,200
In that room?

231
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,080
You are new here,

232
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,000
so you don't know.

233
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,480
Let me explain.

234
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,680
There are many

235
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,120
middle-aged workers in the factory

236
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,560
and some young workers.

237
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,400
During the day,

238
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,800
they feel embarrassed to come

239
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
to my office to get them,

240
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,040
so I thought of an idea.

241
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,440
I moved these birth control

242
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,840
supplies home.

243
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
When they finish work,

244
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,560
they come quietly to get them.

245
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,040
This way, it avoids embarrassing them.

246
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,200
It's been working well like this.

247
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,360
Can I see the claim records?

248
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,460
What?

249
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,440
Records?

250
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,200
How can there be records for this?

251
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,480
This is a private matter

252
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,800
for couples.

253
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,120
I can't keep a...

254
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,340
According to regulations,

255
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,340
birth control supplies should be kept
by the medical room,

256
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,800
and every transaction should be
clearly recorded.

257
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,400
This way, we have a

258
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,560
clear trail for audits.

259
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,520
What are you implying?

260
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,400
Are you suggesting
I'm abusing my authority?

261
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,040
I didn't mean it that way.

262
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,240
But these are factory items,

263
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,840
not personal items.

264
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,000
Hey, why are you speaking like this?

265
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,560
Talking about factory and private items,

266
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,800
and you say you don't mean that?

267
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,200
I think you did mean it.

268
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,240
If that's what you're implying,

269
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,040
then let me tell you,

270
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,400
I, Zhao Lizhen,

271
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,560
have always been

272
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,600
diligent,

273
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,760
honest,

274
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,920
and willing to take on any task.

275
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,600
I've never engaged in any

276
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,520
underhanded dealings.

277
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,440
That's right.

278
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,320
Even the factory director
turns a blind eye to it,

279
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,240
you, a newcomer, why are you

280
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,600
acting so high and mighty?

281
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,680
Dr. Bai,

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,760
you're new here

283
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,750
and might not fully understand the situation
in the factory.

284
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,960
It's best to watch what you say.

285
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,080
We all know Chairwoman Zhao's

286
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,360
character very well.

287
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,320
Since there are no records,

288
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,400
I won't disturb you further.

289
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,630
I'll move the items back
to the medical room another day

290
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,840
to avoid misunderstandings.

291
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,480
- Well...
- What are you implying?

292
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,960
Are you threatening me?

293
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,200
Hey, why are you

294
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,800
speaking out of turn like this?

295
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,600
You should learn

296
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,240
some manners.

297
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,760
It's up to you
how you want to interpret this.

298
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,600
I'm just following regulations.

299
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,000
What are you doing?

300
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,000
I should ask you that question!

301
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,240
Do you think I was going to jump off?

302
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,520
(Gongyuan)

303
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,920
No one wants to live more than I do.

304
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,880
Even if you don't admit it,

305
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,760
I know

306
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,640
someone as proud as you

307
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
would feel ashamed to let others know

308
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,360
you have thoughts of dying.

309
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,200
I promise I won't tell anyone,

310
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,520
but you must never do something
like that again.

311
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,080
Even if others don't understand you,

312
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,040
I know

313
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,880
you're not the person they think you are.

314
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,800
You're not selfish at all.

315
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,360
Don't think you know me.

316
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,320
I am selfish.

317
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,240
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

318
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,080
- No, you're definitely not.
- Yes, I am.

319
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,720
I said you're not, so you're not.

320
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,800
I believe in you.

321
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
What is that room?

322
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,800
The...

323
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,200
The administrative office.

324
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,520
What's up?

325
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,440
I just saw a man

326
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,760
bullying a woman,

327
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,560
but then they disappeared.

328
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,120
It's fine if you don't want to accept me.

329
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,760
There's no need to come up with
such a lame excuse.

330
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,440
Do I need an excuse to reject you?

331
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,440
If you're not in a good mood,

332
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,840
how about
we go out together this weekend?

333
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,960
My cousin's ice skating rink
opens at 7:30.

334
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,760
Say my name at the door
for free admission.

335
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,760
It's a deal then.

336
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,400
I'll be there. See you then.

337
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes!

338
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,240
(Dajiang Skate Land)
Come on, dear friends!

339
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,680
It's the first day of
Dajiang Skate Land's opening!

340
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,640
Have fun!

341
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,680
Welcome! Come in!

342
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,600
You'll get a discount.

343
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,340
(Celebrating the opening of the skate land)
Come in, come in! Welcome!

344
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,320
Come in, please.

345
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,480
Hey, where's your girlfriend?

346
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,320
You haven't got her yet?

347
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,720
Hey, Xiaolu!

348
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,200
Slow down.

349
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,480
You might fall flat on your face.

350
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,680
Can't you lend me a hand?

351
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,600
Why did you come alone?

352
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,600
Where's Li Guangnan?

353
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,400
How would I know where he is?

354
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,960
Hey, change your shoes

355
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,840
and teach me.

356
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,960
I can't teach you.

357
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,040
Ask Li Guangnan to teach you.

358
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,120
He's good at it.

359
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,400
You'll teach better than him for sure.

360
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,240
Let's go.

361
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,960
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey, slow down.

362
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,240
That girl likes Xiaolu.

363
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,320
You sit down first.

364
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,600
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

365
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,840
Dear friends,

366
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,560
Dajiang Skate Land is officially open!

367
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,840
Thank you all for coming to support me.

368
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,560
We not only have
the latest generation of ice skates,

369
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,680
but also unlimited beer and soda.

370
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,280
To celebrate our opening,

371
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,000
we'll be hosting the Dajiang Cup

372
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,320
Skating Competition at 8 o'clock tonight.

373
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,600
Bravo!

374
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,120
The winner will receive

375
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,360
a one-year free pass.

376
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,640
Great!

377
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,000
We hope everyone will participate!

378
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,560
You've brought the girl,

379
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,080
show us some moves now.

380
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,480
Dajiang, you misunderstood.

381
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm not joining the competition.

382
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,480
If I do,

383
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,680
no one else will have a chance to win.

384
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,240
That's true.

385
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,160
Can I try?

386
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
It's you!

387
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
What? Not happy to see me?

388
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Everyone's welcome.

389
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
Please.

you don't expect.

402
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,400

Watch your language!

408
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,800
She must have a crush on me,

409
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,600
deliberately bumping into me.

410
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Sorry about that.

411
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,680
Come on, let me touch your little face.

413
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,240
Xiaolu.

414
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,160
What's wrong? What is it?

415
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,760
Someone harassed me.

416
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,600
Sit down first.

417
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,440
Lu Xiaolu!

418
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
Let go.

419
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,440
You call yourself a friend?

420
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,080
- What are you doing?
- Was it you who

421
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,160
left two movie tickets on my bed

422
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,340
and tricked me to go watch a movie?

423
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,080
What movie tickets?

424
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,240
What are you talking about?

425
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,880
It's a joyous occasion.

426
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,280
I brought my brothers here

427
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,680
to liven things up.

428
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,080
What if I say you are not welcome?

429
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,000
No matter if we are welcome,

430
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,680
we paid for our tickets.

431
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,360
You are here looking for trouble!

432
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,560
Lu Dajiang,

433
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
do you despise my brothers?

434
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,200
Honestly,

435
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,120
you might not win
in a head-to-head confrontation.

436
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,000
Laowu, the knife.

437
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,880
Boss, the knife is in the bike.

438
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,720
I left it there after peeling apples.

439
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
I have a hundred ways to deal with you.

440
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,080
What are you doing?

441
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,640
- Light it up!
- Put it down!

442
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,040
- I'll really light it.
- Calm down.

443
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,000
Put it down.

444
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,040
Boss Hu!

445
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,920
Let's talk things out.

446
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,360
You're still making excuses.

447
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,580
You just want to date Little Pouter.

448
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
- Li Guangnan, let go.
- It's not like that, Li Guangnan.

449
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,720
What are you doing?

450
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,200
I put the movie tickets there.

451
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,400
You stupid rats!

452
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,320
Even Buddha gets angry.

453
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,400
What do you want?

454
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,320
You want a fight?

455
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,400
Come on!

456
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,600

You deserve it.

483
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,640
What are you saying?

484
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,640
I've told you, I've been wronged.

485
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,800
You were already dating Little Pouter,

486
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,240
and you're still saying
you've been wronged?

487
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,880
You treat her like a treasure

488
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,200
but I don't.

489
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,000
The person I wanted to date

490
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,080
wasn't her at all.

491
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,480
It was me?

492
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,800
You wanted me to watch you fight?

493
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,480
Okay. You can leave.

494
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,320
It's done.

495
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,600
Let's go.

496
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,120
Come on.

497
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,440
Let's go!

498
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,920
But on another note,

499
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,680
you did pretty well today,

500
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,400
especially after drinking.

501
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,440
It was like a transformation,

502
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,200
just like that Sailor Moon thing.

503
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,120
Seems like you've done
this kind of thing before.

504
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
What do you think?

505
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,000
Let's stop talking and leave.

506
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,840
Wait a minute.

507
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,320
(Gongyuan)

508
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,280
Xiaolu,

509
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
I know that

510
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,360
your family is better off than mine,

511
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,800
and you're better looking than me.

512
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,440
If Little Pouter really likes you

513
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
and you're interested in her,

514
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,720
I'll back out.

515
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,120
You're my best bro,

516
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,680
and I don't want to fall out with you

517
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,560
over a woman.

518
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,000
You don't have to back out.

519
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,800
The person I like isn't her.

520
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,280
But she doesn't like me.

521
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,240
She's always cold to me.

522
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,240
But you still like her, right?

523
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Of course.

524
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,840
If you like someone,

525
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,480
you have to stick with it.

526
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,880
Don't give up.

527
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,200
But what if I'm 40

528
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,920
and she still doesn't like me?

529
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,320
Then you...

530
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,600
...just give up.

531
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,680
Give up?

532
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,080
Then who should I choose?

533
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,720
Xiaoying.

534
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,640
I think Xiaoying is pretty good.

535
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
She's like one of the guys.

536
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
She's probably not going

537
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,280
to get married by 40.

538
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,800
Forget it. I still want to

539
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,840
have a better old age.

540
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,000
Come on,

541
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,240
Xiaoying is great.

542
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,880
Think about it, she's kind,

543
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,680
righteous, and in good shape.

544
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm telling you,

545
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,880
she's the most special woman

546
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,120
in the world.

547
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,160
You really should...

548
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,000
You... You...

549
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,720
What are you doing here?

550
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,680
Lu Xiaolu,

551
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,220
you should say those things to my face.

552
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,280
Don't say that behind my back.

553
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,440
I like being praised.

554
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,960
Here.

555
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,280
Take it.

556
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,880
It's braised beef I made myself.

557
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,240
I'll come find you again.

558
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,640
Again?

559
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,360
Now I think

560
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,320
Xiaoying is not bad.
Why don't you consider her?

561
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,320
I...

562
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,160
Take it. It's all yours.

563
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,600
But it's for you.

564
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,920
(Don't take what belongs to others,
or I'll be after you every day.)

565
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,820
Xiaoying,

566
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,000
why are you dressed like this today?

567
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,880
Are you getting married?

568
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,960
Your mom is getting married!

569
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,120
My mom wouldn't dress like this
at her wedding.

570
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,840
Why are you dressed like a female spy?

571
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,040
Hey, Master,

572
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,280
what's wrong with your daughter today?

573
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,000
Look at her.

574
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,560
Don't say that.

575
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,080
Don't say that.

576
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,160
You will never get meat in the canteen.

577
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,600
You look really good.

578
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,760
Dad. Dad.

579
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,360
Don't call me dad.

580
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,120
Why are you dressed like this?

581
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,680
Don't you feel awkward?

582
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,840
Don't you? Don't you?

583
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,040
You get so drunk every night

584
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,160
that you can barely walk!

585
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,040
Don't you feel awkward?

586
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,880
I... You...

587
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,720
It...

588
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,920
It's for me?

589
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,940
Just take it.

590
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,520
Throw it away if you don't like it.

591
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,240
You too,

592
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,840
feel free to throw it away.

593
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,960
I...

594
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,240
That's enough.

595
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
Just hang in there.

596
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,480
You should pretend a little longer.

597
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,680
It just lasted for three minutes.

598
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,160
You're envious?

599
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,960
That beef looks really good.

600
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,960
Lu Xiaolu,

601
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
I have something to tell you.

602
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,880
What is it?

603
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,360
Do what you do now.

604
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
Let's talk in private later.

605
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,960
Here, eat this.

606
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,560
Xiaolu,

607
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,040
you're such a good friend.

608
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,280
Thank you so much.

609
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,320
The person who stuffed

610
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,000
the threatening letter
into your door crack

611
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,760
must be someone from the factory.

612
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,760
With so many people in the factory,

613
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,560
why target me specifically?

614
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,760
Don't you think you easily offend people?

615
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,640
Don't take what belongs to others,

616
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,920
or I'll be after you every day.

617
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
What's this?

618
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,400
An old booger?

619
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,720
Lu Xiaolu!

620
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,360
Black sesame seeds.

621
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,960
These are only used

622
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,360
in the walnut cake workshop.

623
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,400
It'll be like finding a needle

624
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,680
in a haystack to look for track him.

625
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,080
We don't need to do that.

626
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,080
He'll come to us.

627
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,840
(Don't take what belongs to others,
or I'll be after you every day.)

628
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,840
(Lost and Found)

629
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,280
Have you seen anyone
who looks like that flasher?

630
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,200
No, I haven't.

631
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,840
Do you think he'll come today?

632
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,800
Have you read Conan Doyle's novels?

633
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,960
What about them?

634
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,920
Confident killers

635
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,680
often return to the scene of the crime,

636
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,600
while timid ones

637
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,040
usually destroy all evidence.

638
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,080
This flasher doesn't dare show his face.

639
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,040
He only uses threatening letters,

640
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,760
which shows he's a coward.

641
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,000
Looks like you've read a lot of books.

642
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,120
My dad is a librarian.

643
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,320
I spent every summer vacation
at the library.

644
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,880
If you didn't miss
the college entrance exam,

645
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,320
would you have become a top student?

646
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,720
Hard to say.

647
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,560
Now, do you think

648
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,600
I'm quite impressive?

649
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,880
Do you kind of like me?

650
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,800
Stop being conceited.

651
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,560
It's going to rain.

652
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,040
Will he still come?

653
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,720
Perfect.

654
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:45,060
(Lost and Found)

655
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,040
(Don't take what belongs to others,
or I'll be after you every day.)

656
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:54,800
Someone's here.

657
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
- I'll go.
- Hey, don't be impulsive.

658
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,800
He doesn't look like that flasher.

659
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,320
He's gone.

660
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,800
Doesn't seem like
we'll have any luck today.

661
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,800
Let's go.

662
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,520
Let's wait a little longer.

663
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,920
Night shift is about to end.

664
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,160
Alright.

665
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,520
