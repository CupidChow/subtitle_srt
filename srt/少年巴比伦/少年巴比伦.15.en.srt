What's that?

31
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,200

the most important thing

for the rest of your lives?

191
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,640
Whatever you think.

192
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,760
Just don't tell him
it was me who told you.

193
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,270
Fine.

194
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,370
I'll hang up now.

195
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,200
What are you thinking?

196
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,910
Wondering how many days
Xiaolu has been gone?

197
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,470
I've cut ties with him.

198
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,080
Why would I think about him?

199
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,160
Please don't mention him in front of me.

200
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,520
What if I said

201
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,670
there's an opportunity to go to Shanghai?

202
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,160
So what?

203
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,370
If you want to go, go by yourself.

204
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,430
I won't go to see him.

205
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,470
I didn't say we were going to see him.

206
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,760
There's an import food fair in Shanghai

207
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,720
with many foreign drinks being sold.

208
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,880
Let's go take a look.

209
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,280
Maybe it'll be enlightening.

210
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,120
- Really?
- Yes.

211
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,550
Then let me take a look.

212
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,360
(Whole Wheat "Gold Bricks"
From Australia)

213
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,790
Looks pretty good.

214
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,310
When should we book our tickets?

215
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,760
Why are you laughing?

216
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,480
I just want to

217
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,430
attend

218
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,140
this import food fair,

219
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,600
not to see Lu Xiaolu.

220
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,610
Alright, alright.

221
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,570
We'll attend the fair.

222
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,810
We won't see Lu Xiaolu in Shanghai.

223
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,970
Of course we won't.

224
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,970
I don't have time for him.

225
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,030
Don't end up soft-hearted
and go see him when we are there.

226
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,860
Ma'am.

227
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,570
Miss Bai.

228
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,310
Why are you back so early today?

229
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,280
I went to buy some dinner.

230
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,510
Where's your younger brother?

231
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,550
Is he upstairs?

232
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,380
He's not here.

233
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,780
He's at the hospital.

234
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,310
He needs to be observed
for a few more days.

235
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,430
Come on.

236
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,570
Stop sneaking around,

237
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,830
you two.

238
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,830
Do you think I'm blind and deaf?

239
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,400
You're lying to me.

240
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,850
And lying is not right.

241
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,760
Do you understand?

242
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,950
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

243
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,160
We've been going through
a really tough time lately.

244
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,970
Once we start making money,

245
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,090
we'll move out right away.

246
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,280
Well, I don't mean that.

247
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,030
Everyone goes through a youthful phase.

248
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,530
I must say,

249
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,480
I can see you are having it tough.

250
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,790
Oh well, whatever.

251
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,660
Seeing as

252
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,520
you observed the rules,

253
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,030
I won't hold it against you.

254
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,600
Really, Ma'am?

255
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,000
Thank you so much.

256
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,550
But

257
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,430
living like this

258
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,520
is tough.

259
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,550
In the long run,

260
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,100
I don't think

261
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,190
you can keep it up.

262
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,310
What do you mean?

263
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,430
You know.

264
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,280
Mr. Yang.

265
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,950
Miss Bai.

266
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,650
About that new assignment
you mentioned last time,

267
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,430
is there still a chance?

268
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,340
Miss Bai,

269
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,880
you just gave it up like that,

270
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,640
the opportunity won't wait for you.

271
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,020
Look.

272
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,520
So many girls are here

273
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,000
to interview for it.

274
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,500
Has the model been decided?

275
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,140
Not yet.

276
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,430
The competition is fierce,

277
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,710
and the standards are high.

278
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,430
We'll have to choose carefully.

279
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,670
Count me in.

280
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,650
Hey, Miss...

281
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,290
Hey, Xiaolu.

282
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,260
I've been winning money recently
playing mahjong,

283
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,780
but one of the losers
didn't have cash to pay me,

284
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,160
so he gave me a German-imported camera.

285
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,090
Do you want it for your girlfriend?

286
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:36,930
How much is it?

287
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,480
It's cheap, only 1,000 yuan.

288
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,000
That's too expensive.

289
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,910
I haven't even received
my first month's salary yet.

290
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,190
Not expensive at all.

291
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,780
If you're not willing
to spend on your girlfriend,

292
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,570
she'll be upset.

293
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,930
If she finds out I'm spending recklessly,

294
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,000
she'll be even angrier.

295
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,380
Alright.

296
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,310
Who told you to put that there?

297
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,410
It can't be put here.

298
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,020
Who are you to meddle so much?

299
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,020
- This can't be here.
- Stop it!

300
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,070
Are you crazy?

301
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,780
- Sorry, sorry.
- You don't know how to walk?

302
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,210
- You have no eyes?
- I didn't mean to do that.

303
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,050
I am sorry.

304
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,600
What do you mean by that?

305
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,730
- You didn't mean to?
- Lu Xiaolu!

306
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,690
Are you blaming me?

307
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,530
No.

308
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,500
Why do you cause trouble everywhere?

309
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,670
If you want to quit, just say it.

310
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,020
A star-rated hotel

311
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,450
should have star-level service.

312
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,330
With a service like this,
how many stars do you deserve?

313
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,000
We apologize sincerely.

314
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,400
We'll punish him.

315
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,430
Apologize now.

316
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,770
I am sorry.

317
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,520
You've dirtied the guest's heels.

318
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,480
Clean them.

319
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,380
Lu Xiaolu,

320
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,360
do you want to get fired?

321
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,220
Can you wipe it clean
with your dirty sleeve?

322
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,280
If you can't,

323
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,070
then use your face.

324
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,600
Oh, forget it, forget it.

325
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,520
Stupid doorman. Such bad luck.

326
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,710
I'm really sorry.

327
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,730
Where are you going?

328
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,830
Let me call a taxi for you.

329
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,330
That woman humiliated you like that

330
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,360
and you actually endured it?

331
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,190
Are you still Lu Xiaolu?

332
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,600
It's none of your business.

333
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,120
I know it's none of my business.

334
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,520
I'm here for the food exhibition.

335
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,280
Who knew I'd stumble upon

336
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,480
something I shouldn't have seen.

337
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,430
I know you're still mad at me.

338
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,260
I was really wrong about
what happened with Dajiang.

339
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,190
I apologize to you.

340
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,330
You can even cripple me right now

341
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,360
as long as you can forgive me.

342
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,500
Alright?

343
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,910
I just have one request, Xiaolu,

344
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,030
go back with me.

345
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,910
Let's leave this mean city.

346
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,530
Really.

347
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,250
Let's go back and focus on our business.

348
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,300
In the future,
we'll be the guests of big hotels.

349
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,070
You won't have to bow
and scrape to them anymore.

350
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,550
Don't worry about me.

351
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm doing fine in Shanghai.

352
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,900
Stop being stubborn.

353
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,550
I saw what happened just now.

354
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,310
You are suffering as a doorman,

355
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,830
moreover, that picture of Bai Lan...

356
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,140
That's your woman!

357
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,500
Are you really so eager for money?

358
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,640
Li Guangnan, if you say one more word,

359
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,120
do you believe I'll kick you out?

360
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,050
Li Guangnan!

361
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,730
Sorry, Xiaolu.

362
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,000
Li Guangnan didn't mean that.

363
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,790
Lu Xiaolu, what are you doing here?

364
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,030
Zhang is so busy,

365
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,430
and you're hiding here drinking coffee.

366
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,910
Do you think you're a customer?

367
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,330
I'm discussing business
with a guest here.

368
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,600
Who do you think you are to interfere?

369
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,160
I'm sorry, sir.

370
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,850
Lu Xiaolu is our doorman.

371
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,210
It's his working hours now.

372
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,480
He's my guest at the moment.

373
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,760
Is this how you treat my guest?

374
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,400
Apologize to him.

375
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,880
I'm sorry, sir.

376
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,600
Please take your time.

377
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,170
Wait a minute.

378
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,240
Do you need anything else, sir?

379
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,550
My shoes are dirty.

380
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,880
You have
shoe polishing service here, right?

381
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,310
Please wait a moment.

382
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,670
I'll call someone to assist you.

383
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,400
I don't need anyone else.

384
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,670
I want you to do it.

385
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,400
It's just about money, right?

386
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,860
Polish them.

387
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,670
Not mine.

388
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,190
His.

389
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,830
Li Guangnan, that's enough!

390
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,840
I don't need you to show off here.

391
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,880
Do you think I'm showing off?

392
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,950
I'm just trying to prevent someone

393
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,980
from breaking your dignity with money!

394
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,300
This is the path I've chosen for myself.

395
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,140
What path?

396
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,750
The path of a doorman?

397
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,020
Working like a dog every day

398
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,170
just to be a good doorman?

399
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,080
Li Guangnan, keep quiet for a bit.

400
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,800
Now you find my words offensive, huh?

401
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,840
What did he say back then?

402
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,080
Why did he come to Shanghai?

403
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,610
To see the new world
and live a better life.

404
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,710
What about now?

405
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,100
Lu Xiaolu,

406
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,120
look at what you've become.

407
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,730
Leave.

408
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,970
Get out.

409
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,950
How's life

410
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,800
over here?

411
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,300
Good.

412
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,270
If my mom asks,

413
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,190
tell her

414
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,470
I'm doing fine in Shanghai,

415
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,430
making money.

416
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,640
Li Guangnan isn't good with words.

417
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,560
Don't take it to heart.

418
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,750
This is from Li Guangnan.

419
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,020
You need money

420
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,990
while you're away from home.

421
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,510
Take it.

422
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,360
When you meet problems,
don't keep them to yourself.

423
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,160
Give us a call.

424
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,160
(Health Milk)

425
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,800
(Milk Tea)

426
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,750
If I knew this was your daily job,

427
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,600
I definitely wouldn't have let you go.

428
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,910
Don't go there tomorrow,

429
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,580
okay?

430
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,640
Am I embarrassing you by being a model?

431
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,650
No,

432
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,270
I just don't want you
to take that kind of photo.

433
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,200
The original price is 2,300 yuan,
I'll give it to you for 1,000.

434
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,400
You've won quite a lot
playing mahjong, huh?

435
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,910
Just some old friends

436
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,990
playing for fun.

437
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,810
Why did you change your mind

438
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,040
and decide to buy the camera now?

439
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,390
It's my girlfriend's birthday.

440
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,490
Got it.

441
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,430
Your girlfriend asked you for a gift,
didn't she?

442
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,400
I actually hope she'd ask for something.

443
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,510
But she doesn't do that,

444
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,750
she just endures in silence.

445
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,880
You naive guy,

446
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,270
do you really believe that?

447
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,570
The girl on that human-shaped signboard

448
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,600
was your girlfriend, right?

449
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:19,990
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

450
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,800
That industry is like a big vat of dye,

451
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,090
full of temptations.

452
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,910
Even the best girls will change.

453
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,890
The less she tells you,

454
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,360
the more you should watch her closely.

455
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,650
Zhang,

456
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,600
don't speak ill of my girlfriend.

457
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm just reminding you.

458
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,270
Why are you upset?

459
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,640
I can see you've had it tough.

460
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,860
How about this?

461
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,270
I'll give you a 20% discount.

462
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,380
How about that?

463
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,690
Really?

464
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,730
Yes.

465
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,210
Thank you, Zhang.

466
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,410
You are welcome.

467
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,710
We're friends, aren't we?

468
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,330
- Manager Cao!
- Lu Xiaolu.

469
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,610
I couldn't find you anywhere.

470
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,040
I just delivered the luggage upstairs.

471
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,380
Hurry up

472
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,600
and push these suitcases over.

473
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,190
Alright, on it.

474
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,890
Listen,

475
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,910
I have an old client

476
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,430
who insists on seeing you.

477
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,170
You mean that Health Milk?

478
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,090
No,

479
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,270
it's a bigger client.

480
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,890
You'll see him in a moment.

481
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,270
Come on, this way.

482
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,690
There he is.

483
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,410
Mr. Huang.

484
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,010
Oh, hello.

485
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,640
Let me introduce you.

486
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,550
This is

487
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,300
Mr. Huang Qing from
Hong Kong Investment Group.

488
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,220
He's been in the mainland
for a short time

489
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,470
and has opened several subsidiaries.

490
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,750
He's young and promising.

491
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,080
Miss Bai Lan,

492
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,430
nice to meet you.

493
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,750
- Please, have a seat.
- Sure, thank you.

494
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,010
Miss Bai,

495
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,470
I saw your photo at the hotel exhibition,

496
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,470
and I was immediately drawn to it.

497
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,750
Thank you.

498
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,220
In my opinion,

499
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,040
those photos are sexy but not vulgar,

500
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,990
thanks to your skill

501
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,120
and your personal charm.

502
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,320
That's also why
I'm here to meet you today.

503
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,990
Do you also want me to be your model?

504
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,300
Yes.

505
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,190
My company is promoting
an Italian jewelry brand,

506
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,120
and I want you to be the model for it.

507
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,670
But I'm afraid I can't accept this job.

508
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,750
Last time it was 500 yuan a month,

509
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,910
this time I'm offering you
500 yuan a day.

510
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,710
I still can't accept.

511
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,880
Miss Bai,

512
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,910
please think it over.

513
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,600
It's such a rare opportunity.

514
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,400
If it was a few days ago,

515
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,510
maybe I could accept it.

516
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,780
Why?

517
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,800
Because my boyfriend
doesn't want me to be a model.

518
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,640
Although I really need money,

519
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,690
my boyfriend

520
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,360
is more important.

521
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,820
I'm sorry.

522
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,040
I'll take my leave.

523
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,320
Miss Bai, Miss...

524
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,510
Let me talk to her again.

525
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,450
Miss Bai,

526
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,840
500 yuan a day,

527
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,750
not 500 a month.

528
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,560
(Blue Road)

529
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,040
I thought you weren't coming.

530
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,190
I thought you were angry and not coming.

531
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,840
Even if I were angry, I'd still come.

532
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,810
That's right. Of course we'll come.

533
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,950
It was a deal.

534
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,130
Luckily, the place didn't close.
Let's go.

535
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,710
I suddenly changed my taste.

536
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,060
Let's go.

537
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,720
(Blue Road)

538
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,910
Noodles instead of Western food.

539
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,710
That's another fancy dinner I owe you.

540
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,100
Not at all.

541
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,260
It's our own restaurant anyway.

542
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,560
We can eat whenever we want.

543
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,100
True.

544
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,120
Close your eyes.

545
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,090
Why?

546
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,930
Just close them.

547
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,930
Happy birthday!

548
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,710
A camera?

549
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,090
This is for you,

550
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,120
but also for me.

551
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,160
What do you mean?

552
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,320
I want to learn photography.

553
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,940
In the future, I'll find clients for you

554
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,910
and help you take photos.

555
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,810
That way,

556
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,270
you won't have to suffer so much.

557
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,600
It's not that simple.

558
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,410
It does sound a little far-fetched.

559
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,300
But if we work together,

560
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,610
there's nothing we can't achieve.

561
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,670
What if we succeed?

562
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,640
But right now, your main focus
should be on studying.

563
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,810
If you don't want me
to go to the advertisement,

564
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,800
I won't go.

565
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,840
I just don't want you to be too tired.

566
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,190
Let me share some of the burden.

567
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,320
You don't trust that
I can learn photography?

568
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,840
No,

569
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,430
it's just not the right time now.

570
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,840
I just don't want you
to become more tired

571
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,270
or do things you don't want to do

572
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,880
because I am here.

573
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,040
Are you still mad at me?

574
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,040
Actually, I don't see anything wrong
with those photos.

575
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,430
I just

576
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,400
feel bad for you.

577
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,990
Let's take a picture.

578
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,690
I'll do it.

579
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,950
Three, two, one.

580
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,270
How is Lu Xiaolu usually at work?

581
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,610
Oh, he's pretty diligent,

582
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,460
just a bit mischievous.

583
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,640
- Mischievous?
- Hey, stop.

584
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,320
Yes, sir.
Manager Cao, what's the matter?

585
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,750
He's Lu Xiaolu.

586
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,020
You are Lu Xiaolu?

587
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,860
That's me.

588
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,130
A guest lost something.

589
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,240
We have some questions for you.

590
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,430
What was lost?

591
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,560
The front desk staff

592
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,950
saw you yesterday at lunch break

593
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,460
taking pictures of foreign guests

594
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,640
in the garden with a German camera.

595
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,940
Yes, I did that.

596
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,780
What's the issue?

597
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,160
Manager Cao, that didn't affect my work.

598
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,320
Let's discuss this somewhere else.

599
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,900
Okay.

600
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,400
Tell me,
where did you put the stolen camera?

601
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,300
I told you, the camera wasn't stolen.

602
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,600
It was sold to me by Zhang.

603
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,880
Who is Zhang?

604
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,040
Zhang Teng, my colleague.

605
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,370
He said he won the camera

606
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,650
in a mahjong game

607
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,750
and sold it to me cheaply.

608
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,410
Do you have any proof
of this transaction,

609
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,840
like a note?

610
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,470
I thought we were friends,

611
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,880
so I didn't ask for any proof.

612
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,220
Do you think this is our small town?

613
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,890
This is Shanghai, you know.

614
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,040
Who would be friends with you?

615
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,910
It's okay. Ask him and you'll get clarity.

616
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,160
Manager Cao,

617
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,650
I checked.

618
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,410
Zhang resigned last weekend.

619
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,840
No one knows where he went.

620
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,120
Do you have anything else to say?

621
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,510
In modern business cooperation,

622
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,510
the spirit of the contract
is one of the most important qualities.

623
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,380
However,

624
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,910
there is also a force majeure clause

625
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,750
in the terms.

626
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,470
Just last week,

627
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,430
I was a victim of theft

628
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,750
at the hotel

629
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,040
where I stayed.

630
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,040
I had to call the police,
which delayed our lecture

631
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,640
and caused a breach of contract.

632
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,840
Everyone,

633
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,570
do you think what I just said

634
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,950
constitutes force majeure?

635
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,570
No.

636
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,410
Yes.

637
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,910
- No.
- Yes.

638
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,100
Quiet,

639
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,600
everyone quiet.

640
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,160
Miss Bai Lan,

641
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,510
what do you think?

642
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,510
How did he know your name?

643
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,560
I don't think it does.

644
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,340
Why?

645
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,320
You only realized today
that something was missing,

646
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,190
indicating that you are usually
negligent with your belongings.

647
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,470
After you noticed,
you promptly reported it,

648
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,320
which was your proactive choice.

649
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,020
However, if you felt that

650
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,950
this lecture was important enough,

651
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,040
you could have waited until it ended
before reporting it.

652
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,600
Perhaps this incident

653
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,320
was a distraction for you,

654
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,950
but it's not enough
to justify your lateness.

655
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,450
She's right.

656
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,950
A mere camera

657
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,710
shouldn't be an excuse for me
to violate the spirit of the contract.

658
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,730
Alright,

659
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,580
let's continue.

660
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,610
- Comrade.
- Move.

661
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,190
It really wasn't me.
You've got the wrong person.

662
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,920
- It was Zhang Teng.
- Go explain it at the police station.

663
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,010
Zhang Teng has already fled.

664
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,950
- Cooperate.
- Manager Cao.

665
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,240
- Manager Cao.
- Get in the car.

666
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,990
- Manager Cao, please believe me.
- Cooperate.

667
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,360
- Listen to my explanation.
- Get in the car.

668
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,330
Stop dawdling. Get in the car.

669
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,230
It was Zhang Teng!

670
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,340
Manager Cao!

671
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,580
Mr. Huang,

672
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,670
thank you very much for giving such

673
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,510
a wonderful presentation to the students.

674
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,410
Don't mention it.

675
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,270
Next time you come to Hong Kong,

676
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,610
I'll take you to eat some great food.

677
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,580
Alright.

678
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,080
How was the food in Shanghai this time?

679
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,370
It suited my taste.

680
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,220
Great. Next time, try Shanghai potstickers.

681
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,060
Mr. Huang.

682
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,910
- Professor.
- Bai Lan.

683
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,990
Where did you go this afternoon?

684
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,320
Why did you leave
without saying anything?

685
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,900
Mr. Huang,

686
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,890
I have an unwelcome request to make.

687
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,880
Miss Bai, you have changed your mind

688
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,430
and want to accept my invitation?

689
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:09,930
What,

690
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,950
you know each other?

691
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,170
You can take your time.

692
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,110
I have something to attend to.

693
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,470
- Alright, thank you.
- Goodbye.

694
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,430
It's about the camera incident.

695
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,880
Can you please stop pursuing it?

696
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,450
Why?

697
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,190
Because if you continue pursuing it,

698
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,840
a good person might be wronged.

699
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,040
So, the person who stole my camera

700
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,120
is your friend?

701
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,750
It's my boyfriend.

702
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,120
But I assure you,
he's not that kind of person.

703
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,360
He wouldn't steal.

704
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,120
If he's truly been wronged,

705
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,990
the evidence will clear his name.

706
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,430
That's not my responsibility.

707
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,080
If you can help me with it,

708
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,090
I can shoot those advertisements

709
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,220
according to your requirements,

710
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,400
free of charge.

711
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,670
If you agree because of this reason,

712
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,040
it will seem like I coerced you.

713
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,750
Please help us.

714
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,430
I can't interfere with legal procedures.

715
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,510
I'm sorry.

716
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,190
What if I say

717
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,160
I made him steal it?

718
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,400
Is it worth it for a boyfriend

719
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,540
like this?

720
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,750
There's no other way.

721
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,950
If you really do this,

722
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,080
it's your choice.

723
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,040
If you're willing to face
the consequences, then fine.

724
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,080
You're back.

725
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,500
I just made instant noodles.

726
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,430
Let me get you a bowl.

727
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,080
Here, eat while it's hot.

728
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,600
You went to

729
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,430
the police station today?

730
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,160
Why would you take the blame for me?

731
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,500
I'd rather go to jail myself

732
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,360
than leave any blemish on your record.

733
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,400
Let's forget about this.

734
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,640
Don't mention it anymore.

735
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,120
How can we just forget?

736
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,650
It wasn't me who stole it.

737
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,910
Why admit to it?

738
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,400
Or were you never really sure about me?

739
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,390
I believe in you, so what?

740
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,540
I believe in you,

741
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,000
but others won't.

742
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,270
If they don't believe,
we can prove it to them.

743
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,600
There's always a way.

744
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,460
We've faced many

745
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,600
challenges in Fucheng,

746
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,870
so why can't we get through this one?

747
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,230
That was in Fucheng.

748
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,710
Now we're in Shanghai.

749
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,120
So what if it is Shanghai?

750
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,820
The Bai Lan I know

751
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,020
would never compromise

752
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,260
no matter how much she's been wronged.

753
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:36,970
What about you?

754
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,820
The Lu Xiaolu I know

755
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,710
wouldn't willingly be a doorman.

756
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,270
What do you mean?

757
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,640
Am I embarrassing you
by being a doorman?

758
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,530
I'm sorry.

759
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,350
That's not what I meant.

760
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
But I feel...

761
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,790
I feel...

762
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,190
I don't want to argue with you.

763
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,830
Let's eat noodles.

764
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,600
They are getting mushy.

765
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:58,240
(Disciplinary Action Against Bai Lan)

766
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,750
I'm back.

767
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,790
I brought some pan-fried buns for you.

768
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,260
Bai Lan,

769
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,130
I'm sorry.

770
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,180
I have left.

771
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,790
You're right.

772
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,160
Shanghai is big

773
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,750
and nice,

774
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,440
but it belongs to you,

775
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,390
not me.

776
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,670
Perhaps you'll call me a coward

777
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,390
or even a liar.

778
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:43,970
I know,

779
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,750
we made many promises back then,

780
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,380
and I tried hard

781
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,040
to realize them with you.

782
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,710
But now I realize

783
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,270
I can't do it.

784
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,880
I chose to stay in Shanghai

785
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,240
to brighten and warm

786
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,280
your life

787
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,880
with my presence,

788
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,200
but in reality,

789
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,640
it made your life just as messy as mine.

790
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,360
Those moments of happiness

791
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,080
are like sand by the sea.

792
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,960
Even if we both
give our all for each other,

793
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,120
(Blue Road)
they still slip away bit by bit.

794
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,960
I try desperately

795
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,880
just to find I can't even
catch the passing breeze.

796
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,320
If I could go back,

797
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,440
I would still tell that Lu Xiaolu

798
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,240
sitting on the train,

799
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,120
he'll spend beautiful times

800
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,040
in Shanghai.

801
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,520
But please forgive me

802
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,200
for choosing to be a disgraceful deserter.

803
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,680
I willingly disappear from your life.

804
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,440
I hope

805
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,640
you forget the arguments we had,

806
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,000
forget my disturbances,

807
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
my entanglements,

808
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,400
and also the immature
and insignificant me

809
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,440
to embrace the future
that truly belongs to you.

810
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,400
I wish you a smooth life

811
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,960
and success in all your endeavors.
