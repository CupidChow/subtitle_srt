00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,060
How did I offend you?

25
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,650
You've been following me repeatedly

26
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,930
and even wrote me a threatening letter.

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,500
And the letter says,

28
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,290
"Don't take what belongs to others".

29
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,620
What does that mean?

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,860
Do you remember when we first met

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,010
in the dormitory water room?

32
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,050
Have you talked to Director Ding
at the administration office?

33
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,540
If you want to study abroad,

34
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,730
you have to go through him.

35
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,260
I've talked to him.

36
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,610
He said I could take the exam,

37
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,030
but whether I can get in

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,130
depends on me.

39
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,980
There are so many spots in the factory.

40
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,570
It's not like only one of us can do that.

41
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,760
Why are you targeting me?

42
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,850
You are wrong.

43
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,050
The spots for us workers

44
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,660
are already very limited.

45
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,060
I

46
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,860
begged Ding Dezhong for a long time

47
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,820
and paid a great price,

48
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,540
and he agreed to give me a spot.

49
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,570
But just a few days ago,
he suddenly changed his mind,

50
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,640
saying that the spot was taken
by a cadre.

51
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,730
I checked,

52
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,220
and you're the only one
who's taking the exam this year.

53
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,660
The spots for workers are already limited,

54
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,100
why do you have to take it away from me?

55
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,290
Do you have no conscience?

56
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,330
But you're wrong.

57
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,050
I'm not the one who took your spot.

58
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,770
Who else could it be?

59
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,050
It's Ding Dezhong who has no conscience.

60
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,420
But no matter what, what you're doing

61
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,330
won't solve any problems.

62
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,060
Forget it.

63
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,980
Just go.

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,880
(Lounge, Security Department)

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,600
(Gongyuan)

66
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,980
Lu Xiaolu, could you hurry up?

67
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,720
I'm waiting to work here.

68
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,600
Why are you rushing?

69
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Why don't you fix it yourself?

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
Look at this, does it look easy to fix?

71
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
What is this? A rebellion?

72
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
If I could fix it myself,

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,560
why would I need to ask you?

74
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,960
Take a look. Does this look like

75
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,120
it was drawn by a child?

76
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,600
Why does it look like
it was from a fight?

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,440
Come here,

78
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,240
take a look.

79
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,080
Nail marks.

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,920
Why do I feel like

81
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,320
these were made by a woman?

82
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,120
Stop talking nonsense!

83
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,520
What's wrong, Director Ding?

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,360
Why are you so mad?

85
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,640
It's just a joke.

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
That joke isn't funny at all.

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,560
Ding Dezhong,

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,000
you deserve a tragic death.

89
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,560
If you don't uphold justice today,

90
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,040
I'll jump from here.

91
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,240
Don't tell anyone

92
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,600
you saw me today.

93
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,880
Remember my words.

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,800
My guess is so accurate?

=Smooth Cooperation=

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
What if she really jumps?

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,440
We need to save her.

98
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,800
We can't save her.

99
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
She directly blamed

100
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,540
Ding Dezhong.

101
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,040
There's an old saying that goes,

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,620
"The one who tied the bell should untie it."

103
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,680
Isn't that right, everyone?

104
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,720
Yes!

105
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,640
Hey, Afang!

106
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,440
Calm down!

107
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
The factory leadership

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,680
will definitely resolve your issue.

109
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,960
You must believe, you must...

110
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,360
She is accusing the factory leadership.

111
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,750
And you're still talking about leadership.

112
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,440
Do you know what it is?

113
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,600
You might as well just push her off.

114
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,780
- Shut up.
- Good for nothing.

115
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,280
Can you two stop talking for a moment?

116
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,920
Alright, everyone, be quiet.

117
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,040
Shut up.

118
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,400
Saving a life is the priority.

119
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,840
Afang,

120
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,520
let's talk.

121
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,720
How old are you this year?

122
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Oh, you're 24.

123
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,320
A 24-year-old

124
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,280
should stop being so stubborn.

125
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
You need to believe that

126
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,440
the factory will never mistreat you.

127
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,960
We will speak up for you.

128
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,000
The factory will never ruin your future

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
over such a small matter.

130
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,120
We will never allow anyone

131
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,360
to harm you,

132
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,740
regardless of their status.

133
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,040
This sounds like the right thing to say.

134
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,280
If anyone is

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,440
causing trouble in the factory,

136
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,040
I, Bi Zhigang,
will be the first to oppose it.

137
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,480
- Well said!
- Great!

138
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,040
I'll be the first one to stand up for you.

139
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Quiet down.

140
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,510
What nonsense are you talking about?

141
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,360
- Quiet down.
- I didn't...

142
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,520
Why are you defending her?

143
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
Mrs. Ding, please.

144
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't say anything, okay?

145
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,880
Am I talking too much?

146
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
Security, maintain order.

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,960
Quickly, quickly.

148
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,720
Hey, Afang...

149
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
Enough! Enough!

150
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,320
Hey, everyone, listen to me.

151
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
Who's causing trouble here?

152
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,440
It's her!

153
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,080
She's causing trouble,

154
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,440
accusing my husband here.

155
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
She is the troublemaker!

156
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,560
- I'm not causing trouble.
- You're slandering him!

157
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
I'm not slandering him!

158
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,760
I'm not!

159
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,360
Alright, alright.

160
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
You didn't slander, right?

161
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,080
Will anyone stand up to testify for you?

162
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,160
Who can testify for her?

163
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,760
I can.

164
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,400
Oh, how did he get up there?

165
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,000
Afang, calm down.

166
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,240
Why did you come up?

167
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
You step back.

168
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,120
If you come one step closer, I'll jump.

169
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,280
We can testify for you.

170
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,040
Really!

171
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,880
That day,

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Wednesday night,

173
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,960
in the administrative office,
it was you, right?

174
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,720
I thought I was mistaken at the time,

175
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,720
but now I understand everything.

176
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,720
We really saw it.

177
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,200
We believe you.

178
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,040
We can definitely help you get justice.

179
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,040
You can trust us.

180
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,680
Come on, give me your hand.

181
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,840
Listen to me, all of you.

182
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,890
I, Lu Xiaolu, can testify that

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,560
Afang did not slander Ding Dezhong.

184
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,520
- Great!
- Bravo!

185
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,480
Stop yelling!

186
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,440
Stop it!

187
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,080
Why are you cheering?

188
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,320
Lu Xiaolu,

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,960
you're lying.

190
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,800
Do you know

191
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,720
she's lying?

192
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,000
She's lying!

193
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,400
Hey, enough, enough.
What are you all looking at?

194
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,800
There's nothing to see here.

195
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,560
It's time to work, not to waste time.

196
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,080
Go on, disperse.

197
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,280
Unbelievable.

198
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,480
Why are you shouting so loudly?

199
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,000
Um, I...

200
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,750
I just wanted to know
if Afang is seriously injured.

201
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,040
She's fine.

202
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,040
I will stay with her.

203
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,760
And what about you?

204
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,760
Are you injured?

205
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,280
Is that your concern?

206
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,680
Go back to work now.

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,320
Whether I work or not doesn't matter.

208
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,560
What matters is that you don't get hurt.

209
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,720
I'm the one who's hurt.

210
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,720
Why are you everywhere?

211
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
What are you doing here?

212
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,320
Secretary Bi,

213
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,480
you're showing concern for everyone.

214
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,400
I...

215
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,080
But why don't you show concern for me?

216
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,280
What is this?

217
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,480
Get off me!

218
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,760
Disgusting.

219
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,920
Afang... Afang fainted!

220
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,770
Quick, quick, quick!

221
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,790
(Fucheng People's Hospital
Collaborative Guidance Hospital)

222
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,680
You didn't see anything that day,

223
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,960
yet you came forward just now.

224
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,280
Because I knew that

225
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,840
even if I didn't come forward,

226
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,240
you would still jump out.

227
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,560
You still think you don't have enough
enemies in the factory?

228
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,560
Aren't you the same?

229
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,880
We are the same kind.

230
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,480
As for Ding Dezhong, that old scoundrel,

231
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,760
I've disliked him for a long time.

232
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,680
This is a good opportunity
to teach him a lesson.

233
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,480
But what about you?

234
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
Didn't you say

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
you were a selfish person?

236
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,640
Why are you getting involved in this?

237
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,920
But speaking of which,
it's quite miraculous.

238
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,440
Just a few days ago, we were discussing

239
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,600
how to catch the flasher,

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,880
and today
we're thinking of how to help her.

241
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,840
Yeah,

242
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,680
it's really miraculous.

243
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,000
The two of us were mortal enemies

244
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,250
a few days ago because of this matter,

245
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,440
and now we're allies.

246
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,040
Doctor.

247
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,240
Doctor, how is Afang?

248
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,400
It's nothing serious.

249
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,700
She'll be hospitalized for a few days.

250
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,440
Alright, then you go back first.

251
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,880
Don't worry.
I'll take care of her these days.

252
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,240
They say that

253
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,680
what goes around comes around,

254
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,360
but sometimes,

255
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,840
even heaven turns a blind eye.

256
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,280
Hey, the big hero is back.

257
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,000
Lu Xiaolu,

258
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,760
the hero who saved the beauty,

259
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,560
is back in the limelight.

260
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,760
But let me ask you,

261
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,160
are you really going to testify about

262
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,960
Ding Dezhong and Afang?

263
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,200
Of course.

264
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,480
What's wrong?

265
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
What's with all your looks?

266
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,360
Then let me ask you,

267
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,520
if the factory office

268
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,680
asks you to testify,

269
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,000
will you dare?

270
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,560
Let me ask you, Xiaolu,

271
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,400
if this goes to court,

272
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,240
will you dare to testify?

273
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,920
If the factory sides with Ding Dezhong

274
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,640
and fires you, what will you do?

275
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,040
What do I have to fear?

276
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,960
Come on, Xiaolu,

277
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,520
I think everyone's concerns are valid.

278
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,340
Ding Dezhong has been in the factory
for so many years,

279
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,280
he must have taken roots.

280
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,400
If you confront him like this,

281
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,850
will you still have a future here?

282
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,760
Li Guangnan,

283
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,800
why are you siding with him?

284
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,160
I'm not siding with him.

285
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
I'm definitely standing with Afang.

286
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,960
But if you go against Ding Dezhong,

287
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,400
Little Pouter
will be in a difficult position.

288
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,800
Master,

289
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,000
how do you see this?

290
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,960
Man,

291
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,640
this situation

292
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,000
has gotten deep.

293
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,320
Hello?

294
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,080
Okay, wait a minute.

295
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,560
Lu Xiaolu,

296
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,480
your mom's calling.

297
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,560
Hello, Mom.

298
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,480
I went to the city labor union today
for something,

299
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,720
and you've made trouble again.

300
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,960
Come home right now.

301
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,200
Mom.

302
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,000
She's angry?

303
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,960
Mom,

304
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,680
I rushed home after you

305
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,880
told me to.

306
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,280
Come on.

307
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
Come here.

308
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,320
Do as your mom says.

309
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
Don't go against her.

310
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,800
Sign this.

311
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,560
Apology letter?

312
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,840
I, Lu Xiaolu,

313
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
at a critical moment

314
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,800
to save my factory colleague
Liu Fang's life,

315
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,440
had to falsely claim that

316
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
I saw Director Ding Dezhong
mistreating her.

317
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,800
Mom, what does this mean?

318
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,280
It's not a false claim.

319
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,760
Keep reading.

320
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,680
Do it. Keep reading.

321
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,240
Director Ding is a just person

322
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
who has always worked tirelessly
and selflessly

323
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,480
for the factory.

324
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,000
But in this sudden situation,

325
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,720
I resorted to this strategy to save a life

326
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,360
and told a white lie,

327
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,840
which unfairly damaged

328
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,680
Director Ding's reputation.

329
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,440
Director Ding, please forgive...

330
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,320
Mom, what does this mean?

331
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,400
Let me say it again.

332
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I didn't lie.

333
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,920
This is nonsense.

334
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,760
I can't sign this.

335
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,680
Nonsense?

336
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,200
You talk tough.

337
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,120
This is to save your life.

338
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,880
If you offend Ding Dezhong

339
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,560
and he fires you,

340
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,680
what other factory
will dare to take you in?

341
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,960
Are you going to end up on the streets?

342
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,280
Even if I become a street beggar,

343
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,640
I won't apologize to Ding Dezhong.

344
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,480
Fine.

345
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,560
Okay.

346
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,060
You just go

347
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,440
be a street beggar.

348
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
Don't even call me your mom anymore.

349
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,320
I won't be involved in your affairs.

350
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,360
Dad,

351
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,880
Mom,

352
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,240
since I was young, you taught me

353
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,240
not to confuse right and wrong,

354
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,080
and to be truthful.

355
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,320
Isn't that right?

356
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,680
Was that

357
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,080
just a joke?

358
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,880
How can that be a joke?

359
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,840
Our family values have been

360
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,880
passed down for generations.

361
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,440
We must be

362
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
honest and trustworthy,

363
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,160
right?

364
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,120
What does that mean?

365
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,560
Are you two trying to say

366
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,240
I'm an evil person?

367
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm a villain to you, right?

368
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,640
No.

369
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,810
I'll take responsibility
for my actions alone.

370
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,120
I won't sign this document.

371
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,040
You've grown up.

372
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,480
A man should seek justice,

373
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,520
and help the weak.

374
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,660
That's what my cousin should be like.

375
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,520
Dajiang,

376
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,600
are you supporting me?

377
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,600
But there's a saying,

378
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,720
"Those who know
when to retreat are wise."

379
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,320
The mess in the factory won't be
resolved easily.

380
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,560
Even if you step up now,

381
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,520
it won't change anything.

382
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,560
Why are you talking like my dad?

383
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,240
Standing up now

384
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,760
can at least bring justice to Afang.

385
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,360
If I hide like a turtle,

386
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,640
how am I any different from

387
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,680
that scoundrel Ding Dezhong?

388
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,840
Lu Xiaolu,
you're so full of righteousness.

389
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
My uncle is a scoundrel.

390
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,320
Then what am I?

391
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,880
Why are you here?

392
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,120
I called her here.

393
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,680
Your mom was getting upset,

394
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,320
so I had no choice.

395
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,760
Have a seat.

396
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,520
Say it.

397
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,160
Say what?

398
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,400
Your cousin said you'd apologize to me

399
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,560
for yesterday's incident,

400
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,400
so I'm here.

401
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,480
Apologize?

402
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,840
Apologize for what?

403
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,840
For falsely accusing my uncle,
hitting my aunt,

404
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,920
and embarrassing me.

405
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,880
Little Pouter,

406
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,280
don't you know what kind of person

407
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,640
your uncle is?

408
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,000
Besides,

409
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,160
I didn't accuse you of anything,

410
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,360
how could I have embarrassed you?

411
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,360
Lu Xiaolu, do you have to do this to me?

412
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,160
How did I offend you?

413
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,880
Just because my uncle is Ding Dezhong,

414
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,120
everyone hates me.

415
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,240
You all look down on me.

416
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,600
Don't say that.

417
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,080
You're you, and they're them.

418
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,080
I don't mix you up with them,

419
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,600
and I don't look down on you.

420
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,000
Lu Xiaolu,

421
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,520
listen to me.

422
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,920
Don't speak up for Afang anymore.

423
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
You have no proof.

424
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,240
Go apologize to my uncle and aunt first.

425
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,280
Then I'll try to help you explain.

426
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,680
If they still won't let you off,

427
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,360
I'll throw a tantrum and cause a scene.

428
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,380
I'm going to cry and make a scene.

429
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,400
Lu Xiaolu,
I'm doing this for your own good.

430
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,600
If you don't apologize,

431
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
you'll be fired.

432
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,920
I don't want that for you.

433
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,080
I know you mean well,

434
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,080
but today I need
to make it clear to you that

435
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,800
even if I'm fired,

436
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,440
I won't compromise on this matter.

437
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,280
Lu Xiaolu!

438
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
You stubborn Lu Xiaolu!

439
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,280
Stubborn!

440
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,640
Stubborn!

441
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,200
Director Ding.

442
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,920
What are you doing here?

443
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,960
I came to see

444
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,120
how Auntie is doing.

445
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,120
A small gift.

446
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,640
She's doing well.

447
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,960
But I'm not.

448
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,800
It seems she misunderstood anyway.

449
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,000
Misunderstood?

450
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,280
Sit down.

451
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
I heard you made a great effort that day

452
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,000
when Afang lost control,

453
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,440
saying comforting words

454
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,680
to prevent a disaster.

455
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,480
It was the least I could do.

456
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,240
But my promise to speak up for her

457
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,440
was conditional. She had to be

458
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,440
telling the truth.

459
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,080
If she was spreading rumors

460
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,320
and harming others,

461
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,320
that would not be acceptable.

462
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,360
So, do you think

463
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,320
what she said was true?

464
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,880
Impossible.

465
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Everyone knows that

466
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,650
Afang was not in her right mind.

467
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,920
She was talking nonsense.

468
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,840
She's crazy?

469
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,000
Very delusional.

470
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,640
Everybody thinks so.

471
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,780
That's the only possibility.

472
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,040
That's right!

473
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,280
But that Lu Xiaolu

474
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,720
was just fanning the flames.

475
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,800
I have never offended Zhao Lizhen.

476
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,320
Why does her son always
have a problem with me?

477
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,320
Lu Xiaolu isn't crazy.

478
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,040
He's just an evil person. You know?

479
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,920
He spreads rumors with sinister intentions.

480
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,200
- Exactly.
- We need to deal with him.

481
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,960
What

482
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,560
should I do from now on?

483
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,680
Mental illness is serious.

484
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,960
We can't make baseless claims.

485
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,120
We need proof.

486
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,720
Proof?

487
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,680
Dr. Bai can provide a medical certificate.

488
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,360
Bai Lan is

489
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,320
quite educated,

490
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,940
but she has trouble
distinguishing right from wrong.

491
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,000
Uncle Ding,

492
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,520
trust me,

493
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,560
if you agree,

494
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,280
let me handle this.

495
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,280
Can you handle it?

496
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,360
We have a close relationship.

497
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,200
Good for you, boy.

498
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,160
You could even handle that ice queen.

499
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,760
You're promising.

500
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,440
My dad is my role model.

501
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,160
Yes, indeed.

502
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,200
How do you plan to handle her?

503
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,880
If you can't bear the pain,

504
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,960
you can take one

505
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
of these painkillers,

506
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,880
but no more than three a day.

507
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,440
Dr. Bai,

508
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,640
I'm sorry

509
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,320
for how I treated you before.

510
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,960
It's okay.

511
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,800
That's in the past.

512
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,440
Two years ago,

513
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,400
I passed the exam,

514
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,720
but Ding Dezhong gave the quota

515
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,640
to the son of the beverage
department director,

516
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,200
blocking my chance.

517
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,160
Last year,

518
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,840
when I passed again,

519
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,050
he said there were no quotas left
in the factory.

520
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,400
Later, I found out

521
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,780
the quota went to the son
of the finance department director.

522
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,320
One day, he came to me

523
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,680
and asked if I still wanted
to take the exam this year.

524
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
I said yes.

525
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,600
He said

526
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
passing exams on paper was useless.

527
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,040
I'd never succeed that way.

528
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,880
If I wanted to succeed,

529
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,480
I had to satisfy him first.

530
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,840
I repeatedly refused him,

531
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,120
but he persisted.

532
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,320
Eventually, I discovered that

533
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
this year's quota
went to another cadre's child.

534
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,320
I confronted him,

535
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,880
but he warned me to stay out of it.

536
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,960
I didn't dare offend him.

537
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,960
I thought about it many times.

538
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,960
And I only heard that

539
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,800
you were the one
who would take the exam.

540
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,840
So I thought the connected person

541
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,680
was you.

542
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,040
I...

543
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,840
I had no choice.

544
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,840
I didn't know what to do,

545
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,880
so I ended up doing that foolish thing.

546
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,840
Alright, Afang,

547
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,880
don't be afraid.

548
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,520
These people who bully you

549
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,120
aren't as powerful as they seem.

550
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,480
Fight back,

551
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,080
and who knows who will come out on top?

552
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,120
If you dared to dress up
as a pervert to threaten me,

553
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,120
why be afraid of an old man?

554
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,600
She was fine when I was here just now,

555
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,720
but she's crying when she sees you.

556
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Why are you here?

557
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,400
Xiaolu came to take care of me.

558
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,080
And he brought me

559
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,360
these books from the library.

560
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,480
Oh, you are all here.

561
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,840
Afang,

562
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,640
I'm here
on behalf of the factory to visit you.

563
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,080
You need to rest

564
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,800
and not think about anything right now.

565
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,640
If you need anything, just let me know.

566
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,240
I'll do my best to help you.

567
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,560
Bai Lan,

568
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,720
come with me for a moment.

569
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,960
I have something to discuss with you.

570
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,360
Just say it here.

571
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,400
Well...

572
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,360
We shouldn't disturb her rest.

573
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,240
Let's talk outside.

574
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,720
What?

575
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,160
A certificate of mental illness?

576
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,080
Yes,

577
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,120
this matter has escalated too much.

578
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,240
It's the best solution

579
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,320
and a way to protect Afang.

580
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,920
You know that

581
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,000
after the factory leadership
found out about this,

582
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
they were very angry

583
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,600
and wanted to fire her directly.

584
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,480
So, I think

585
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
if we issue her

586
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,320
a mental illness certificate,

587
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,560
it proves she's crazy.

588
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,750
Crazy people can talk without
consequences, right?

589
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,600
Besides,

590
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,200
if she has this illness,

591
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,080
the factory will have to support her.

592
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Isn't that protection?

593
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,680
You're truly a responsible cadre.

594
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,600
It's my duty.

595
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,260
I'm just a small factory doctor.

596
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,360
I don't have the authority to issue
a mental illness certificate.

597
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,320
That's okay.

598
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,040
You just need to issue it

599
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,760
on behalf of the factory clinic.

600
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,920
I'll handle the rest.

601
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,880
What if I don't issue it?

602
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,360
Is there a problem?

603
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,960
If the factory can't even protect

604
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,800
a sober worker,

605
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,400
how can they protect a crazy one?

606
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,040
Alright,

607
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,920
I didn't want to tell you this,

608
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,360
but since you insist,

609
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,240
I'll relay Director Ding's words to you.

610
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
You can consider them.

611
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,800
Director Ding said that

612
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,800
Bai Lan is an outstanding female comrade,

613
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,160
but she has some issues with

614
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,000
how she handles things.

615
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,240
Like before, when she clashed

616
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,400
with superiors in school

617
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,050
and even physically assaulted someone,

618
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,200
which led to disciplinary action

619
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,520
and her transfer to our small place.

620
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,680
If she still can't

621
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,240
adapt here,

622
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,440
then let her go.

623
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,120
She deserves freedom.

624
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,120
We shouldn't stand in her way.

625
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,120
I'll translate this for you.

626
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,400
It means

627
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,400
if I don't issue
the mental illness certificate,

628
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,360
then I'll be fired.

629
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,640
This isn't what I want.

630
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm doing this for your own good,

631
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,000
to make you understand the seriousness
of this matter.

632
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,320
The factory still
hasn't come to a conclusion.

633
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,200
Could they be trying to protect
Ding Dezhong?

634
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,440
How come I heard that

635
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,360
Afang just couldn't

636
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,680
pass the exam herself,

637
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,840
deliberately trying to smear

638
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,960
Ding Dezhong's reputation?

639
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,120
Rumors are just rumors.

640
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,600
You think you are
some kind of an informer?

641
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,600
After so many years, everyone knows

642
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,440
Ding Dezhong's character.

643
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,230
Even when going out for a meal,
he always finds chances

644
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,410
to touch the hands of the waitresses.

645
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,360
His wife has beaten him up
many times for that.

646
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,640
How will the factory handle this matter?

647
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,200
Police investigation

648
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,680
also requires evidence.

649
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,920
Based on

650
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,760
just Xiaolu's words,

651
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,320
I suspect this matter will be swept
under the rug.

652
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,320
Yeah.

653
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,000
It shouldn't be like this.

654
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,040
It's so unfair to Afang.

655
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,240
Normally, you're as timid as a kitten.

656
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,760
Never thought
you could stand up for justice.

657
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,480
Thank you.

658
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,560
Today's braised pig trotters are all yours.

659
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,800
Thank you, Xiaoying.

660
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,640
Hey, Xiaolu,

661
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,880
what do you think?

662
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,080
As long as you say the word,

663
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,660
I'll be the first
to take care of Ding Dezhong.

664
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,000
You're just a young girl.

665
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,280
Stop pretending to be tough!

666
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,920
I was just saying.

667
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,000
- Are you full?
- Yes, I'm full.

668
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,040
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, I'm full.

669
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,120
Time for you to go home.

670
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,040
Alright, Master.

671
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,160
Thank you, Master.

672
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,480
- Alright.
- Bye, Master.

673
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,600
- The pig trotters...
- Hey, Xiaolu.

674
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,720
Take them, take them.

675
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,000
They're really delicious.

676
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,280
Just a little left.

677
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,320
Put it down!

678
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,400
Didn't you say one cup?

679
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,000
Just this little bit.

680
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,920
We will...

681
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,600
Come on, Master.

682
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,520
Cheers.

683
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,400
Xiaolu,

684
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,400
what do you think about
Ding Dezhong's matter?

685
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,280
What can I think?

686
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,480
We have so many hammers and tools

687
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,520
in the maintenance department.

688
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,400
I don't believe we can't crush
one or two pests.

689
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,800
Good.

690
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,240
Looks like

691
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,560
I didn't misjudge you, you rascal!

692
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,080
When encountering injustice,

693
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,520
draw your sword to help,

694
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,160
whether it's in hell

695
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,880
or in heaven,

696
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,680
we'll smash them to pieces.

697
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,840
But,

698
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,160
let me tell you,

699
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,160
you're like a good piece of material,

700
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,720
good steel.

701
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,200
You have to take yourself seriously,

702
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,520
understand?

703
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,120
Good steel

704
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,080
should be used for cutting.

705
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
When facing a problem,

706
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,320
don't rush.

707
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
Haste makes waste

708
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,160
and can sometimes hurt yourself.

709
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,320
Understand?

710
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,200
What do you mean?

711
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,120
Are we just going
to stand by and do nothing?

712
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,520
Since when did you become a coward?

713
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,940
Where's that spirited attitude you had
when you were young?

714
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,840
I passed it all to you!

715
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm telling you,

716
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,800
Afang is too weak.

717
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,880
If Ding Dezhong dares to do that to me,

718
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,720
I'll grab a knife and stab him.

719
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,440
Look at you.

720
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,360
Like you would really stab him.

721
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
Why not?

722
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,760
You...

723
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,280
Xiaoying is right.

724
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,440
Why can't she stab him?

725
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,200
Hey, I'm telling you...

726
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,040
You two...

727
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,320
Master, I'll take my leave.

728
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,120
- No, wait...
- He just left like that?

729
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,960
Xiaolu...

730
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,280
I hope you understood what I said.

731
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,480
Hey...

732
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,740
(Gongyuan Golden Peacock Food Factory)
This is the certificate you wanted.

733
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Why did you...

734
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,480
If you had done this earlier,

735
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,360
we wouldn't have had to argue last time.

736
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,800
I carefully considered what you said,

737
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,840
and you're right.

738
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,230
I don't want trouble.

739
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,400
But I'm just a mere factory doctor.

740
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,840
This can only be a reference,

741
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,240
not legal evidence.

742
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,880
This step is crucial.

743
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,200
With this certificate,

744
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,480
I can hand over the rest

745
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
to a doctor at the hospital.

746
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,680
Really?

747
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,040
You're that capable?

748
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,800
It's not that impressive.

749
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,360
This is a small matter

750
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,200
that's within my ability.

751
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,800
So, tomorrow.

752
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,280
Tomorrow, I'll take care of it.

753
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,880
Okay.

754
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,000
I hope I can be of help.

755
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,480
Have some tea.

756
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,280
That's enough already.

757
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,960
I've really been wronged.

758
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,880
Look, I have the diagnosis certificate

759
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,760
from the factory here.

760
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,000
She's a psychiatric patient

761
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,360
with delusions.

762
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,600
Why should I look at it?

763
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,120
Do I not know

764
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,200
what kind of person you are?

765
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,720
You have to look at it.

766
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,760
There's the red stamp from our factory.

767
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,320
Alright, come on.

768
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,920
Swear to heavens.

769
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,960
Repeat after me.

770
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,080
From now on,

771
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,920
I won't talk to young female workers
in the factory.

772
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,320
Can you make sense?

773
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,440
How can I work in the future?

774
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
What work?

775
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,520
It's not allowed.

776
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,400
Alright, alright. I swear, I swear.

777
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,800
Can I stand up?

778
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
My legs are about to break.

779
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,950
Just keep your knees on the ground.

780
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,040
What's that sound?

781
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,700
Someone's knocking on the door?

782
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,040
It's all my fault!

783
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,120
Please spare me!

784
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,440
I admit that I did it!

785
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,720
Afang, I'm sorry.

786
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,920
Please spare me.

787
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,880
Afang,

788
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,920
you reported Ding Dezhong

789
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,240
for harassing you

790
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,360
and mistreating you.

791
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,450
The factory is conducting
a serious investigation.

792
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,720
Don't worry,

793
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,200
as long as we have solid evidence,

794
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,000
we will handle him seriously.

795
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
(Report Letter)
This is a joint letter

796
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,720
from some factory workers

797
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,080
reflecting all of Ding Dezhong's issues.

798
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,960
So the factory has decided to

799
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,800
deduct his bonus for three months,

800
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,480
issue a severe warning,

801
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,720
and publish a punishment notice
throughout the factory.

802
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,360
Does hearing this

803
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,760
make you feel better?

804
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,880
Now,

805
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,360
if you have any demands,

806
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,760
Afang, feel free to speak up.

807
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,200
As long as it's within my capabilities,

808
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,640
I will grant you it.

809
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,640
Director asked you a question. You...

810
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,040
Afang, don't be afraid.

811
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,800
If you have any demands, tell Director Liu.

812
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,000
I heard you want to study at night school

813
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,840
to get a diploma.

814
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,120
That's a good thing.

815
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,640
It shows a positive pursuit.

816
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,640
As long as you pass the exam,

817
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,400
the factory will not only provide you
with a recommendation letter

818
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,200
but also apply for paid study leave for you.

819
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,680
How about that?

820
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,360
No,

821
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
I want to resign.

822
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,560
I don't want anything.

823
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,200
I just want to leave here completely.

824
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,160
Alright,

825
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,560
I agree.

826
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,320
I'm still in this position now,

827
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,320
and I will fulfill your wish.

828
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,800
But if I'm not in this position one day,

829
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,160
others may not value your matter as much.

830
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey, Director, what do you mean by this?

831
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,440
Times have changed,

832
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,960
and I also want
to explore the world outside.

833
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,560
You can go back now.

834
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,600
Time to say goodbye.

835
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,440
You'll be in an unfamiliar environment,

836
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,440
don't let yourself be bullied again.

837
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,760
If you're bullied,

838
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,640
fight back.

839
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,280
Never swallow your pride.

840
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,400
Also,

841
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,040
you must become strong

842
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,720
so others won't dare to bully you.

843
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,720
Dr. Bai,

844
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,040
Xiaolu, I can't imagine

845
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,320
what I would have become

846
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,680
without you.

847
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,520
Maybe I would have silently endured

848
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,680
and buried these dirty things inside.

849
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,640
Maybe I would have
given up all my dignity

850
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,440
and never held my head up here.

851
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,960
Or maybe

852
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,840
that day on the rooftop,

853
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,000
I would have jumped.

854
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,560
Those are all in the past.

855
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,120
Every day from now on

856
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,920
is a brand new day.

857
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,960
That's right,

858
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,120
even if you're bullied, don't be afraid.

859
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,240
Just give me a call,

860
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,480
and I'll go beat them up.

861
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,550
The bus's here.

862
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,400
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

863
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,360
(Gongyuan)

864
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,640
I'll remember.

865
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,160
You two are my lifelong friends.

866
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,120
Until we meet again.

867
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,880
Don't break your promises.

868
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,400
Certainly.

869
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,640
Take care.

870
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,640
Goodbye.

871
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
Afang said

872
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,440
we're her lifelong friends.

873
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,240
So, that also

874
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,080
makes us lifelong friends.

875
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,360
Instead of an enemy,

876
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,400
you want to be my friend now?

877
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,720
(Fucheng Gongyuan Golden Peacock
Food Factory)

878
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,960
The day Afang had trouble,

879
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
my mom asked me to go home

880
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,400
and asked me a question.

881
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,120
What question?

882
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,600
She asked why I rushed forward

883
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,360
in Afang's matter and

884
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,000
if it was because of your influence.

885
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,760
What did you say?

886
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,320
I said no at the time,

887
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,440
but now I think

888
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,960
maybe.

889
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,120
Are you blaming me
for leading you astray?

890
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,560
Actually, if it weren't for you,

891
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,000
I really don't know
if I would have given up at some point.

892
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Maybe when my mom made me sign
a letter of apology

893
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,440
or when my cousin

894
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,000
made me apologize to Little Pouter.

895
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,000
Or it could have been when I saw you

896
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,960
almost getting hurt

897
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,200
by that ballbuster.

898
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,600
But every time I realize there's

899
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,400
a crazy woman like you by my side

900
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,560
who can charge with me together,

901
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,840
I think,

902
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,320
who cares what others think?

903
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,680
So, in that case,

904
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,600
we're quite like-minded.

905
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,000
So,

906
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,360
do you want to consider
being friends with me?

907
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,280
You have so many thoughts,

908
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,140
and you do things without considering
the consequences.

909
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,600
I'll have to think about it carefully.

910
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Together, we'd be unstoppable.

911
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,360
It would be a shame if we couldn't be

912
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
