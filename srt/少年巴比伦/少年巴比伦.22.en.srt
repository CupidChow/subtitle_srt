24
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,890
Why is there only one screen working,

25
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,080
while the other three are black?

26
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,640
(No Signal)
Actually, there are cameras in these places,

27
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,540
but you know the situation in the factory now.

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,140
There aren't many workers in the factory,

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,180
and they don't have much money,

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,020
so

31
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,700
there's no money to repair them.

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,000
It's okay. This one will do.

33
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,410
We can see the entrance to the cold storage.

34
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,840
Oh, right.

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,030
Someone just went in.

36
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,120
Let me replay it.

37
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,280
I've watched it so many times,

38
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,770
and I can recognize all the hundreds of

39
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,380
employees in our factory,

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,220
but I still

41
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,330
don't know who he is.

42
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,590
You two, take a closer look.

43
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,400
See if you recognize him.

44
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,100
Who is it?

45
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,720
Lu Xiaolu?

46
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,240
How did you get in here?

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,030
I have a spare key
that I forgot to give you.

48
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,280
Now it's come in handy.

49
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,100
Look there.

50
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,750
The person who injured Master Niu

51
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,630
should be tall.

52
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,930
How dare you hit my dad!

53
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,860
I'll teach you a lesson.

54
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,700
Open the door.

55
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,030
Open the door!

56
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,570
Let me try.

57
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,010
What's wrong?

58
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,470
It seems to be locked.

59
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,280
No signal here.

60
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,730
Let me check.

61
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,130
Do you have it over there?

62
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,340
No.

63
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,550
Look.

64
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,280
A footprint.

65
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,470
This is different

66
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,670
from the other footprints.

67
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,590
This is a tactical boot.

68
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,760
There are hardly any people
in the factory who wear these.

69
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,610
They're too bulky.

70
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,550
Usually it's those hooligans on the streets

71
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,990
who wear them.

72
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,720
There's even a crack in the middle.

73
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,640
These boots are really old,

74
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,080
probably left by the culprit.

75
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,840
You understand street matters better.

76
00:04:58,970 --> 00:04:59,960
I'll take a picture first.

77
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,460
Okay.

78
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,490
What are you doing?

79
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,030
Put this on,

80
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,910
don't get cold.

81
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,200
Have you ever thought about

82
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,760
what the person who injured Master Niu

83
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,320
was trying to achieve?

84
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,520
Master Niu has been opposing
the resumption of work.

85
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,200
So the person who injured him

86
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,570
is trying to threaten the workers

87
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,470
to resume work quickly.

88
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,990
If that's the case,

89
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,110
then I should be the prime suspect.

90
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,280
You are right.

91
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,880
But who's the second suspect?

92
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,350
Do you still suspect Huang Qing?

93
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,110
Isn't he worth suspecting?

94
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,760
I don't think it's him.

95
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,400
You trust him so much?

96
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,590
After I left school,

97
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,640
I had nowhere to go.

98
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,280
He took me in.

99
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,760
At that time, I hadn't seriously
studied economics.

100
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,330
Wanting to make my mark

101
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,990
in the industry

102
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,400
was like dreaming.

103
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,520
He taught me,

104
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,610
guided me

105
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,790
through each project,

106
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,080
that's how I got to where I am today.

107
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,490
If it weren't for him,

108
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,550
I would have given up long ago.

109
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,960
So,

110
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,550
he must be very important to you.

111
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,020
Yeah.

112
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:06,930
I understand.

113
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,400
I once had someone

114
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,470
whom I trusted unconditionally.

115
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,110
You should take it back.

116
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,660
I don't need it.

117
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,730
I can handle the cold.

118
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,170
It won't hurt me.

119
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,230
It might

120
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,470
hurt you instead.

121
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,350
If you freeze to death,

122
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,280
who will take care of this mess
of the factory?

123
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,990
No one should freeze.

124
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,910
Let's go out together.

125
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,060
We're both so lucky,

126
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,240
neither of us will freeze to death.

127
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,840
Bai Lan, Bai Lan, are you there?

128
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,840
- Bai Lan.
- Yes, I'm here.

129
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,640
- Be careful, be careful!
- Oh my god!

130
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,780
Xiaolu.

131
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,990
Who locked the door?

132
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,010
Xiaoying called and said Bai Lan is here,

133
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,200
she asked me to let her out.

134
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,840
- Xiaoying?
- I've scolded her thoroughly.

135
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,540
Alright.

136
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,840
Send her back quickly.

137
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,230
- Just go.
- You can take it back now.

138
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,340
Let's go.

139
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,640
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

140
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,930
Feeling cold?

141
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,250
Put on your coat.

142
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,560
=Episode 22=
=A Bet on Tomorrow=

143
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,650
You've run enough?

144
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,180
Tired now?

145
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,250
I really can't understand,

146
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,930
you were locked in the cold storage
during the day,

147
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,280
and then come out at night
to run and sweat.

148
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,630
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

149
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,580
Here.

150
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,940
Wear this.

151
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,330
I really don't understand.

152
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,410
What happened in the warehouse?

153
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,000
What did Bai Lan do to you?

154
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,380
Little Pouter told me that

155
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,830
you two have become close again.

156
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,520
Old feelings rekindled?

157
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,670
It's time to stop.

158
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,600
Stop what?

159
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,190
You know, I've never

160
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,030
been able to let her go
in these five years.

161
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,790
I've always regretted

162
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,600
leaving her like that.

163
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,670
But she's doing well now,

164
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,070
and she has someone to take care of her.

165
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,000
It's time to let go.

166
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,070
You two are really over?

167
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,890
Yeah,

168
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,830
it should have ended long ago.

169
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,610
Let's go!

170
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,460
Are you okay?

171
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,240
Lyu told me

172
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,720
you were trapped
in the cold storage today,

173
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,240
are you okay?

174
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,240
Nothing serious,

175
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,280
just caught a chill.

176
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,080
This can warm you up.

177
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,680
Thank you.

178
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
I needed this.

179
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,080
I heard Lu Xiaolu was there too.

180
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Did he cause you any trouble?

181
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,760
Not at all,

182
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,520
in fact, I'm glad he was there.

183
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,560
Otherwise, I wouldn't have managed alone.

184
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,360
He's your ex-boyfriend
from back then, right?

185
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,320
Yeah.

186
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,560
Looks like he still

187
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,920
has a significant impact on you.

188
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,520
No, not really.

189
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,080
I don't want him

190
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,840
to affect your judgment.

191
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,720
You seem tired lately.

192
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,520
Why don't you take a break?

193
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,160
I can't.

194
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,800
I want to finalize the cooperation

195
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,440
with the Italians as soon as possible,

196
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,200
turn around the situation in the factory,

197
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,520
and calm the workers' emotions.

198
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,760
That's the priority.

199
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,360
I've made up my mind.

200
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,400
Once Master Niu recovers,

201
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,320
I'll arrange for Mr. Mancini

202
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,640
to meet with the key people in the factory.

203
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,920
This will boost confidence on both sides.

204
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,440
Didn't you say Fucheng was beautiful?

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,240
I've been busy working since I arrived,

206
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
and had no time to explore.

207
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,960
Why don't you show me around tonight?

208
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,840
Alright.

209
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,800
You've been here before?

210
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,720
A long time ago.

211
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,960
Stop it, Dad will take you
to the amusement park.

212
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,360
Thank you.

213
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,240
I mean...

214
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,440
Doctor Bai?

215
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,720
When did you come back?

216
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,280
This is my wife.

217
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
She used to work at our food factory too.

218
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,520
Nice to meet you.

219
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,720
This is my son,

220
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,560
his name is Kaixin.

221
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,800
Come on, say hi to Auntie.

222
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,280
Hello, Auntie.

223
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,960
This is my boss.

224
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,680
This is

225
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,240
my old colleague from the food factory,

226
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
the office secretary,

227
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,360
Secretary Bi.

228
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,480
Bi Zhigang.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,760
A colleague from the food factory, huh?

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,840
Yes.

231
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
You are surnamed Bi.

232
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,000
Is Vice Mayor Bi of Fucheng

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
related to you?

234
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,920
He's my father-in-law.

235
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,280
What a coincidence.

236
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,200
I met him yesterday.

237
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,040
Sorry,

238
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
I don't know him well.

239
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,680
Alright, come on, Kaixin,

240
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,080
say goodbye to Uncle and Auntie.

241
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,760
Dad will take you to the amusement park.

242
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,520
Goodbye.

243
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,760
Let's go.

244
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,960
Dad heard

245
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,000
there's a new toy at the amusement park,

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,560
and they have cotton candy too.

247
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,120
Do you want it?

248
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,320
After knowing you for so long,

249
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,360
it's the first time I've learned

250
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,880
you like horror movies.

251
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,840
I have many surprises.

252
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,560
(Lu Lan)

253
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

254
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,320
welcome to the New Century Grand Theatre.

255
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,960
I am Fucheng's famous prince of love songs,

256
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,880
Lu Xiaolu.

257
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,560
Today, I will dedicate my
premiere performance on this stage

258
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,520
to the beautiful lady in the audience,

259
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Bai Lan!

260
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,520
High above the silvery ocean,

261
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,040
winds are gathering the storm-clouds.

262
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,520
And between the clouds and ocean,

263
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,880
proudly

264
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,080
wheels the Stormy Petrel,

265
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,920
like a streak of sable lightning.

266
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,160
It's the storm!

267
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,160
The storm is breaking!

268
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,320
Still the valiant Stormy Petrel

269
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,800
proudly wheels among the lightning,

270
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,800
over the roaring, raging ocean.

271
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,960
And his cry resounds exultant, like a prophecy
of triumph--

272
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,920
Let it break

273
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,200
- in all its fury!
- In all its fury!

274
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,440
Bai Lan,

275
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,760
will you join me

276
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,120
as a lifelong member of this theater?

277
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,280
Let's watch movies together

278
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
and grow old together.

279
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,760
(Lu Lan)

280
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,920
(Director's Office)

281
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,760
Why?

282
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,240
My negotiation with Mancini
went pretty well,

283
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,520
why did he suddenly change his mind?

284
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,080
The food factory can't provide

285
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,880
the sales channels they're satisfied with.

286
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,520
They gave up.

287
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
That's impossible.

288
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,480
Even if we didn't have them before,

289
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,640
we can open new channels

290
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,440
in the South China region in the future.

291
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,080
Isn't there any room for negotiation?

292
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,600
I ultimately rejected them.

293
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,080
Cooperation should be fair,

294
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,520
but they kept adding conditions.

295
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,440
That's my bottom line.

296
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,640
Couldn't you
have consulted me beforehand?

297
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,480
If we don't cooperate with them,

298
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,340
what will the factory produce
after resuming work?

299
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,200
Then don't resume work for now.

300
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,040
We'll find another solution.

301
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,560
What solution?

302
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,320
The profits from production

303
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,960
are far less than

304
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,600
the profits from land appreciation
in Fucheng.

305
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,020
You want to buy land
for real estate development?

306
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,560
You want to lay off all the workers?

307
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,280
This wasn't a sudden decision for me.

308
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,280
In business, you can't put all eggs
in one basket.

309
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,440
Moreover, from a marketing perspective,

310
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,120
the profits from real estate development

311
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,320
are something you couldn't earn
selling chocolates for ten years.

312
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,400
Did you plan this a long time ago?

313
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't look at me like that.

314
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,760
You willingly came to Fucheng
in the first place,

315
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,920
and out of self-interest,
I wanted to give you

316
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,720
a chance to develop.

317
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,600
That's why I didn't interfere with
your plan to acquire and

318
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,320
restructure the food factory.

319
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,240
But things are different now.

320
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,760
With Bi's help,

321
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
the land of the food factory

322
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,600
is a ripe piece of meat waiting to be eaten.

323
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,320
Seeing it but not seizing it

324
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,480
will be my incompetence.

325
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,800
If you had this plan all along,

326
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,040
why didn't you tell me beforehand?

327
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,680
You watched me trying to resume work,

328
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,200
negotiating with the Italians,

329
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,040
and being anxious every day,

330
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,760
were you just enjoying it?

331
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,320
Or did you never intend for me

332
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,160
to win from the start?

333
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,440
Of course not.

334
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,720
I swear,

335
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,860
if the Italians

336
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,630
had made concessions
at the negotiation table today,

337
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,160
I wouldn't have said a word of this to you.

338
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,720
I would fully support you, help you

339
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,680
get the factory back on track,

340
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,480
and stand by you when it officially

341
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,400
resumes production.

342
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,680
I would be there to celebrate with you.

343
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,160
But we have to face reality.

344
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,760
It's come to this,

345
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,280
with no room for compromise.

346
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
Mancini will leave Fucheng tomorrow

347
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,720
and never return.

348
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
This path

349
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,680
is closed.

350
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,280
Does that mean it's all over now?

351
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
Just a minor setback in life,

352
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
something you'll forget after

353
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,400
taking a vacation.

354
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,680
How about this?

355
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,040
Whether you go to Hong Kong

356
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
or back to Shanghai,

357
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,040
I'll clean up the mess here.

358
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,840
I won't give up easily.

359
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,440
They're leaving tomorrow,

360
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,840
so I still have time to convince them.

361
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,840
Even if it doesn't work out,

362
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,280
I can find other partners.

363
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,720
If I succeed in negotiating a deal...

364
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,080
If you succeed in doing that,

365
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,800
I'll give you an additional three months.

366
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,050
You can use that time
to restore the factory's profitability

367
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,600
and pay back the workers.

368
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,160
I have full faith in your abilities.

369
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,400
But why should I do this?

370
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,640
Before you came to Fucheng,

371
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,480
you said

372
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,000
if you couldn't complete the reform
of the food factory,

373
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,040
you'd be willing to stay by my side
for another ten years.

374
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,720
Remember that?

375
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,320
Then give me another month.

376
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,360
Five days.

377
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,800
No room for negotiation.

378
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Five days it is.

379
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,300
(Good Cat Restaurant)
Eat and drink

380
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,350
to your heart's content today.

381
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
If you're feeling dissatisfied,

382
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,480
don't hold it in.

383
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,360
Let it out.

384
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,920
Sir,

385
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,440
bring a case of beer.

386
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,280
Coming.

387
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,720
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

388
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,120
- No problem.
- Thank you.

389
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,760
- Here.
- Here.

390
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,440
Xiaoying.

391
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,920
What are you doing?

392
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,360
We know you have been upset recently.

393
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,160
Just say whatever you want to say

394
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,560
and scold whoever you want to scold.

395
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,680
Don't hold it in.

396
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,880
Okay.

397
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,000
Then I'll speak first.

398
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,880
It's my fault to lock Bai Lan
in the cold storage.

399
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,640
I apologize to you.

400
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,720
- Come on.
- Bottoms up.

401
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,680
What...

402
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
- What are you doing?
- I'll drink it for you.

403
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
You can't drink too much.

404
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,160
Alright, go ahead.

405
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,240
Drink it up.

406
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,960
But,

407
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,400
it's fine to target me,

408
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,480
but definitely

409
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,320
not my dad!

410
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,720
He's not just your dad,

411
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,960
but also our master.

412
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,720
With us around, who dares to target him?

413
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,560
Don't worry.

414
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,640
We'll help our master get justice.

415
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,400
- Another one!
- Sure.

416
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,600
- Cheers.
- Come on.

417
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,440
Come on.

418
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,480
Cheers!

419
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,040
Xiaoying,

420
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,000
can we eat now?

421
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,520
Of course. Please.

422
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,840
You should eat a lot.

423
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,680
You've been working overtime these days,

424
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,080
I wonder what Bai Lan is thinking,

425
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,120
making you go through all this.

426
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,600
It's not about her.

427
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,800
It's because their negotiations
with the Italians fell apart.

428
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,360
The Italians wanted sales channels

429
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,560
they couldn't provide,

430
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,960
so they decided not to cooperate.

431
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,800
They'll be leaving tomorrow.

432
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,400
And then that Huang Qing

433
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,120
issued an ultimatum to Bai Lan.

434
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,720
If she can't convince

435
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,680
the Italians to stay,

436
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,200
she has five days

437
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,520
to find a new factory.

438
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,640
What if she can't find one?

439
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,840
Why are you looking at me?

440
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,920
Eat.

441
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,240
Let's eat.

442
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
Come on, have another drink.

443
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,360
- Why are you so quiet?
- Come on.

444
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,200
What's going on?

445
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,500
- Let's drink.
- We don't eat together a lot.

446
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,840
Cheers.

447
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,880
Come on, cheers.

448
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,800
(Good Cat Restaurant)

449
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,840
You knew you couldn't handle alcohol.

450
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,960
Why did you do that?

451
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,520
You gave him the gift,

452
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
but why didn't you show up?

453
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,760
How did you know it was me?

454
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,600
No, no,

455
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
it wasn't me.

456
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,080
Xiaoying,

457
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,720
can I ask you something?

458
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,360
Go ahead.

459
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,400
Do you still dislike me?

460
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Yes.

461
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,920
I dislike people like you

462
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,000
who run away after being scolded.

463
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,600
My dad was injured in the head,

464
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,400
and you gave him books and chess.

465
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,320
Do you think his injuries
aren't serious enough?

466
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,640
When I gave the gift,

467
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,760
I didn't think that much.

468
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,320
I just thought he would be bored

469
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,080
in the hospital, so I...

470
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,640
Now he's not bored at all.

471
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,840
His hospital room is lively

472
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,160
with people playing chess with him.

473
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,600
He's suffering from headaches

474
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,080
and still asks about

475
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,920
the Battle of Guandu.

476
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,160
It annoyed me,

477
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,880
so I took away the books and chess.

478
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,520
Now he's mad at me.

479
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,400
That's good.

480
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,240
Go home.

481
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,560
Go home.

482
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,840
Go home.

483
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,080
Let's hold hands.

484
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,120
It's not worth it for a small matter.

485
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,000
Dr. Bai,

486
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,040
are you thinking of jumping again?

487
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,760
You rogue,

488
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,640
why are you here?

489
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,520
By the way,

490
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,920
I dreamt of you last night,

491
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,800
cursing you.

492
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,880
Why would you curse me

493
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,160
in your dream, female rogue?

494
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,560
Because you keep haunting me,

495
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,800
wanting to kill me.

496
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,520
Am I that bad in your dreams?

497
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,800
What do you think?

498
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,920
What is the matter?

499
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,160
I'm here to fulfill your wishes.

500
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,360
(Gongyuan)

501
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,160
Do you know what you were just
talking about?

502
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,040
Yes.

503
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,440
(Gongyuan)

504
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,560
Our company wants to exchange shares
with the food factory.

505
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,280
Any issues?

506
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,320
I don't agree.

507
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,840
In Fucheng's food industry,

508
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,520
our company's distribution channels

509
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,040
are among the best.

510
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,400
Just last month,

511
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,920
I coordinated with Hong Kong

512
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,480
and South China distributors.

513
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,320
So,

514
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,560
the channel issue
the Italians are concerned about

515
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
is not an issue.

516
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,840
What?

517
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,840
Is our company too small for you?

518
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,800
No, it's not that.

519
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,840
Then what is it?

520
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,840
The risk is too high.

521
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,520
- I know.
- You don't know.

522
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,320
Given the current situation
of the food factory,

523
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,280
even if this deal goes through,

524
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,320
I can't guarantee the future of the factory.

525
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,320
I understand that.

526
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,080
So even if you join,

527
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,840
it's not necessarily going to be profitable.

528
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,520
In fact, it could be a total failure.

529
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,840
I understand all that.

530
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Then why take this risk?

531
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
If you can take the risk,

532
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
why can't I?

533
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,440
I have nothing to lose.

534
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,600
Don't you understand that?

535
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,840
This path is the only hope
for the factory

536
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,320
and, for me, as well.

537
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,640
But it's different for you.

538
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,470
You have a good business and a good life.

539
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,760
Why give that up?

540
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,760
I can't let you wade through this mess.

541
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,600
So I can't let you

542
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,920
do me this favor.

543
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,520
Manager Bai,

544
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,560
I think you may have misunderstood.

545
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,440
Joining the food factory might help a little,

546
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,440
but it's mostly a business decision.

547
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,080
Our company has always focused
on distribution channels,

548
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,960
lacking independent production capabilities.

549
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,240
The food factory

550
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,360
is the opposite.

551
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,640
Isn't this a perfect match?

552
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,080
So,

553
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,440
I'm not trying to help you.

554
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,440
I'm trying to hitch a ride on your success.

555
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,360
What?

556
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,800
Don't you believe you can succeed?

557
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,120
I can't guarantee the outcome.

558
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,000
But I believe in you.

559
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,240
I remember you said

560
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,200
this company isn't just yours.

561
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,560
Li Guangnan also has a stake.

562
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,080
Will he agree?

563
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,680
Don't worry.

564
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,600
When it comes to making big money,

565
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
he's more enthusiastic than me.

566
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,880
Let's go.

567
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,120
Call the Italians and tell them

568
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,280
we have a deal to discuss.

569
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,160
(Gongyuan)

570
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,400
This is all the money
our company currently has,

571
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,240
plus this office

572
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,840
and the warehouse in the suburbs.

573
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,120
Take it all.

574
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,160
What are you doing?

575
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,920
I'm planning for the company
to exchange shares

576
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
with the food factory,

577
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,520
but I don't want to drag you all down
with me.

578
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,800
Lu Xiaolu, are you crazy?

579
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,560
What has Bai Lan been telling you

580
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,440
to make you keep giving in?

581
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,240
You gave up the cold storage,

582
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,240
okay.

583
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,560
But you are now giving up everything?

584
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,360
It's not as bad as you're thinking.

585
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,360
Just take the money.

586
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,600
Otherwise, if I end up losing,

587
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,320
how will you two live?

588
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,200
What about Master's retirement money?

589
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,960
Do you think if you lose,

590
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,000
we'll applaud

591
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,480
and be grateful?

592
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,120
I know,

593
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,600
you founded the company,

594
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
but what right do you have now

595
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,000
to talk about splitting up

596
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,840
and parting ways?

597
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,840
Compared to that woman,

598
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,160
what are we to you?

599
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,960
Li Guangnan, watch your tone.

600
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,160
It's not just for Bai Lan.

601
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,360
The factory also needs help.

602
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,840
What help does the factory need?

603
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,760
It's already collapsed beyond saving.

604
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,920
Lu Xiaolu, let me tell you,

605
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,720
we're in business,

606
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,320
not charity.

607
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,720
If a person is capable, they make money;

608
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,920
if not, they're poor.

609
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,800
You want to split up, right?

610
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,640
Since we're so

611
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,480
unimportant to you,

612
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,000
let's part ways.

613
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
Xiaoying!

614
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,000
Lu Xiaolu,

615
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,600
I'll give you one last chance.

616
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,120
You must

617
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,360
choose between

618
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,320
us and Bai Lan today.

619
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,400
If you choose the food factory,

620
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,240
then we're done.

621
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,680
Fine.

622
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,040
Do you want to smoke?

623
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,400
How about a drink?

624
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Forget it,

625
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,360
it's bad for my voice.

626
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,200
You're really persistent.

627
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,440
Now I finally understand

628
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,040
why we can be brothers.

629
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,120
It's all about being stubborn

630
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,000
and sticking to one path until the end.

631
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Like the connections

632
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,000
between you and Guangnan.

633
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,320
Xiaolu,

634
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
are you really willing to give up

635
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,160
everyone's effort for Bai Lan?

636
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
Not entirely.

637
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,440
Then,

638
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,400
is it for the factory?

639
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,480
That's part of the reason.

640
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,400
Then why?

641
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,080
While Bai Lan
is gambling for her freedom,

642
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,560
Master and the workers

643
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,720
are gambling for compensation.

644
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,320
I'm also gambling,

645
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,760
but I can't drag you all into it.

646
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,720
Xiaolu,

647
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,400
don't worry.

648
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
I'll talk to Xiaoying.

649
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,040
(Gongyuan)

650
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,150
This is our company's

651
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,700
cooperation agreement
with the food factory.

652
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Please review it again.

653
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,040
If there are no issues,

654
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,360
we can sign it.

655
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,800
Have you really made up your mind?

656
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,400
I couldn't hope for anything better.

657
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
There's nothing to think about.

658
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,800
Why are you here?

659
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,600
Why is Mr. Lu here?

660
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,080
For business cooperation.

661
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,400
Cooperation?

662
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,040
Mr. Lu has decided
to merge his sales company

663
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,800
with the food factory
through equity exchange.

664
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,080
This way, we'll have new sales channels

665
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,720
and can renegotiate with the Italians.

666
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,160
I didn't expect Mr. Lu
to be so interested in

667
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
the factory's affairs
after leaving for so many years.

668
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,240
Thank you.

669
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,000
It's not a big deal.

670
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,800
This is a win-win decision.

671
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,960
Alright,

672
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,360
I'll leave you to your conversation.

673
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,040
I won't disturb you.

674
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,840
Is there anything I can do for you?

675
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,200
Ciao, Mr. Mancini.

676
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,160
I would like to invite you
to have dinner this evening.

677
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,400
Alright.

678
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,760
That's good.

679
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,240
See you then.

680
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,040
Mr. Mancini has checked out?

681
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,000
Yes, it was an impromptu check-out

682
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,160
at 2 PM today.

683
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,320
No wonder we couldn't reach him by phone.

684
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,280
Did he leave any message?

685
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,560
No.

686
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,000
He suddenly left at 2 PM

687
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,080
without contacting us.

688
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,680
Huang Qing and I had a deal.

689
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,080
I have four days left
to regain authorization

690
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,880
for the OEM factory.

691
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,440
If I can't secure a new

692
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,720
OEM brand by then,

693
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,240
he might change his mind.

694
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,080
I won't let anyone

695
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,440
stand in your way of doing what you want.

696
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,600
I'll help you get what you want,

697
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,280
your freedom.

698
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,400
Let's go to your office.

699
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,640
All the resources

700
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,040
and connections I've accumulated

701
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,360
over the years are here.

702
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,760
Then let's get started.

703
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,840
Hello?

704
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,560
Mr. He, it's me,

705
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,400
Xiaolu.

706
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,200
We have a new project and would like to

707
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,160
discuss it with you.

708
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,040
Really?

709
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,440
Okay,

710
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,720
tell me about it.

711
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,560
I saw Lu Xiaolu and Bai Lan

712
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,040
at the front desk just now.

713
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,600
I think

714
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,760
they must have heard about
Mr. Mancini's situation.

715
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,960
Vice Mayor Bi.

716
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,800
- Here?
- He's inside.

717
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,320
I'm sorry

718
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,880
to bother you so late.

719
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,840
Mr. Huang.

720
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,840
It's good to take a walk.

721
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,880
Good for my health.

722
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,240
Mayor Bi, we're good friends,

723
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,480
so I'll be direct.

724
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,360
I want to expedite the acquisition

725
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,960
of the remaining 40% stake
of the food factory

726
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,680
to complete the purchase of

727
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,160
the factory's land and assets thoroughly.

728
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,600
This is necessary

729
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,400
for me to proceed with my plans.

730
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,640
That's excellent.

731
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,760
We're on the same page.

732
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,360
We really need to move quickly.

733
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
Reliable, huh?

734
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,360
Alright, tell me

735
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,800
about your plans.

736
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,600
Any suggestions?

737
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,120
Well, I envision

738
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,720
constructing a large commercial plaza

739
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,040
on the food factory site

740
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,600
to make it a landmark

741
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,080
in Fucheng's development history.

742
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,840
What do you think?

743
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,320
Building a commercial plaza
is indeed a good idea.

744
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,680
I'll present this plan
to the city authorities.

745
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,360
However, actual construction will be

746
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,840
time-consuming and resource-intensive.

747
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,640
My current financial and energy resources
don't fully support this.

748
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,520
Are you thinking of

749
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,520
selling it off later?

750
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,880
How do you predict

751
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,320
Fucheng's future land prices will increase?

752
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,400
In my opinion,

753
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,520
within six to eight years,

754
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,150
tripling to quintupling the current value
shouldn't be an issue.

755
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,480
I'm more optimistic.

756
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,000
I'd say within five years,

757
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,000
it could quintuple.

758
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,280
So, I plan to hold onto it
for at least five years

759
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,920
and assess the situation later.

760
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
If you

761
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,480
apply for approval

762
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,280
for a large commercial plaza

763
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,480
and it's granted,

764
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,800
you can't delay the construction.

765
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,440
That might lead to criticism.

766
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,080
So I need your assistance.

767
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,040
I don't want to commit to

768
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,960
a specific construction timeline.

769
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,800
If you can help me with this,

770
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,960
I'll be very grateful to you.

771
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,200
We can discuss that later.

772
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
Normally,

773
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,760
constructing
such a large commercial plaza

774
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,960
would take about three years,

775
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,440
five years

776
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,240
is a bit too long.

777
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
But it's okay.

778
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,000
I'll try to help with that.

779
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,120
Once you acquire the land,

780
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,760
you need to make some noise.

781
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,960
Don't worry.

782
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,040
After I acquire the land,

783
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,440
I'll start demolishing the food factory,

784
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,840
and make the land ready.

785
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,080
And then I'll hire a word-famous designer

786
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,000
to do that design.

787
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,120
How long will it take?

788
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,200
Who knows?

789
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,680
Of course,

790
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,480
you also

791
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,200
have to solve the problems
of the workers.

792
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,800
Before the demolition,

793
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,880
pay off outstanding wages

794
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,280
and medical expenses.

795
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,280
The city places great importance

796
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,720
on stability and unity.

797
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,240
I'll do my best.

798
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
One more thing I must say,

799
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,440
and I hope you won't take offense.

800
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,920
Go ahead.

801
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,920
Control your woman.

802
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,640
If she successfully revitalizes

803
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,600
the food factory,

804
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,720
the cost of acquiring

805
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,240
the full ownership

806
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,240
in the future

807
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,240
will be significantly higher and

808
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
possibly unacceptable.

809
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,520
So,

810
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,240
don't let Miss Bai
cause any trouble for us.

811
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,560
Don't worry,

812
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,720
she won't be a problem.
