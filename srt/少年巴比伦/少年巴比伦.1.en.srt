00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,730
I was having a nice dream,

35
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,770
playing basketball with Joey Wong.

36
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,730
Forget about that Joey Wong.

You have
the college entrance exam to take.

38
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,330
Get up, get up, get up!

39
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,450
Okay, okay, I got it.

40
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,290
Get up quickly.

41
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,450
Come on, eat.

45
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,080
to feed your brain.

46
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,800
We've been eating them
for three days straight

47
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,360
and I'm tired of them already.

48
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,710

Give it to your son.

53
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,580
Come on, a big piece.

54
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,420

- Eat it.

57
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,520
and hurry home.

58
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,050
I heard there is a pervert out there.

59
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,230
I can't rest easy with you

60
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,350
going home alone at night.

61
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,710
Why should a boy be afraid of a pervert?

62
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,470
Look at his long hair.

63
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,540
What if the pervert

64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,790
mistakes him for a girl?

65
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,960
It's my fault, really.

66
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,270
I looked too delicate when I was young.

67
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,710
What's with that expression?

68
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,300
What are you trying to say?

69
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,730
Are you saying our son takes after you?

70
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,460
Yes, exactly. He looks just like
a mirror image of me.

71
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,860
He looks like me, okay?

72
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,700
Yeah, he looks like you.

73
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,580
Our son is so handsome and delicate

74
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,860
- because I'm pretty.
- You are right.

75
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,700
He is...

76
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,180
Hey, Lu Xiaolu,

77
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,760
why are you taking the recorder?

78
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,340
Today is the last day
of the college entrance exam.

79
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,220
The head teacher said

80
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,290
we'll have a party

81
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,130
after it's over.

82
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,580
I just told you

83
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,170
to come straight home.

84
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,050
Why do you want to celebrate?

85
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,680
What if you mess up the exam?

86
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,680
He won't. He won't.

87
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,910
This teacher's suggestion is good.

88
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,780
That kid from the chemical factory

89
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,710
didn't do well in the exam
and jumped off a building.

90
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,790
What are you saying?

91
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,390
Don't worry,

92
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,930
I definitely won't do that.

93
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,170
Go get the oral solution.

94
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,470
- Okay, okay.
- Let me tell you,

95
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,760
the teacher personally told me that

96
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,320
you are smart enough

97
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,350
for college.

98
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,270
My son won't mess up the exam, right?

99
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,700
Mom, I think you misunderstood.

100
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,570
Huh?

101
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,900
I meant, even if I do mess up,

102
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,610
I definitely won't jump off a building.

103
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,270
- You little rascal.
- I'm leaving.

104
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,260
Hey!

105
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,500
Lu Xiaolu,

106
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,810
check your paper a few more times
before handing it in.

107
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,930
You must be home by six o'clock tonight.

108
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,810
Watch out for that pervert.

109
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,470
Don't worry,

110
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,050
if I run into that pervert,
I'll smash his head.

111
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,470
Oh, stop bragging.

112
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,660
=Episode 1: Young People at the Food Factory=
Go for it, son!

113
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,640
- Bye.
- I'll wait for your good news.

114
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,270
Stay safe.

In the early hours of today,

118
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,860
(Gongyuan)
after a female worker finished her night shift,

119
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,200
(Strive for a Miracle)
she met a pervert in the residential area.

120
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,080
According to the victim's report,

121
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,640
this pervert is of medium build,

122
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,590
wearing a raincoat,

123
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,320
and behaving inappropriately.

124
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,020
If you have any information,

125
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,910
please contact
the factory security department.

126
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,930
- Li Guangnan.
- Yeah?

127
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,880
I'm really a good friend, huh?

128
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,470
I came right before the exam
to help you pursue the girl.

129
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,370
You could have chosen any day to confess,

130
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,460
but you insisted on doing it today.

131
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,660
I must be the first person in the world

132
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,560
to wish her a happy birthday.

133
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,290
Okay, but let's set it straight.

134
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,230
If she doesn't show up

135
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,220
within ten minutes,
I have to go for the exam.

136
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,030
Alright, alright, ten minutes it is.

137
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,390
Here, take this.
Good luck with your exam.

138
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,740

this is for you.

Happy birthday to you!

I've been preparing for a year.

146

Look, I know you like Chen Haonan.

147
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,150
I bought you all his magazines.

148
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,480
And remember how you liked

149
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,900
those little cards about the Sailor Moon

150
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,930
in the instant noodles?

151
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,050
I collected them all for you.

152
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,890
How about that?

153
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,860
These are things I liked

154
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,780
back in middle school.

155
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,760
I've moved on long ago.

156
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,640
Morning, Uncle Li.

157
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,250
Nice dance, Uncle Li.

158
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,710
- Yeah.
- Don't hurt your back.

159
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,760
Even if you don't like them,

160
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,560
I got some music for you.

161
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,830
Two tapes, played the wrong one.

162
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,910
Are you crazy?

163
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,200
What if my bosses see this?

164
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,120
Hey, wait, Little Pouter.

165
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,130
The moment I first saw you

166
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,930
in middle school, I liked you.

167
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,490
I still like you after six years.

168
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,640
But I don't like you.

169
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,650
No, hey!

170
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,130
Li Guangnan came on the day
of college entrance exam

171
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,790
just to wish you a happy birthday.

172
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,000
Even if you don't accept it,

173
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,520
can't you be a bit more polite?

174
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,790
What does it have to do with you,
Lu Xiaolu?

175
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,560
You used to be lovely.

176
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,660
Why have you become so rude

177
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,030
after a few years?

178
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,880
None of your business. Move aside.

179
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,390
Hey, Little Pouter.

180
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,090
I really...

181
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,980
- Hey!
- Where are the hooligans?

182
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,320
Dakang, these two.

183
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,700
Are you crazy?
You came to our factory gate

184
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,560
to harass the most beautiful girl
in our factory?

185
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,950
I'll teach you two a lesson today.

186
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,490
- What's going on? You've misunderstood.
- Get them!

187
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,440
- Little Pouter, say something.
- Let go!

188
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,180
Let go!

189
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,140
We're not hooligans.

190
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,060
Let's talk

191
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,560
in the security office.

192
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,890
We have to take the college entrance exam.

193
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,350
We can't go with you to the security office.

194
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,060
We need to hurry.

195
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,490
The mayor invited me to a meeting later.

196
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,330
Move!

197
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,710
- Let go!
- You don't know who his cousin is?

198
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,820
Who is he?

199
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,660
Let go.

200
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,280
His cousin is the undefeated Lu Dajiang,
Scarface Lu along the Min River.

201
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,970
Let go.

202
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,900
You are scared, huh?

203
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,590
Lu Dajiang? I know him.

204
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,230
He is just a stinky thug.

205
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,610
He's a big thug.

206
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,580
You two are little thugs.

207
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,420
How dare you hit me!

208
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,760
(No Parking)

209
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,840
(Gongyuan)

210
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,550
♪You entered my world♪

211
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,340
♪And everything of mine
began to spiral out of control♪

212
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,680
Li Guangnan, run!

213
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,870
(People say)

214
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,710
(real life starts)

215
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,990
(from the moment of awakening.)

216
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,990
(When I was 19,)

217
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,280
(I always wanted to conquer the world,)

218
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,220
(just like how)

219
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,680
(it wanted to conquer me.)

220
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,590
(On that morning)

221
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,280
(when colorful clothes flew in the air,)

222
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,080
(she walked towards me)

223
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,960
(and the world fell silent.)

224
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,610
(I knew)

225
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,320
(our story)

226
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,920
(started)

227
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,160
(from here.)

228
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,200
(Golden Peacock)

229
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,380
(Gongyuan)
Lift your heads up!

230
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,550
(Chief Ma, Security Department)
Lu Xiaolu, the future college student.

231
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,020
Uncle Ma.

232
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,130
You're about to become a college student,

233
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,440
yet you still hang out all day
like a street punk.

234
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,480
Li Guangnan.

235
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,950
- Yeah?
- Don't give me that.

236
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,880
Turn around.

237
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,960
When I first joined the factory,

238
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,060
the two of you

239
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,480
were still running around
in open-crotch pants.

240
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,800
Now you've got the guts

241
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,080
to fight at the factory gate. I...

242
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,000
Uncle Ma,

243
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,280
save the lecture for another day.

244
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,000
We're about to take the exam today.

245
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,480
Why didn't you think that
before you fought?

246
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,840
Uncle Ma, if he doesn't take the exam,
his parents will kill him.

247
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you think of

248
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,680
your parents when you were fighting?

249
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,920
- I...
- Okay, that's enough.

250
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,880
Ma.

251
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,520
Raise your heads.

252
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,520
Who threw the first punch?

253
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,360
They did!

254
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,200
Hey, you...

255
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,000
What's your name?

256
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,640
Qin Juan.

257
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,320
Wu, she is a clerk in our labor
and management office.

258
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,000
Tell us,

259
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,880
who started the fight?

260
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,240
I... I didn't see anything.

261
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Hey, Little Pouter.

262
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,640
- I...
- Alright,

263
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,400
you're not involved here.

264
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,720
You can go.

265
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,960
She can't leave.

266
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,000
She's a witness.

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,080
Shut up!

268
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,080
You're the new factory doctor?

269
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,680
Yes.

270
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,940
(First Love)
Did you see who threw the first punch?

271
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,960
I did.

272
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,840
Ma.

273
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,080
Oh, Bi.

274
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,320
I heard there was trouble here.

275
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,120
There's not much going on here.

276
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,120
Let me introduce you.

277
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,400
This is Officer Wu
from the police station.

278
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,680
Nice to meet you.

279
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,600
Wu, this is Bi Zhigang from

280
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,440
the secretary's office.

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,980
(Bi Zhigang, Factory Secretary)
Come have tea with me sometime.

282
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,360
So, what's the situation?

283
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,320
We're interrogating,

284
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
but they all deny
throwing the first punch.

285
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,920
We hold disciplinary

286
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,680
and ideological education sessions
every month.

287
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Our workers are civilized and rule-abiding.

288
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,760
They wouldn't

289
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,840
start fights, right?

290
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,440
That's right.

291
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
You are Lu Dajiang's cousin, right?

292
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,920
Your cousin used to dominate Fucheng.

293
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,720
How come you're so worthless?

294
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,640
Getting beaten down like this.

295
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Hey, Bi...

296
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,360
- What are you doing?
- I may not have my brother's power,

297
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,680
but I can swat flies,

298
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,560
especially annoying ones like you.

299
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,960
- I...
- Dude,

300
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,650
haven't washed your hair in years, huh?

301
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,040
Your mousse is probably stinking.

302
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,560
Look, it must have been him
who threw the first punch.

303
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,490
Arrest him! It's definitely him.

304
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,240
- It must be him!
- Alright!

305
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,280
Calm down.

306
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,120
(Security Department)

307
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,320
- Captain Wu.
- Get down.

308
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,960
She said she saw
who threw the first punch.

309
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,520
Who was it?

310
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,840
- Him.
- I told you!

311
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,320
Dong, take him with us.

312
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,480
Everyone else can go.

313
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,080
- Let's go.
- Have a good day.

314
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,040
You've got the wrong person.

315
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,240
Shut up!

316
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,280
None of your business!

317
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,760
Get lost!

318
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,000
This is not over.

319
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,480
Of course it is not,

320
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,080
you owe me a suitcase.

321
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,600
Xiaolu,

322
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,110
I think you can still make it to the exam.

323
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,560
There's a shortcut
by the vegetable market.

324
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,800
Hurry on your bike, you can get there.

325
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,680
- Just go.
- Thanks, Uncle Wu.

326
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,320
- I'm going.
- Good luck!

327
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
Strive to become a college student.

328
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,040
- Don't be like your cousin.
- Okay.

329
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,240
That's it?

330
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,920
We've taken him out of the factory.

331
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,480
Will you buy him lunch if we keep him?

332
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,080
Let's go back.

333
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,600
Honey,

334
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,800
when did you start believing in this?

335
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Li Guangnan's mother taught me this.

336
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,600
She said the students would be blessed.

337
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
Didn't you say that

338
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,840
our son is naturally bright,

339
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,760
born to excel in academics?

340
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,520
I didn't tell the truth

341
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,000
in front of him just now.

342
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,840
Actually, the teachers said,

343
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,320
"Your son, Lu Xiaolu,

344
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,360
is intelligent enough

345
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,760
for college,

346
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,160
but he's mischievous and doesn't study hard.

347
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,480
It's difficult for him to even get
into the top ten in the class."

348
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,700
Mischievous and lazy,

349
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,080
yet he can still make it into the top ten.

350
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,200
What kind of intelligence is this?

351
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,620
Whose intelligence did he get?

352
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,800
Apparently yours, isn't it?

353
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,160
Not at all.

354
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,880
When I was a student,

355
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
I was always in the top three of the class.

356
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
I was good-looking,

357
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,320
and my grades were decent.

358
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Every teacher liked me.

359
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,800
- Let me tell you.
- What?

360
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,920
Many people

361
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,680
in our factory ask for

362
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,600
a celebratory banquet when they see me.

363
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,400
I've booked a restaurant.

364
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,360
If this brat doesn't do well,

365
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,960
what will we do?

366
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,440
He'll definitely do well.

367
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,480
No problem.

368
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,280
(Brave the waves, pass with flying colors)

369
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,880
Sir, please don't lock the door.

370
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,840
Let me in.

371
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560
Stop yelling.
They're taking exams inside.

372
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm here to take the exam too.

373
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,960
- Let me in.
- I can't.

374
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
Mr. Zhang!

375
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,840
Mr. Zhang!

376
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,840
Please don't shout.

377
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,040
Mr. Hu!

378
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,080
Please let me in!

379
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,480
- I'm Xiaolu!
- Young man,

380
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,000
if you shout again, I'll call the police.

381
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,800
Please, sir, please let me in.

382
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,560
Why are you also outside?

383
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,560
We were both in the fight this morning,

384
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,320
how can I go in alone?

385
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,960
My brother.

386
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,720
Take this.

387
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
(Parents, please keep out)

388
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,520
How will you explain

389
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,000
to your mom tonight?

390
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,560
Explain?

391
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,880
Dare I say anything?

392
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,800
The problem is,

393
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,840
even if I go to take the exam,

394
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,120
I might not pass.

395
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,760
But you could

396
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,360
at least pass a vocational school.

397
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,520
I'm sorry.

398
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,800
It's all because of me.

399
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,880
No big deal.

400
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,520
It's just the college entrance exam.

401
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,760
With my intelligence and talent,

402
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,320
even if I don't go to college,

403
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,480
I can do anything.

404
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,640
Maybe we can work in a factory.

405
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,200
In a factory?

406
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,040
Yeah.

407
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,080
Working in a factory is honorable,

408
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,920
especially if you can

409
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,000
get into that food factory.

410
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,560
Not only is the welfare good,

411
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,320
with endless bread and soda every month,

412
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,040
but more importantly, it's the factory
with the most girls in the city.

413
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,280
Little Pouter works there too.

414
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,560
Let's focus on surviving tonight now.

415
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,320
Alright,

416
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
stop sulking. It's no use.

417
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,840
Come with me

418
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,640
to find my cousin.

419
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,520
My mom's waiting for me at home.

420
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,120
It's too early to go back and meet death.

421
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,400
Early death, early reincarnation.

422
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
The basketball court renovation project

423
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,560
(Welcome to Golden Peacock)
can't be taken by Lu Dajiang,

424
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,600
do you understand?

425
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,840
Although he used to be
a worker in our factory,

426
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,600
he committed some bad deeds

427
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,840
and ran off to Hong Kong.

428
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,120
Now he's a

429
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,960
complete troublemaker.

430
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,880
So what if he has money?

431
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,080
We don't associate with such social scum.

432
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,520
Anyway, don't give him the project.

433
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,280
Just do as I say.

434
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,880
He can talk to me at the factory!

435
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,040
He's on his way?

436
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,680
(Lu Dajiang, Domineering Man of Fucheng)

437
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,040
Why didn't you say this earlier?

438
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Director,

439
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,000
this is Bai Lan,

440
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,520
our new factory doctor.

441
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,000
I just graduated from university,

442
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
and I brought her to meet with you.

443
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,920
You...

444
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,520
You are...

445
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,920
Where is my cousin?

446
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,880
Who's your cousin?

447
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,920
Cut the crap!

448
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,600
Someone told me you had him arrested.

449
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,320
That's right,

450
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,840
he openly harassed
one of our factory workers

451
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,320
and got involved in a fight.

452
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,120
The evidence is clear,

453
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,840
and the witness is right here.

454
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,120
He was just taken away by the police.

455
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,480
Good for you, Bi Zhigang,

456
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,280
now you're acting all dignified

457
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,240
and you dare to touch my cousin.

458
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,080
I...

459
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,440
Don't forget

460
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,360
how you begged me

461
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,200
when I beat you up back then.

462
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,760
I was a student cadre.

463
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,320
I couldn't stoop to your level.

464
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,160
You...

465
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,040
Hey, you...

466
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
What are you doing?
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

467
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,560
You're the witness?

468
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
What did you see?

469
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,080
I don't know if your cousin
harassed the female worker,

470
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,920
but he did hit someone

471
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,760
and damaged my suitcase.

472
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,600
That's right.

473
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,280
I'll pay you double for the suitcase.

474
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
Call the police now

475
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,320
and tell them he didn't hit anyone.

476
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,920
Get him released right now.

477
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,800
Lu Dajiang, stop messing around here!

478
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,480
Just shut up.

479
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,920
- Hey, you...
- He hit someone. That's the truth.

480
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,360
I can't lie to the police.

481
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,720
That's right.

482
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,400
Pig Teeth,

483
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,240
Dumb Jar,

484
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,720
close the door.

485
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,040
- You...
- What are you doing?

486
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,360
You... You...

487
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,080
- What do you want?
- In broad daylight, this is...

488
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,560
- Stop making trouble!
- What do you want?

489
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,840
If they don't release him today,

490
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,000
no one will leave.

491
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,360
- Wait.
- Listen,

492
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,840
your logic is flawed.

493
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,560
He's not even here.

494
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,200
If you have the guts,
go to the police and ask for him.

495
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,160
That's right.

496
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,600
If you have the guts, go ahead.

497
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,120
You are talking about logic?

498
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,960
I may only have
a middle school education,

499
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,200
but I understand logic.

500
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,720
You framed him,

501
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,800
so the police arrested him.

502
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,680
Change your tune,

503
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,440
and they'll release him,

504
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,000
right?

505
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,400
This is not logic at all.

506
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,480
This is unreasonable.

507
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,040
Let me tell you,

508
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,280
this is the factory director's office,

509
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
not where you can act wild.

510
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,320
- Get out of here.
- Hit him!

511
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,920
Don't do that!

512
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,360
Why are you doing this?

513
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,600
Call the police now.

514
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,320
Let him go. You let go first.

515
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,520
Let go, it's dangerous.

516
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,400
- Make the call, will you?
- You...

517
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,840
- Fine, I'll make a call.
- Do it now.

518
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,680
Stop wasting time.

519
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,320
Police officer?

520
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,880
- Dajiang!
- Boss!

521
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,720
Oh dear.

522
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,360
She hit him hard.

523
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,360
You... You guys...

524
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,640
Stop messing around.

525
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,560
Are you okay?

526
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,960
No... No...

527
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,640
Boss.

528
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,000
Quickly release him.

529
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,960
If you don't,

530
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,560
just wait and see.

531
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's go.

532
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Pig Teeth, open the door.

533
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,800
This

534
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,080
is not over!

535
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,360
You should go to the hospital

536
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,880
in case of a concussion.

537
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,720
They're gone. They're gone.

538
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,040
No need to come here.

539
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,680
Hit him! Hit him!

540
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,480
Hit him!

541
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,640
Punch him! Punch!

542
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,200
Take it easy.

543
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,240
Boss, are you okay?

544
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,300
(A Better Tomorrow)
Boss Ma,

545
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,160
please protect my big brother
and keep him safe.

546
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,280
What happened to him?

547
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,600
He was...

548
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,600
He was attacked by a woman.

549
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,280
That crazy woman!

550
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,680
Who is she?

551
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,080
She wore a blue floral dress,

552
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,200
white shirt,

553
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,840
big eyes,

554
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,920
quite pretty,

555
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,160
but she's too vicious.

556
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,440
Dajiang was fine when he was there,

557
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,860
but once he came out,
he was in bad shape.

558
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,200
Blue floral dress, white shirt...

559
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,120
- Dajiang.
- Boss.

560
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,200
- Dajiang.
- Be careful. Slowly.

561
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,040
Are you okay?

562
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,720
Why am I here?

563
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,760
Your head

564
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,640
just got hit at the food factory.

565
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
You should rest a bit more.

566
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,160
It's okay, it's okay.

567
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,040
I remember now.

568
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,720
Lu Xiaolu?

569
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,320
You came out so quickly.

570
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,200
It was her.

571
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,720
She's the one who attacked Dajiang.

572
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,160
It's really you.

573
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,700
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

574
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,240
You hit me

575
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,000
and then want me to go to hospital.

576
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Why are you treating me so well?

577
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,240
If there really was a concussion,

578
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,400
there would be consequences.

579
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,600
I let my guard down today,

580
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,960
but I never hit women.

581
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
I won't pursue this matter with you.

582
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Stop bothering me.

583
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,320
Get out of here.

584
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,720
Leave now.

585
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,320
Leave right now.

586
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,320
We'll settle this with a game of snooker.

587
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,760
If you win, I'll go with you.

588
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,480
If you lose, get lost.

589
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,920
Nice shot.

590
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,800
You've got some skills.

591
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,720
Do you college girls often play this?

592
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,080
I played for two years
with my foreign teacher

593
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,280
to learn English in university.

594
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,280
My cousin just got injured

595
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,360
and is not feeling well.

596
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,920
I'll play for him.

597
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,000
Whatever.

598
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,680
The power is out.

599
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,800
Who's cooking again?

600
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,440
The fuse

601
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,600
is blown again.

602
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,880
Do what we always do.

603
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,240
- Good shot.
- Nice.

604
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,640
Amazing!

605
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,240
(Lu Dajiang)

606
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,000
Mom? What are you doing here?

607
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,280
What are you doing?

608
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,840
You skipped the exam

609
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,080
and came here to play billard?

610
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Mom, please calm down.

611
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Listen to my explanation.

612
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,600
What explanation?

613
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,360
Dajiang! Help!

614
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,800
Stop! Little brat!

615
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
Mom, I'll explain when I get home.

616
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,720
Lu Xiaolu,

617
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,840
stop right there.

618
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,240
Where are you going?

619
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Lu Xiaolu!

620
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,280
You can't leave.

621
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
You lost to me.

622
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,600
Xiaolu!

623
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,680
Hop on.

624
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,880
Mom, stop chasing.

625
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,000
(Dajiang Entertainment)
Where are you going?

626
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,000
Come back here!

627
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,720
You failed the college entrance exam

628
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,720
and your parents won't let you off.

629
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,160
What will you do next?

630
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,800
Dajiang,

631
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,160
what were you doing

632
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
at 18?

633
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,560
Me?

634
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,200
I got expelled from middle school.

635
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,200
When I was 18,

636
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,560
I was fighting,

637
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
chasing girls, and selling cigarettes.

638
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,320
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

639
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,640
Because

640
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,160
I want to be like you.

641
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,240
What do you mean like me?

642
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,560
I mean as tough as you.

643
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,040
You do whatever you want

644
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,480
and protect whoever you want

645
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,800
just like Boss Ma.

646
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,160
You should study hard.

647
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,520
You failed this year,

648
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,600
but you can do another year.

649
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,360
Today,

650
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,480
there was a moment

651
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,280
when I felt like my life was doomed.

652
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,960
I didn't know what to do next

653
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,960
or how to

654
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,120
face my mom and others.

655
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,600
But now,

656
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,200
I've figured it out.

657
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,800
Since fate made me
miss the college entrance exam,

658
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,400
why not venture out?

659
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,320
Heroes have no fixed origins.

660
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,320
Maybe you can work in the food factory,

661
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,440
you may achieve something there.

662
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,960
Why must I enter a factory?

663
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,800
You don't want me to work for you?

664
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,720
Are you looking down on me?

665
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,760
Life isn't a movie.

666
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,680
It's much harder than that.

667
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,160
You'll understand in the future.

668
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,680
Dajiang.

669
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,400
What

670
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,400
would Boss Ma do

671
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,080
in this situation?

672
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,280
I don't know.

673
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,720
But whether he chooses right or wrong,

674
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,000
he'll definitely rise again.

675
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,920
(A month later)

676
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,520
In the hot summer air

677
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,160
when everything

678
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,440
is flourishing,

679
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,520
our factory welcomes...

680
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,080
Secretary Zhao. Secretary Zhao.

681
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,760
Mrs. Li.

682
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,280
I've chased you for a while.

683
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,720
I didn't see you.

684
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,080
Thank you so much.

685
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,160
What for?

686
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,200
It's all thanks to you that

687
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,880
my son Guangnan entered the factory

688
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,320
together with your son Xiaolu.

689
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,280
I'll bring two bottles of good liquor
for Mr. Lu tonight.

690
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
We've been friends

691
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,320
for so many years.

692
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,560
Why all the formality between us?

693
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,440
We should thank you anyway.

694
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,010
He couldn't have gotten in
without your help.

695
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,120
- Next up, please welcome
- Oh, come on.

696
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,360
- the representative of the young workers,
- Let's go.

697
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,600
Comrade Lu Xiaolu,

698
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,240
to address everyone.

699
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
It's Xiaolu.

700
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,160
Who asked him to speak?

701
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,640
What right does he have to speak?

702
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,040
Because he's talented.

703
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,120
- Just listen.
- Not at all.

704
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,400
Respected leaders and seniors,

705
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm Lu Xiaolu.

706
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,960
Due to failing the college entrance exam,

707
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,760
I lost the opportunity for higher education.

708
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,200
I felt lost and

709
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,120
desperate in life.

710
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,600
I let my teachers,

711
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,880
classmates,

712
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,040
and my parents down.

713
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,080
Can you be serious?

714
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,720
Speak properly. I might be punished.

715
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,920
You called me here

716
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,760
and then blame me?

717
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,720
At this time,

718
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,600
my mom opened the Xinhua Dictionary

719
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,560
for me to read a passage.

720
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,760
Zhang Hua got into Peking University,

721
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,640
Li Ping entered a vocational school,

722
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,000
and I ended up as a salesperson
in a department store.

723
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,360
We all have bright futures.

724
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,520
That enlightened me!

725
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,080
That's right!

726
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,080
Every road leads to Rome.

727
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,640
I can't be defeated
by such a small obstacle.

728
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,080
I want to thank the leadership
of the food factory

729
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,760
for providing me with a new

730
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,440
and bright future

731
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,400
when I was lost and confused.

732
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,800
So, starting today,

733
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,680
I'm dedicating

734
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,200
all my youth and passion

735
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,160
to this food factory.

736
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,960
I want to put down roots here, grow,
and flourish.

737
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,280
Yeah!

738
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,800
See how well Xiaolu speaks?

739
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,360
He's always been

740
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,480
good at making a speech.

741
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,240
He's a perfect boy!

743
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,360
That's right.

744
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,240
Was that speech just now
good enough for you?

745
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,960
I almost had a heart attack.

746
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,320
It's all your fault.

747
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,920
But honestly,

748
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,920
don't ask me to do this again in the future.

749
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,920
I used to be good at self-criticizing,

750
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,580
but now everything I say
feels like a self-critique.

751
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,160
You are not bad

752
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,280
when you are serious.

753
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,680
You should change yourself.

754
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,560
I can't change anyway.

755
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,960
You can let that female college student

756
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,120
make the speech.

757
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,320
She looks most suitable for

758
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,640
making those righteous speeches.

759
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,080
You mean Bai Lan?

760
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,920
Yes.

761
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,720
My grudge with her isn't settled yet.

762

00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,600
Why?

765
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,200
She is

766
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,320
not quite clean.

767
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,840

Her record is not clean.

770
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,240
She's stabbed someone with a knife.

771
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,640
Really?

772
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,320
Bai Lan stabbed someone with a knife?

773
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,960
No wonder she's so wild.

774
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,120
She even dared to hit my cousin's head.

775
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,000
So she's a repeat offender?

776
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,560
That little brat!

777
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,360
But she didn't kill anyone.

778
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,520
It was just a minor injury.

779
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,040
But she was once arrested.

780
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,160
That's absolutely true.

781
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,240
Don't tell anyone.

No need. I live in the dormitory.

796
