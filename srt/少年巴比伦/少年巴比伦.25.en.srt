He can't talk to you.

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,200

for your involvement anymore.

00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
Also,

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,320
you're not qualified to

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,080

I must see Huang Qing today.

41
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120

42
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,160

Here, Master.

49
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400

53
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,600
Alright.

54
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,600
Master,

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,040
are we really going to confront them?

56
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,160
They're a bunch of desperados.

57
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,280
If our people don't have weapons

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,920
when they come back,

59
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,320
we will be at a disadvantage.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,560
Master, it's raining.

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,480
Those jerks won't come back, right?

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,120
It's good to be cautious.

63
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,920
Oh, by the way,

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,000
I asked you two

65
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,640
to secure the peacock statue

66
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,480
at the factory gate. Did you do it?

67
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,720
I went up to check.

68
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,200
There's a big crack up there

69
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,160
that would need a lot of
steel wire to secure it.

70
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,600
But...

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,440
But what?

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,440
But we don't have
any steel wire right now.

73
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,720
We need to buy some new ones.

74
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,840
I went to logistics
that day to ask them for it,

75
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,880
but they said

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,160
the factory is in chaos these days

77
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,040
and they've frozen the accounts,
so there's no money for us.

78
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,880
So you just gave up?

79
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,720
I...

80
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,760
Even if you tied it up with ropes,

81
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,960
it would be a lot safer.

82
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,080
Do you know that thing

83
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
could hurt someone if it falls down?

84
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,000
- I...
- Master Niu.

85
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Why are you here?

86
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,280
I heard someone's coming
to tear down our factory.

87
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,120

88
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,680
even if we die today,

89
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,520
we must fight these jerks to the end.

90
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, fight to the end.

91
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,240

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,440
♪Mirage is all over the heart♪

188
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,280
If there's no money, I'll find a way.

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,680
Everything will be okay.

190
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,520
Bai Lan, have you ever thought about it?

191
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,520
The Golden Peacock's factory buildings,

192
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,600
dormitories,

193
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,200
chimneys,

194
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,710
and maintenance workshop

195
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,960
will all disappear completely

196
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,040
in the near future.

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
I remember when I was little,

198
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,280
I thought everything
in the food factory was eternal

199
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,360
and unchanging.

200
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,560
I thought it would accompany me
throughout my life.

201
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,120
I even had a dream.

202
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,000
I was really old in it,

203
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,640
but when I walked into the medical room,

204
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,440
I found you still treating patients.

205
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,160
Was I old too?

206
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,040
No, you were not.

207
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,320
You still looked young,

208
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,640
just like when I first met you.

209
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,600
You were there for treatment too?

210
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,240
I just wanted to get closer to you.

211
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,920
I had so many things

212
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,800
to say to you.

213
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,560
It's just a dream
that will never come true.

214
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,960
(Gongyuan)
Due to the accident occurred in our factory,

215
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,920
the City Party Committee
and Government require

216
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,760
an immediate halt to all

217
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,940
resumption of work activities,

218
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,140
pending investigation
by the accident investigation team.

219
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,160
In addition, according to
the directives of the government,

220
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,960
as our factory no longer possesses

221
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,640
the basic conditions for normal production,

222
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,480
in order to maintain

223
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,120
the stability and unity of our factory,

224
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,560
please promptly carry out

225
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,560
the democratic voting process
among all employees

226
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,050
(Not Sell, Abstain, Sell)
to decide whether to proceed with

227
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,760
the overall transfer of our factory
to Shanghai Huaxing Corporation.

228
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
The vote is coming soon.

229
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,160
Could it be that
we really can't save this factory?

230
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:11,080
(Gongyuan)

231
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
Mayor Bi,

232
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,050
is the investigation proceeding smoothly?

233
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,360
If the accident is ultimately

234
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,760
attributed to equipment failure,

235
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,600
as the responsible person
for restructuring the food factory,

236
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,000
you can't

237
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,400
avoid implication.

238
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,200
Therefore,

239
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,720
you must compensate the injured girl.

240
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,720
As long as we can secure the land,

241
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,360
money is not an issue.

242
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,640
However, this accident

243
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,400
has indeed
been quite advantageous for us,

244
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,360
as it has made the workers

245
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,320
more aware of reality.

246
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,080
Meanwhile,

247
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,360
the city is considering

248
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
resolving the food factory issue

249
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,800
as soon and thoroughly as possible.

250
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,360
Think about it,

251
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,560
who would want to hold onto

252
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,000
such an unlucky and unpromising factory?

253
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,520
I won't delay the matters

254
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,840
I promised you.

255
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,960
Dajiang.

256
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,120
Hey, you're back.

257
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,280
I'm planning to take a trip to Thailand
with Tao.

258
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,200
Ms. Tao told me about it.

259
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,080
That's great!

260
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,840
If you like it there,

261
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,440
just stay a bit longer

262
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,050
and don't keep
thinking about coming back.

263
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,920
Don't miss me too much.

264
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,960
If you run into trouble,

265
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,360
don't hide it from me.

266
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,920
Dajiang,

267
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,800
what trouble could I have?

268
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,720
How's your friend
Li Guangnan doing lately?

269
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,280
I heard his wife got injured.

270
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,680
I don't know.

271
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,660
I looked for him all afternoon
but couldn't find him.

272
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,040
Fucheng isn't that big.

273
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,080
Where could he go?

274
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,880
Juan, you're awake.

275
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,640
Bai Lan went to get your medicine.

276
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,560
I saw no one in the room,

277
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,800
so I came in to check on you.

278
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,120
Are you thirsty?

279
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,240
I know you don't want to talk to me now.

280
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,360
You probably hate me,

281
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,560
but this is all my fault.

282
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,200
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

283
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,040
Just focus on recovering.

284
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,600
- The other things...
- Let's get a divorce.

285
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,440
Okay.

286
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,920
When your legs heal,
we'll go through with it.

287
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,320
Juan,

288
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,760
if we can't be husband and wife anymore,

289
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,160
can we still be friends?

290
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,280
(Dajiang Entertainment City)

291
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,480
(Skate Land)

292
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,800
There you are.

293
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,960
Xiaolu, you're here.

294
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,080
Come take a look

295
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,960
at our skating rink.

296
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,960
Xiaolu,

297
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
remember how good it was

298
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,600
when we were here at the skating rink?

299
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,880
We had no sorrows

300
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,120
and our love was so pure.

301
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,880
It was right there.

302
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,440
I fought with you

303
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
for Little Pouter.

304
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,320
She kept saying she liked you,

305
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,840
but she didn't actually like you,

306
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,280
she liked me, right?

307
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,360
Yes,

308
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,640
she liked you.

309
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,520
Your dream came true.

310
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,040
But what are you doing now?

311
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,920
Li Guangnan,

312
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,160
tell me what you should be doing!

313
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,880
You have no right to be sad here.

314
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,240
Let me tell you,

315
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,120
you should be at the hospital.

316
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,520
You should be by Little Pouter's side.

317
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
I won't go.

318
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,080
- You won't go, huh?
- I won't go.

319
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,160
I will never be there.

320
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,420
You want to die, huh?

321
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,480
Move!

322
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,560
Come on!

323
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,160
I won't go.

324
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,160
Walk!

325
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,520
You want to die?

326
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,480
Do you still want to die?

327
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,480
Tell me!

328
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,360
Look at me!

329
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,440
Speak!

330
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,760
Help!

331
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,920
Staying in the hospital
doesn't make much sense now.

332
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,760
I suggest

333
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,880
she goes through
the discharge procedures.

334
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,480
In her current condition,

335
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,680
given the limitations
of medical technology,

336
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,800
successful treatments are extremely rare.

337
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,000
Is it a work-related injury?

338
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,050
Then you can seek reimbursement
from the employer.

339
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,960
Which company are you with?

340
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,040
Golden Peacock Food Factory.

341
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,280
Then go talk to the factory leadership

342
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,280
and let them pay the money.

343
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,080
If the factory refuses to pay,

344
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,580
then you should make a scene.

345
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,000
There are many methods you can try.

346
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,840
At times like this,
don't worry about dignity.

347
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
From my experience,

348
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,560
those leaders are all afraid of trouble.

349
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,640
The money won't come
from their pockets anyway.

350
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,920
Thank you, doctor.

351
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,480
Do you remember that year

352
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,480
we both missed the college entrance exam?

353
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
The whole summer,

354
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
you rode that old bike

355
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,320
and took me around everywhere.

356
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,320
Back then, I felt like

357
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,080
my whole life was over.

358
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,720
Of course I remember that.

359
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
That bike was my

360
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,520
18th birthday gift.

361
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,900
And I rode it into a ditch because of you.

362
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,800
My mom scolded me for a long time.

363
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,200
Looking back now,
you should really thank me.

364
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,280
If it weren't for that bike breaking down,

365
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,050
it wouldn't have been used
for experiments for Big Feet.

366
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,520
It was the first

367
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,200
motorcycle bike in the factory.

368
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,120
Afterward,

369
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,080
we used the first money we earned
from selling milk tea

370
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,680
to buy a real motorcycle.

371
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,240
After that,

372
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,440
we each had our own car.

373
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,120
But Li Guangnan,
have you ever thought about it?

374
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,680
As we earn more money

375
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,360
and upgrade our cars,

376
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,600
we become less happy.

377
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,640
Do you remember what you said to me

378
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,720
when I came back from Shanghai,

379
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,120
and was at the lowest point in my life?

380
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,360
Those days taught me a lesson.

381
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,440
Even in the darkest times,

382
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,960
there's a day to come out.

383
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,840
As long as you want,

384
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,440
everything can start anew.

385
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,200
I know what to do now.

386
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,240
Juan,

387
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,520
the doctor said

388
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,600
you need to move your legs more

389
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,200
to keep the muscles

390
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,440
from atrophying.

391
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,960
So from now on,

392
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,160
before the caregiver arrives,

393
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,800
I'll massage your legs every day.

394
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,400
Don't waste time.

395
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,520
Why is it a waste of time?

396
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,040
As long as
we persist like this every day,

397
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,360
you'll be able to walk soon.

398
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,440
It's no use!

399
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,640
I can't feel them at all!

400
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,480
Juan!

401
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Not at all!

402
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,320
Juan!

403
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,120
Don't you believe me?

404
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,040
You're not a doctor anymore!

405
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,440
But I'm your doctor.

406
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,600
Whatever difficulties you face,

407
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,960
I'm on your side.

408
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,560
I can take care of you
in the future if needed.

409
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,840
Thank you.

410
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,320
Why don't you rest for a while?

411
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,680
I'll rest too.

429

Hello?

430
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,240
Mr. Huang.

431
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,440
I heard you're leaving Fucheng.

432
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,440
I've taken care of everything for you.

433
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,740
Yet you're leaving
without even telling me?

434
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,240
You are quite well-informed.

435
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,280
Of course,

436
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
so I'm calling to remind you

437
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,560
not to end up like Vice Mayor Bi.

438
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,920
Otherwise, you'd be in trouble.

439
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,480
Is that so?

440
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,480
I've done so much for you,

441
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,920
and you're leaving like this?

442
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,280
Come on.

443
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,640
I didn't get anything I wanted.

444
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,960
How can I give you what you want?

445
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,320
Mr. Huang,

446
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,720
you're a shrewd businessman,

447
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,120
and I knew

448
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
you wouldn't just pay so easily.

449
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,960
That's why

450
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,600
your woman is here with me.

451
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,560
You're extorting me?

452
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,280
After all the collaboration,

453
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,840
you know what I'm capable of.

454
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,360
Don't waste our time.

455
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,840
I'm waiting for you.

456
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,760
Lyu, prepare the car.

457
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,600
We're going to the airport.

458
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,240
Are you delivering the money to me?

459
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,560
Mr. Huang,

460
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,800
you're willing to

461
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,880
abandon your own woman just to escape?

sheltering organized crime,)

00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,880
(illegally accepting property from others,)

465
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,570
(resulting in significant losses
to the interests)

466
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,080
(of the state and the people.)

467
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,720
(The Fucheng People's Procuratorate)

468
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,140
(has lawfully issued an arrest warrant
against Bi Shanwen)

469
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,960
(and brought charges including sheltering)

470
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,500
(organized crime, and bribery.)

471
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,210

472
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,370
(under the shelter of Bi Shanwen,)

473
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,560
(organized and led
an organized crime group,)

474
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,850
(committing offenses such as)

475
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,800
(intentional murder, intentional injury,)

476
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,030

and forced transactions.)

(Huang Qing has been lawfully arrested)

478
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,250
(and charged with offenses
including organizing and leading)

479
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,310
(an organized crime group
and intentional murder.)

480
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,000
- Let go of me!
- Move!

481
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,680
Bai Lan?

482
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,560
Is it that I'm getting old?

483
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,800
That's impossible.

484
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,400
You just became more mature.

485
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
The charm of a mature man.

486
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,720
Just stop. I can pack my stuff myself.

487
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,520
How can I stop?

488
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,800
I have to watch you
getting in Ms. Tao's car.

489
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,460
That's the only way I can be reassured.

490
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,640
Let me do it.

491
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,760
Dajiang,

492
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
you and Ms. Tao

493
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,840
can finally leave this place

494
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,400
and live a carefree life.

495
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,320
I'm genuinely happy for you.

496
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,240
In the future, you and your girl

497
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
will also have such good days.

498
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,560
Hello?

499
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,960
Bai Lan has been kidnapped.

500
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,200
What are you saying?

501
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,640
I've been looking for Boss Hu
these past two days.

502
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,280
I wanted revenge for Little Pouter.

503
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,200
I just found him,

504
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,520
and guess what? I saw Bai Lan.

505
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,880
Where are you?

506
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,880
I'm at the East Suburb warehouse.

507
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,080
There's a blue truck at the entrance.

508
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,120
Wait for me.

509
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,320
Don't act alone.

510
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,560
Okay.

511
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,560
Xiaolu.

512
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,360
What's wrong?

513
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,800
Nothing.

514
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,160
Li Guangnan

515
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,040
is feeling down,

516
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,360
and wants me to console him.

517
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,160
Hey, Dajiang,

518
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,800
are you leaving for the dock?

519
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,200
Tao is about to come pick me up.

520
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,960
Okay, then I won't see you off.

521
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,440
When I'm done with this busy period,

522
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,480
I'll come visit you in Thailand.

523
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,360
Make sure to bring her with you.

524
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,960
- Take care, Dajiang.
- Go ahead.

525
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,360
Let's go.

526
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,640
I'm a bit worried about Xiaolu.

527
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,720
He just got a call from Li Guangnan

528
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,960
and left in a hurry.

529
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,400
What's going on?

530
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,560
How about this?

531
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,720
You go ahead.

532
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,960
I'll go see him

533
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,350
and then head directly
to the dock to meet you.

534
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,640
At this moment,

535
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,320
will you leave me alone again?

536
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,800
This time, I absolutely won't

537
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,120
leave you alone.

538
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,400
I promise to be there

539
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,240
