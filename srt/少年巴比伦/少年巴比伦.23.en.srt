00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,760
It's been a while since you ate here,
hasn't it?

35
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,400
I used to find it odd.

36
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,060
Now, I haven't had it in a long time.

37
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,070
I even miss it a bit.

38
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,310
When you go back to Shanghai,

39
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,440
I'll ask the owner to pack a big portion
for you to take away.

40
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,400
Actually, I don't know why.

41
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,000
But this time coming back,
I don't feel like going back to Shanghai.

42
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,660
Really?

43
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,050
I get it.

44
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,190
The pace of life in Shanghai is so fast.

45
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,590
The pressure must be huge.

46
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,820
Consider days in Fucheng a vacation.

47
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,660
That's also pretty good.

48
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,090
Is the flavor too bland?

49
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,790
Add some of this seafood chili sauce.

50
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,120
I pickled it myself.

51
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,030
Sir, do you remember me?

52
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,190
On August 7, 1996, just one minute

53
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,490
to eight o'clock.

54
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,910
Wasn't it you two?

55
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,520
Hard to forget that.

56
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,650
Enjoy.

57
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,780
My dear,

58
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,030
look at my watch.

59
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,180
One minute

60
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,490
before 8 PM on August 7, 1996.

61
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,880
Remember this moment.

62
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,470
Because in the next minute,

63
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,280
I am about to become your boyfriend.

64
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,030
We were so silly back then.

65
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,960
Is being silly bad?

66
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,790
We did so many foolish things.

67
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,960
Right.

68
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,790
Back then,

69
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,110
together, we caught a pervert,

70
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,550
scared a German expert,

71
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,960
and even helped Afang
deal with Ding Dezhong.

72
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,520
It's been so many years.

73
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,640
Feels like it was just yesterday.

74
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,880
Right.

75
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,760
How could I forget her?

76
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,910
- Who?
- Afang.

77
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,980
After Afang left Fucheng,

78
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,880
she went to Guangzhou.

79
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,290
And then?

80
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,490
She became an agent
for foreign food brands in Guangzhou,

81
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,540
and she's thriving.

82
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,790
We could ask her for help.

83
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,930
Xiaolu,

84
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,530
I just checked the map.

85
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,470
From Fucheng to Guangzhou

86
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,280
is over a thousand kilometers.

87
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,640
If we hurry,

88
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,110
we can make it in over half a day.

89
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,250
Bai Lan,

90
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,490
with just that address above,

91
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,430
can you find her?

92
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,400
I think we should be able to.

93
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,450
Xiaolu says this is something
Afang had someone bring back

94
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,760
from Guangzhou before.

95
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,700
But you only have three days left.

96
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,420
If this trip to Guangzhou
doesn't work out,

97
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,760
you'll completely run out of time.

98
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,430
We don't have any other choice.

99
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,520
Right, here's the information
you asked for.

100
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,610
Thank you.

101
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,180
I'll leave the factory in your hands
while I'm away.

102
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,930
Don't worry.
If there's any news about Huang Qing,

103
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,960
I'll contact you immediately.

104

called me a thug,

189
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,320
This outfit suits him, right?

190
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Dajiang.

191
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,920
Go.

192
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,280
- Lu Dajiang.
- Dajiang!

193
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,400
Do you still think this is the past?

194
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,520
Look at you.

195
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,720
You're just a janitor now.

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
Still think you're Boss Ma?

197
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,720
It's the 21st century.

198
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,960
Boss Ma is outdated.

199
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,440
Get him!

200
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,560
- Dajiang!
- Ms. Tao!

201
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,400
Dajiang!

202
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,160
- Dajiang!
- Let's go.

203
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,320
Dajiang!

204
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,560
Dajiang!

205
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,480
Get Boss Hu out!

206
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
- He hit Boss Hu!
- Dajiang!

207
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,680
Ms. Tao, let's go!

208
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,280
Dajiang, stop hitting him!

209
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,720
You could kill him, Dajiang!

210
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,360
Let go! Stop hitting him, Dajiang!

211
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,520
You could kill him!

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,880
Dajiang!

213
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,360
- Ms. Tao!
- Don't touch me!

214
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,800
Thank you for today.

215
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,800
Have we really

216
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,520
become so estranged now?

217
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,720
You're hurt.

218
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,160
Let me take you to the hospital.

219
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,840
I'm fine.

220
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,880
I haven't finished my work.

221
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
I'm leaving now.

222
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Lu Dajiang.

223
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,040
The day you came back,

224
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,480
we threw a banquet for you.
Why didn't you show up?

225
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,240
Were you afraid to see me?

226
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,960
If you've forgotten me already,

227
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,680
why do you keep the letter I gave you?

228
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
Why keep the scarf I gave you?

229
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,680
Every day you pretend to clean,

230
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,760
right up to the hotel entrance.

231
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,440
Is the entrance

232
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,680
your responsibility? Answer me.

233
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Tao,

234
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,560
it's been so many years.

235
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,240
Why can't you let it go?

236
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,160
You left for Hong Kong without a word,

237
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,840
not even a goodbye.

238
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,120
Not even a goodbye!

239
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,280
What happened back then was my fault.

240
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,480
But now I'm just a janitor.

241
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,600
You shouldn't waste

242
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,560
any more time on me.

243
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,400
Can't you see it?

244
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,520
In these past few years in prison,

245
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,200
I've moved on

246
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,640
from the past.

247
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,720
Don't go!

248
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,440
Don't go!

249
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,960
Don't touch me!

250
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,400
What did you do?

251
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,440
What did you do?

252
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,440
Didn't you say you'd take me with you?

253
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,320
Weren't you going
to let me accompany you?

254
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,600
Why did you leave me behind?

255
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,760
You liar!

256
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,640
You big liar!

257
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,800
What did you do?

258
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:14,250
♪Memories never seem to cease♪

259
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,950
♪Staying in the day we met♪

260
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:26,910
♪Just let it be vague♪

261
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,960
Will you leave me?

262
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,440
(Guangzhou)

263
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,520
Hello.

264
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
We're here to see

265
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,240
Liu Fang, the general manager
of Xiaoran International Trade.

266
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,760
Do you two have an appointment?

267
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,920
No.

268
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,720
Sorry, you can't enter
without an appointment.

269
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,480
There seems to be no one named Liu Fang
in their company.

270
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,520
Are you looking for
Ms. Liu Yang instead?

271
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,760
Sorry, no.

272
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,120
Didn't you contact her?

273
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,160
I did,

274
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,440
but couldn't get through.

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,520
But she's our only lead.

276
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,560
We can only

277
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,680
try our luck.

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,880
We've wasted another day.

279
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,760
Just wait a bit longer.

280
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,920
What if she comes out after work?

281
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,920
Even if it's until tomorrow morning.

282
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,680
Look.

283
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,520
Do you see that star?

284
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,160
That one

285
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,720
is a weather-predicting star.

286
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,280
Though there are

287
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,720
dark clouds

288
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
everywhere,

289
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,240
as long as there's one star,

290
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,360
tomorrow will be a good day.

291
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,840
So,

292
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,440
before tomorrow comes,

293
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,360
let's not give up yet.

294
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,240
Didn't know you could read the skies.

295
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,040
Watched the stars too much. That's why.

296
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,320
Actually, on the day you drank too much

297
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,040
and asked me to buy more liquor,

298
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,840
I saw it all when I came back.

299
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,680
Though I don't like

300
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,640
that Mr. Huang,

301
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,600
it's good

302
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,760
that someone is taking care of you.

303
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
What are you laughing at?

304
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,200
You don't think

305
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,880
I'm involved with him, do you?

306
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,240
Isn't it?

307
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
Of course not.

308
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,960
Lu Xiaolu,

309
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,840
you're back with the liquor?

310
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,720
Here I come.

311
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,640
Coming.

312
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,320
Mr. Huang.

313
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,560
Are you okay?

314
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,560
I'm fine. Don't worry.

315
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,400
Good night.

316
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,200
It turns out

317
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,120
that I misunderstood.

318
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,080
Is that Afang?

319
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,080
Afang!

320
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,600
Xiaolu!

321
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,840
Afang!

322
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,680
Bai Lan!

323
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,480
I haven't been called Afang
for a long time.

324
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,960
No wonder you couldn't find me.

325
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,760
This is my new name.

326
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Lily Liu.

327
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,960
Haven't seen you in years.

328
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,600
You've changed a lot.

329
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,240
Of course.

330
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,080
But you two haven't changed.

331
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,280
Back in the factory,

332
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,560
I could see

333
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,520
you were made for each other.

334
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,120
Are you together now?

335
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,440
How's it going?

336
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,320
Married yet?

337
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,560
No.

338
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,640
You misunderstood.

339
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,200
We're just friends.

340
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,280
Sorry about that.

341
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,240
No worries.

342
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,440
So,

343
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,640
what brings you all the way here

344
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,920
to find me?

345
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,120
Xiaolu and I have started a project,

346
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,160
and we hope you can join us.

347
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,160
Take a look at the proposal first.

348
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,040
Food factory.

349
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,560
Here's the thing.

350
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,000
Since your company
deals with food trade,

351
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,240
this project

352
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,020
is really suitable
for collaboration with you.

353
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,280
Xiaolu,

354
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,320
Bai Lan.

355
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,600
Did you forget

356
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,400
how I left the food factory?

357
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,880
But now, the food factory

358
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,240
is different from before.

359
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,160
The leadership
has been completely changed.

360
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,360
The people you disliked are gone.

361
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,800
It's my company

362
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,120
that has taken over the food factory.

363
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,040
I am now the general manager.

364
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,000
Do you know why I changed my name?

365
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,480
It was to forget that

366
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,840
disgusting past.

367
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
I'm truly happy

368
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,560
to see you both again.

369
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,040
Back when I was down,

370
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,440
out of so many in the factory,

371
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,800
only you two sincerely stood by my side.

372
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,280
I remember

373
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,760
the favor I owe you.

374
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,800
But this factory,

375
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,120
I never want to have anything
to do with it again in my life,

376
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,880
let alone save it.

377
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,600
Moreover, I now prefer

378
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,120
developing new domestic brands.

379
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,920
The introduction of imported brands

380
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,640
is no longer the focus of our business.

381
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,960
Sorry.

382
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,720
I really can't help you.

383
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,560
It's okay.

384
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,440
It's okay.

385
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,240
Oh, by the way,

386
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,920
I brought you

387
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,360
a small gift this time.

388
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,040
Even if we can't collaborate,

389
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,440
we can still be friends.

390
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,160
Sure.

391
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,200
What gift did you bring for Afang?

392
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,960
I made some milk tea powder myself.

393
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,720
Just a little gift.

394
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,400
We need to hurry back,

395
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,880
or it'll start raining soon.

396
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,360
Didn't you say today
would be good weather?

397
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,520
It wouldn't rain.

398
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,360
If I hadn't said that,

399
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,720
maybe we would have
given up back there.

400
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,560
Even though finding Afang
wasn't very likely,

401
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,360
if we gave up ourselves,

402
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,400
then there really
would have been no hope.

403
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
We didn't accomplish anything,

404
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,920
yet you're still so happy?

405
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,360
I don't know.

406
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,600
I just feel like today

407
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,640
is the best day I've had
in the last five years.

408
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,600
Even if there's a storm ahead,

409
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,800

Yes.

Is the clay pot rice
in Guangzhou delicious?

441
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,800
Only Qin Juan in the factory

442
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,440
knows about my trip to Guangzhou.

443
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,200
You had someone follow me?

444
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,400
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

445
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,480
You're not only my boss

446
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,560
but my opponent at the gambling table.

447
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,200
I don't need
to report everything to you, right?

448
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
Now, do you still think

449
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,680
you have a chance to win?

450
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,160
Why not?

451
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,720
You gave me five days.

452
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
Now, there's one day left.

453
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,240
The deal is off.

454
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,080
Why?

455
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Does winning matter that much to you?

456
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,600
Of course, it's important.

457
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,280
Initially, I just wanted to reclaim

458
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,400
what was mine.

459
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,200
But now, I've gambled the entire factory.

460
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,480
I've made promises to the workers.

461
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,080
I can't betray them.

462
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,480
What if you lose?

463
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,200
Do you know?

464
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,520
I really don't want you to lose.

465
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,880
Stop cooperating with Lu Xiaolu.

466
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,080
Don't let him
drag you back to your old life.

467
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,480
Even if the food factory is gone,

468
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,040
I can promise you to invest

469
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,200
to cover the workers' losses.

470
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,320
You don't sound like yourself.

471
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,120
What do you mean?

472
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,600
You once told me.

473
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,640
As a businessman,

474
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,640
you would never invest money
without seeing a return.

475
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,080
As a wise person,

476
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,000
you would never favor any opponent.

477
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,200
But look at your methods now.

478
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,120
You've become weak

479
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,120
yet arrogantly harsh.

480
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,640
You know

481
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,280
that developing real estate

482
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,960
is a major trend in the domestic market.

483
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,320
Once this option is laid out,

484
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,360
the food factory
will have no other way out.

485
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,120
You can't change this era,

486
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,320
nor can you save those people.

487
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,680
Go back to Shanghai now,

488
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,360
and I can pretend
none of this ever happened.

489
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,080
If you're still not satisfied,

490
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,400
you can choose

491
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,800
to stay by my side

492
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,000
with a different status.

493
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,080
We can both win.

494
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,360
Don't touch me.

495
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,040
Mr. Huang,

496
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,560
I think I need to reassess you.

497
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,040
I was worried about you,

498
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,080
so I came to check.

499
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,560
You don't look well.

500
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,360
What did Huang Qing say to you?

501
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,760
Are you fired?

502
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,000
If only that were true.

503
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,320
I'll take you back to the hotel to rest.

504
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,680
Boss Hu,

505
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,160
begin the operation.

506
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,120
I'll take you up.

507
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,120
No need.

508
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,560
I'm just staying one last night.

509
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,120
Tomorrow, I'll change to another hotel.

510
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,040
It's awkward

511
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,280
running into Huang Qing.

512
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,040
Then rest well.

513
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,520
Don't worry about those trivial matters.

514
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,680
I'll take care of everything.

515
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,040
Tomorrow morning, I'll pick you up

516
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,320
and take you to the new hotel.

517
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,360
Okay.

518
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,320
Either help the workers

519
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,520
reclaim what's theirs

520
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,200
or find them a new path.

521
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,680
You won't go back

522
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,960
until these matters are settled,

523
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,280
right?

524
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,000
Right.

525
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,560
I'm really, really, really glad

526
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,160
that we can work together again.

527
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,720
I'm glad too.

528
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,040
Hope we can work well together.

529
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,600
Hope we can work well together.

530
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,480
Hello.

531
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah.

532
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,200
This is she speaking. Who's that?

533
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,080
Mrs. Mancini.

534
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,920
How did you get my number?

535
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,320
Oh, yeah.

536
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,440
That was a gift for you.

537
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Hope you like it.

538
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,920
I beg you pardon?

539
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,120
What do you mean by that?

540
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,080
Lu Xiaolu,

541
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,560
how dare you mess
with Mr. Huang's woman?

542
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,560
Do you have a death wish?

543
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm giving you a friendly warning

544
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,040
out of the years of friendship

545
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,000
I had with your cousin.

546
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,920
Stay away from Miss Bai.

547
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,880
The food factory's affairs

548
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,360
are not for you to meddle in.

549
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,560
If you get in the way
of us making money,

550
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,920
I'll throw you into the sea
to feed the fish.

551
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,480
Let's go.

552
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,680
I didn't fire you.

553
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,840
I just wanted you to return to Shanghai.

554
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,600
As long as you stay

555
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,620
out of the affairs in Fucheng,

556
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,120
our relationship
can be the same as before.

557
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,680
What relationship?

558
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,320
For Lu Xiaolu?

559
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,440
For no one else.

560
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,840
I just don't want to be deceived anymore.

561
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,680
I am your mentor,

562
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,440
and also your boss.

563
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,280
I have my business plans.

564
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,760
It's not really deception.

565
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,200
What about Mr. Mancini?

566
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,840
Why did he leave?

567
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,680
What are you trying to say?

568
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,000
Coincidentally,

569
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,040
I had sent a gift to his wife.

570
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,600
She called yesterday to thank me,

571
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,200
and she told me something

572
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,280
I didn't know.

573
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,600
I admit I kept it from you

574
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,320
because I knew

575
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,240
you would struggle
to accept the sudden halt

576
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,440
of the food factory's reform plans.

577
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,720
I hoped it would be easier for you.

578
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,320
You seem not to understand

579
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,640
the problem between us.

580
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
Over these five years,

581
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,940
you've blocked me
from the position I wanted to pursue,

582
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,480
saying it was for my good.

583
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,600
You drove away my business partners,

584
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,960
also claiming it was for my good.

585
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,240
You kept plans from me,

586
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,880
making all my efforts a joke,

587
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,980
still claiming it was for my good.

588
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,360
In your eyes, what am I?

589
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,280
A puppet to be manipulated

590
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,240
or a fool to be played with?

591
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,880
To others,

592
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,300
I try to be
as straightforward as possible.

593
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,720
I did this because...

594
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,760
Because I care about our relationship,

595
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,920
and I care more about how you see me.

596
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,320
This car is company-provided,

597
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,640
not personally mine.

598
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,880
Take it.

599
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,520
I've said it before.

600
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,560
You're not entitled to leave

601
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,840
until I fire you.

602
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,680
Mr. Huang,

603
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,120
make it clear.

604
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,480
This time, I'm the one firing you.

605
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,280
Are you really sure about this?

606
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,200
I've never been so sure

607
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,760
in these five years.

608
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,080
Hello, Dr. Bai.

609
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,960
Dajiang?

610
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,000
Where's Xiaolu?

611
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,600
Why didn't you tell me?

612
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,640
Trying to hide it from me?

613
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,520
Dajiang,

614
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,160
look at this tactical boot.

615
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,560
Doesn't it look familiar?

616
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,640
Kind of.

617
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,160
Who beat you up like this?

618
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,440
It's okay.

619
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,240
I've always been tough.

620
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,960
It's just some superficial wounds.

621
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,480
Nothing serious.

622
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,760
I want to show you something.

623
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,200
I wrestled this off

624
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,200
from one of those guys yesterday.

625
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,560
Boss,

626
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,440
stop hitting him,

627
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,600
or we could kill him.

628
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,040
Look at the sole.

629
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,680
Doesn't it look familiar?

630
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,080
Same sole.

631
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,720
Boss Hu has always had a grudge
against my brother.

632
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,600
It's one thing for him to hit me,

633
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,640
but why did he hit my master?

634
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,160
I guess Boss Hu and Huang Qing

635
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,120
are in this together now.

636
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,040
Dr. Bai,

637
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,640
could you please take care of him?

638
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,280
I need to step out.

639
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,080
Dajiang,

640
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,240
where are you going?

641
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,280
