Amidst the fragrance of osmanthus,

the golden autumn has arrived.

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,370
To celebrate the annual
Mid-Autumn Festival,

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,370
on the evening of September 27th,

at Dajiang Skate Land,

30
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,540
the annual Youth Workers' Fellowship
Grand Party will be held.

31
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,380
- On this beautiful moonlit night,
- Let's go.

32
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,570
let's come together.

33
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,330
Everyone is welcome to participate.

34
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,060
Xiaolu.

35
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,220
What are you hiding?

36
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,700
Nothing.

37
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,880
Hey, let me tell you some good news.

38
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,650
The doctor said
I can leave the hospital tomorrow.

39
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,420
Well, I'll tell you some good news too.

40
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,570
Tomorrow, I'll be back to work
at the SLI Bureau.

41
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,770
Really?

42
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,220
Congratulations!

43
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,610
Weren't you unhappy about me
returning to the Bureau?

44
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,890
Why are you so happy now?

45
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,100
I've come around.

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,660
You can do what you enjoy.

47
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,610
That is pretty great.

48
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,570
After getting beaten up,

49
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,820
you've become nicer.

50
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,450
The Mid-Autumn Festival
is around the corner.

51
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,940
How do you plan to celebrate it?

52
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,610
I don't.

53
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,060
Why?

54
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,890
Ever since I went to the orphanage,

55
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,360
I have never celebrated
Mid-Autumn Festival.

=Episode 8=
=It's All the Moon's Fault=

57
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,100
You've really grown up.

58
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,940
You have become capable enough

59
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,890
to pick up a fight now.

60
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,450
You are really something.

61
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,260
It's okay. I'll protect you.

62
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,290
I've only been on a business trip

63
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,820
for a few days,

64
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,330
and look at the trouble you've caused.

65
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,610
Mom,

66
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,890
I know you're worried about me, right?

67
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,540
I've told you, it's just a minor injury,

68
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,420
nothing serious.

69
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,100
- I'm worried about you?
- Don't resist.

70
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,940
In your dreams!

71
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,730
If I had known
you would fight with someone,

72
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,770
I would have broken your leg.

73
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,170
Hey! What are you doing?

74
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,010
What are you doing?

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,380
You can't hit me!

76
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,860
Oh, who's here?

77
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,420
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Lu.

78
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,260
Hey, why are you here?

79
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,610
I'm here to visit Xiaolu.

80
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,100
Mr. Lu, I also came to visit Xiaolu.

81
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,330
You came to visit Xiaolu too?

82
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,290
Xiaolu is at home. Come in, please.

83
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,860
- Mrs. Lu.
- Come in, please.

84
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,490
- You two are so beautiful.
- Hello, Mrs. Lu.

85
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,730
Hello, hello.

86
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,050
I gave you a warning before you fought,

87
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,610
but you didn't even tell me
you left the hospital.

88
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,490
- I...
- That's right.

89
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,780
I cooked for you in the past few days,

90
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,810
and you didn't tell me either.

91
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,340
It's not a good thing after all.

92
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,610
I can't let you two
hold a party for me, right?

93
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,250
- We would have done that.
- We would have done that.

94
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,250
These are calcium supplements for you.

95
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,220
Mr. and Mrs. Lu,
these supplements are for you.

96
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,250
Oh, thank you so much.

97
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,170
Oh my, this girl is really considerate.

98
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,060
Mr. and Mrs. Lu,

99
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,130
supplements are all deceitful.

100
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,040
It's best to rely on food for nutrition.

101
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,690
You see, all-natural.

102
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,020
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Oh, quickly, quickly.

103
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,100
Pick that up.

104
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,770
Over there, over there.

105
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,220
Which one do you like?

106
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,580
This one is not bad.

107
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,810
- Take it away!
- This one is also good.

108
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,780
Where is it, where is it?

109
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,020
Give it to me.

110
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,170
They both look good.

111
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,460
- You like both of them?
- Yes.

112
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,320
Come in.

113
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,240
Mom.

114
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,960
Why are you here?

115
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,000
I brought you a little surprise.

116
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
I am busy with budgeting.

117
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,480
What is it?

118
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,440
Is the bureau's Mid-Autumn Festival party
under your jurisdiction?

119
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,320
Yes.

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,640
Why?

121
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
I want to bring a friend.

122
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,720
She's not from the bureau
or a family member.

123
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,640
Is that okay?

124
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,680
You should ask your dad.

125
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,880
He has more authority than me.

126
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,120
Every time I ask my dad for something,

127
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,400
he always talks about principles.

128
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,440
He would never help me.

129
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,280
Mom,

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,800
you also have the power.

131
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,120
You're almost a deputy bureau chief.

132
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,360
You can easily help me.

133
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,800
Your girlfriend?

134
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,960
Well, not quite yet.

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
Soon, though.

136
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,320
This is a big deal.

137
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160
Bring her to me,

138
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,640
I'll take a look at her.

139
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,280
Mom, it's too early for that.

140
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,840
You're always so serious,

141
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,960
you might scare her off.

142
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,520
Can you just treat her
like an ordinary friend?

143
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,680
Our family is special, you know.

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm a department head,
and your dad is a bureau chief.

145
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,160
If she's not decent enough,

146
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,520
how can we introduce her to anyone?

147
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,720
She is a university graduate,

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,760
definitely decent enough.

149
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,480
If you feel embarrassed,

150
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,440
I'll ask Ding Dezhong to handle it.

151
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,360
- But...
- Alright, go back.

152
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,480
Mom,

153
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,800
stop staying at the guesthouse.

154
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,040
You and Dad have been in a cold war
for so long.

155
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,280
You should go home.

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
Stay out of adult matters.

157
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,800
Oh, my son.

158
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,800
Let me pour you a cup of tea.

159
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,320
Oh Mom, it's fine, I'll pour it myself.

160
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Let me do it for you.

161
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,600
Let me do it.

162
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,760
I'll do it.

163
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,160
Okay, okay.

164
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,320
Let's have a chat.

165
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,600
Mom,

166
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
why did you suddenly invite me to dinner

167
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,480
and pour me tea?

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,080
It's pretty scary.

169
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,800
Just tell me

170
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,880
what you want.

171
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,040
What plans are you making?

172
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Tell Mom.

173
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,600
Who are you planning to invite

174
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,440
to the Mid-Autumn Festival party?

175
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,960
Mom, don't worry about this matter.

176
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,200
Whatever.

177
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
I know who

178
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,280
you will invite anyway.

179
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,240
Who is it?

180
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,360
You think you can keep

181
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,560
your little thoughts from me?

182
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,160
I not only know

183
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,840
who you want to go with,

184
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,880
but I also know

185
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,920
you've liked her for a long time.

186
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,400
You're just one step away from dating,

187
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,760
aren't you?

188
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
Mom,

189
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,720
who's been telling you these things?

190
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
Listen to Mom, okay?

191
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,520
You and her,

192
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,440
even though one is a worker

193
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,400
and the other

194
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,880
is like a junior cadre,

195
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,240
as long as you two are in love,

196
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,400
you will get my blessing.

197
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,760
Really.

198
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,520
But...

199
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,520
I don't even know

200
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,360
if she likes me.

201
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,080
Of course she likes you.

202
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,640
You're my son!

203
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,640
You're my son.

204
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,280
Your dad and I are experienced.

205
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,000
Just by looking at

206
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
these things,

207
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,320
we can tell what's going on.

208
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,040
Really?

209
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,960
Of course.

210
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,480
If she didn't like you,

211
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,720
why would she agree to come?

212
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,360
Come here?

213
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,320
She agreed to come!

214
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,040
This way.

215
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,680
Director Ding,

216
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
why the secrecy

217
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,000
over a work dinner?

218
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,640
Anyway, you'll benefit from it.

219
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
It's a great thing.

220
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,080
Who is it exactly?

221
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,640
Why not just go in and find out?

222
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,200
Come on.

223
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Let me tell you,

224
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,160
I...

225
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
Juan!

226
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,040
You are finally here.

227
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,280
Come here, sit down.

228
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Let me tell you something.

229
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,560
Guess what?

230
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,600
Yesterday,

231
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,280
I ran into your Aunt Dong.

232
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,480
If it weren't for

233
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,280
Aunt Dong telling me,

234
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,840
I would still be in the dark.

235
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,880
Hey, Mom,

236
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
what did she tell you?

237
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,920
Aunt Dong said that

238
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,680
Juan often goes to your dorm

239
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,520
to find you.

240
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,920
One time, she even went
in the middle of the night.

241
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,640
Is that true?

242
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,120
Yeah, she did come. So what?

243
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,400
As young people,

244
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,880
you should express your love boldly.

245
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,080
Is that right, Juan?

246
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,840
Juan, which year were you born in?

247
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,040
I was born in '77.

248
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
Oh, really?

249
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,440
Xiaolu was also born in '77.

250
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,080
So, you're both born
in the year of the snake.

251
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,840
What should I call you two?

252
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,320
Golden snakes!

253
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,920
Golden snakes.

254
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,400
More like rotten snakes

255
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,880
- or crazy snakes.
- What are you saying?

256
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,040
How old are you this year?

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
23,

258
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,840
about the same age as Zhigang.

259
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,050
I heard you're a university graduate.

260
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,680
That's right.

261
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
We only have a few university graduates

262
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,280
in our factory.

263
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,840
She must have been a model student
since childhood.

264
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,560
Ma'am, you misunderstood.

265
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,160
I was not a good student

266
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,680
since childhood.

267
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,680
Look,

268
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,560
young girls nowadays are modest.

269
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,640
I'm a university graduate,

270
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,350
but I only got a graduation certificate,

271
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,520
not a degree certificate.

272
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,240
What do you mean?

273
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,960
Before graduation, I was dissatisfied with
the school's unfair distribution

274
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,080
and clashed with the leadership.

275
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,560
An accident happened.

276
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,080
What kind of accident?

277
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,120
I hit the principal's head

278
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,880
and ended up

279
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,880
in jail because of that.

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,920
Do you want to know more?

281
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,280
I'll tell you everything.

282
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,600
If I remember correctly,

283
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,760
you and Xiaolu were

284
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,280
middle school classmates, right?

285
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,640
Yes.

286
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,080
Good.

287
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,440
You know each other well.

288
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,800
Don't take what he said to heart.

289
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,560
He's been mischievous since childhood

290
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,760
and has a bad mouth.

291
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,960
- And he doesn't know
- Thank you, Mrs. Lu.

292
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,440
how to express love.

293
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,360
He doesn't even know

294
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,000
how to invite a girl to dance with him.

295
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,800
I can do that.

296
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,560
You can do what?

297
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,240
I can be your Mid-Autumn Festival
dance partner.

298
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,740
Come on.

299
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,000
Good.

300
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,160
Why are you making that face?

301
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,760
Are you happy or upset?

302
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,000
Mom,

303
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,480
I have to clarify something today.

304
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,200
Little Pouter did come to our dorm,

305
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,960
but I don't think it was for me.

306
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,520
The person who really wanted to invite her

307
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,410
as a dance partner wasn't me,

308
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,440
it was Li Guangnan.

309
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,240
And

310
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,640
there is someone I want to invite.

311
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,120
- But that girl is...
- I don't want to know.

312
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,000
Stop talking.

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,840
Hey, Juan!

314
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,960
Juan!

315
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,520
Why did you say such things

316
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,680
in front of her?

317
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,960
Mom, what did I say?

318
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,600
You're also colleagues.

319
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,200
You shouldn't hurt her like that.

320
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,500
What are you still standing there for?

321
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,680
Go find her

322
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
and apologize to her.

323
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,680
Oh no,

324
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,200
I've made a mistake

325
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,920
and caused trouble.

326
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
But now Bai Lan has changed.

327
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,680
She's not so impulsive anymore.

328
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,560
Since she came to our factory,

329
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,720
she excels in all aspects,

330
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,880
which is why

331
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,920
she caught a young talent

332
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,640
like Zhigang's attention.

333
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,960
Exactly,

334
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Bai Lan is doing

335
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,920
very well in the factory.

336
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
- Am I right?
- Yes.

337
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,960
Director Ding,

338
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,920
Secretary Bi,

339
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,120
are you serious?

340
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,440
Have you forgotten why I was

341
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,760
sent to the boiler room?

342
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,040
Bai Lan, stop talking nonsense.

343
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,880
Let her speak.

344
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,000
Ma'am,

345
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,320
there's a situation
you may not understand.

346
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,120
I provided a fake mental illness certificate

347
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,800
for our female worker, Afang.

348
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
That's why I was punished
and sent to the boiler room.

349
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,640
- You...
- Why did you issue

350
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,160
a fake mental illness certificate?

351
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,560
Well,

352
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,960
on Secretary Bi's instructions.

353
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
- I...
- Because if I hadn't done it,

354
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,640
Afang's public accusation

355
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,960
in front of the whole factory

356
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,640
that Director Ding mistreated her

357
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,280
would be believed by all.

358
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,840
Our family in Fucheng

359
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,440
is respected.

360
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,880
How could someone with bad manners,

361
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,120
low education,

362
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,920
bad character,

363
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
and a stained past

364
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,680
be worthy of my son?

365
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,120
Mom,

366
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,640
although Bai Lan made mistakes before,

367
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,320
she's doing well now.

368
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,520
Admitting fault and changing

369
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,510
for the better is commendable.

370
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,560
Mom...

371
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,760
What right do you have

372
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,800
to criticize Bai Lan?

373
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,520
Lu Xiaolu, what are you doing here?

374
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,000
You...

375
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,800
What you call a stained past

376
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,640
is standing up for the weak

377
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
and upholding justice.

378
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,600
Is that a stain on life?

379
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,160
It's a shining moment!

380
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,640
People like you with narrow-minded views

381
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,840
will never understand.

382
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,840
What are you talking about?

383
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,880
Do you know who you are talking to?

384
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,440
I'll say that no matter who is here!

385
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,680
What an arrogant young man.

386
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,840
Who are you?

387
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
Where are you from?

388
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,680
I'm Lu Xiaolu,

389
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,960
Bai Lan's boyfriend.

390
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,880
Lu Xiaolu,

391
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
are you crazy?

392
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,520
Bai Lan doesn't have a boyfriend.

393
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,840
Is he your boyfriend?

394
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,760
No.

395
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,560
Mom, Mom.

396
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,640
He's just a troublemaker in the factory,

397
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,600
a filthy rascal.

398
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,600
He thinks he's the boyfriend
of every girl!

399
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,680
Are you out of your mind?

400
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,000
Why are you glaring at me?

401
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
It looks like you are not welcome here.

402
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,080
Please leave.

403
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,840
This is a family gathering.

404
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,160
Get out now.

405
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,240
Get out!

406
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,240
Although Lu Xiaolu isn't my boyfriend,

407
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,080
he's my best friend.

408
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,050
We are the same kind of people.

409
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,320
He's a rascal, and I'm a female rascal.

410
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,720
We'll leave together.

411
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,080
Let's go.

412
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,040
Hey, Bai Lan.

413
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,120
Bai Lan!

414
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,320
You two, stop.

415
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,760
Sit down.

416
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,480
Oh, Mrs. Ding,

417
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,240
look what's happened.

418
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,160
This is...

419
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,360
It's fine.

420
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,160
Let's eat.

421
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,680
Let's eat. Let's eat.

422
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,520
Come on.

423
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,520
Eat.

424
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,420
The people from the Bi family
are so snobbish.

425
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,640
Who are they

426
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,800
to talk about you like that?

427
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,920
So, taking a bottle of wine from them

428
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,040
isn't excessive.

429
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,560
We can share it.

430
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,040
Not bad.

431
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,520
You are drinking too much.

432
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,400
Bai Lan, let me ask you.

433
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,040
Why didn't you admit earlier

434
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
that I'm your boyfriend?

435
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,320
What about that night

436
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,160
when we got drunk?

437
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,440
What was that all about?

438
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,520
Do I mean

439
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,600
absolutely nothing to you?

440
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,200
You are still thinking about that night?

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,960
That night...

442
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,920
That night I drank too much,

443
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,800
so I accidentally kissed you.

444
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,840
I apologize to you.

445
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,840
What do you mean you apologize to me?

446
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,480
Do I need your apology?

447
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,080
That night,

448
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,520
you not only kissed me.

449
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,880
We also...

450
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,680
The finger-guessing game?

451
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,360
We...

452
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,360
Don't tell me you think we did that.

453
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,600
Hey, why are you laughing?

454
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,680
Because you are so silly.

455
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,360
How am I silly?

456
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,760
Two buddies!

457
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,160
Three stars!

458
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,520
Four fortunes!

459
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,040
Five champions!

460
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,600
Six successes!

461
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,000
Seven surprises!

462
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,480
Eight immortals!

463
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,920
Nine rings!

464
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,720
Ten... Ten...

465
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,960
Ten...

466
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,360
Bai Lan.

467
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,200
Bai Lan.

468
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,720
Bai...

469
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,280
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

470
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,200
How did I suddenly become...

471
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,400
Become...

472
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,720
Become what?

473
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,760
Become...

474
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
Become...

475
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,520
I just feel...

476
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,960
I just feel so sad inside.

477
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
Stop whining.

478
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,680
You are luckier than me.

479
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,440
At least that kiss of yours

480
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,680
is real.

481
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I have been liking Little Pouter
for so many years,

482
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,760
but I haven't even...

483
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,000
I...

484
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,240
I haven't even touched

485
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,600
the tips of her fingers.

486
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,640
What right do you have

487
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,680
to criticize Bai Lan?

488
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,160

Do you know how many people
I have turned down

543
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,080
just to wait for his confession?

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,040

00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,800
I've never had any artistic talent
since I was a child.

552
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,320
What if I embarrass myself

553
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,400
in front of him at the dance tomorrow?

554
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,840
It's okay, I'll teach you.

00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,680
invite her to dance.

566
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,600
I did invite her.

567
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,120
But she's not coming.

568
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,360
How many times did you invite her?

569
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,480
Don't tell me you gave up

570
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,500
just after being rejected once.

571
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Once is already enough.

572
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,520
I care about my dignity, you know.

573
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,940
Do you think I'm someone
who cares about dignity?

574
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,400
Of course. You care about
your dignity the most.

575
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,160
Then let me tell you,

576
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,240
I'm willing to give up

577
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,680
all dignity

578
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,520
for the girl I like.

579
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,280
That's a man's true nature.

580
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,480
It's not embarrassing at all.

581
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,000
Love

582
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,590
is something you have to
fight for yourself.

583
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,520
You need to be brave.

584
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,720
Don't be like me,

585
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,640
regretting not doing

586
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,880
what I should have done

587
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,680
so I'm still single.

588
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,600
Alright,

589
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,640
hurry up and come in.

590
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,360
Sorry for calling you out

591
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,400
so late tonight.

592
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,800
But this party tonight

593
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
is organized by the city.

594
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,760
People from all walks of life in Fucheng

595
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,620
and many foreigners are attending.

596
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,800
Don't worry,
I'll be with you the whole time.

597
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,760
Bai Lan,

598
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,000
are you still mad about that dinner

599
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,840
that night?

600
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,840
Secretary Bi,

601
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,440
I hope there won't be any more

602
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,800
private dinners like that in the future,

603
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,680
especially without my knowledge.

604
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
It's all my mom's fault.
She's too impatient.

605
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,160
I told her not to do that.

606
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
Don't take what she said to heart.

607
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,720
You know that's not what I meant.

608
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,800
Also,

609
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,720
could you please stop trying

610
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,320
to irritate me with Lu Xiaolu?

611
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,880
I know

612
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,760
you can't really like him.

613
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,920
After all, with your status,

614
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
you are way out of his league.

615
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,000
Actually, I don't mind

616
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,040
if you two become friends.

617
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,320
After all, being friends

618
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,760
doesn't mean being together.

619
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,880
And,

620
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,520
when you try to use him to irritate me,

621
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,200
I actually feel a little sweet inside.

622
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,200
Because that means

623
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,120
you at least

624
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,240
care about me.

625
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,600
That's the only reason you do it.

626
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,880
Am I right?

627
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,720
Can we talk about work?

628
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,840
Alright,

629
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,000
let's talk about work.

630
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,160
What's wrong?

631
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,040
Do I look weird?

632
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,040
This is for me?

633
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,800
Are you wearing your dad's suit?

634
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,600
No.

635
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,400
I love you.

636
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,480
Do I look like Leon Lai Ming?

637
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,400
Did you put pig fat on your hair?

638
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,480
No.

639
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,840
Don't forget your task today.

640
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,360
Don't worry.

641
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,000
I won't let you lose face.

642
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,240
(Skate Land
Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration)

643
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

644
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,120
are you ready?

645
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,920
I declare...

646
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,600
I declare...

647
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,480
I declare...

648
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,000
The 1996...

649
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,600
Dajiang.

650
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,600
Dajiang?

651
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,240
The 1996

652
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,920
Golden Peacock Mid-Autumn Festival
dance party

653
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,080
begins now!

654
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Why can you do this?

655
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,660
I learned it at the Youth Palace
when I was a child.

656
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,600
Not bad, right?

657
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,080
Together!

658
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,320
Cool!

659
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,200
I have great confidence
in the future of Fucheng.

660
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,600
But currently, your infrastructure

661
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,120
is not enough.

662
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,440
You should spend more effort on it.

663
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,520
He has a lot of confidence

664
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,600
in Fucheng's future,

665
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,680
but currently our infrastructure

666
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,840
isn't sufficient.

667
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,080
He thinks
we should spend more effort on it.

668
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,920
He's absolutely right.

669
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,200
Tell him that

670
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,400
this has indeed

671
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,240
been the focus of the city's work
in recent years.

672
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Mr. Bi totally agrees with you.

673
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,840
And he said the infrastructure has been

674
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,160
the main focus by the city these years.

675
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Very well, Mr. Bi.

676
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,240
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

677
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,280
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

678
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,960
My father.

679
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,840
Nice to meet you and your son.

680
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,720
You've been waiting, huh?

681
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,320
I saw the note.

682
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,520
You usually act so serious,

683
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,300
I never expected you could write that.

684
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,280
What note?

685
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,880
Oh, come on.

686
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
I'll wait for you over there.

687
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,360
Xiaolu.

688
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,480
Xiaolu.

689
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,000
- Hey, Debao.
- What are you thinking about?

690
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,360
The prizes are out.

691
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,320
First prize is

692
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,040
a year pass for the Dajiang Skate Land,

693
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,080
second prize is

694
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,400
a box of exquisite five-nut mooncakes,

695
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,600
and third prize is a box of animal crackers.

696
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,880
That's it?

697
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,200
Music!

698
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,520
Xiaolu, see you later!

699
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,920
Have you ever had animal crackers?

700
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,400
Animal crackers?

701
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,280
Yeah,

702
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,840
when I was at the orphanage,

703
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,800
if we behaved well,

704
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,280
the teachers would give us

705
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,600
animal crackers.

706
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,960
There were tigers,

707
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,680
elephants,

708
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,320
monkeys,

709
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,320
all sorts of them.

710
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,000
Those kids favored by the teachers

711
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,520
had countless animal crackers,

712
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,360
but I never got a single one.

713
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,480
Later, I got so anxious that

714
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,200
I said to them,

715
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,360
"Let's play a game together.

716
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,080
If you lose,

717
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,420
you have to give me the crackers."

718
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,400
And then?

719
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,320
Of course I won,

720
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,080
but they just refused

721
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,840
to give them to me.

722
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,480
So you know what I did?

723
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,000
What did you do?

724
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
I beat them up

725
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,600
one by one

726
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,040
and took all their crackers.

727
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,520
But then I realized

728
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,080
the animals were all gone because

729
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,280
all the crackers were broken into pieces.

730
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,440
Interesting story, huh?

731
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,880
Dajiang.

732
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,800
Where did you just go?

733
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,040
I went to the bathroom.

734
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,640
Can I borrow this?

735
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,920
Take it.

736
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,320
Thank you.

737
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,240
I'll be right back.

738
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
I won't close

739
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,960
before you take her here.

740
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,880
Alright.

741
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,680
Xiaolu!

742
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,360
Why are you leaving?

743
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,280
Why don't you dance with me?

744
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,880
Just go have fun.

745
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,680
Go on, go on.

746
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,120
Thanks!

747
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,080
You're welcome.

748
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,120
I didn't expect you

749
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,160
to dance pretty well.

750
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,640
Thank you.

751
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,880
Oh, by the way,

752
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,240
in addition to the dance

753
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,280
I just did today,

754
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,920
I also know the cowboy dance.

755
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,840
And recently, I've been learning

756
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
the tap dance.

757
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,600
When we were in school,
I didn't know anything.

758
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,360
Only you were willing
to help me on stage.

759
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,000
Now I'm better, right?

760
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,840
I've made progress.

761
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,280
By the way,

762
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
thank you, Li Guangnan.

763
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,240
Thank you

764
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,920
for helping me shine

765
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,560
in front of Lu Xiaolu.

766
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,440
But I know,

767
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,080
if someone doesn't like you,

768
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,520
no matter how pretty you dress

769
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,240
or how well you dance,

770
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,400
they'll still like someone else.

771
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,080
Even if Lu Xiaolu doesn't like you,

772
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,200
you're still you.

773
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,080
There will be someone else
in this world who likes you,

774
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,000
just like me.

775
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,740
I still remember

776
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,960
when I first saw you

777
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,280
in junior high,

778
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,560
I thought, "My goodness,

779
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,640
how can there be such a beautiful girl
in this world?"

780
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
At that moment, I made a vow.

781
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,600
I said, "Someday, I will

782
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,200
make this girl my girlfriend."

783
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,800
Little Pouter,

784
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,320
will you be my girlfriend?

785
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,560
Li Guangnan,

786
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,360
I will never like you.

787
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,920
I,

788
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,040
Qin Juan,

789
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,200
have always been one of the top students

790
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,920
in my class since I was a child.

791
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,440
Even in the factory, I am a cadre.

792
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,840
The person I like
should be the most handsome

793
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,130
and dazzling in the crowd.

794
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,800
And what about you?

795
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,600
When I was kicked out of my house,

796
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,280
did you have a place to take me in?

797
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,040
Why do you think you can like me?

798
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,960
I need a home.

799
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,000
I want to have a house.

800
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,720
Can you give me that?

801
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,720
You're being vain.

802
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,680
I am!

803
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,800
I actually liked you! I'm such a fool!

804
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,960
Then don't like me.

805
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,600
Guangnan,

806
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,840
that bottle can be exchanged for money.

807
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,800
I have plenty of money.

808
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,920
Okay.

809
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,600
Tired?

810
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,440
What do you think

811
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,440
about this wine party?

812
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,880
It's not an exaggeration to say

813
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,160
it's the highest standard
in the whole city, right?

814
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,800
Bai Lan,

815
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
you have the opportunity

816
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,960
to meet the highest level of people
in Fucheng here.

817
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,840
You also

818
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,320
have the chance to become one of them.

819
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,760
Secretary Bi,

820
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,120
I'm just a small translator,

821
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,800
I can't reach that level.

822
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,800
Bai Lan,

823
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,280
I know

824
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,120
you have opinions about me,

825
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,440
but I don't mind.

826
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,560
I don't mind being rejected by you
again and again,

827
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,640
and I don't mind

828
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,760
you always give me a bad face.

829
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,360
Because I know

830
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:09,760
you would never be content

831
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,480
with a low worker like

832
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,320
Lu Xiaolu.

833
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,200
I believe...

834
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,160
I don't look down
on the working class by the way.

835
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,880
I just think

836
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,840
you and he are so different.

837
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,560
You have talent, beauty,

838
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,560
ambition,

839
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,370
and there are things

840
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,680
that only I, Bi Zhigang, can give you.

841
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,680
What about him?

842
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,480
What can he give you?

843
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,680
A modified bicycle?

844
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,280
Speaking of which, it's funny.

845
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,240
Do you remember last time we fought?

846
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,600
He actually came to me in advance,

847
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,920
wanting to make a bet.

848
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,440
If I agree to this matter,

849
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,600
you will admit defeat?

850
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,960
I keep my word.

851
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,190
The situation has already escalated.

852
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,360
You admit defeat?

853
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,560
Can your maintenance team agree to that?

854
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,920
Admit defeat without a fight,

855
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,600
how boring.

856
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,200
If this gets out,

857
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,560
others will think I, Bi Zhigang,

858
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,960
am a sore winner.

859
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,120
What do you want then?

860
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,680
If I win,

861
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,520
let Bai Lan leave the boiler room

862
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,200
and return to the SLI Bureau.

863
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,280
If you win?

864
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,560
Bai Lan can return to the SLI Bureau,

865
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,680
but you

866
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,520
have to lose.

867
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,040
That idiot,

868
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,520
he knew that even if I...

869
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,160
- I would definitely...
- Bi Zhigang!

870
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,440
You rat!

871
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,200
I have said it many times,

872
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,720
you can't enter without an invitation.

873
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,160
Alright, I won't go in.

874
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,520
Can you at least help me call someone?

875
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,200
You can't go in.

876
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,640
Go, go, just leave.

877
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,520
Director Bi's son, Bi Zhigang,
you know him, right?

878
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,840
I'm looking for a tall girl.

879
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,040
She should be around him.

880
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,880
Could you take a look for me?

881
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,840
- Xiaolu.
- Bai Lan.

882
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,720
What are you doing here?

883
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,480
- I...
- Stop talking. Come with me.

884
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,600
Bai Lan, you...

885
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,840
You...

886
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,000
You will regret this.

887
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,880
Look at her.

888
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,840
She's going to step on his feet.

889
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,200
It's okay, it's okay.

890
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,040
There it goes.

891
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,400
And this guy dares to dance with her?

892
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,880
I've been observing all night.

893
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,080
Let me tell you...

894
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,680
Look, look.

895
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,120
This girl is the queen of stepping on feet.

896
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,120
She's stepped on over 20 people tonight.

897
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,200
Over 20?

898
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,040
No wonder no one

899
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,800
danced a complete song with her.

900
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,120
Forget it, let's go.

901
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,080
Alright, let's go.

902
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,960
Go on.

903
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,280
Forget it, Dajiang.

904
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,320
What are you afraid of?

905
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,520
Next,

906
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,760
the last performance of the evening.

907
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,760
No, no, I can't do it.

908
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,600
Dajiang.

909
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,720
Xiaoying.

910
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,600
Music!

911
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,200
One, two, three!

912
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,880
Bravo!

913
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,080
I can dance now.

914
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,520
Why were you at the wine party?

915
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,280
I...

916
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,720
I just happened to pass by.

917
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,040
You're lying.

918
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,480
I'm not lying.

919
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,880
You are lying.

920
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,000
And you said
you couldn't beat Bi Zhigang.

921
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,720
You intentionally lost to him

922
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,440
to make me return
to the SLI Bureau, right?

923
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,600
I really didn't.

924
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,040
I just couldn't beat him.

925
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,880
Alright, spill it.

926
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,280
What else did you lie about?

927
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,120
I lied about a lot of things.

928
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,200
Which one do you want to hear?

929
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,680
Then start from just now.

930
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,160
Just now?

931
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,480
When I said I just happened

932
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,560
to pass by the wine party?

933
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,280
I admit I lied.

934
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,320
I was angry and anxious.

935
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,760
I saw you in Bi Zhigang's car.

936
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,200
I didn't know where you went.

937
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,880
I asked many people and finally
found that place.

938
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,840
But the security at the door

939
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,680
didn't let me in.

940
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,480
Said I didn't have an invitation.

941
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,280
I could only wait at the entrance,
waiting and waiting.

942
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,720
Finally you came out.

943
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,160
Yes,

944
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,080
I know it's too late now
for anything I say.

945
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,360
But I still want to try one last time.

946
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,760
Can I invite you to dance?

947
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,760
You...

948
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,880
Are you okay?

949
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,640
It's not too late.

950
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,560
Not too late?

951
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,040
Let's go, to the skating rink.

952
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,280
(Skate Land)

953
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,920
Do you remember when I said

954
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,320
I never celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival?

955
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,760
Today is my first time.

956
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,520
I will never forget your words.

957
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,240
From now on,
every Mid-Autumn Festival,

958
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,040
I will be with you.

959
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,480
You're not alone anymore.

960
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,320
You have me,

961
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,680
and friends.

962
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,940
And in the future, you'll have a family,

963
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,200
with many children.

964
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,720
I hope that

965
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,480
when we grow old,

966
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,360
you'll still remember today.

967
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,640
That there was someone named Lu Xiaolu

968
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,120
who spent your first
Mid-Autumn Festival with you.

969
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,640
Can I invite you to dance?

970
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,920
