You're finally back.

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,080
The dormitory is about to close.

You've been waiting for me?

28

Why are you hanging out
with Bi Zhigang again?

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,080
So what?

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,560
I saw you in his car.

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,160
I also saw the two of you...

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,520
This is my private matter.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,530
It's none of your business.

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,640
How can you say
it's none of my business?

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,920
What about what happened between us?

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,440
Wasn't that a major life event?

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,990
What happened between us?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,120
Do I have to take responsibility for you
for life?

39
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,200
Naive.

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,120
Immature.

41
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
Go back and get some sleep.

42
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,080
Li Guangnan,

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,280
am I naive?

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,800
Both foolish and naive.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,040
Oh, Lu Xiaolu.

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,160
You've encountered an expert.

47
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,880
What do you mean?

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,520
Do you know there's a type of woman

49
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,880
in martial arts novels

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,360
like

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,720
Madam Ma from "Demi-Gods and
Semi-Devils"

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,360
or Lin Xian'er
from "Legend of Dagger Lee"?

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,880
Women like them

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,320
are never serious

55
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,680
with men.

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,240
They use men as stepping stones.

57
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,680
Their beauty is their weapon.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,400
Bai Lan isn't that kind of person.

59
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,080
Well, it seems like you don't know.

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Bai Lan was transferred to
the Second Light Industry Bureau

61
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,800
to work as Bi Zhigang's father's translator.

62
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,440
I'm not making this up.

63
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,360
My mom told me.

64
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,950
It's been spreading
around the women's dormitory,

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,180
and you're the only one who doesn't know.

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,760
Well, that's good in a way.

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,520
At least she doesn't have to suffer
in the boiler room.

68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
Suffer?

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,080
Bi Zhigang can make Bai Lan suffer?

70
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,320
Bi Zhigang

71
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
isn't a good person,

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,960
but he indeed has a good father.

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,160
Oh, if I were a woman,

74
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,160
I'd go for him.

75
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,840
What I mean to say is,

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,960
if you compare yourself to Bi Zhigang,

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
he has a background, education,

78
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
and a good father.

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,600
What do you have?

80
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,240
I...

81
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,520
You do have one advantage.

82
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,520
What is it?

83
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,200
Good looks.

84
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,560
Isn't that enough?

85
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,600
It's usually sufficient,

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,080
but not for the girl you want to impress.

Director Bi,

90
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,070
he says he's very thankful
for your warm hospitality.

91
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,000
He's had a great time these past few days

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,400
and expresses his gratitude.

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
Okay, then tell him

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
if that's the case,

95
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,440
he shouldn't leave yet.

96
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,280
Stay a few more days.

97
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,480
Mr. Bi said, "Why don't you stay
a few more days here?

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,560
Don't rush to leave."

99
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,560
I would love to stay here,

100
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,840
but I still need to go.

101
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,360
He is thankful

102
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,840
but he has to go.

103
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,960
He needs to go back to persuade

104
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,000
his business partner to help us,

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,040
so he has some work to do.

106
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,280
Thank you again.

107
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,040
He said thank you again.

108
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,280
Okay.

109
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,440
No problem.

110
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,520
- Thank you sir. Goodbye.
- Thank you.

111
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,840
- See you soon.
- Okay.

112
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,680
Thank you.

113
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
Miss Bai, thank you.

114
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,480
- See you.
- Thank you very much.

Miss Bai,

117
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,100
you've done a great work
these past few days.

118
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,890
I'm really a little reluctant to let you

119
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,590
go back to the food factory.

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,630
This is my duty.

121
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,280
Oh, this is the meeting summary

122
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,080
from yesterday with the foreign guest

123
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,320
that I organized.

124
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,400
That was fast!

125
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,040
Good, you really live up to

126
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,560
being a university graduate from Beijing.

127
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,640
If you keep working at the food factory,

128
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,860
it would be a waste of talent.

129
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,240
I hope you work hard,

130
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,480
seize opportunities,

131
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
and I see great potential ahead for you.

132
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,120
Thank you for your approval.

133
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,400
Well then, Director Bi,
I'll head back to the factory now.

134
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,380
You are going already?

135
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,920
Yes. Goodbye, Director.

136
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Alright. Bye.

137
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,800
Secretary Bi,

138
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
what brings you here?

139
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,880
Oh, nothing.

140
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
Just checking in on you.

141
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,560
Are you settling in well?

142
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,680
Everything's fine.

143
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,960
Well,

144
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
about that night at the hotel,

145
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,880
I really didn't mean anything bad.

146
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,380
I hope you don't misunderstand.

147
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,640
I understand.

148
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,040
It must have been Lu Xiaolu
trying to cause trouble.

149
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,240
It was my idea.

150
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,560
It has nothing to do with him.

151
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,080
I tried so hard to persuade my dad

152
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,480
to let you come here
and be the translator.

153
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,320
Is that so?

154
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,760
But I saw the application notice

155
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,720
posted on the bulletin board
at the food factory.

156
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,600
I volunteered.

157
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,280
The Bureau selected based on merit.

158
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,360
What does it have to do with you?

159
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,920
I heard that

160
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
the Bureau has a fully funded slot

161
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,880
to study for a master's
in Shanghai this year.

162
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
There's only one slot,

163
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,200
and many people are

164
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,040
competing for it.

165
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,720
My dad said

166
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,840
they must choose the most capable person

167
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,050
to make everyone trust the result.

168
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,440
Of course,

169
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,360
you don't need to worry.

170
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,160
I'll do everything I can

171
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,320
to help you.

172
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,320
But it also depends on
your own capabilities.

173
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,040
I don't think I need your help.

174
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,360
I believe in my own abilities.

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,400
Right?

189
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,480
What are you cooking?

190
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,740
My dad asked me to...

191
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,920
Why are you so insistent on cooking?

192
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,000
He insisted on doing it.

193
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,680
This is my job, you know.

194
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,800
Come on, give it to me.

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,320
Okay, good boy.

196
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
Hey, come back.

197
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,760
Alright,

198
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,640
keep going.

199
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,870
Dad,

200
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,760
have you heard of that strange syndrome?

201
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,880
What syndrome?

202
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,680
It is called Stockholm Syndrome.

203
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,600
I know.

204
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,840
The victim falls in love
with the perpetrator, right?

205
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,520
Don't you think you have this syndrome?

206
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,760
Alright, son.

207
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,240
You've grown up.

208
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,040
You know how to use sarcasm now.

209
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,760
Dad,

210
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
that's not what I meant.

211
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,360
But the truth is

212
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
since I was little,

213
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,990
you did whatever Mom asked.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,690
You never fought back or argued.

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,920
Are you really so afraid of Mom?

216
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,120
Afraid?

217
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,520
You don't understand.

218
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,600
Let me tell you,

219
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,360
there's no man in this world

220
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
who's afraid of his wife.

221
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,240
This is about respect.

222
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,720
It's about love, tolerance

223
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,760
and trust.

224
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,560
Do you understand?

225
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,760
Well, let me ask you another question.

226
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,720
Go ahead.

227
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,480
If Mom gets close to

228
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,830
someone you really dislike

229
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,160
and does things you don't understand,

230
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,560
what would you do?

231
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,440
You should ask her.

232
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,280
Why are you asking me?

233
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,920
I already asked her.

234
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,400
She refused to answer

235
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,680
and claimed it had nothing to do with me.

236
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
How did you ask her?

237
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,960
Did you ask calmly

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
or assertively?

239
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,120
How can you stay calm

240
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,560
when something like that happens?

241
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
This matter

242
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,760
is very simple. It...

243
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,440
It sounds like
an interesting conversation.

244
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,760
What are you talking about?

245
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,800
Nothing.

246
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,680
About relationship issues?

247
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,320
No.

248
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,160
You asked your dad
about relationship issues?

249
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,800
Your dad is like a fool in that aspect.

250
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,800
What does he know?

251
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,280
You should ask me about that.

252
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm right here.

253
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Let me tell you

254
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,160
what love is.

255
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,320
Love is all about trust.

256
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
What did you just say?

257
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,280
You questioned her?

258
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,280
How could you question her?

259
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,320
If you lose trust,

260
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
love will run away,

261
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,440
right?

262
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,560
Tell me.

263
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,080
Are you dating someone?

264
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,680
No.

265
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,600
Tell me what happened.

266
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
Which girl is it?

267
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,040
- Mom.
- Well...

268
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,240
Stop asking if he doesn't want to say.

269
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,760
Remember, it's only about

270
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,800
trust.

271
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,200
Look at me.

272
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,720
I trust your mom completely,

273
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,120
right?

274
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,320
Of course.

275
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,360
Trust.

276
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,080
You understand?

277
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,800
Mom, Dad just lied to you earlier.

278
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,280
He asked me to watch the stove.

279
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,480
Hey, you brat, how can you...

280
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,240
I have always done this alone.

281
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,480
That brat.

282
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,520
So stingy.

283
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,280
Hey, hey, why is she here?

284
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,720
She's a big shot at the SLI Bureau now.

285
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,320
Why did she
come to our canteen to eat today?

286
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,640
To show off of course.

287
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,400
Hey, did you hear?

288
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
Bai Lan is now

289
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,240
part of the Bi family.

290
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,880
She might marry Bi Zhigang this year.

291
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,680
Huh? So fast?

292
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,920
They have to. She's pregnant.

293
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,240
Dr. Bai, you don't want to eat with us?

294
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,800
She thinks we workers are dirty.

295
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,280
That's true.

296
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,280
We workers

297
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,560
have no money,

298
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,560
no power,

299
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,400
no education background.

300
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,080
We can't compare with cadres.

301
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,640
Am I right, Dr. Bai?

302
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,480
Hey, Xiaolu!

303
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,000
Watch your mouth.

304
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,240
What are you doing?

305
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,800
I dare you to say that again!

306
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,960
Hey, Xiaolu, Xiaolu.

307
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,960
Calm down, calm down.

308
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,200
Isn't she your girlfriend?

309
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,050
She dumped you,
and you are still defending her?

310
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,840
What a shame.

311
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,840
Let go of Lu Xiaolu! What are you doing?

312
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,400
What are you doing? What are you doing?

313
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No, Xiaoying, Xiaoying.

314
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,520
- Xiaoying, Xiaoying. Enough.
- What...

315
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,160
What does it have to do with you?

316
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,520
You can't bully him

317
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,960
on my turf.

318
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,600
Bai Lan,

319
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,880
why are you leaving?

320
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,950
You just work there as a translator.

321
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,920
Why not explain?

322
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,640
Is explaining useful?

323
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Even you thought that was true.

324
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,520
I...

325
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
Dr. Bai,

326
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,880
my dad said
there's a event in the afternoon

327
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,960
and he needs you to participate.

328
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,080
Got it.

329
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,440
I'll come pick you up then.

330
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,480
A toad wants to marry a white swan.

331
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,120
You're just a lowly worker.

332
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
Focus on your work

333
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,360
instead of daydreaming

334
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,220
and hindering others' pursuit of happiness.

335
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,520
We workers earn money honestly
with our skills.

336
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,080
What does Bi Zhigang have?

337
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
Just a big mouth and his dad.

338
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,040
Nothing to be proud of.

339
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,120
That's right.

340
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,400
He's just bullying people

341
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,760
with borrowed authority.

342
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,760
Big Feet,

343
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,920
I'll borrow your bike.

344
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,280
Sure.

345
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,240
What do you need it for?

346
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,520
Thanks, but don't ask.

347
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,040
Xiaolu, I'm not done yet.

348
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,480
(Gongyuan)

349
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,120
Lu Xiaolu,

350
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
are you going
to pick up Bai Lan on that bike?

351
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,680
It's really hard for you.

352
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,960
Dr. Bai,

353
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,160
I'm here to pick you up.

354
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,860
You don't have to trouble yourself.

355
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,840
It's no trouble.

356
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,040
I heard a new Western restaurant
opened in the west of town

357
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,120
with authentic flavors.

358
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,200
Let's go check it out together.

359
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
Bai Lan,

360
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,520
I'm here to pick you up.

361
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,480
Let's go.

362
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,080
Hey, wait...

363
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
You are just...

364
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,840
But my...

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,360
What is the problem?

366
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,320
I heard Bi Zhigang say

367
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,200
he wants to take you out
for Western food.

368
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,040
It seems so.

369
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,760
I could also do that.

370
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,880
You know what?

371
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,520
There's a new place on East Street

372
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,800
- called K... KFC.
- Kentucky Fried Chicken?

373
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,640
Yeah, it's really popular.

374
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,640
The line stretches all the way

375
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,160
from East Street to the City Hall.

376
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
That's not Western food.

377
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
It's fast food.

378
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,560
Really?

379
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,320
Then,

380
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,840
when I get my year-end bonus,

381
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,600
I'll treat you to the most authentic
Western food in Fucheng.

382
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,440
How about that?

383
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,480
No need.

384
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,680
You workers earn money the hard way.

385
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,240
Didn't you say there's a place
with the best fish ball soup

386
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
in the world?

387
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,000
Let's go there.

388
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,360
Sure, it's settled then.

389
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,680
Mr. Niu!

390
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,680
Mr. Niu!

391
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,680
This car has been
having trouble starting lately,

392
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,520
and the left rear tire is a bit flat.

393
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,640
Can you have someone fix it?

394
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,160
That's not our responsibility.

395
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,720
You need to go
to a professional repair shop.

396
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
This is the SLI Bureau's vehicle
for foreign guests.

397
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,800
Isn't this

398
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,560
a matter for us?

399
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,990
No,

400
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,040
we can't handle it.

401
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,280
Where is Lu Xiaolu?

402
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,600
He's good at this.

403
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,680
Let him fix it.

404
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
Xiaolu has

405
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,720
something else to do today.

406
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,000
Really busy.

407
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,240
Well, I'm telling you...

408
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,440
He's really busy.

409
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,560
You...

410
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,640
How about this? I can fix the battery.

411
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I'll do it.

412
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,520
Stop!

413
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,480
Today, only Lu Xiaolu

414
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,280
is allowed to fix this car.

415
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,000
- Xiaolu is...
- Alright.

416
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,920
I'll fix it.

417
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,400
Xiaolu.

418
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,440
Master,

419
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,560
leave it to me.

420
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,160
Tell me about the problem.

421
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,000
Check this tire first.

422
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,320
Let me tell you,

423
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,000
be careful.

424
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,360
This is a high-end vehicle,

425
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,640
all imported.

426
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,850
If you mess it up, I doubt
you can afford to pay for it.

427
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,160
High-end

428
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,640
but useless trash.

429
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,040
My bike's wheels work better than this.

430
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,000
Lu Xiaolu,

431
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,760
I forgive you
for your ignorant remarks just now.

432
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,520
After all, with your background,

433
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,680
you probably haven't had much exposure
to imported cars,

434
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,240
and

435
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,440
for someone like you,

436
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,980
even if you spend your whole life
fixing things in this factory,

437
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,880
you probably can't even afford this tire.

438
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,720
Bi Zhigang,

439
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,840
- watch your words.
- That's right.

440
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,920
What do you mean by that?

441
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,840
Do you look down on us repair workers?

442
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,080
What are you guys doing?

443
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,360
This is between him and me.

444
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,720
None of your business.

445
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,760
Get back to work!

446
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,680
Lu Xiaolu,

447
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,360
I'm warning you,

448
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,520
stop showing up in front of Bai Lan.

449
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,720
Sometimes people are like cars,

450
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,520
some are imported, some are domestic,

451
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,280
and some are just a mishmash of junk.

452
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,800
You're right.

453
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,240
People, like cars,
come in different varieties,

454
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,880
but it's not about money;

455
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,800
it's about whether your heart is clean.

456
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,960
Don't think you're special just because

457
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,330
your dad is a director.

458
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,720
I'm telling you,

459
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,120
in my eyes,

460
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
besides putting on airs

461
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,640
- What are you doing?
- and faking it,

462
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,280
you're nothing.

463
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,720
I'll...

464
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,380
- What are you doing?
- Did you forget who you are?

465
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,480
You want a fight?

466
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,760
Let me tell you,

467
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,400
no matter whose son you are,

468
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,720
during work hours,

469
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,860
you can't mess around in my repair shop.

470
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,290
You think you can
just do whatever you want

471
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,120
because you're a cadre?

472
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,960
Exactly!

473
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
Alright, you guys.

474
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,320
You've got a lot of people

475
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,480
and you're ganging up on me, huh?

476
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,000
Hey, don't say we're ganging up on you.

477
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,600
You can also find people to back you up.

478
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,960
We'll have a fair fight

479
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,440
and see who's the coward.

480
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,840
Alright, let's fight!

481
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,160
I have plenty of friends,

482
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,000
and let me tell you,

483
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,520
you can't afford to offend them.

484
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,200
You mean those sons of cadres

485
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,320
from your big yard?

486
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,360
- Bring them on!
- I'll...

487
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,160
I'll teach them a serious lesson.

488
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,880
- Okay, alright.
- Just go!

489
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,160
Remember what you said.

490
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,680
This matter is not over!

491
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,920
Not over!

492
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,520
Hey, Xiaolu is here.

493
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,080
Xiaolu, we've heard about it.

494
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,160
Heard about what?

495
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,200
Your repair team
will have a fight with Bi Zhigang.

496
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,640
It spread so quickly.

497
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,800
I heard that guy was

498
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,080
scared out of his wits.

499
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,320
Good job!

500
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,920
Bi Zhigang has been doing bad deeds,

501
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,400
we've all had enough of him.

502
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,720
You stood up for us workers,

503
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,480
and we won't forget it.

504
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,640
If you need anything,

505
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,520
just let us know.

506
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,960
- Exactly!
- Yes!

507
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
I apologize for last time.

508
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,640
I was wrong.

509
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,360
We thought you were teaming up with them

510
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,560
because of Bai Lan.

511
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,200
It was all a misunderstanding.

512
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,880
I told you Xiaolu wasn't like that.

513
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,360
Get out of the way!

514
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,280
These are all for you.

515
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,040
You think I'm a pig?

516
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,680
These are your favorites.

517
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,640
Oh, right.

518
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,080
Delicious.

519
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,240
Take them.

520
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,120
You need to be full to have strength.

521
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,800
These are your favorites.

522
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,320
She's not only good at cooking

523
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,560
but also fighting.

524
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,560
What a special girl.

525
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,240
She is really one of a kind.

526
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,160
Lu Xiaolu and the repair team

527
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,600
are a bunch of barbarians.

528
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,200
Why would you fight with them?

529
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,640
Secretary Bi!

530
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,880
Don't drop the ball tomorrow.

531
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,840
We're all waiting for you to get beaten up
by the repair team.

532
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,480
- What are you saying?
- Hey, Secretary Bi.

533
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,640
- Say that again!
- Secretary Bi, please.

534
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,840
Don't leave, don't go!

535
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,480
Did you see that?

536
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,240
I didn't want to fight,

537
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,400
they forced me into it.

538
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,600
But can you really win against them?

539
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,040
- I...
- Those are just rough people.

540
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,360
I just can't swallow this.

541
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,640
Even if I can't win,

542
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,560
I have to fight.

543
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,040
Secretary Bi,

544
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,800
if you don't want to fight,

545
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,880
I can

546
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,560
find a way to resolve this.

547
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,070
- You?
- But

548
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,040
since the incident with Afang last time,

549
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,800
I've been feeling mistreated

550
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,960
and I haven't been valued at all.

551
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,880
I mean...

552
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,600
- Fighting is uncivilized after all.
- That's right.

553
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,160
If you can calm this trouble,

554
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,650
it'll make up for your previous actions.

555
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,720
I'll definitely speak to my father

556
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,720
on your behalf.

557
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,160
I'll do my best.

558
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,000
Children fighting is normal.

559
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,760
Why do you care?

560
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,880
How can this be children fighting?

561
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,100
He's fighting against the only son

562
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,080
of Deputy Director Bi of the SLI Bureau.

563
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,200
It doesn't matter whose son he is.

564
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,660
He'll get beaten up if he deserves it.

565
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,520
You...

566
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,040
Your cousin is too young to know better,

567
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
but you, as his older cousin,

568
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,240
shouldn't act like him.

569
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,840
Let me tell you, this fight can't happen.

570
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,420
If it does, it'll affect your skating rink.

571
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,480
You don't understand?

572
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,720
Secretary Hong has always been

573
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,040
dissatisfied with your use

574
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,920
of factory land for the skating rink.

575
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,720
Now that he's the factory director,

576
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
if his higher-up's son gets beaten up...

577
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,440
Think about it.

578
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,800
Do you still want the skating rink?

579
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,640
Alright,

580
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,960
Ding,

581
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,000
I'll handle this.

582
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,720
Don't take it lightly.

583
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,600
Talk to him nicely.

584
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,080
- I have to go.
- Okay.

585
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,320
Easy.

586
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Each of us

587
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,000
- will wield a stick like this.
- Let me see.

588
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,240
Bi and his friends

589
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,560
will be in serious trouble.

590
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,720
No sticks.

591
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,550
My cousin said we should not

592
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,720
go all out in a fight.

593
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,920
It's a hidden rule.

594
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,240
We're all from the same factory.

595
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,560
What if someone gets seriously hurt?

596
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,800
Blind weapons can cause accidents.

597
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,680
But just now...

598
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,840
I think you're right.

599
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,320
Me too.

600
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,320
I think

601
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,200
we can do that this weekend.

602
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,760
We should settle this
sooner rather than later

603
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,040
to prevent further complications.

604
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,160
Sure, whatever.

605
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,200
You seem to understand brawling
pretty well.

606
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,280
- Bro.
- Dajiang.

607
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,600
Why are you here?

608
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,560
I have so many good qualities,

609
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,840
why only learn

610
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,480
how to fight like me?

611
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,040
It's not like that.

612
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,400
For the sake of a woman,

613
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,680
you're arranging fights now,

614
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,400
causing a huge commotion.

615
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,160
You've really grown up.

616
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,120
- Dajiang...
- Dajiang,

617
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
it's not about a woman.

618
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,280
Bi Zhigang has gone too far.

619
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,440
He looks down on us workers,

620
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,120
and we can't stand for it.

621
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,280
It's true!

622
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,960
- He's right.
- It's true!

623
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,080
That's why

624
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,320
I've brought my brothers here.

625
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,120
Let's see who dares to touch my cousin.

626
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,440
Let's go!

627
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,680
- Thank you, Dajiang!
- Thanks!

628
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,360
- Let's go.
- Dajiang is great!

629
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,640
Xiaolu.

630
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,960
Why are you here?

631
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,360
Director Bi asked me
to check if the car was fixed.

632
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,400
The foreign guests are waiting.

633
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,460
There was just a minor issue

634
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,460
with the battery connection,

635
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,360
but it's fixed now.

636
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,400
I'm asking you,

637
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,400
did you arrange to fight with Bi Zhigang?

638
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Even you know about it?

639
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,480
But strictly speaking, this isn't just a fight.

640
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,240
It's a battle for justice.

641
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,640
That's still a fight.

642
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,280
Anyway, no matter what,

643
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
you must come

644
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,520
and see

645
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,280
how I knock Bi Zhigang down.

646
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,800
I won't come.

647
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,050
Why?

648
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,600
Anyway, I'm telling you,

649
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,120
if you fight,

650
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
I won't talk to you anymore.

651
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Hey, have you ever learned to drive?

652
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,560
That way!

653
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,800
Why can't you
solve problems with your brain?

654
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,120
Resorting to violence

655
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,240
is something barbarians do.

656
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,360
Whatever you say.

657
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,480
Just consider me a barbarian.

658
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
I can't back out at this point.

659
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,600
- You must fight?
- Yes.

660
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,120
Foolish!

661
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,000
Selfish!

662
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,640
Vain!

663
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,960
You narcissistic men,

664
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,160
am I some kind of object?

665
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,960
Whoever wins gets me as a prize?

666
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,280
Your competition with Bi Zhigang

667
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,720
is utterly absurd from start to finish.

668
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,200
It's not like that, Bai Lan.

669
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
I don't mean that.

670
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,000
Bi Zhigang is really up to no good.

671
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,000
Not only does he look down on us workers,
but he deliberately placed you in the SLI Bureau

672
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
just to take advantage of you.

673
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,950
I voluntarily went
to the Second Light Industry Bureau.

674
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,360
I like English, I like translation.

675
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,200
I don't like the boiler room.
What business is it of yours?

676
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,560
Get off!

677
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,880
Get off!

678
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
When I sent it for repair,

679
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,600
it just had a minor issue with starting.

680
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,080
How did it end up like this

681
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,200
when it came back?

682
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,950
This is the car for hosting foreign guests.

683
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,040
It's very delicate.

684
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,360
Director, I'm sorry.

685
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,400
It was my carelessness.

686
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,200
Please give me some more time.

687
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,440
I'll find a way to fix this.

688
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,760
Bai Lan,

689
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,280
normally you seem

690
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
quiet and composed.

691
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,960
I always feel you are reliable.

692
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,120
Listen,

693
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,160
you can't be the type of girl

694
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,600
who treats everything lightly

695
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,760
and does things recklessly.

696
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,520
- I...
- Listen,

697
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,880
I'll put the issue of the training quota

698
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,440
on hold for now.

699
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,760
I think you need to go back to the factory

700
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,120
and gain some experience.

701
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,850
I want to see how you perform.

702
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,480
(Sunday morning at 8:00, Shipyard)

703
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,360
(Sunday morning at 8:00, Shipyard
Get a stretcher ready)

704
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,760
(Sunday morning at 8:00, Shipyard)

705
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,510
(Sunday morning at 8:00, Shipyard
Get a stretcher ready)

706
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,160
Get a stretcher ready.

707
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,600
♪Life fools me♪

708
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,480
♪Deceives me♪

709
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
♪Troubles me♪

710
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,480
Enough, Big Feet, stop singing

711
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,440
and start training seriously.

712
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,560
We are going to fight,

713
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,520
not sing.

714
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,840
Xiaolu,

715
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,160
I'm not going to train.

716
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,160
It's too late anyway.

717
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,240
Maybe I can cheer you guys.

718
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,120
I'm not going.

719
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,360
If you dare to back down,

720
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,270
- I'll hit you right now. Do you understand?
- What are you doing?

721
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:33,760
Stop, come here.

722
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,360
- What are you doing?
- Why are you here?

723
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,880
Xiaolu, you can't fight this battle.

724
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,720
You can't win.

725
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,280
Who sent you as a mediator?

726
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,200
Even if you fight, you won't win.

727
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,520
What do you mean?

728
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,960
The battle hasn't even started yet.

729
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,000
How can you

730
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,080
deflate our morale?

731
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,720
When I was
delivering files in the office,

732
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,600
I overheard Bi Zhigang

733
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,080
making a phone call to the police.

734
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,680
- The police?
- Yes.

735
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,560
I eavesdropped on him.

736
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,040
He told the police that the workers

737
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,510
were going to bring weapons
to start a fight.

738
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,280
He wanted the police to arrest all of you.

739
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,080
How can that jerk play dirty like this?

740
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,800
The more he does this,

741
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,680
the less we can back down.

742
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,800
Do you all want to get caught?

743
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,240
It's okay.

744
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,640
Let's change the location later

745
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,550
and have our brothers
keep an eye on Bi's people.

746
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,240
We won't let them leak information.

747
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,640
Yes, our factory people

748
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,880
can help us keep an eye on Bi's people.

749
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,280
Are you guys crazy?

750
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,480
Don't worry, Little Pouter.

751
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,800
The fight between men

752
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,740
is about facing challenges
and never backing down.

753
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,040
Well said.

754
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,560
Then did you know the SLI Bureau
fired Bai Lan?

755
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,480
She's starting to work
in the boiler room today.

756
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,080
- Really?
- I saw the notice

757
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,560
in the office with my own eyes.

758
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,960
And have you considered

759
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,000
why she was demoted?

760
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Everyone in the factory knows

761
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
who you are fighting for.

762
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,620
Do you think the leadership doesn't know?

763
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,840
You still have time to call it off now.

764
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,560
If you really fight and cause some result,
Bai Lan won't escape unscathed.

765
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,960
Enough. Stop it.

766
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,920
Oh, stop.

767
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,760
This is not your first time here.

768
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,680
You don't need me
to teach you again, right?

769
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,720
You need more practice.

770
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,040
She's pretty good at it already.

771
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,120
Quickly.

772
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,040
- Let's take a break.
- Take a break.

773
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,660
Have you heard this old saying?

774
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,880
It's said that the higher

775
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,480
a person climbs,

776
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,000
the harder they may fall.

777
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh, Doctor Bai,

778
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,520
you must understand
this principle too, right?

779
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,560
It's not easy at the top, right?

780
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,240
Practice more.

781
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,280
Tired already?

782
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,200
Hurry up
or you can't finish it even tomorrow.

783
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,920
Hurry up. Come on.

784
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,240
What are you waiting for?

785
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,240
Staring at me won't help you.

786
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,720
Move!

787
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,020
The battle is happening on Sunday.

788
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,360
Are you so excited that you can't sleep?

789
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
I feel the same way.

790
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,800
Should I

791
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,200
play the guitar for you

792
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,960
to calm you down?

793
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,320
♪Should I give up, admit defeat?♪

794
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,160
Stop!

795
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,680
The battle between experts

796
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,760
are more about mental state.

797
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,960
Don't disturb Xiaolu.

798
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,680
Got it.

799
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,400
♪Should♪

800
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,240

I'll stop singing.

804
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,080
Ding Dezhong! I'm telling you!

805
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,160
I will definitely leave the boiler room!

806
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,920
You narcissistic men,

807
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,680
am I some kind of object?

808
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,000
Whoever wins gets me as a prize?

809
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,760
I like English, I like translation.

810
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,240
I voluntarily went to the SLI Bureau.

811
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,200
What business is it of yours?

812
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,680
Dajiang,

813
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,200
no matter what happens today,

814
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,360
don't start fighting

815
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,560
without my permission.

816
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,600
Promise me.

817
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,400
Did you hear the news?

818
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,920
Lu Xiaolu is having a showdown

819
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,480
with Bi Zhigang this morning.

820
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,080
Is it true?

821
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,520
Who do you think will win?

822
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,600
It's definitely Lu Xiaolu.

823
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,720
Bi Zhigang is so frail

824
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,820
that I could push him over easily.

825
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,440
Well, you never know.

826
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,960
He's also a man.

827
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,200
You can't say that.

828
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Although Bi Zhigang is...

829
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,080
The fight is about to start!

830
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,120
Let's go watch.

831
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,060
- Let's go.
- Come on.

832
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,320
Who are you betting on to win?

833
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,240
This whole thing today

834
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
started because of my

835
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,600
personal grievances with Bi Zhigang.

836
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,440
To avoid dragging down others,

837
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,240
I propose settling it

838
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,760
with a one-on-one.

839
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,800
- One-on-one?
- Xiaolu.

840
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,300
- You don't have to do this.
- Xiaolu.

841
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,280
You don't have to say that.

842
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,300
We're not afraid of him! Hit him!

843
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,560
Quiet!

844
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,840
No need for a one-on-one.

845
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,280
Today's fight

846
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,320
is between Lu Xiaolu and Bi Zhigang.

847
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,160
Since this is their decision,

848
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,040
no one should object.

849
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,810
Let me make one thing clear beforehand.

850
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,200
During their one-on-one,

851
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,450
no one is allowed to intervene.

852
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,240
Whoever breaks this rule,

853
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,040
I won't approve it.

854
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Understood?

855
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,040
Understood.

856
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,280
Okay.

857
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,840
Debao.

858
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,080
Debao.

859
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,440
Xiaolu!

860
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,920
- Is he okay?
- He's bleeding.

861
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,160
He went all out!

862
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,200
Xiaolu! Xiaolu!

863
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,640
Xiaolu, fight back, Xiaolu!

864
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,080
Fight back, Xiaolu!

865
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,000
Get up!

866
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,680
You big mouth!

867
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,000
That's too much!

868
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,120
- Get out of the way!
- Get up and keep fighting!

869
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,240
Stop fighting!

870
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,280
Why are you here?

871
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,840
Xiaolu.

872
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,040
Let me see.

873
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,240
He brought this upon himself.

874
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,280
It's not my fault.

875
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,550
Get lost!

876
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,960
Clearly, I won.

877
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,400
If anyone should get lost, it's you all.

878
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,120
Why should I get lost?

879
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,560
Get lost!

880
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,600
Why should I listen to you?

881
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,800
Why not?

882
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,200
Fine.

883
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,480
Alright.

884
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,080
Take care of your injuries.

885
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,880
This feels so good!

886
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,840
Get lost now!

887
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,920
- Get lost!
- Xiaolu!

888
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,160
Xiaolu!

889
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,480
- Xiaolu, Xiaolu!
- Xiaolu, Xiaolu!

890
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,560
You guys...

891
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,000
You guys...

892
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,480
You're not allowed to bully Bai Lan.

893
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,360
Xiaolu.

894
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,680
You are awake.

895
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,800
Young lady,

896
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,680
why are you crying?

897
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,080
What did you call me?

898
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,960
Young lady.

899
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,760
What's wrong?

900
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,440
Don't you recognize me?

901
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,080
You seem quite familiar.

902
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,800
You wouldn't happen to be

903
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,440
my dream lover, would you?

904
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,280
It hurts here?

905
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,040
Let me take a look.

906
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,640
Here?

907
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,840
It's probably a rib issue.

908
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,320
A rib issue?

909
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,320
Don't lie to me.

910
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,440
I know if I

911
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,960
have a rib issue.

912
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,600
Let me tell you,

913
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,680
it doesn't hurt at all.

914
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,160
It was nothing at all.

915
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,920
Does it hurt or not?

916
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,640
Okay,

917
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,280
let's go to the hospital.

918
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,360
I'll take you to get an X-ray.

919
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,520
Didn't you say I had a rib problem?

920
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,760
I can't walk anymore.

921
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,240
If we need to go,

922
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,400
then carry me there.

923
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
I'll help you walk.

924
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,520
Get up.

925
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,680
Slowly sit up.

926
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,960
Why are you so mean?

927
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,720
You won't even carry me.

928
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,000
Just helping you walk

929
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,440
is already overflowing
with humanitarianism.

930
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,280
Be good.

931
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,640
I read in a book that

932
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,200
women are men's ribs.

933
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,480
