If I don't agree now,

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,670
that would really be too unkind.

to help him quit drinking.

150
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,710
Dog ended up like this

when I couldn't afford the wedding house,

165
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,080
you gave me all the money
you'd earned over the years,

167

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,990
I would have lost faith in love long ago.

189
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,710
Nonsense.

190
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,300
You still believe in love?

191
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,990
You haven't had a girl in years.

192
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,040
What?

193
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,800
Still thinking about Bai Lan?

194
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,370
No way.

195
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,990
That's all in the past.

196
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,710
Indeed, it's all in the past.

197
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,590
It's been five years already.

198
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,710
Time flies.

199
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,830
If you had a child back then,

200
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,710
they'd be old enough
to help you with groceries now,

201
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,710
maybe even fend off drinks for you.

202
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,560
Alright, that's enough.

203
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,830
A couple of days ago, I saw Bai Lan.

204
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,630
Really? When was this?

205
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,470
In Shanghai.

206
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,710
Just after
I finished business with Mr. He,

207
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,130
I was coming down in the elevator

208
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,590
and saw her in the crowd.

209
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,350
She looked just like before,

210
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,830
wearing a white dress.

211
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,700
I really wanted to

212
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,630
say something to her,

213
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,990
but I saw she's already married

214
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,320
and has a child now.

215
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,980
You must be delirious.

216
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,520
That must be a dream.

217
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,470
You're right,

218
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,800
it was a dream.

219
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,520
If only I had really seen Bai Lan.

220
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,710
If I could really see Bai Lan again,

221
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,440
I would definitely
tell her what's in my heart.

222
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,020
I love you?

223
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,180
How cheesy.

224
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,520
What then?

225
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,130
Reveal your gold watch

226
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:48,970
and ask her,

227
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,730
"Do you regret it?"

228
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,230
What time is it?

229
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,750
I forgot to send the wedding shoes!

230
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,220
Hurry, hurry, let's go.

231
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,060
Quickly!

232
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,960
(Happiness)

233
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,060
Oh, so beautiful.

234
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,230
You really understand fashion.

235
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,560
Could you help me with it too?

236
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,730
When Big Feet comes back,

237
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,680
it'll surprise him.

238
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,420
How's Big Feet doing in Beijing?

239
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,460
He's not even coming to my wedding,

240
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,710
is he really that busy?

241
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,560
He's been in
too many performances lately,

242
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,870
really can't get away.

243
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,850
Juan! Juan!

244
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,890
Open the door, it's me.

245
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,730
Who's there?

246
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,040
It's me, Juan.

247
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,050
What's the groom doing here
in the middle of the night?

248
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,530
The wedding's tomorrow.

249
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,080
Can't rush into things, you know?

250
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,370
I came to deliver wedding shoes.

251
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,610
Oh, that's true.

252
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,200
I asked him to buy them in Shanghai.

253
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,940
The shoes can come in, but you can't.

254
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,850
The bride and groom can't see each other
before the wedding.

255
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,850
Don't you understand the rules?

256
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,580
Why are you making such a fuss?

257
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,420
Xiaolu.

258
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,590
If the groom can't come in,

259
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,990
I surely can, right?

260
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,130
And who are you?

261
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,130
Who do you think I am?

262
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,080
I'm the best man.

263
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,340
Out, out, out.

264
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,400
Juan, Juan.

265
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,950
Get out of here!

266
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,020
Leave it to me, leave it to me.

267
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,560
Only the best man is allowed in.

268
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,580
Li Guangnan.

269
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,820
Get out of here!

270
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,700
Juan, Juan.

271
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,230
- Get out.
- Little Pouter.

272
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,520
Size 38, the only pair in the country.

273
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,110
Really beautiful.

274
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,320
Let me see.

275
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,340
After so many years,

276
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,590
aren't you going to say hello?

277
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,110
Li Guangnan is waiting for me.

278
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,730
I have to go.

279
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,320
- Try them on.
- Try them on.

280
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,990
What's going on?

281
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,830
- Why are you dragging me?
- Why didn't you tell me?

282
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,820
Tell you what?

283
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,660
She's here.

284
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,800
Who's here?

285
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,590
Are you pretending
or do you really not know?

286
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,350
I really don't know.
What are you talking about?

287
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,800
Bai Lan?

288
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,340
I swear,

289
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,520
I had no idea
Little Pouter invited Bai Lan.

290
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,440
After all these years,

291
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,770
the first time we meet,

292
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,710
and she sees me like this.

293
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,610
Lu Xiaolu, can you please wake up a bit?

294
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,530
It's been five years.

295
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,130
You don't even know if Bai Lan

296
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,420
has a boyfriend, or if she's married

297
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,260
and has kids.

298
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,710
Why do you care how she sees you now?

299
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,350
Come on, wake up.

300
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,750
You're not you from five years ago,

301
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,770
and she's definitely not her
from five years ago.

302
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,920
I don't mean anything else.

303
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,650
I just want to apologize to her.

304
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,610
Do you think it still matters to her?

305
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,040
But it matters a lot to me.

306
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,730
Fine.

307
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,880
(Happiness)

308
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,110
You are my wife now!

309
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,280
Happy wedding!

310
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,980
Didn't you want to apologize to Bai Lan?

311
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,090
You two will ride the car behind.

312
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,150
Everything's arranged for you.

313
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,860
Half an hour in the car,

314
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,240
you can apologize a hundred times.

315
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,420
Just you?

316
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,850
Yeah,

317
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,660
Bai Lan said
she has something to attend to,

318
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,050
so she'll go to the restaurant later herself.

319
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,830
Let's go ahead.

320
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,570
Let's go.

321
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,220
Xiaolu,

322
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,560
are you alright?

323
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,500
I'm fine.

324
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,090
If there's something,

325
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,320
you have to tell me.

326
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,190
These years, thanks to you and Guangnan,

327
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,290
me and Dumb Jar can

328
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,320
live the life we have now.

329
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,870
Don't say that.

330
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,320
Our company has come this far

331
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,190
thanks to everyone's efforts.

332
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,560
Working for you and Guangnan,

333
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,910
we've gained some dignity.

334
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,530
Just yesterday evening,

335
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,760
I heard Guangnan's mom

336
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,810
saying,

337
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,610
thank goodness Guangnan
went into business with you,

338
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,370
made some money,

339
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,530
otherwise, those relatives of his dad

340
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,240
back in the village wouldn't have come.

341
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,480
People, you know,

342
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,830
when you're poor,

343
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,830
not a single visitor shows up,

344
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,720
but now that Guangnan has money,

345
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,150
they all come bearing gifts.

346
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,700
His dad went to the restaurant

347
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,960
early this morning.

348
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,590
Ten tables of people.

349
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,520
But the bride's side is different,

350
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,040
her relatives
can't even fill half a table,

351
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,760
even Little Pouter's only elder,

352
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,480
her aunt, didn't come.

353
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,090
Those people will definitely

354
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,560
gossip about later.

355
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,180
Pig Teeth, pull over here.

356
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,280
Xiaolu, where are you going?

357
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,800
To handle something. You go ahead.

358
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,780
Okay.

359
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,410
Congratulations!

360
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,910
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, thank you.

361
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,190
Thank you, thank you.

362
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,760
Welcome, welcome.

363
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,620
Hey, not bad, Dog.

364
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,190
Your red envelope is the thickest today.

365
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,460
Master.

366
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,080
This is thick, Xiaoying.

367
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,530
How much money

368
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,420
have you earned

369
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,590
with Xiaolu and Guangnan?

370
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,010
It's not just from me,

371
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,430
it's from me and Big Feet together.

372
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,480
Since he couldn't come back from Beijing,

373
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,720
we put in more

374
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,000
as an apology.

375
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,330
We even made fun of Big Feet back then,

376
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,380
crazily insisting on
going to Beijing to sing.

377
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,700
We all thought he'd be back

378
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,320
in less than a month,

379
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,730
but who would've thought?

380
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,900
Yeah, no one could have imagined this.

381
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,860
He's made a fortune,

382
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,810
while we couldn't even get our salaries
at the factory,

383
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,810
barely having porridge to eat.

384
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,630
It's not as good as you think.

385
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,350
Actually, he's under a lot of pressure.

386
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,380
Even though he can earn
a few thousand for one performance,

387
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,280
- A few...
- it's tough work.

388
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,980
A few thousand?

389
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,250
Is that true?

390
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,290
In one performance,

391
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,080
he makes more than
what we earn in a year?

392
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,320
This is mine.

393
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,000
- Let me tell you.
- Come here.

394
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,140
What is it?

395
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,720
Can you stop boasting?

396
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,190
Did Big Feet really send you money?

397
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,500
He did.

398
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,630
Don't think I can't see it.

399
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,980
These days, you've been saving every bit,

400
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,960
not even buying meat.

401
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,150
Look at you now, so thin.

402
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,190
You think I'm stupid?

403
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,540
I'm dieting.

404
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,820
You don't understand.

405
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,660
You silly child.

406
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,500
I...

407
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,820
Hey, you...

408
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,910
When she was with Li Guangnan,

409
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,800
she should have known
this day would come.

410
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,090
I've provided for her

411
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,630
so well all those years,

412
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,180
and then

413
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,420
she just ran off with someone

414
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,320
who harmed her uncle.

415
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,650
Now she wants me to attend her wedding?

416
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,720
Don't you think that's too much to ask?

417
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,280
But, Auntie,

418
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,150
as far as I know,

419
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,140
besides your son,

420
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,830
you have no other children.

421
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,480
And now, with Ding Yu's situation,

422
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,660
haven't you thought about

423
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,830
the issue of old age support?

424
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,960
She broke my heart.

425
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,700
Old age support?

426
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,770
I don't care about that.

427
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,800
When I'm old,
I'll find a place where no one is,

428
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,430
and just die there.

429
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,760
If you die,

430
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,040
what will your son do?

431
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,480
Why are you here?

432
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,830
I'm afraid you'll act impulsively

433
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,480
and make a decision
you'll regret for life.

434
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,280
What do you mean by that?

435
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,590
I just heard

436
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,240
last month,
an old lady died in this building,

437
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,560
and no one found that out
for half a month,

438
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,810
until it started smelling,

439
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,050
and someone finally called the police.

440
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,190
Ah, a lonely old lady,

441
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,720
and they say she had a terrible temper,

442
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,430
so her children
didn't want to come see her,

443
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,190
even the maids left after a few tries.

444
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,700
Wait,

445
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,530
what are you implying?

446
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,430
If she knew this would be the result,

447
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,590
who knows if she would regret it
in the beginning.

448
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,540
Auntie,

449
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,000
did you know this old lady?

450
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,290
Stop acting here.

451
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,490
One talking to me nicely,

452
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,390
the other trying to scare me,

453
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,830
acting here with me.

454
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,220
I won't fall for this.

455
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,760
I won't fall for this.

456
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,280
Hey, Debao, are we starting or not?

457
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,670
Just a moment.

458
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,610
How is it?

459
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,180
Can your relatives still come?

460
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,240
We can't delay this any longer.

461
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,670
Just wait a little longer.

462
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,620
Honey, be happy.

463
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,590
Everyone is watching.

464
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,910
I'm getting married, and there's no one
from my family here.

465
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,520
That's not true.

466
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,800
I'm your family.

467
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,280
And my parents are also your family.

468
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,570
Don't worry.

469
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,040
You won't be alone anymore.

470
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,800
It's time to start.

471
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,980
We can't delay any longer.

472
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,830
I shouldn't have put those two
in the same car.

473
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,040
Could they have eloped?

474
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,430
Although this sounds frightening,

475
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,080
what I'm saying is all true.

476
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:29,960
Think about it.

477
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,810
Who helped you get your son

478
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,000
into the best hospital?

479
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,110
And who helped renovate
this old house for you?

480
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,960
During festivals and holidays,

481
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,800
who always greets you and sends gifts?

482
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,020
Auntie,

483
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,390
you know
what Little Pouter has done for you

484
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,480
all these years better than anyone.

485
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,670
Forget it.

486
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,150
Juan said

487
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,870
she willingly did this for Auntie

488
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,110
and she doesn't expect Auntie
to thank her.

489
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,960
But, you know,

490
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,350
she thinks Auntie
is the closest person to her.

491
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,170
She really...

492
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,830
She said that?

493
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,590
Last night, she told me

494
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,830
she remembers all the good things

495
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,430
you've done for her over the years.

496
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,150
When she had a high fever
in middle school,

497
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,480
you carried her to the hospital at night

498
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,190
in pouring rain,

499
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,110
preferring to get soaked yourself

500
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,960
rather than letting her
touch a drop of rain.

501
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,590
She always remembers these things.

502
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,760
She remembers it?

503
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,870
When she told me last night,

504
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,800
her eyes were swollen from crying.

505
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,630
On this joyful day,

506
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,110
if you can't be there to witness it,

507
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,870
Juan will be very sad.

508
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,520
If you really don't want to go,

509
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,150
we won't force you.

510
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,040
We'll just tell Qin Juan that

511
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,040
you don't want to be her aunt anymore

512
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,830
and let her just give up.

513
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,490
And from now on,

514
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,800
you two will never see each other again.

515
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,190
Little Pouter
won't come to bother you again.

516
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,460
Let's go.

517
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,350
You... You two...

518
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,000
You shouldn't sow discord between us.

519
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,330
Who...

520
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,040
Who said I don't acknowledge her?

521
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,720
Are you willing to go with us then?

522
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,110
On this joyous day,

523
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,010
we gather here

524
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,080
to witness
this beautiful moment together.

525
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,380
I now declare the wedding ceremony
officially begins.

526
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,630
Great!

527
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,350
Yes!

528
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,630
- Wait a moment.
- Juan.

529
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,910
Auntie!

530
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,020
Juan.

531
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,350
I'm sorry

532
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,430
I'm late.

533
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,760
Not late at all.

534
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,980
Juan,

535
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,910
you're a good girl.

536
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,870
You always have been
since you were little.

537
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,780
Although

538
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,430
so much has happened,

539
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,040
and I have been upset with you,

540
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,590
I raised you since you were little.

541
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,910
In my heart,

542
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,870
you're like my daughter.

543
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,800
Today is your wedding day,

544
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,190
I am happy,

545
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,330
so happy.

546
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:18,870
Really.

547
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,720
Great!

548
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,940
It's a happy day,

549
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,960
no crying, come on.

550
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,150
Don't cry.

551
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,810
Be happy.

552
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,240
Look how beautiful you are.

553
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,570
No more crying.

554
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,370
No more crying.

555
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,850
It's a happy occasion.

00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,400
it's going to rain soon.

748
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,360
I brought you an umbrella.

749
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,450
Thank you.

750
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,270
How have you been

751
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,710
all these years?

752
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,370
Very well.

753
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,480
How did you get the scar on your arm?

754
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,400
So you followed your cousin's old path.

755
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,180
Speaking of which,

756
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,560
when will he be out?

757
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,630
They reduced his sentence by two years.

758
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,090
But after he got out,

759
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,310
he didn't want to stay in Fucheng.

760
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,520
He'll be back soon.

761
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,590
I think once my cousin is back

762
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,560
and sees where I am today,

763
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,080
he'll be happy for me.

764
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,520
It seems like you're doing well now.

765
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,820
Sort of,

766
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:29,930
but not really.

767
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,480
My mom...

768
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,080
I really didn't know that.

769
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,780
She...

770
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,150
She had pancreatic cancer,

771
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:49,960
late-stage.

772
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,840
I believe she's happy

773
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,000
in heaven.

774
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,580
I have to go.

775
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,260
Bai Lan,

776
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,780
I'm sorry.

777
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,560
Back then, I lacked the courage

778
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,270
to say goodbye to you in person.

779
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,440
I was a deserter,

780
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,270
leaving you alone to face everything.

781
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,420
The apology has been pent up in my heart

782
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,630
for five years.

783
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,080
I know that it won't change things.

784
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,210
I know you would be mad at me,

785
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,560
or even hate me.

786
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,520
But I still want to say sorry.

787
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,000
Truly, I'm sorry.

788
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,100
Lu Xiaolu,

789
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,040
it's all in the past.

790
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,790
Let's look forward.

791
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,520
I've long since let go.

792
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,110
I hope you can too.

793
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,760
