Xiaolu!

27
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,690
Xiaolu!

28
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,080
Xiaolu!

29
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,440
Xiaolu!

30
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,310
You check there. I'll go up.

31
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,330
Okay.

32
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,930
Xiaolu!

33
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,440
Lu Xiaolu!

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
Xiaolu!

35
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,160
You mean he's been back for several days?

36
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,340
It's been seven to eight days, Master.

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,770
It's been over a week,

38
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,000
but he hasn't come back to the factory.

39
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,190
Ask him

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,240
if he still wants to work at the factory!

41
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,420
Master, I'm not sure how to ask.

42
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,440
Master,

43
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,300
if it were me,

44
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,620
I wouldn't want to come back
to this lousy factory.

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,460
Get lost!

46
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,700
Master,

47
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,210
since he already came back,

48
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,440
why can't we find him?

49
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,420
So...

50
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,720
Dad! Dad!

51
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,970
Where's Xiaolu?

52
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,960
Something's happened.

53
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,700
What happened?

54
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,250
Xiaolu's mom
has been admitted to the hospital.

55
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,190
He needs to be there.

56
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,180
What?

57
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,460
Is she hospitalized because

58
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,490
she missed her son too much?

59
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,420
Stop guessing! Hurry up,

60
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,220
split up and find Xiaolu.

61
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,780
- I'll stay here and keep watching.
- Alright, Master.

62
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,490
- Hurry up.
- Hurry, hurry.

63
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,330
Alright. Alright.

64
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,870
Did Xiaolu really come back to Fucheng?

65
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,910
He didn't even tell his parents.

66
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,190
Big Feet met him in a bookstore.

67
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,210
I went to his houseboat

68
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,050
and checked.

69
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,910
He wouldn't even open the door for me.

70
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,030
He still hasn't forgiven you, huh?

71
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,790
I peeked through the crack in the door,

72
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,190
and he was lying there listlessly.

73
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,420
Why is that?

74
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,160
What happened between him and Bai Lan?

75
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,460
They were just fine

76
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,680
when we went to Shanghai.

77
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,860
What's that sound?

78
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,300
Let's check.

79
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,070
Lu Xiaolu?

80
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,520
Why are you here?

81
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,520
What happened between you and Bai Lan?

82
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,330
Xiaolu,

83
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,590
I know you don't want to see me,

84
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,700
but I have something important to tell you.

85
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,470
Your mom is in the hospital.

86
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,540
It's okay. Don't feel burdened.

87
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,110
The bleeding has stopped,

88
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,760
but for a permanent solution,

89
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,110
she might need surgery.

90
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,910
Why didn't you come earlier?

91
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,450
The food factory
has been struggling this year,

92
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,370
and the medical insurance money
hasn't come through.

93
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,220
She kept taking medicine

94
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,470
and said she was fine.

95
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,890
So, she kept putting it off

96
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,730
until now.

97
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,320
If we had found out earlier,

98
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,550
maybe we could have grasped
the critical treatment period.

99
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,320
Now it has become
advanced pancreatic cancer.

100
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,990
She'll have to have a surgery
or wait for death.

101
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,330
Doctor,

102
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,110
what are the chances

103
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,320
if she undergoes surgery?

104
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,880
All surgeries have risks.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,930
Even if the surgery goes smoothly,

106
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,450
every patient's reaction afterward

107
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,320
is different.

108
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,890
Doctor, we don't understand.

109
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,350
Can you give us your advice?

110
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,250
From a medical perspective,

111
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
I would recommend the surgery.

112
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,990
But the final decision

113
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,230
rests with you.

114
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,740
If you decide on surgery,

115
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,580
it needs to happen soon.

116
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,790
How much will the surgery cost?

117
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,790
This surgery

118
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,200
requires a specialist
from the provincial capital.

119
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,910
The cost is not a small sum.

120
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,930
You can negotiate with

121
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,080
your factory.

122
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,550
In theory, this should be

123
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,110
fully covered by public health insurance.

124
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,060
Okay.

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,660
Doctor, I'll go to the factory to inquire.

126
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,740
Wait for my message, okay?

127
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,890
- Sure.
- Okay, thank you.

128
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,110
- No problem.
- Thank you, thank you.

129
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,520
Dad, how is my mom?

130
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,820
Xiaolu.

131
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,410
Mom,

132
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,020
I'm back.

133
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,080
Finally.

134
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,430
When did you come back?

135
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,760
You've lost weight.

136
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,860
Where did you notice that?

137
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,760
Where's Bai Lan?

138
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,230
I came back alone.

139
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,250
I heard you were sick,

140
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,640
so I rushed back.

141
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,420
If I weren't sick,

142
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,990
you wouldn't have come back to see me?

143
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,470
- Mom.
- Let me flick you.

144
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,900
Come on.

145
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,760
Let me flick you.

146
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
I'm fine,

147
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,480
just lie here for a couple more days,

148
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,160
and I'll be fine.

149
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,200
Go ahead if you are busy.

150
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,280
Don't worry about me.

151
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm not busy.

152
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,560
I'm back now,

153
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,680
I'll stay by your side

154
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
and not leave again.

155
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,600
What's wrong?

156
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,080
Did you have a fight with Bai Lan?

157
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,840
No.

158
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,480
We're fine.

159
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,720
She even said

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,640
she wanted to come back with me
to see you,

161
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,800
but she's busy studying

162
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,720
and couldn't make time.

163
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,080
I told her

164
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,920
that

165
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,000
you're okay,

166
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,680
and didn't let her come.

167
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,840
Go on.

168
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,340
Continue making up stories.

169
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
You are my own son,

170
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,760
and I can see right through

171
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,000
your mind.

172
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
Your eyes tell me

173
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,520
it's not that simple.

174
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,640
Just tell me about it.

175
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,920
Mom,

176
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,280
don't worry about this and that.

177
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,960
Just stay put and

178
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,120
get the surgery done.

179
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,320
As long as you are healthy,

180
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,360
I won't have any worries.

181
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
Okay.

182
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,480
Just hearing you say this,

183
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm content as a mother.

184
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
But Xiaolu,

185
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,080
I've made up my mind,

186
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,720
I'm not

187
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,280
having the surgery.

188
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,480
Why not?

189
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,920
Mom,

190
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,720
you must have it!

191
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,120
No.

192
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,120
Secretary Hong,

193
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,520
why isn't the factory reimbursing
my mom's medical expenses?

194
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,040
Xiaolu, calm down please.

195
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,880
It's not that the factory won't reimburse it,

196
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,920
we just don't have the money.

197
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,400
The Finance Department told me that

198
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,720
the medical insurance fund
has already been overspent,

199
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,280
and we can't find funds

200
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,760
from elsewhere.

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,840
Look,

202
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
I even bought some fruit

203
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,160
with my own money

204
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
to go visit

205
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,400
your mom.

206
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,440
I wanted to see if there were

207
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,840
any difficulties that needed solving.

208
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,080
Secretary Hong,

209
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,240
my mom's difficulty
is that she needs surgery.

210
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,080
She needs the factory
to cover the medical expenses.

211
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,340
- The surgery expenses...
- Lu Xiaolu,

212
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,840
get out and don't disturb
Secretary Hong's work.

213
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Get out!

214
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,680
Get off me!

215
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
Secretary Hong,

216
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,160
my mom has dedicated decades
to the factory,

217
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,320
you can't just stand by
and watch her die!

218
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,320
- I know.
- Lu Xiaolu!

219
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,280
You and your mom
colluded to fake illness,

220
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,910
submitting fake medical leave
to go to Shanghai

221
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,880
to hang out with Bai Lan.

222
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,120
You had no regard for discipline,

223
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
and your mom broke the regulations.

224
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,320
I haven't settled the score with you yet,

225
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,040
and now you dare come to the factory
and raise hell?

226
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,280
What are you trying to do?

227
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,320
Ding Dezhong, you should come at me!

228
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,160
This is between you and me.

229
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,760
You can punish me

230
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,240
or even fire me,

231
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,360
I won't say a thing,

232
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,840
just don't involve my mom.

233
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,360
These are two separate issues.

234
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,400
Don't confuse them.

235
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,400
Secretary Hong,

236
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,520
Lu Xiaolu has been

237
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,280
causing trouble repeatedly.

238
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,040
You used to protect him,

239
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
but letting him continue like this

240
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,320
undermines discipline.

241
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,200
Alright, enough, stop arguing.

242
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,640
Get out now.

243
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,520
Did you hear that?

244
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,560
Get out.

245
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,520
I meant you!

246
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,480
You get out!

247
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,760
But...

248
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,600
Oh, whatever.

249
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,760
Lu Xiaolu,

250
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,440
let's go.

251
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
Come with me to the hospital

252
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,400
and visit your mom.

253
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,720
Take this.

254
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,360
And we'll talk about the medical expenses.

255
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,240
Dad.

256
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,840
You have been back for days
but didn't come home.

257
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,280
Were you staying at Lu Dajiang's place?

258
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,480
Yes.

259
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,040
What is it?

260
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,480
Tired of this home?

261
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,800
No,

262
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,640
I just want some quiet time.

263
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,840
I understand.

264
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,840
Because you used to

265
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,200
study with Bai Lan there,

266
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,680
so there are her traces everywhere.

267
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,000
Actually, I don't want to go home either.

268
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,840
Because there are all your mom's traces.

269
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,880
Dad,

270
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
as long as Mom's surgery goes smoothly,

271
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,120
everything will be fine,

272
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,760
and we can go home.

273
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,200
After a few months,

274
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,080
you've grown up.

275
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,520
I have to grow up.

276
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,160
Everyone has to go through hardships.

277
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,840
The hardest part

278
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,440
is being mentally ready for the hardship.

279
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,680
Other things are easy.

280
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,160
Dad,

281
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,760
we have to get through this hurdle.

282
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,600
Yes.

283
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,640
We will definitely get through it.

284
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,840
Look at your mom's condition.

285
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,440
She's fine, right?

286
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,520
We'll get through it for sure.

287
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,640
I asked the doctor.

288
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,320
If the provincial experts
perform the surgery,

289
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,000
it'll cost around 2,000 yuan.

290
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,600
And this is 2,000 yuan.

291
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,520
Is this all the money we have at home?

292
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,560
We also have over ten IOUs,

293
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,200
totaling more than 5,000 yuan.

294
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,640
The factory's performance
has been poor these past few years,

295
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,960
and your mom, she's so kind-hearted,

296
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,760
always helping

297
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,000
others in need.

298
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,520
Our money is all tied up.

299
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,480
I'll pull a long face

300
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
and try to collect those debts.

301
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,560
This way, we'll have enough

302
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,080
for medical expenses,

303
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,560
hospitalization fees,

304
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,560
and the surgery.

305
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,400
Listen, Xiaolu,

306
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,080
don't worry about the surgery fees.

307
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,640
Take care of yourself,

308
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
so your mom will be at ease.

309
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,360
Oh, by the way,

310
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,720
when Secretary Hong
went to see your mom today,

311
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,120
he told her that

312
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,800
the warehouse leader
didn't want you there anymore.

313
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,960
Your mom pleaded with Secretary Hong

314
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,960
to find you another place.

315
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,080
In the end, Secretary Hong agreed to

316
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,480
assign you to the Security Department.

317
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,920
Report there tomorrow.

318
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,760
Okay,

319
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,440
got it.

320
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,080
We must have confidence.

321
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,840
Your mom will definitely get better.

322
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,560
Come on, Xiaolu.

323
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,920
Xiaolu,

324
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,640
smile.

325
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,760
Stop moping around all day.

326
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,000
(Gongyuan)

327
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,120
Where are you going?

328
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,200
I have taken leave

329
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
and am going out.

330
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Alright,

331
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,760
go ahead.

332
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,560
What are you doing standing here

333
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,680
like a statue?

334
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,680
Someone was going out

335
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
but you turned a blind eye?

336
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,400
You are standing guard here!

337
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,800
What?

338
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,240
Are you unhappy about this?

339
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
I found you an easy job to do

340
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,960
for your mom's sake.

341
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,560
You...

342
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,960
You don't have to
worry about anything at work.

343
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,640
And after work, just keep an eye out.

344
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,440
Don't let anyone

345
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,040
steal our socialist fruits

346
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,760
and clear out our factory.

347
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,200
You're just nodding along, aren't you?

348
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,640
Did you really understand what I said?

349
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,720
You need to pay attention

350
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,800
and not let our factory fire you for good.

351
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,320
Got it?

352
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,680
Understood.

353
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,880
Alright, stop suffering here.

354
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,760
Take this and come with me.

355
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,200
I don't know how it happened

356
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,800
but Ding Dezhong got bitten by a dog

357
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,280
when he was wandering around the factory

358
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,440
last night.

359
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,280
That is such a trouble.

360
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,920
Why didn't that dog finish him off?

361
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,880
This is truly unsettling.

362
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,840
Let's go catch the dog.

363
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,400
Come on.

364
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,640
Why are you still standing there?

365
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,000
- Is everyone here?
- Oh, yes.

366
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,040
Let's have Director Ding say a few words.

367
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,880
No, take it away.

368
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
A stray dog biting someone
is no small matter.

369
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,760
It doesn't matter if it bit me,

370
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,360
but if it had bitten Secretary Hong

371
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
or an inspecting leader,
what would we do?

372
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,240
It would affect

373
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,800
our factory's future development plans.

374
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,040
Yes, yes,

375
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,880
Director Ding makes a good point.

376
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,200
Thanks to this being
just an ordinary stray dog.

377
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,600
What if it

378
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,720
had rabies?

379
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,920
We need to be prepared.

380
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,640
If that dog had rabies,

381
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,800
Director Ding,

382
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,640
you wouldn't have many days left, right?

383
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,480
I heard it's incurable.

384
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,360
When people die of it,

385
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,760
it's terrifying.

386
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,640
Don't talk nonsense.

387
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,640
Director Ding might lose control
and bite you.

388
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,280
Cut out the nonsense!

389
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,840
Look at all of you.

390
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,760
Get into position.

391
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,880
Listen to me, pair up and catch the dog.

392
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,310
If it comes near, strike it down.

393
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,920
What if we get bitten?

394
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,360
Don't worry, even if we die,

395
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,520
Director Ding will be there with us.

396
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,640
What's with this attitude?

397
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,560
Go, go, go!

398
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,040

410
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,360
Stop running!

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,440

Hurry up!

413
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,880
Catch it!

414
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,880
It ran towards the skating rink!

415
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,920
You guys, chase after it!

416
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,760
Where's the dog?

417
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,120
Xiaolu, hurry.

418
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,320
It ran towards the skating rink.

419
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,760
Go on!

420

What are you doing, Niu?

423
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,560
I wanted to ask you.

424
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,440
Why are you after Lu Xiaolu?

425
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,680
Do I have to report to you?

426
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,880
Let me tell you,

427
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,920
stay in your repair team

428
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,160
and mind your own business.

429

Ding Dezhong,

430
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,560
when I joined the factory,

431
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,200
you were still wearing open-crotch pants.

432
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,680
I know all about you.

433
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,040
Let me remind you,

434
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,760
don't make me expose all your

435
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,640
dirty deeds and tangled accounts

436
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,280
in the factory.

437
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
What dirty deeds?

438
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,440
You think you can threaten me?

439
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,280
I warn you,

440
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,920
if you dare touch my apprentice,

441
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,280

446

I won't lower myself to your level.

447

This way!

448
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,680
Stay away from my apprentice.

449
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,760
Just wait and see.

please don't be sad.

568
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,320
Now that Xiaolu is back,

569
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,880
you should be happy.

570
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,120
What do I have to be happy about?

572
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,640

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,680
I

574
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,240
read a book before

575
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,520
that talked about

576
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,120
two types of distance

577
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,400
between people,

578
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,080
spatial distance

579
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,000
and temporal distance.

580
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,200
Xiaolu and Bai Lan

581
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,960
have spatial distance now.

582
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,680
Don't worry,

583
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,200
as the temporal distance lengthens,

584
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,200
just wait and see.

585
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,200
What do you take me for?

586
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,560

no one likes me,

No, it's not like that.

590
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,600
Xiaolu and Bai Lan broke up

591
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,960

Xiaolu?

622
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,440
Bai Lan,

623
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,120
Lucky's injured.

624
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,840
Can you help me take a look?

625
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,840
Let me see.

626
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,680
The wound is festering.

627
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,760
Xiaolu.

628
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,640
Xiaolu.

629
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,840
Dr. Tian,

630
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,000
Lucky is injured.

631
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,360
Could you take a look, please?

632
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,040
I would like to,

633
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,880
but the problem is

634
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,000
the factory won't reimburse
medical expenses,

635
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,320
so the workers all took it out on me,

636
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,800
taking everything away.

637
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,760
I couldn't stop them.

638
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,280
Now I don't even have

639
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,000
a bottle of alcohol
or a pack of cotton swabs.

640
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,200
So I'm afraid...

641
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,480
I understand.

642
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
I'll try another place.

643
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,240
Is Bai Lan doing well over there?

644
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,400
Do I even need to ask?

645
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,280
Of course she's doing well.

646
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,520
She's in Shanghai,

647
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,680
pursuing her master's degree.

648
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,280
By the way,

649
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,760
how's your mom doing now?

650
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,760
She's in the hospital.

651
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,680
She'll have a surgery
in a couple of days.

652
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
Good.

653
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,520
That's good.

654
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,640
To be honest,

655
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,400
Chairwoman Zhao has been good to me,

656
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,600
but this time,

657
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,560
I couldn't really help.

658
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,800
As a doctor,

659
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
it doesn't sit well

660
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
with me.

661
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,000
Xiaolu,

662
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,680
make sure to keep all the documents safe.

663
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,760
Who knows, maybe the factory
can cover it one day,

664
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,040
right?

665
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,040
Alright.

666
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,880
- I'll head off now.
- Okay.

667
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,760
(Medical Room)

668
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,160
I heard

669
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,120
you have a dog.

670
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,440
I came to see what breed it is.

671
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,720
Here.

672
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,400
I can't tell the breed.

673
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,480
I didn't want to come.

674
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,120
Little Pouter forced me to.

675
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,440
The dog is injured?

676
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,800
Yes.

677
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,520
Does it need treatment?

678
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,640
Yes.

679
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,960
If you're short of money...

680
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,800
I'm not.

681
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,880
Do you want to hear about

682
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,600
the business I'm in now?

683
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,200
No.

684
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,240
I'll tell you about it.

685
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,080
I'm not interested.

686
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,280
Okay,

687
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,480
you've seen the dog.

688
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,960
If there's nothing else,

689
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,600
you should leave now.

690
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,440
What are you doing, Lu Xiaolu?

691
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,160
Bai Lan dumped you,

692
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,960
but you shouldn't take it out on me.

693
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,280
What are you trying to do?

694
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,400
What am I trying to do?

695
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,080
Look at you now!

696
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,520
You are like a ghost.

697
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,360
Is Bai Lan

698
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,720
really worth it?

699
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,640
Maybe she's already forgotten about you.

700
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,400
Whatever.

701
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,680
Lucky,

702
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,120
do you think

703
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,200
she's doing well now?

704
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,080
What?

705
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,840
You really dropped out of school?

706
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,120
To be precise,

707
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,160
I was advised to leave.

708
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,360
They were going to expel me,

709
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,720
but the professor was kind enough

710
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,400
to ask me to leave voluntarily.

711
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,320
Bai Lan,

712
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,600
although we haven't known

713
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,520
each other long,

714
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,360
I quite admire you.

715
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,200
Do you know that?

716
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,200
I felt that

717
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,840
you are a girl

718
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,200
who knows what she wants.

719
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,760
But on this matter,

720
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,480
what exactly are you thinking?

721
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,640
In life,
you have to try a few things blindly

722
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,920
to understand the importance
of giving your all.

723
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,720
You could also understand this

724
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,240
as self-comfort.

725
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,160
Self-comfort...

726
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,640
What about your future?

727
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,840
What will you do?

728
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,560
That's why I came to you.

729
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,600
Do you have any

730
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,520
suitable work for me?

731
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,960
Miss Bai,

732
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,040
you know that

733
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,200
modeling is

734
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,760
a competitive industry.

735
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,280
Your education
was your label and capital.

736
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,520
I understand.

737
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,920
If there's a suitable opportunity
in the future,

738
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,080
please think of me.

739
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,600
Oh, by the way,

740
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,920
you really turned Mr. Huang down?

741
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,520
What a great opportunity.

742
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,160
500 yuan a day

743
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,080
for the Italian jewelry series.

744
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,400
So many girls would

745
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,680
jump at this chance.

746
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,080
Can't you reconsider?

747
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,640
I already said, it's the rule.

748
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,120
Besides the surgery fee,

749
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,480
you should also pay the deposit,
2,000 yuan.

750
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,360
Doctor, you didn't mention

751
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,880
the deposit last time.

752
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,080
If the food factory could reimburse,

753
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,600
then that's not your concern.

754
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,160
But the factory won't reimburse now,

755
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,080
so you have to cover it yourselves.

756
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,120
It's simple logic.

757
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,080
Don't you understand?

758
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,840
I do understand,

759
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,880
but I can't come up with

760
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,160
that much money right now.

761
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,920
This money is for the hospital,

762
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,400
not my pocket.

763
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,240
Besides, the specialist

764
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,960
only comes once a month.

765
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,240
If you don't pay
before the end of tomorrow,

766
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
you'll have to wait until next month.

767
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,000
No, doctor,

768
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,840
my wife can't wait.

769
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,120
You said the sooner the surgery,

770
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
the better the chance.

771
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,640
What should I do?

772
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,720
Yes, I said that,

773
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,720
but I can't grant your request.

774
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,960
For such a serious illness,

775
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,080
hospitalization fees, surgery fees,

776
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,640
and miscellaneous medical expenses

777
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,070
probably amount
to over ten thousand yuan.

778
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,080
I understand.

779
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,600
If you can't afford it,
there's nothing I can do.

780
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,440
Doctor, doctor,

781
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,280
please help me, okay? Doctor!

782
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,600
Hello, may I speak to Ms. Tao?

783
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,800
Just tell her it's Xiaolu.

784
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,640
Ms. Tao is away on a business trip?

785
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,040
Thank you.

786
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,480
Sorry to bother you.

787
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,120
What?

788
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,680
Do you have a solution?

789
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,600
Xiaolu!

790
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,200
What's the matter?

791
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Li Guangnan wants to see you.

792
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,800
Why would he want to see me?

793
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,840
You'll find out when you see him.

794
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,560
Take it easy.

795
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,440
Xiaolu,

796
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,240
are you here for Mr. Li?

797
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,840
He's busy inside.

798
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,400
Mr. Li, huh?

799
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,200
Xiaolu,

800
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,900
we're working for Mr. Li now

801
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,080
just like we did for Dajiang.

802
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,520
You are here.

803
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,880
You wanted to see me?

804
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,280
Yes.

805
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I heard your mother is ill

806
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,200
and needs money for surgery.

807
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,400
Why didn't you come to me?

808
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,000
You're running a small business.

809
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,320
How much money do you have?

810
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,840
How much do you need?

811
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,680
Five thousand.

812
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,080
That's not a big amount.

813
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,320
You don't know, Lu Xiaolu.

814
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,120
My business is doing really well now.

815
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,080
As soon as I open the door to my shop,

816
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,920
money pours in every day.

817
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,080
When do you need it?

818
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,960
Before tonight.

819
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,560
Stop pretending.

820
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,240
I can figure it out.

821
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,920
You really underestimate me.

822
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,120
I happen to have a sum of money.

823
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,320
I was thinking of investing in stocks.

824
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,720
If you urgently need it,

825
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,320
I'll lend it to you first.

826
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,600
Can you give it to me tonight?

827
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,520
Not tonight,
but I can give it to you tomorrow.

828
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,160
Tomorrow is too late.

829
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,720
If not tonight,

830
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,940
my mother's surgery
will be postponed for a month.

831
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,360
Okay.

832
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,120
Here.

833
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,600
Write me an IOU.

834
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,920
I'll give you the money.

835
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,960
Stop drinking.

836
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,440
Where did this money come from?

837
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,640
Don't ask.

838
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,360
No, you have to tell me.

839
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,120
We didn't make that much money
from our business.

840
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,320
Where did this money come from?

841
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,720
Talking about the money?

842
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,160
I have to thank your uncle.

843
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,720
My uncle?

844
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,480
He is not that kind-hearted.

845
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,480
Do you know how much money

846
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,560
Xiaolu's mom needs for the surgery?

847
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,440
Do you know

848
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,920
that Xiaolu's dad went to the factory
to ask for money

849
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,080
and didn't get a single penny?

850
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,120
He was kicked out.

851
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,600
How can I just stand by and watch Xiaolu

852
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,200
be driven to his death by money?

853
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,400
Don't change the subject.

854
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,720
My uncle doesn't have that much money.

855
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,840
Where did the money come from?

856
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,600
I don't want to owe him anything.

857
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,640
What do you owe him?

858
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,360
Your uncle is so nice.

859
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,720
For Xiaolu's mother's surgery money,

860
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,160
I went to borrow money from him.

861
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,160
Your uncle introduced me

862
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,680
to a boss who does usury business.

863
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,400
The coincidence is that

864
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,760
your uncle also invested in that company.

865
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,640
Twenty percent of the interest

866
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,480
I pay for the money

867
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,440
goes to your uncle.

868
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,400
What do you think?

869
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,520
He's just a wage earner.

870
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,320
Where would he get that much money?

871
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,720
Of course, he doesn't have it.

872
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,760
But he can cook the books.

873
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,200
He moved all the medical insurance money

874
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,240
from the factory.

875
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,000
It's impossible.

876
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,720
Although my uncle has done

877
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,520
a lot of bad things,

878
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,560
he shouldn't have the guts.

879
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,920
That's Ding Dezhong!

880
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,360
And the factory is collapsing,

881
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,480
what else does he care?

882
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,040
He's just looking for profit.

883
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,520
How did you know about this?

884
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,160
Secretary Hong has started auditing.

885
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,160
Your uncle is afraid.

886
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,440
He knew I had a sales channel

887
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,160
and wanted me to sell

888
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,950
all the expired food in the factory
to the countryside.

889
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,840
And he would take the money
and cover the accounts.

890
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,600
He even wanted to drag me down.

891
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,040
He wanted me to help him
do fake accounting,

892
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,000
and make more money.

893
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,880
That is what your uncle is like.

894
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,960
Did you do it?

895
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,600
I helped him sell the goods,

896
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,240
but I didn't do the fake accounts.

897
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

898
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,750
If you had told me, I would never
have let you get involved

899
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,420
in this kind of mess.

900
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,920
Do you think I wanted to do this?

901
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,160
He told me that if this thing succeeded,

902
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,840
he would agree to let you marry me.

903
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,760
Why didn't you...

904
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,920
Why didn't you

905
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,840
discuss it with me?

906
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,400
What do we do now?

907
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,200
We work hard to earn money

908
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,120
and pay back the debts!

909
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,720
The factory is trying to

910
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,920
figure out a solution.

911
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,920
You focus on getting well.

912
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,160
Oh, well...

913
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,280
Secretary Hong,

914
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
we know there are

915
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,200
difficulties in the factory.

916
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,600
- Hey, Xiaolu, give me the kettle.
- I understand.

917
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,200
- When can you reimburse it?
- Let me handle it, Dad.

918
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,120
Do you have the final say?

919
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,960
I am useless.

920
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,000
It's all thanks to you that your mom

921
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,920
had surgery this time.

922
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,520
Dad, what are you saying?

923
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,480
It's been hard for you these past few days.

924
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,160
Today, I'll take care of Mom.

925
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,280
You go home and have some rest.

926
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,280
No need.

927
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,960
I'm used to taking care of your mom.

928
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,160
I'm worried if you take care of her.

929
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,600
Take a break.

930
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,920
You don't have to do this.

931
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,760
Please.

932
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,240
- Have some fruit.
- Thank you.

933
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,200
Have some fruit.

934
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,960
- Here, Secretary Hong.
- Okay okay.

935
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,680
No problem.

936
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,600
What's wrong with you?

937
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,320
- Nothing.
- Hey.

938
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,480
Why are you crying?

939
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,600
I'm not.

940
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,040
