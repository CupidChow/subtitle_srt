used to be different.

Mom,

77
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,310
please don't be mad.

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,440
I brought you some fruit.

79
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,280
Mom.

80
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,720
Speak louder.

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,790
Okay, okay.

82
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,760
You've locked yourself
in the room all night.

83
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,670
Dad and I are worried sick about you.

84
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,190

85
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,350

Mom!

87
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,800
Running away from home?

88
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,720
You didn't discuss it with us

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,270
before you decided to go to Shanghai!

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,910
I'm discussing it with you two right now.

91
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,150
Is this discussing?

92
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,510
It's notifying.

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,150
Okay, alright.

94
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,590
Since you were born until now,

95
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,960
I've never

96
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,510
seen your mom so angry.

97
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,110
If we count from when we met,

98
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,470
it's only happened once.

99
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,910
Which time?

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Back then,

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,040
we hadn't come out

102
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,200
in the open.

103
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,390
Our families didn't know about us.

104
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,760
Your grandmother insisted on
arranging blind dates for me,

105
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,630
so I went along.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Then Comrade Zhao Lizhen found out.

107
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,080
My goodness,

108
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,910
she didn't talk to me
for over two months.

109
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,470
That long?

110
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,430
So,

111
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,680
how did you win my mom back?

112
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,630
Later,

113
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,360
after continuous efforts

114
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,160
and writing hundreds of love letters,

115
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,870
things improved.

116
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,560
So many years have passed,
and just thinking about that incident

117
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,230
still makes my back sweat.

118
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,510
Good for you, Dad.

119
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,390
When the going gets tough,
the tough get going.

120
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,800
Dad, can you also help me

121
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,150
figure out a way?

122
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,790
Help you figure out a way?

123
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,910
It looks like

124
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,550
only I can deal with

125
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,230
Comrade Zhao Lizhen.

126
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,270
Lu Xiaolu

127
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,550
is really out of line.

128
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
In his eyes,

129
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,310
do parents even exist anymore?

130
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,560
I'd say it's because

131
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,270
I haven't spanked him enough.

132
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,550
What are you saying?

133
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,480
What did you say?

134
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
No, I...

135
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
Is our son

136
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,310
- for you to scold?
- What are you doing?

137
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,190
I can scold him

138
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,150
but you can't.

139
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,670
Talking about that child,

140
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,710
back then,

141
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,560
I got such a long cut

142
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,640
on my stomach

143
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,070
just to give birth to him.

144
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
And it was not easy

145
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,030
to raise him.

146
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,590
But he's turned out
to be this heartless thing.

147
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,350
Look at what he's doing now.

148
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,310
He forgot his mother right after
he's got a girlfriend.

149
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,550
It's all because of you.

150
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,910
He learned this from you.

151
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
How could that be true?

152
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,670
How could it not be true?

153
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,800
He inherited

154
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,680
this trait

155
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,670
from you.

156
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
He's not like me.

157
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,150
I'm devoted to you.

158
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,790
Come on.

159
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,910
What should we do?

160
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,880
What should we do?

161
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,750
You need to help me figure out a way.

162
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,640
We can't let our son

163
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,310
end up like you back then,

164
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,440
being taken away by his wife easily.

165
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,910
Lu Xiaolu, are you out of your mind?

166
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,360
You're studying now,

167
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,980
preparing for
the adult college entrance exam

168
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,360
to go to Shanghai?

169
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,990
What's wrong with that?

170
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,600
If it hadn't been for Bai Lan,

171
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,670
I should be in a university classroom
right now.

172
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,320
And she's helping me
with exam retakes now.

173
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,230
Isn't that great?

174
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,600
It's not that I look down on you,

175
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,560
but with your grades,

176
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,710
I'll believe it if you say
you can pass the adult college exam,

177
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,440
but you are saying
you can go to a college in Shanghai?

178
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,480
That's like Big Feet telling me

179
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,520
he's going to hold a concert
in Hung Hom, Hong Kong.

180
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,630
Just pure nonsense.

181
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,120
Who's that?

182
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,240
Let's go.

183
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,710
Big Feet?

184
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,060
What are you doing in there?

185
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,040
What are you hiding? Let me see.

186
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,200
It's nothing. I'm not hiding anything.

187
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,680
What is it? A carnal book?

188
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,520
No.

189
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,270
Why are you reading?

190
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
I...

191
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,640
Xiaolu.

192
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,390
Have you seen Big Feet?

193
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,440
Big... Big Feet?

194
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,600
We've been looking for Big Feet too.

195
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,950
No.

196
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,030
We haven't seen him for days.

197
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,720
There's so much work in the maintenance.

198
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,390
Dozens of water pumps and light bulbs
need to be fixed.

199
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
He's probably off somewhere
avoiding work.

200
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
- I think so too.
- If we find him,

201
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,790
we'll send him back right away.

202
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
Okay, let's look elsewhere.

203
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's go.

204
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,230
Come on.

205
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,440
Have they left?

206
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,560
Yes.

207
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,120
(Chemistry)
A high school chemistry book?

208
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,830
Could it be...

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,710
Yeah, I also want to be in college.

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,990
I was thinking,

211
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,510
since the factory isn't doing well,

212
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,510
I thought I could do something else.

213
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,990
But please don't tell anyone.

214
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,950
They say that workers participating
in the adult college entrance exam

215
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,480
are considered shirking work,

216
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,360
reaching too far,

217
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,350
being ambivalent,

218
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,320
and changing loyalty...

219
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,360
Is that a word?

220
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,470
Yeah, changing loyalty.

221
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,230
You know what?

222
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,470
If I get caught,

223
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,080
I will not only be fined.

224
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,430
I'll also be shifted to the graveyard shift.

225
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,080
That's what you should keep in mind.

226
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,260
The graveyard shift is really scary.

227
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,880
Stop studying.

228
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,150
Big Feet, I support you.

229
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,320
Let's take the exam together.

230
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,560
Really?

231
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,670
The more some people look down on us,

232
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,510
the more we have to prove them wrong.

233
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,080
Great! Great!

234
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,040
Thank you, Xiaolu!

235
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,880
Debao!

236
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,680
Debao! I found Big Feet!

237
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,950
Lower your voice.

238
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,280
Debao!

239
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,670
Quiet!

240
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,150
Let me get you a bowl of soup.

241
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,030
You can eat a bit more.

242
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,560
You're too thin.

243
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,070
That's enough.

244
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,000
That's enough, thank you.

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,840
Here.

246
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,630
I'm not sure

247
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,120
what's

248
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,800
been going on lately.

249
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,430
I feel uncomfortable all over.

250
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,710
I have headaches at night

251
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,190
and back pain
while working during the day.

252
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,270
My liver

253
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,750
hurts

254
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,830
a lot.

255
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,480
You're a doctor.

256
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,910
Can you help me with it?

257
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,320
Mrs. Lu,

258
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,710
I'm no longer the factory doctor.

259
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,400
If you're feeling unwell,

260
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,630
go see Dr. Tian or go to the hospital.

261
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,560
Also, this area is your stomach,

262
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,400
not your liver.

263
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,030
Oh, really?

264
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,310
I'm getting older,

265
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,560
and I've

266
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,950
worked hard to raise my son.

267
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,110
It's okay if he won't be wealthy,

268
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,720
but now that

269
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,440
he's in love,

270
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,520
he wants to leave my side.

271
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,680
What's going on?

272
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,080
I understand now.

273
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,520
You invited me to dinner

274
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,840
because of Xiaolu
going to Shanghai, right?

275
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,400
Xiaolu is lucky to have you

276
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,160
as his girlfriend.

277
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,040
He's been mischievous
since he was little,

278
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,680
but he's never

279
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,840
gone against us

280
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,760
on important matters.

281
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,560
Yet, since meeting you,

282
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,360
he seems like a different person.

283
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,200
Have you ever considered that

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,960
this might be the real Lu Xiaolu?

285
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
He has his ideals,

286
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,680
pursuits, and rebellion.

287
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,960
Do you think

288
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
you really know him?

289
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,240
Alright,

290
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,880
then let me ask you.

291
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,240
Do you share common interests?

292
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,280
Similar life experiences?

293
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,080
Unified life goals?

294
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,880
You like each other now,

295
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,040
you feel excited together,

296
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,080
but can you guarantee that will last?

297
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
You've already decided

298
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
to explore the world in another city,

299
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,640
but have you thought about taking
responsibility for each other's future?

300
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Mrs. Lu,

301
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,120
I only know that

302
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,440
Xiaolu really likes me,

303
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
and I like him too.

304
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
So, since we've decided

305
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,320
to pursue the life we want together,

306
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,440
we won't be easily shaken.

307
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,720
You're too young.

308
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,920
You think you can
sacrifice everything for love.

309
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
It's brave and romantic,

310
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,160
but in the future, you'll realize

311
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,760
how naive and crazy

312
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,280
your decisions are now.

313
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,840
But if you don't have a naive

314
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,480
and crazy moment when you're young,

315
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,280
you'll regret it later.

316
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,440
This house is the new home of my son

317
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,640
and daughter-in-law.

318
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,000
Right after they got married,

319
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,760
they went to Guangzhou to do business.

320
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,440
Look, the furniture is all new.

321
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,320
Good view

322
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,480
and location.

323
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
- Here.
- Thank you.

324
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,520
You two can take a closer look.

325
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,280
Okay. Thank you.

326
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,440
Thanks.

327
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,720
The buildings in Fucheng
are getting taller and taller.

328
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,760
Li Guangnan, come and have a look.

329
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,800
Li Guangnan,

330
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,480
didn't you say you'd come
to see the new house with me?

331
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,680
Why the sour face?

332
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,840
Come on, tell me why.

333
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,560
You said Fucheng is getting better.

334
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,040
Why does Lu Xiaolu want to leave?

335
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,960
No matter how good Fucheng is,

336
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,520
if Bai Lan doesn't like it, it's useless.

337
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,440
But he has family and friends here.

338
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,520
He has nothing in Shanghai,

339
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,680
what if he gets bullied?

340
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,960
Lu Xiaolu will never be bullied.

341
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,320
Every time you get bullied,

342
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,520
he's always the one standing up for you.

343
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,480
You're right.

344
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Lu Xiaolu

345
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
would never leave his friends behind.

346
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,320
You've waited a long time?

347
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,680
What do you think?

348
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,920
My cousin left it to me.

349
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,240
Cool, right?

350
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,480
Yeah.

351
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,960
This will be
your exclusive seat from now on.

352
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,640
I get out of class
an hour earlier than you,

353
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,960
so I used that hour

354
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,480
to get familiar with the surroundings.

355
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,440
I checked out all the bookstores,

356
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,960
stationery shops, and restaurants.

357
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,520
This is the reference book you need.

358
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,080
You are quite efficient.

359
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,800
What are you going to do later?

360
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm going home to review, of course.

361
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,960
Let me tell you,

362
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,920
I'm full of energy

363
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,400
from head to toe.

364
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,720
I'm even scaring myself.

365
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,920
Then I'll go with my classmates
to continue studying.

366
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,160
Alright, go ahead.
I'll come pick you up later.

367
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,000
Okay.

368
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,120
That's cool!

369
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,160
Bad news! Bad news!

370
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,000
What's wrong?

371
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,560
Li Guangnan is in trouble!

372
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,760
Hurry! Come on!

373
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,720
Hurry.

374
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,680
What took you guys so long?

375
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,520
Li Guangnan would be in deep trouble
if you'd be any later.

376
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,360
What's the situation?

377
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,520
The leader is called Boss Hu.

378
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,760
They are carrying knives

379
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,800
and seem reckless.

380
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,120
Boss Hu?

381
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,240
Here.

382
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
Let's go meet them.

383
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,520
Hey, wait a minute.

384
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,350
What are you hesitating for?

385
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,160
I mean,

386
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,400
I don't even

387
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,320
have a girlfriend yet.

388
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,800
If I go in,

389
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,280
I might lose my life.

390
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,840
Think about it, I just started classes...

391
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,000
Enough talking.

392
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,080
I have an idea.

393
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,680
I'll go in first

394
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
and meet them.

395
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,840
Boss, take a break.

396
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,960
Look at this magazine.

397
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,200
It's amazing!

398
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,080
What magazine?

399
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,280
Do you even know how to read?

400
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,600
It's mostly pictures.

401
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,840
This is good indeed.

402
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,040
- Where did you get this from?
- Boss Hu.

403
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Long time no see.

404
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,280
Lu Dajiang's cousin.

405
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,320
Long time no see.

406
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,960
Why did you kidnap my friend?

407
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,800
Your cousin is in prison.

408
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,920
The skating rink

409
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,640
will be mine sooner or later.

410
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,880
I know

411
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,640
you've been eyeing that spot
for a long time.

412
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
But what does that have to do
with Li Guangnan?

413
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,520
Oh, dodge! Dodge!

414
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,120
He didn't

415
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,840
recognize the situation

416
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,480
and came into my shop,

417
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,000
accusing me of taking over
your cousin's territory.

418
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,920
He not only broke my things,

419
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,160
but also attacked my people.

420
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,120
So what if I hit you?

421
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,360
How much money do you want?

422
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,800
I'll pay.

423
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,000
At least this much.

424
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,720
Okay, 500 it is.

425
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,880
But you must release him today.

426
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,400
This is not just about money.

427
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
I have another condition.

428
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,680
What is it?

429
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,320
Guess.

430
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,680
Tell me.

431
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,040
Over the years,

432
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,960
Lu Dajiang has been giving me hard times.

433
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,880
I've suffered a lot in Fucheng.

434
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,400
Today, if you kneel down, admit defeat,

435
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,720
and crawl under my crotch,

436
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,600
I'll let him go.

437
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,440
Kneel down!

438
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,160
- Kneel!
- Kneel!

439
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,320
Take him away.

440
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,560
Big Feet, drink it up!

441
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
No, no, no.

442
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,520
This is too strong.

443
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,880
But today, when you rode
that small cart in to save me,

444
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,120
that was really cool.

445
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,760
- Thank you.
- If you can make that move

446
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,560
and then spin out,

447
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,720
that would be even cooler.

448
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,320
You're right!
I'll practice that move later.

449
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,360
Sure, sure, sure.

450
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,720
How did you make the smoke bombs?

451
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,120
Boss Hu was coughing like hell!

452
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,960
Oh, help! Help!

453
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,440
It's quite simple.

454
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,480
Just mix syrup with a few firecrackers,

455
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,280
and add chili powder

456
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,120
for that extra kick.

457
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,680
- Chili powder?
- No wonder!

458
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,560
Essence! Essence!

459
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
No wonder! No wonder!

460
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,440
Xiaolu,

461
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,480
I acted impulsively.

463
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,160
Anyway,

464
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,640
thank you all

465
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,760
for saving my life today.

466
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,600
I will drink it up.

467
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,440
Thank you again.

468
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
It's not much,

469
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,720
but can help a bit.

470
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,280
What do you mean?

471
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,680
This happened
because you defended my cousin.

472
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,400
The feud between Boss Hu and him

473
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,920
has been going on for a long time.

474
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,280
He's clearly
just using this as an excuse.

475
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,440
It's not your fault.

476
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,600
In the future, don't face

477
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,360
these things alone.

478
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,280
No need to do that.

479
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Actually,

480
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,000
I've thought about a lot of things

481
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,840
during this time I was kidnapped.

482
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,760
Look,

483
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,120
the milk tea formula is still with us.

484
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,880
We can still make money.

485
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,880
You and I

486
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,920
can handle packaging design and sales,

487
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,680
Big Feet can promote the product,

488
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,160
- Xiaoying can manage the...
- The raw materials.

489
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,480
Yes, raw materials.

490
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,000
And Little Pouter
can handle the finances.

491
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,880
If we're short-handed,

492
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,040
we can call Pig Teeth

493
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,240
- and Dumb Jar to help.
- Right!

494
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,920
As the business grows,

495
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,460
we'll make enough money
to repay the debts.

496
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,080
It's a good idea,

497
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,040
but I've said it before.

498
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,400
I need to study.

499
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,800
I want to go to Shanghai.

500
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,120
I actually want to study too, but...

501
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,680
Think before you talk.

502
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,280
No, I don't want to study.

503
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,040
You just told me

504
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,280
not to face things alone.

505
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,080
Why are you leaving when we're about

506
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,360
to do something worthwhile?

507
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,560
You're the backbone of our group.

508
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,920
If you leave, what will we do
if they come looking for trouble again?

509
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,160
Yeah.

510
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,000
If you really want to leave,

511
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,480
let's expand the business first,

512
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,680
and then you can leave with money.

513
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,520
Exactly!

514
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,880
How can you just leave now

515
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,160
and leave us behind?

516
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,200
Yes.

517
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,960
I think Xiaoying is right.

518
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,920
I agree with her.

519
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,400
I owe them a lot of money.

520
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,880
If I don't repay it, they'll kill me.

521
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,840
Xiaolu, I'm begging you.

522
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,520
Stop crying. Alright, alright.

523
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,800
Okay.

524
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,120
Okay.

525
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,400
I'll help.

526
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,960
But remember,

527
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,000
just this one time.

528
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,320
Just one time.

529
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,520
Fill your cups.

530
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,320
Cheers!

531
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,080
Xiaolu is really a great friend.

532
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,920
(A cup of milk tea is all you need.
Fresh milk brings you sweetness)

533
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,280

00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,120
Here.

535
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,120
Here, Guangnan.

536
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,040
Thank you, thank you.

00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,880

Just say he's sick.

your mom is sick,

Oh, I thought you would never come back.

- I didn't mean it, Mom.

- Yes, really.

Bai Lan,

639
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,680
let me explain.

640
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,280
I admit I've been skipping classes lately,

641
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,840
but there are reasons for it.

642
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,120
Are there really reasons,

643
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,840
or do you simply not want to study?

644
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,960
Do you not believe me?

645
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,240
I'm studying while working,

646
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
eating,

647
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,720
and even sleeping,

648
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,840
all to be able to go to Shanghai with you.

649
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,680
But I also have friends in my world.

650
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,510
I can't ignore Li Guangnan's situation.

651
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,640
I hope you can understand.

652
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,640
I know you have a lot of people
in your world,

653
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
but how do you know
I can't understand you?

654
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,760
I believe in you so much,

655
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,600
but what did you do?

656
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,600
Say something, will you?

657
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,680
What's going on?

658
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,440
Having a fight.

659
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,840
He must be
having a fight with his girlfriend.

660
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
Having a fight?

661
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,160
Why do I feel like you're enjoying this?

662
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,960
How is that possible?

663
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,160
Am I enjoying this?

664
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,040
They are still young,

665
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,520
having a fight is pretty normal.

666
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,200
Remember when

667
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,000
we were dating? Did we ever argue?

668
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,160
- No.
- Exactly.

669
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
I always let you have your way.

670
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,240
That's because you are always right.

671
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,880
Exactly,

672
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,440
I have always been right.

673
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,200
When two people are right for each other,
everything is harmonious.

674
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,480
- Isn't that true?
- Absolutely.

675
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
If two people aren't harmonious,

676
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,360
how can there be

677
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,160
eternity,

678
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,480
growing old together,

679
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,200
or everlasting love?

680
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,280
Isn't that right?

681
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,560
Absolutely, all correct.

682
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,160
So, if they are not harmonious,

683
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,280
their relationship can't last long.

684
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,120
What's wrong?

685
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,560
I don't know what is going on
with my stomach.

686
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,040
It has been hurting.

687
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,360
It's been acting up again?

688
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,390
That's why you shouldn't say such things.

689
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,240
What things?

690
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,720
And never fake a problem

691
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,440
to scare Bai Lan.

692
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,080
Who scared Bai Lan?

693
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,160
This little rascal

694
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
is getting on my nerves.

697
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,840
give me my salary bag.

This is the money
Li Guangnan owes you.

703
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,050
I'll pay you the remaining back
as soon as possible.

704
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
When I'm away,

705
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,200
don't bother my brothers anymore.

706
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,480
Hey, wait.

707
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,480
Mr. Lu

708
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,000
has no merits

709

what's going on?

720
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,840
Firstly,

721
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,160
on behalf of our company,
I'd like to thank you...

722
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,000
I mean,

723
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,000
all of you.

724
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,840
Thank you all

725
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,800
for supporting our

726
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,440

727
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,240
The rest depends on you.

728
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,520
Laowu. Explain to Mr. Lu.

729
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,440
- Okay.
- Tell him what's going on exactly.

730
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,880
Mr. Lu,

731
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
it's Li Guangnan.

732
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,240
He said as long as
we cooperate in staging a play,

733
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,400
he'll cover our annual beverage expenses.

734
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,320
- How many more do we need?
- Li Guangnan!

735
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,720
Xiaolu, Xiaolu!

736
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,280
- Xiaolu, what are you doing?
- Tell me!

737
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,320
What are you doing? Let go!

738
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,160
What are you doing?

739
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,240
It might be a misunderstanding!

740
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,050
You know perfectly
that it's not a misunderstanding!

741
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,520
Tell me.

742
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,640
Why did you lie to me?

743
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,080
So what if I lied to you?

744
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,680
Will you stay if I don't lie to you?

745
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,420
You'll just leave
only because you want to.

746
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Have you considered us

747
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,240
or the milk tea shop?

748
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,240
Move aside.

749
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,640
It's my own choice

750
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,040
to leave, to stay, to go anywhere!

751
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,960
Lu Xiaolu,

752
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,000
that's what you are truly thinking, right?

753
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,080
What am I to you, really?

754
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,920
What are you doing?

755
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,050
We missed the college entrance exam
together,

756
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,200
fought together,

757
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,440
faced discipline together.

758
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,280
Why didn't you say that then?

759
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,400
Now, because of Bai Lan,

760
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,120
you want to cut ties with me?

761
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,360
As you wish.

762
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,240
- Xiaolu.
- Xiaolu!

763
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,320
Didn't you say we were a team?

764
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,720
What's the problem?

765
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,320
What's the matter?

766
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,680
I

767
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,640
came to pick you up.

768
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,120
No need,

769
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
I have something to do later.

770
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,600
Hi, Bai Lan.

771
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,960
So this is your boyfriend?

772
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,800
Yes.

773
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,840
Hey, how are you?

774
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,680
I'm treating everyone
to Western food later.

775
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,840
Do you want to join us?

776
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,400
Do you?

777
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,280
Sure!

778
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,910
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

779
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,080
Bai Lan, how do you usually study?

780
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,600
I'm so worried about

781
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,960
the English test coming up.

782
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,120
It's actually not that hard.

783
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,600
Just review a few more times.

784
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,080
I'll lend you my notes tomorrow.

785
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,720
Really? That's great!

786
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,720
Hey, this song sounds familiar. It's...

787
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,200
It's from a famous western rock band.

788
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,640
Yes. You also like
listening to western rock?

789
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,440
My dad used to travel abroad frequently

790
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,720
and always brought back

791
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,280
lots of cassette tapes

792
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,440
and CDs

793
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,080
that we couldn't hear.

794
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,040
If you like them,

795
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,280
I can lend them to you.

796
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,120
Then I'll exchange books with you.

797
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,440
I have works by Wang Shuo, Mo Yan,

798
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,280
Wang Xiaobo, everything.

799
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,680
Do you have any books by Su Tong?

800
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,240
I love reading his books.

801
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
Of course I do.

802
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,360
Then I'll benefit from it.

803
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,520
Are you hungry? Let's order.

804
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
- Okay.
- Okay.

805
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,530
Waitress!

806
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,240
Hello, sir.

807
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,600
May I take your order?

808
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,040
You go ahead.

809
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,840
Their salami is highly recommended.

810
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,600
But I heard that German-style salami

811
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,200
has a high fat content.

812
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,040
Didn't Su Tong say that

813
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,880
for a piece of meat,
no matter how it's cooked,

814
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,440
the fat is its soul?

815
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,320
Alright, I'll trust you.

816
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,640
One German-style salami

817
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,720
and one filet mignon,

818
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,040
medium rare. Thank you.

819
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,000
I'll have a medium-rare sirloin.

820
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,120
I'll have a sirloin too,

821
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,960
medium well.

822
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,480
Xiaolu, what about you?

823
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,120
This one.

824
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Okay. How would you like it?

825
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,400
Eighty percent well.

826
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,160
Then I'll have the same,

827
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,120
eighty percent well.

828
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
A customer just now

829
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,640
(Restroom)
ordered an eighty percent well filet.

830
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,280
Do you think he's doing that on purpose?

831
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,320
Who eats an eighty percent well steak?

832
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,000
He must be a country bumpkin.

833
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,520
Let's just make it however.

834
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,400
Right.

835
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,280
He probably won't even tell.

836
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,760
Exactly.

837
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,320
Let's go.

838
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,520
Bai Lan,

839
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,840
how did you meet Xiaolu?

840
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,160
Were you college classmates?

841
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,280
He's my colleague from the food factory.

842
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,040
A colleague?

843
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,240
Which university did he graduate from?

844
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,560
He's preparing to take the entrance exam.

845
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,880
Bai Lan, the guy you like

846
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,600
is different from what I imagined.

847
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,680
Yeah?

848
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,280
What kind of guy
do you think I should like?

849
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,600
I think an excellent girl like you

850
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,520
would like someone
knowledgeable, cultured,

851
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,160
with shared interests.

852
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,160
At the very least, he should be
a university graduate.

853
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,760
He'll be one soon.

854
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,400
Hey, I suddenly remembered,

855
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,640
I have to do a night shift
at the warehouse.

856
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,560
I need to go back.

857
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,640
For us working-class folks,

858
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,240
time is really not our own.

859
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,920
Oh, when the steak is served,

860
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,920
you should go ahead and split it.
It's quite expensive.

861
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,000
Don't waste it.

862
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,440
I'll head off. Enjoy it!

863
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,000
Goodbye.

864
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,400
I'll leave too.

865
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,400
Hey...

866
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,000
Let's go for fish ball soup.

867
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:02,840
(Fish Ball)

868
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,840
You actually chose fish balls

869
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,480
over steak?

870
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,200
You said you would take me to this place.

871
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,480
So, how was it? Is it good?

872
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,400
To be honest,

873
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,520
when I first came to Fucheng,
I couldn't get used to the food here.

874
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,960
I found everything

875
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,520
too sweet and light,

876
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,200
not suitable for a northerner like me.

877
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,600
Even now, I haven't fully adapted.

878
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
So,

879
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,520
forcibly changing someone's stomach
is difficult.

880
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,240
Just like this bowl of fish ball soup,

881
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,080
people who like it

882
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,000
may not necessarily like steak.

883
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,000
What do you mean by that?

884
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
These days,

885
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,880
I've been thinking about what you said.

886
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,880
I think you're right.

887
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,760
This is your home,

888
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,120
with your family and friends.

889
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,520
If I were to forcibly take you away,

890
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,840
wouldn't that be selfish?

891
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,000
Don't say that.

892
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,200
How do you know

893
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,720
I am not leaving willingly?

894
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,240
I came to see you today

895
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,160
just to say sorry.

896
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,440
It was wrong of me to deceive you,

897
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,680
but I truly didn't want
to disappoint you.

898
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,760
But what if one day I disappoint you?

899
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,440
I'm afraid you'll regret

900
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,760
abandoning everything for me.

901
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,240
I won't regret it.

902
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,920
Bad news!

903
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,360
Bad news!

904
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,160
Xiaolu.

905
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,520
Guangnan is in trouble.

906
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,040
Have you heard of the boy cried wolf?

907
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,400
No, this time it's real.

908
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,600
It's really real.

909
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,440
What does it matter to me
whether it's real or not?

910
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,360
Quite impressive.

911
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,520
Good acting.

912
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,520
Nice costume. Where did you rent them?

913
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,920
Watch your manners in front of Ms. Tao.

914
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,400
This extra is pretty good too.

915
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,000
Is this enough already?

916
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,480
Hurry up and bring Li Guangnan out.

917
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,560
I really want to ask him face-to-face.

918
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,160
Isn't he tired of

919
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,840
using this trick?

920
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,800
How much did Li Guangnan give you?

921
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,950
You are acting so diligently.

922
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,840
You rented a KTV room,

923
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,800
put on a leather jacket,

924
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,400
and started to

925
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,960
act tough in front of me.

926
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,520
You think I'm a fool?

927
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,360
Move!

928
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,360
Move again, I dare you.

929
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,280
Sit down first.

930
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,680
Xiaolu,

931
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
it's been a long time since

932
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,440
someone dared to talk to me like this.

933
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,960
What's her name again?

934
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,440
Luo Chuntao?

935
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,160
What are you doing, Lu Dajiang?

936
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,120
Sit down!

937
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,040
Underground people call her Ms. Tao.

938
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,000
What underground people?

939
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,120
How did you get to know her?

940
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,510
Li Guangnan was selling milk tea
at the entrance of her karaoke bar.

941
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,800
The security guard wouldn't let him sell,

942
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,880
and even turned over his stall.

943
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,280
He ended up arguing with them.

944
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,320
And then I went there.

945
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,560
Your name is Lu Xiaolu

946
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,640
and you are Lu Dajiang's cousin, right?

947
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,840
Yes, I'm Lu Xiaolu.

948
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,040
Lu Dajiang is my cousin.

949
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,360
I've seen you when you were little.

950
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,120
But now I don't recognize you anymore.

951
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,720
You've seen me before?

952
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,800
How come I don't remember you?

953
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,360
It's been too long.

954
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,080
Feels like it's from a previous life.

955
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,880
But why does Lu Dajiang

956
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,480
always avoid me?

957
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,040
How about this?

958
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,960
Bring him here,

959
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,320
and I'll release him immediately.

960
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,480
My cousin is in prison,

961
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,200
sentenced to five years.

962
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,640
Now he can completely avoid me.

963
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,760
Five years, right?

964
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,040
No problem.

965
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,560
I'll wait for him.

966
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,640
Dajiang,

967
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,760
you are clearly her target.

968
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,520
Could it be your enemy?

969
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,600
Not an enemy,

970
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,440
worse than that.

971
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,240
Worse than that?

972
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,560
Dajiang,

973
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,800
could she be the old lover of yours

974
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,080
you mentioned?

975
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,840
Don't cause trouble for her.

976
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,920
It's not easy for a girl like her.

977
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,800
Inside the cabinet under the TV
in my boathouse,

978
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,040
there's a metal box.

979
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,120
Show her what's inside.

980
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,120
That's all I can do for you.

981
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,800
I don't know if it'll help.

982
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,560
Does he have anything to tell me?

983
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,640
I'm not even worthy of receiving
a single word from him, am I?

984
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,560
He deserves to be in there.

985
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's best if he never gets out of prison.

986
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,120
If my cousin did something

987
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,600
to hurt you back then,

988
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,400
I apologize on his behalf.

989
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,280
Can you please
release Li Guangnan first?

990
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,560
When I was 15,

991
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,480
some thugs tried to take advantage of me,

992
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,960
but Lu Dajiang came to my aid.

993
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,960
He wasn't even 20 at the time,

994
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,360
wearing a leather jacket

995
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,920
and the white scarf I gave him.

996
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,040
Don't run!

997
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,440
Get him!

998
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,280
The fight was quite intense.

999
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,360
To protect me,

1000
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,000
his white scarf
was stained red with blood.

1001
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,640
But he still won in the end.

1002
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,600
Later, he said to me,

1003
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,400
"Follow me in the future.

1004
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,720
I can protect you."

1005
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,000
And then he took me everywhere with him.

1006
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,280
We drove illegal taxis, polished shoes,

1007
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,640
and even sold cigarettes.

1008
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,840
He also told me

1009
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,680
he would marry me

1010
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,640
once he earned enough money.

1011
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,680
Your cousin is quite honorable,

1012
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,800
often lending money to his friends.

1013
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,760
But suddenly one day,

1014
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,320
he got into a fight
with someone he lent money to

1015
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,240
and injured them,

1016
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,000
and he just ran away and left me behind.

1017
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,800
My cousin went to Hong Kong.

1018
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,640
I know,

1019
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,320
after he came back,

1020
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,120
I heard that he went to Hong Kong.

1021
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,560
But have you ever thought

1022
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,200
that he didn't want to leave you,

1023
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,600
but rather didn't want to involve you?

1024
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,040
Then why didn't he tell me?

1025
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,120
Couldn't I go to Hong Kong to find him?

1026
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,040
This is something between the two of us.

1027
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,360
Why did he make decisions on his own?

1028
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,360
He simply didn't care

1029
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,680
about what I was thinking.

1030
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,160
Enough, let's not talk about this.

1031
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,600
Stay here tonight

1032
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,000
and have a drink with me.

Do you think my place is alright?

1043
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,760
Amazing! Grand!

1044
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,880
Nice beer!

1045
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,320
So, in the future, if my karaoke

1046
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,360
only serves your beverages, how's that?

1047
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,240
Are you serious, Ms. Tao?

1048
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,760
If you become our client,

1049
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,680
we'll thrive.

1050
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,520
Yeah!

1051
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,640
Alright.

1052
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,680
Listen to me.

1053
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,360
To show sincerity, I'll finish this bottle.

1054
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,400
Oh, no need.

1055
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,280
I want him to drink.

1056
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,560
It's the same.

1057
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,560
Yeah, Ms. Tao.

1058
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,000
Your cousin never gets drunk.

1059
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,760
Do you have his drinking capacity?

1060
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,000
Listen,

1061
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,320
whether we can
make this deal tonight or not

1062
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,160
depends on your sincerity.

1063
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,800
Well, our sincerity is definitely enough.

1064
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,000
I'll drink!

1065
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,760
He downed it, Ms. Tao, not a drop left.

1066
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,920
Let's have one together.

1067
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,560
Ms. Tao, it's a great day today.

1068
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,880
I'll have another one!

1069
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,320
- Come on.
- Together!

1070
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,240
Cheers!

1071
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,800
Lu Xiaolu!

1072
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,050
What?

1073
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:28,960
You are so noisy.

1074
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,440
You... you're my

1075
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,920
best friend

1076
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,840
in this world.

1077
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,440
Can you wait until you're sober
before confessing?

1078
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,360
Nope, I have to say it now.

1079
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,680
I still remember when I came here,

1080
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,240
everyone avoided me,

1081
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,440
saying that I came from the countryside,

1082
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,880
calling me poor and unsophisticated.

1083
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,120
But you,

1084
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,600
you didn't avoid me.

1085
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,880
You played with me.

1086
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,560
I love you so much.

1087
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,800
You are disgusting, you know?

1088
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,920
Believe it or not,

1089
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,440
I will...

1090
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,200
Lu Xiaolu.

1091
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,560
I just knew

1092
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,360
you wouldn't abandon me.

1093
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,560
Li Guangnan.

1094
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,400
Yeah?

1095
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,320
We're lifelong good brothers,

1096
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,920
but do you know why

1097
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,840
I must save you this time?

1098
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,280
Why?

1099
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,360
Because if you're doing well,

1100
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,040
then I can leave with peace of mind.

1101
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,240
Alright.

1102
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
