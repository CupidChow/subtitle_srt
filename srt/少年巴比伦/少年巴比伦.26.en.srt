Huang Qing is really a jerk.

25
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,200
He has no humanity at all,

26
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,670
abandoning even his own woman.

27
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,750
He won't come.

28
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,440
You are just wasting your time.

29
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,960
You will surely be useful.

30
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,350
Although Huang Qing abandoned you,

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,520
there's still Lu Xiaolu.

32
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,630
What's Lu Xiaolu's phone number?

33
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,030
Lu Xiaolu and I
parted ways a long time ago.

34
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,290
Don't pretend with me.

35
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,770
I've got your phone.

36
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,750
What's the password?

37
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll find it myself.

38
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,720
- I deleted his number.
- Boss Hu,

39
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,980
are you looking for me?

40
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,470
Lu Xiaolu, I knew you would come.

41
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,100
Release her first.

42
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,190
Let's talk about money.

43
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,870
I don't trust anyone now.

44
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,560
Because of the trouble you caused,

45
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,590
I gained nothing.

46
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,680
Huang Qing has fled now.

47
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,790
You give me the 300,000 yuan
he promised me,

48
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,680
and you can take her away.

49
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,290
Okay.

50
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,700
Release her first,

51
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,440
and I'll get the money for you.

52
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,160
Are you trying to pull a fast one?

53
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,440
I'll release her when I get the money.

54
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
Don't tell me
you don't have 300,000 yuan.

55
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,640
You are a big boss.

56
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,520
You have two hours.

57
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,440
Go back and get it.

58
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,840
If I don't see the money,

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,200
your little lover will suffer.

60
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,080
Don't touch her.

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,440
What?

62
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,760
Want to fight?

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
If you don't want to be disabled,

64
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,440
go back and bring me the money.

65
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,640
My wife's paralyzed because of you!

66
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,840
Nobody moves!

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,840
Don't move!

68

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,240
How dare you attack me!

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,480
- Hit him!
- Come here if you wanna die!

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,640
Don't move!

72
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,600
Xiaolu!

73
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,960
Boss Hu,

74
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,080
your old friend is here to see you.

75
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,360
I've been waiting for this chance.

76
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,400
Dajiang,

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
why are you here?

78
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,760
Boss Hu and I are old friends.

79
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,880
Of course I should bid him farewell.

80
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,520
You came by yourself?

81
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,080
Are you also here

82
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,960
to play the hero and save the beauty?

83
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,840
You voluntarily came here.

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Don't blame me for being heartless.

85
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
I didn't come here to fight.

86
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,320
I'm here to apologize.

87
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's talk things out properly.

88
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,880
Just release them.

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,440
Apologize, huh?

90
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,200
Leave your fingers behind.

91
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
One finger for one person.

92
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,320
Let me cut off three,

93
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,520
and you can take them away.

94
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,200
Fine.

95
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
No problem.

96
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
Dajiang!

97
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,560
Boss, here is the chopper.

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,680
Lu Dajiang,

99
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,800
I admire you.

100
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,240
Dajiang!

101
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,240
Go!

102
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,640
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Go!

104
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,080
Dajiang, the chopper!

105
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,680
We've called the police.
You can't escape.

106
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,200
Xiaolu,

107
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,120
take them and go.

108

109
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,920
Let's go.

110
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,200
Dajiang,

111
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,760
the police are here. You should go.

112
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,080
Go find Ms. Tao.

113
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,480
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

114
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,520
I'm really fine.

115
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,640
Take care of her.

116
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,920
Have a safe journey.

117
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
- I'll come visit you soon.
- Sure.

(just like in Fucheng,)

121
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,520
(there's a beautiful dock here.)

122
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,440
(The only difference
is that it snows in May.)

123
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,200
(I hope one day)

124
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,760

(has long organized
and led a criminal gang,)

128
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,780
- (engaging in activities)
- Get in.

129
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
(such as kidnapping,)

130
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,090
(intentional injury,
and provocation of troubles,)

131
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,460
(which seriously disrupted)

132
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,800
(the economic and social order
of Fucheng City.)

133
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,210
(Hu Dafa has been lawfully arrested)

134
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,720
(and charged with organizing
and leading a criminal gang)

135
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,420
(and kidnapping, among other offenses.)

136
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,040
Looks like

137
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,920
it's really time to say goodbye
to this place.

138
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,040
Are you surprised?

139
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,680
No.

140
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Bi and Huang Qing have been
brought to justice.

141
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,640
Since the government promised

142
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,720
to reimburse the workers
with the land sale proceeds,

143
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,040
this outcome is inevitable.

144
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,240
You can't go back to your company.

145
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,160
So what are your plans next?

146
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,840
I plan to study abroad

147
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,080

148
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,520
And you?

149
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,440

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,640
continue the milk tea business.

151
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,520
If it goes well,

152
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,680
I'll open a chain store

153
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,680
and hire all the workers.

154
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,280
You haven't changed
after all these years.

155
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,800
Don't you think about yourself?

193
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,990
This way, please.

194
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,440
I really didn't expect that

195
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,880
you would choose to

196
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,480
have your final meal here before leaving.

197
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,960
Remember when we used to

198
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,160
talk about coming here to eat?

199
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,480
Then we never had the chance.

200
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,960
Today, we're making up for it.

201
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,480
Do you remember

202
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,200
that time
we had dinner with our classmates

203
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,360
from the postgraduate class?

204
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,960
You ordered an eighty percent well steak.

205
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,680
Of course, I remember.

206
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,640
You protected my dignity.

207
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,360
But in the end,

208
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,680
neither of us got to eat.

209
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,600
Yes. What did we end up eating?

210
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,160
Fish balls?

211
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,560
Fish ball soup?

212
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
Right.

213
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,520
Fish ball soup.

214
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,240
So, do you want to

215
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,400
try an eighty percent well steak today?

216
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,840
Give it a try?

217
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,280
- These two appetizers.
- Okay.

218
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,840
- This Burgundy wine.
- Okay.

219
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,360
Plus two eighty percent well
sirloin steaks.

220
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,680
Eighty percent well?

221
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,160
Are you sure?

222
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm sure.

223
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,360
Okay, let me check with the kitchen.

224
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,440
- Okay.
- Please wait a moment.

225
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,360
Do you think they can make it?

226
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,400
If the chef won't make it for us,

227
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,560
we'll do it ourselves.

228
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,160
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

229
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,880
Sir,

230
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,400
no problem, it can be made.

231
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,480
Two eighty percent well steaks,

232
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,320
right?

233
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

234
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,640
It's my duty.

235
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,520
Just now, our chef told me that

236
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,960
he makes eighty percent well steak

237
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,160
at least once a year,

238
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,200
so he's very skilled.

239
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,360
Please rest assured.

240
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,920
It looks like someone shares our taste.

241
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,280
What a coincidence.

242
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,180
Let me tell you some good news.

243
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,000
Just yesterday,

244
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
a big customer called me.

245
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,160
Guess who it was?

246
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,110
Afang.

247
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,460
How did you know?

248
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,600
Since the last time

249
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,440
you gave her the milk tea powder,

250
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,300
I had a feeling.

251
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,690
But if it were me, I would also

252
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,850
be willing to cooperate with you.

253
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,780
I believe that before long,

254
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,870
everything will get better and better.

255
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,900
Will you

256
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,000
come back then?

257
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,070
Who knows?

258
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,800
Yeah.

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
You are fully recovered, huh?

373
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,360
Just another month,

374
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,960
and I'll be able
to get rid of this wheelchair.

375
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,280
- That's great.
- Fantastic.

376
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,480
If I were you,

377
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,360
I'd pretend not to recover

378
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,860
and have Li Guangnan
take care of me for life.

379
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,640
Wouldn't that be nice?

380
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,960
Who cares about him?

381
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
He annoys me every day.

382
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,320
I can take care of myself.

383
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,040
Oh, Big Feet, congratulations to you.

384
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,680
I wish you a great married life.

385
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,050
And congratulations on
finally being able to stand up.

386
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,760
Where is Bai Lan?

387
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,520
She should be here soon.

388
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
She said she would come.

389
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,720
I'm handing Xiaoying over to you.

390
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Don't mistreat her.

391
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,120
Of course.

392
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,000
Don't worry, Master.

393
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,160
Sorry, Dad.

394
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Be careful.

395
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,120
Next up, let's welcome our groom,

396
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,200
Mr. Chen Guowei,

397
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,320
to deliver a speech.

398
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,800
Bravo!

399
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,960
Come on. Be confident.

400
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,600
Hello, everyone.

401
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,440
I'm Chen Guowei.

402
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,640
Today is

403
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,840
the wedding between Niu Xiaoying and me.

404
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,240
Thank you all for coming.

405
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,080
Great!

406
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,120
My father-in-law,

407
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,480
also my most respected master,

408
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
has asked me to give a wedding speech.

409
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,800
I've written a lot of

410
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,720
heartfelt words for Xiaoying,

411
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,600
but there are too many words

412
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,240
and I can't remember them all,

413
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,600
so I brought notes.

414
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,040
Oh, I forgot to take it.

415
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,800
As you all know,

416
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,400
I'm

417
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,520
not very good at speaking.

418
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,280
- No, we don't know.
- We don't know that.

419
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,120
We really don't know.

420
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,960
You do,

421
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,160
and Xiaoying does too.

422
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,560
And,

423
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,160
I've always

424
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
wanted to be a singer.

425
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,440
Even though I failed,

426
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,280
I've always felt that

427
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,080
I sing better than I speak.

428
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,920
So today,

429
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,300
at my wedding, I want to

430
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,120
sing a song

431
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,720
for Xiaoying
and all our family and friends.

432
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,840
Great!

433
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,880
This song

434
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,360
is a tribute

435
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,080
to our shared youth.

436
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,880
The song is called

437
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,160

Little Pouter,

525
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,120
since I first saw you

526
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,520
in junior high,

527
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,320
I've started to like you.

528
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,040
I, Li Guangnan, have liked you

529
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,560
for fourteen years!

530
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,120
What fourteen years?

531
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,200
Just thirteen years.

532
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,480
You've always been exaggerating.

533
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,720
Juan,

534
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,600
I love you.

535
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,640
Great!

536
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,520
Do you remember?

537
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,920
The first day we met,

538
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,480
I was holding that tape recorder

539
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,000
helping Li Guangnan confess.

540
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,200
Then we got into a fight,

541
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,680
I saw you

542
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,170
and took your suitcase.

543
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,960
Of course I remember,

544
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,840
you used my suitcase to fight

545
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,080
and broke it.

546
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,960
Later, I testified against you
to the police,

547
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,500
causing you
to miss the college entrance exam.

548
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,680
It was a chaotic day

549
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,480
but also the most

550
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,960
unforgettable one for me.

551
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,810
Me too.

552
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,640
Look,

553
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,240
who are those coming over there?

554
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,960
I miss them so much.

555
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,200
Beer, peanuts, melon seeds, mineral water.

556
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,360
Beer, peanuts, melon seeds, mineral water.

557
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,120
Excuse me,

558
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,560
where are we?

559
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,600
Do you have melon seeds?

560
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,520
Yes.

561
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,440
I'll take a pack of them.

562
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,080
This is the train
from Fucheng to Shanghai.

563
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,040
What year is it now?

564
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,240
You are not totally awake?

565
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,160
I feel like I had

566
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,200
a very long dream.

567
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,200
Yes,

568
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,160
you were smiling

569
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,800
in your sleep just now.

570
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,560
We'll reach Shanghai station

571
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,920
in thirty minutes.

572
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,440
Shanghai station
is the final stop of this train.

573
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,840
Please prepare to get off.

594
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,520
