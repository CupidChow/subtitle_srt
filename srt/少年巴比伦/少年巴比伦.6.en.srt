Did you hear the news?

Dr. Bai has been reassigned
to the boiler room.

34
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,360
The boiler room?

35
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,320
They say it's because she issued

36
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
a fake mental issue certificate for Afang

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
and got reported to the police

38
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,860
by Ding Dezhong's wife.

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,560
Xiaolu!

40
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,880
Anyone here?

41
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,480
Hello,

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm Bai Lan.

43
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,760
I'm reporting in.

44
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,040
It's not like

45
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,960
anyone can work in our boiler room.

46
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,600
There are rules here.

47
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,400
What rules?

48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,920
The first rule is

49
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,480
we never welcome traitors

50
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,080
who bully the working class.

51
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,640
What do you mean?

52
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,400
What do I mean? You don't understand?

53
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,840
Everyone in our factory knows

54
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Afang isn't mentally ill.

55
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,710
Why did you issue a fake certificate
to harm her?

56
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,320
Today, I'm going
to uphold justice for her.

57
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,320
Are you in love with Afang?

58
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,600
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,520
Our relationship is pure
working-class friendship.

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,920
It's just that I can't stand

61
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,160
your despicable tactics.

62
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,160
So despicable.

63
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,320
Unbelievable.

64
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,150
What about the second rule?

65
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
The second rule...

66
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
I'll tell you when I think of it.

67
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,720
Okay, then, I'll go to work.

68
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
If you want to join our working class,

69
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,160
you need to have the skills of us.

70
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,640
See that?

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
That pile of coal,

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
move it all

73
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,960
to the opposite corner within an hour.

74
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,320
Then you pass the test.

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,440
How about that?

76
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,600
Get started.

77
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,240
Hey, don't just stand there.

78
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,320
Clock is ticking.

79
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Hurry up.

80
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,640
- You scumbag!
- I...

81
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,960
How could a man like you bully a woman?

82
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,800
- No...
- Xiaolu.

83
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,920
She cozied up to Ding Dezhong.

84
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,280
I'm avenging Afang.

85
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
- Continue.
- We should stick together.

86
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
Lu Xiaolu,

87
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,000
what are you doing?

88
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,600
Don't think you can act arrogant
because you're

89
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,680
a hero in the factory now.

90
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,760
Let me tell you...

91
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,800
Xiaolu!

92
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,560
You wait!

93
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't go. I'll come back.

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,680
- Wait for me.
- This is not over.

95
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,560
Let's go.

96
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,840
- What are you doing?
- Come.

97
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,480
Hey, let go.

98
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
Pack up and go back

99
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,480
to the medical room to work.
Don't come here again.

100
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,840
I accepted it.

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
I issued the fake certificate,

102
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,160
it's only right that I'm punished.

103
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,560
But the one who suggested it was me.

104
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,320
If anyone's punished, it should be me.

105
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,240
Do you regret it?

106
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,160
Do you regret helping Afang?

107
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,760
Of course not.

108
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
I don't regret it either.

109
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,720
But if you stay here,

110
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,640
what if Dakang and the others
bully you again?

111
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,400
Do you think they can bully me?

112
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,360
Catch.

113
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,280
Next time they bully me, I'll hit them.

114
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,280
- Hit them hard.
- Hit them hard.

115
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,920
Hey, why are you hitting me?

116
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,280
- You should hit them.
- I'm practicing on you.

117
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,480

=Pink Memories=

118
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,680
You're all dirty.

119
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,800
Oh my! You scared me.

120
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,320
Why are you hiding here

121
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,280
during lunch break?

122
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,400
This electric fan is in such bad shape.

123
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,400
Why bother fixing it?

124
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,920
You don't understand.

125
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,040
I can turn even

126
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,520
rubbish into treasures.

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,520
Not bad.

128
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,440
Where did you find these things?

129
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,240
These are all treasures.

130
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,040
Big Feet.

131
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
Alright, I'll help you make a new one.

132
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,800
Thanks.

133
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,000
How is it?

134
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,360
- It's nothing.
- Xiaolu,

135
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,640
come have a cup of tea.

136
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
Debao.

137
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,160
What did you put in this tea?

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,880
It's the cooling tea I prepared.

139
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,240
I brewed mint and tea leaves together.

140
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,400
Isn't it refreshing?

141
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
This invention is amazing!

142
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,480
What are you saying?

143
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,880
It's hardly an invention.

144
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,880
You are even speaking up for Bai Lan?

145
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,440
Have you forgotten how she

146
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
slandered your uncle?

147
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,120
You know if it was a slander or not.

148
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,040
What are you saying?

149
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,080
Who raised you from childhood?

150
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,920
You forgot?

151
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,040
Now that you have grown up,

152
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,560
you're turning against me, right?

153
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,600
Then I'll just leave now.

154
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,920
I'll give you back everything
you've given me.

155
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,280
How are you going to repay me?

156
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,960
What?

157
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,800
Go away!

158
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,880
What are you...

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,240
Hey, sweetie, sweetie.

160
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,760
I don't want you. I want meat.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,840
What are you doing here?

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,880
Are you alright?

163
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,880
Did Ding Dezhong scold you again?

164
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,480
Not only did we argue,

165
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,800
but I was also kicked out.

166
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Now I have nowhere to go.

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,320
Are you happy now?

168
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,480
Stop crying.

169
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Don't look this way.

170
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,200
Turn around.

171
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,200
Ding Dezhong is Ding Dezhong,

172
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,320
and you are you.

173
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,440
Even if others don't understand you,

174
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,760
I do.

175
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,960
What's the use of your understanding?

176
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,680
Lu Xiaolu, that heartless scoundrel.

177
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,760
He knows nothing.

178
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,840
Lu Xiaolu is just a big fool.

179
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,040
When we go back,
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

180
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,400
I don't want to go back.

181
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,000
Everyone will hate me because

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,440
I'm Ding Dezhong's niece.

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,440
No one will like me.

184
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,400
How do you know no one likes you?

185
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,360
Clearly,

186
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,520
someone is full of thoughts about you,

187
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,960
but you just can't see it.

188
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,120
If you have nowhere to go,

189
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
I'll just take care of you.

190
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,080
Li Guangnan,

191
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,040
I consider you a friend.

192
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,120
Don't think about taking advantage of me.

193
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,040
What you are saying is unreasonable.

194
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,520
I'm just willing to help a friend.

195
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,120
Why do you think of me like that?

196
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,360
Even if you're pretty,

197
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,920
that's not enough for me
to make mistakes.

198
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,600
And let me tell you,

199
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,640
you're not that pretty.

200
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,640
At most,

201
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,280
you're third in Fucheng.

202
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,320
Third?

203
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,920
Why am I third?

204
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,840
Who's first?

205
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,080
First is, of course, Guanyin Bodhisattva.

206
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,720
And second?

207
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,280
Second

208
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,040
is Mazu.

209
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,640
Smooth talker.

210
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,080
I'm telling the truth.

211
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,320
You're definitely third.

212
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,560
Don't be greedy.

213
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,480
Li Guangnan, turn around.

214
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,400
I'm hungry.

215
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,440
You said you'd help your friend, right?

216
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,480
Treat me to a meal.

217
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,520
See?

218
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,080
How did he start

219
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,960
fiddling with these bottles and jars?

220
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,360
What is he messing around with?

221
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,280
He doesn't look like he's messing around.

222
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,200
Is he creating a new product

223
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,600
for the factory?

224
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,120
What new product?

225
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,600
He's in maintenance.

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,840
What,

227
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,920
did he switch to R&D?

228
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,480
That's a good thing.

229
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,040
What future does maintenance have?

230
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,840
Technical jobs are different.

231
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,400
You fool.

232
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,200
Your son's in love.

233
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,040
He's grown up?

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,840
He's grown up.

235
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,920
Seeing you, a college graduate,

236
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,280
doing this kind of work

237
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,960
really pains my heart.

238
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,560
Unfortunately,

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,120
my abilities are limited,

240
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,520
and I couldn't help you.

241
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,850
College graduates are also human beings.

242
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,360
Why can others do things

243
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
while I cannot?

244
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,160
But...

245
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,560
Let me do it.

246
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,320
I'll help you.

247
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
I feel it's such a waste for you.

248
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,360
This matter

249
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,520
shouldn't be blamed on you at all.

250
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,840
It's just because

251
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,120
you're here without any support.

252
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
No one is backing you.

253
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,800
It's working hours now.

254
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Don't disturb me at work.

255
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,960
Do you just

256
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,120
want to keep staying here?

257
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,280
Bai Lan.

258
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,520
What are you doing?

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,160
As long as you're willing to trust me,

260
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,480
I can take care of you

261
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,640
and protect you.

262
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,200
Bai Lan.

263
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,040
You guys in the boiler room work late.

264
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,280
I know you haven't taken a hot shower
in days.

265
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,560
You can do it here.

266
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,240
Bah! Lunch time!

267
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,520
Hey, I...

268
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,240
Who's this?

269
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,880
Lu Xiaolu?

270
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,960
Why are you here during work hours?

271
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,320
It's lunch break.

272
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,280
Lunch break...

273
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,000
What are you doing?

274
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,880
What are you doing?

275
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,060
Stay away from me!

276
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,700
I heard there are a lot of flies
in the boiler room,

277
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,600
so I came to chase them away.

278
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,560
Flies?

279
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,360
There are the most flies in your
maintenance department,

280
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,960
and they're all headless flies.

281
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
With these gloves,

282
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,800
you won't be afraid of getting burned

283
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
or cut in the future.

284
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,960
It's quite thick.

285
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,240
Thank you.

286
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,240
What's this?

287
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,400
It's a specially made
jasmine iced tea for you,

288
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,040
plus your favorite milk.

289
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,800
Try it.

290
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,720
How is it?

291
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,600
Is it good?

292
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
It's a bit strange

293
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,960
but still good.

294
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,640
See? I knew it.

295
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,360
Just now, I saw Bi Zhigang

296
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
handing you a letter.

297
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,200
A love letter?

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,840
Are you curious?

299
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,360
What's there to be curious about?

300
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,640
I'm just reminding you as a good friend.

301
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,920
Bi Zhigang is not a good person.

302
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,080
He's scheming, cunning,

303
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,920
and hypocritical.

304
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,320
Don't fall for his tricks.

305
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,440
Come on,

306
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,360
take a look.

307
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,440
Hmm?

308
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,720
Didn't you say you weren't curious?

309
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
I'm just helping you

310
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
as a friend

311
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,320
so you don't get deceived.

312
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,400
Come on, let me see.

313
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,560
Let me see.

314
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,160
Why are you smiling?

315
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,760
This scoundrel.

316
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,540
(Grand Hotel)
I knew he was bearing evil intentions.

317
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,480
It's a three-star hotel.

318
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,000
You're not allowed to go.

319
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,440
Why not?

320
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,720
Hello, sir. Do you have a reservation?

321
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,200
Has anyone come to room 412?

322
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,320
Let me check for you.

323
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,880
Oh, the guest has already checked in.

324
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,560
Bai Lan.

325
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,640
It's me, Bi Zhigang.

326
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,480
Take your time showering.

327
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,040
I'll wait outside for you.

328
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,080
Honestly,

329
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,800
I didn't expect you to actually come.

330
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,960
I feel like

331
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm dreaming.

332
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,250
I remember the day
you first came to the factory.

333
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,440
You were wearing a snow-white

334
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,120
polyester skirt,

335
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,280
elegant

336
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,280
and stylish,

337
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,840
unlike any of

338
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,080
the other girls I've met before.

339
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,680
But I'm

340
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,400
just ordinary

341
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,200
and too introverted,

342
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,640
so I never

343
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,120
dared to confess to you.

344
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,920
Yeah,

345
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,880
I'm just ordinary.

346
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,810
Even though my dad is a leader
in the Second Light Industry Bureau,

347
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,680
I'm

348
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,120
just a small,

349
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
ordinary office secretary.

350
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Who knows when I'll become

351
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,280
a big leader?

352
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm too introverted.

353
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,960
Many young and beautiful female comrades

354
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,560
in the factory try to talk to me,

355
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,920
but I don't know how to respond

356
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,540
and just end up blushing
and running away.

357
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,800
The female comrades
have opinions about me,

358
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,240
blaming me

359
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
for not giving them a chance.

360
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,040
But it's not that I don't want to...

361
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,960
No, no.

362
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Don't come out yet.

363
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,520
Let me finish.

364
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,680
Do you remember the chocolate I gave you?

365
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,800
When I was a child,

366
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,640
my parents always argued.

367
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,000
Whenever they did,

368
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,720
I would hide in a corner of the house

369
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,400
with a box of chocolates

370
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,040
and quietly eat them

371
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,480
because chocolates

372
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,200
gave me a sense of security.

373
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,040
I've seen your file.

374
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,080
I think in some ways,

375
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,160
we're both lonely people.

376
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,960
Lan,

377
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,400
I really don't want to see you

378
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,920
falling into despair

379
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,040
with someone like Lu Xiaolu.

380
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,440
If you're with me,

381
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,920
I promise you'll live a life

382
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,800
ten times,
a hundred times better than now.

383
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,680
I promise

384
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,560
you won't suffer any

385
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,380
innocent repercussions again.

386
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,840
Do you believe me?

387
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,800
I do.

388
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,480
Bi Zhigang,

389
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,720
your words just now are truly touching.

390
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,560
I'm really moved.

391
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Too moved.

392
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,320
Wait a minute. Why is it you?

393
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,480
Why couldn't it be me?

394
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,920
Where's Bai Lan?

395
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,720
I... I...

396
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,360
Unfortunately,

397
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
I'm a guy.

398
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,720
I've been working in the factory all day,

399
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,600
dirty and smelly.

400
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,800
Hey, haven't you been concerned about

401
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,820
your colleagues in the factory?

402
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,120
Can't I come over and take a shower?

403
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,560
No, I... I...

404
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,600
Besides, I'm just a lowly worker

405
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,240
who's never even stayed
in a star-rated hotel.

406
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,000
Secretary Bi,

407
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,080
you're so thoughtful.

408
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,800
You even bought me supper.

409
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,080
How considerate.

410
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,800
- Thanks.
- Put it down. Put it down.

411
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,240
It's not for you.

412
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,240
What's this?

413
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,840
You want to fight?

414
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,880
Can you beat me?

415
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,760
I...

416
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,680
Lu Xiaolu,

417
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,680
don't think you can act recklessly

418
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,360
just because your cousin backs you up.

419
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,360
Do you believe I can make things
very ugly for you?

420
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,240
I... I...

421
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,600
So, you're scared of my cousin, huh?

422
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,240
But let me tell you,

423
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,440
dealing with you

424
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,240
doesn't require his intervention.

425
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,080
Alright.

426
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,600
You guys wait and see.

427
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,520
I'll make you regret this.

428
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,080
Shameless.

429
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,240
Good speech.

430
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,640
Goodbye.

431
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,600
Hey, you're looking great in that outfit.

432
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,920
Couldn't tell you just got off
from the boiler room.

433
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,360
Cut it out.

434
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,280
Oh, you have no idea.

435
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,640
When I came out

436
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,480
of the shower just now,

437
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,920
Bi Zhigang's eyes nearly

438
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,320
popped out of his head.

439
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,600
It was so hilarious.

440
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,040
Too bad

441
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,360
you weren't there to witness
such a great scene.

442
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,920
I actually wanted to go.

443
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,260
You were the one who said I shouldn't.

444
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,640
Are you hungry?

445
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,840
Yeah.

446
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,840
Let's go.

447
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,360
(Gongyuan)

448
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,200
Ding Dezhong!

449
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,600
I'm telling you!

450
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,560
I will definitely leave the boiler room!

451
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,640
Definitely!

452
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,440
What should we do next?

453
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,080
Let's go back to sleep.

454
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,920
Oh, come on,

455
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,640
it's too early to sleep.

456
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,380
How about we go

457
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,920
catch that pervert?

458
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,160
We only caught a fake one.

459
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,560
The real one is still out there.

460
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,280
He's too scared to leave

461
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,600
his house for days.

462
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,880
We should just go to bed.

463
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,760
Hey, who's there?

464
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,820
Security.

465
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,200
Go.

466
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,600
Here.

467
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,160
Hey, who's that?

468
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,400
Wanna do something

469
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,280
more exciting?

470
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,840
With your poor tolerance for alcohol,

471
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,240
you shouldn't have drunk so much.

472
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,680
You got yourself all dirty.

473
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,800
Who said I have a poor alcohol tolerance?

474
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
Which room? Give me the key card.

475
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,920
See?

476
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,720
I told you I'm not drunk.

477
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,640
I can even find the key card.

478
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,280
Let's go.

479
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,080
Ding Dezhong,

480
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,600
come out and face me.

481
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,400
I'll teach you a lesson.

482
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,000
Lower your voice,

483
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
it's late at night.

484
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,400
Bai Lan.

485
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,640
Why are you calling my name?

486
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,480
Are you Bai Lan?

487
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,200
Yeah.

488
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,400
You're not Bai Lan.

489
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,280
Bai Lan is much prettier.

490
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,440
Is Bai Lan really that pretty?

491
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,520
Of course.

492
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,960
In my heart, Bai Lan

493
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,520
is so, so beautiful.

494
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,960
She's almost as pretty as Joey Wong.

495
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,600
Don't you think

496
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,160
she's weird

497
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,280
and violent?

498
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,320
If you badmouth Bai Lan again,

499
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,480
I'll punch you.

500
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,960
Even if I don't punch you,

501
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,760
if Bai Lan hears you,

502
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,040
she'll punch you too.

503
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,000
That woman is terrifying.

504
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,840
Then why are you defending her?

505
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,560
People are afraid of her

506
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,360
because they know nothing about her.

507
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,920
But I know

508
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,120
she's alone and

509
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,060

and Factory Director.

Next,

538
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,800
we invite Secretary Hong

Comrades and colleagues

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,820
of Golden Peacock Food Factory,

543
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,920
good morning.

544
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,080
First of all,

545
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,160
I would like to thank
the higher-level leadership

546
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,840
and the factory party committee

547
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,040
for their trust and support,

548
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,160
allowing me to temporarily
assume the positions

549
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,780
of secretary and factory director.

550
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,760
How was your sleep last night?

551
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,960
I fully obey the decisions of

552
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,900
- the party committee and leadership.
- What do you mean?

553
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,810
- I didn't return to the dorm last night.
- I hope that all comrades

554
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,350
- Didn't you sleep alone?
- can support and assist me

555
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,340
- Of course.
- in carrying out

556
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,560
- Otherwise, who would I sleep with?
- the factory's work.

557
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,040
You are weird.

558
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,080
Now,

559
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,000
the primary task of our factory

560
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,040
is to ensure production,

561
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,990
secure the welfare of all workers,

562
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,440
and quickly restore profitability.

563
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,400
Of course, to achieve this goal,

564
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,560
we need the concerted efforts

565
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,080
of everyone in the factory.

566
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,360
Why did you not come back last night?

567
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,320
Where did you go?

568
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,080
Little Pouter

569
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,480
was kicked out of her house.

570
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,760
She didn't want to yield

571
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,000
nor did she want to go back

572
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,120
to the dorm to face Bai Lan,

573
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,880
so I helped her carry her things out

574
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,400
and we spent the night at the guesthouse.

575
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,040
So you didn't come back all night.

576
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,760
You two stayed at the guesthouse?

577
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,880
Yeah.

578
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,680
So you two...

579
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,120
What are you thinking?

580
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,760
Who would do that before

581
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,280
confirming a relationship?

582
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,920
That's so improper.

583
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,320
Who could do such a thing?

584
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,400
I will humbly learn from everyone.

585
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,960
Let's all work together

586
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,000
to quickly make our Golden Peacock

587
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,120
bloom its beautiful feathers again.

588
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
Lu Xiaolu, if you don't confess today,

589
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
you're not a man.

590
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,640
Do you have something to say to me?

591
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,000
No.

592
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,440
- Last night...
- Last night...

593
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
Did you sleep well last night?

594
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,960
Not bad.

595
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,560
Are you sober now?

596
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,040
Yes.

597
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,520
Do you remember
what happened last night?

598
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,000
Last night?

599
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,760
What do you mean?

600
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,260
It's good that you don't remember.

601
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,640
It's good that I don't remember?

602
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,920
What does she mean by that?

603
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,680
You rogue woman.

604
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,080
My cousin

605
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,960
met that woman at the skating rink.

606
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,000
She's extremely beautiful,

607
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,640
looked like the combination of

608
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,040
Rosamund Kwan and Vivian Chow.

609
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,920
From the first time they met,

610
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,480
she was all over my cousin.

611
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,160
So what happened next?

612
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,520
My cousin couldn't resist,

613
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,440
and that night, he confessed to her.

614
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,360
After dating for a week,

615
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,760
they talked about getting married.

616
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,100
But after they got married,

617
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,160
guess what?

618
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,360
What happened?

619
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,960
After they got married, he found out that

620
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,960
she had been a mistress

621
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,920
to a wealthy businessman.

622
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,440
She only came to my cousin

623
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,240
after the businessman was arrested.

624
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,320
That's why in those

625
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,680
martial arts novels,

626
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,280
the prettier the woman,

627
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,760
the better she is at deceiving.

628
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,960
See?

629
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,840
You young people,

630
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,440
before you get married,

631
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,680
you must go to the hospital

632
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,320
for a check-up.

633
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,220
You must check thoroughly
before you get married.

634
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,000
How do men get checked?

635
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,520
For men,

636
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,520
it's not about checking,

637
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,720
it's about observing.

638
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,560
Observing?

639
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,880
Here is the fruit.

640
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,840
Here is the fruit.

641
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,080
Virgin mark?

642
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,520
Look,

643
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
my virgin mark is gone!

644
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,240
Then you should go to the hospital.

645
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,260
Why are you in the boiler room?

646
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,760
Why the hospital?

647
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
To see a psychiatrist.

648
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,080
Come on,

649
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,160
Bai Lan, I'm serious.

650
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,680
I admit I drank too much that night,

651
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,360
but I swear, I am definitely not someone

652
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,510
who dares not take responsibility.

653
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,940
How will you take responsibility?

654
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,040
Will you invite me to dinner
or help me with work,

655
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,040
or...

656
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,960
Or what?

657
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,120
Or do it again?

658
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,360
Okay, okay.

659
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,400
Let's just forget about

660
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,320
that night.

661
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,760
It's the alcohol's fault.

662
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,280
Don't take it to heart.

663
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,440
What do you mean, don't take it to heart?

664
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,760
This was my

665
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,000
first time.

666
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,720
What?

667
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,000
You and Bai Lan...

668
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,280
Bro!

669
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,720
Lower your voice.

670
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
That old saying is right.

671
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,640
Younger generations

672
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,260
always surpass the older ones.

673
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,560
You're better than me.

674
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,440
And you're quite brave.

675
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,900
It is hard to say

676
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,940
who was the one being brave.

677
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,240
True.

678
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,160
A fierce woman like Bai Lan

679
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,000
is really hard to deal with.

680
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,240
Dajiang,

681
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,600
what should I do now?

682
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,800
Given your situation,

683
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,640
you're quite passive.

684
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,760
Then how can I
turn passivity into initiative?

685
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,840
She's just a woman.

686
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Is it that difficult?

687
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,560
Do you really like her?

688
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,560
The key is I don't even know

689
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,560
if she likes me or not.

690
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,960
If she doesn't like you,

691
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:45,960
why did she do that with you?

692
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,160
If she likes me,

693
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,200
why say

694
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,160
"don't take it to heart"?

695
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,040
You just don't understand.

696
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
A woman's heart

697
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,200
is hard to understand.

698
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,240
Really?

699
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
You brat.

700
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,760
The initiative is in your hands.

701
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,720
You've been in Fucheng for so long,

702
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,750
and I've never treated you to fish balls.

703
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,120
This place serves my favorite fish balls.

704
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,160
When I was a child, my mom always used

705
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,080
pork belly and dried shrimp

706
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,600
to make fake fish balls for me.

707
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
It was only when

708
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,800
my cousin brought me here
for the first time

709
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,400
that I realized

710
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,240
fish balls are so delicious.

711
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,720
Fish balls are made with conger eel.

712
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,000
Actually,

713
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,560
since that night,

714
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,360
there are some things
I've wanted to tell you.

715
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,960
It's not just about taking responsibility
for what I've done,

716
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,080
but I've wanted to

717
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,280
say something for a long time.

718
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,880
You know what?

719
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,520
You're like this bowl of fish ball soup.

720
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,200
Before I met you,

721
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,320
I didn't know
there was another side to the world.

722
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,800
Yes,

723
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,680
I'm a small worker,

724
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,080
but so what?

725
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,320
I'll do my best to treat you well.

726
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,160
Bai Lan,

727
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,920
I like you.

728
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,280
Xiaolu.

729
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,360
What do you think?

730
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,320
If I were a girl,

731
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,080
I'd marry you.

732
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,160
Shut up.

733
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,280
Here.

734
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,560
It was so touching.

735
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,760
You're sure to succeed.
